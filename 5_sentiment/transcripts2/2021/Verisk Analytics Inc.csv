Thanks for joining us for our Q4 2020 earnings conference call. While 2020 was a year like no other, for everyone at Verisk, it was a year that demonstrated the resilience and stability of our business model, the relevance",1911,"Thanks, Stacey. Hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us for our Q4 2020 earnings conference call. While 2020 was a year like no other, for everyone at Verisk, it was a year that demonstrated the resilience and stability of our business model, the relevance and mission-critical nature of our solutions and our relentless focus on our customers. And this was all powered by the strength and creativity of our over 9,000 Verisk teammates around the globe, who I want to thank for their dedication and commitment to deliver on our core mission: To serve, add value and innovate during these challenging times. 
The net results in 2020 was another strong year of financial performance, marked by organic constant currency revenue growth of 4.1% and organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth of 11.6% after normalizing for the impact of the injunction related to roof Measurement Solutions. 
More importantly, in 2020, we delivered 6.9% organic constant currency revenue growth in the 85% of our revenues that we identified as non-COVID sensitive, essentially in line with our long-term growth target. Conversely, our COVID-sensitive revenues declined 11% on an OCC basis, yet, those revenue streams continue to show resilience as the underlying causal factors improve, and we have confidence in this relationship. 
Throughout the year, we've been very deliberate in our cost actions and have protected profitability by matching headcount growth with the trend in our revenue growth. As such, the pace of our hiring and our overall headcount growth has increased sequentially, following the moves that we took at the onset of the pandemic in early spring 2020. As a result, Verisk delivered strong organic-adjusted EBITDA growth and solid margin expansion throughout the year. Lee will provide more details on our performance in his financial review. 
2020 also exhibited the importance of our strong cash flow, the disciplined capital allocation mindset and our emphasis on creating long-term durable shareholder value. Despite the challenges of the operating environment during 2020, we were deliberate about our continued investment in our innovation agenda by inventing new solutions and enhancing existing ones. We also partnered with our customers to bring them solutions to help them be more automated and digitally connected during the pandemic. We funded the continued transformation of our technical infrastructure through cloud migration, tokenization and key data assets and the development of cutting-edge data fabric to underlie our analytics solutions. This is a journey we embarked on in earnest 2 years ago, and we have made significant progress moving our data sets and solutions to the cloud, yet, we still returned over $500 million in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. And I'm pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has approved a 7% increase in our cash dividend and a $300 million increase in our share repurchase authorization to support ongoing capital returns. 
On the innovation front, our Insurance business continued to advance our existing solutions and introduced new innovations. In our commercial property business, we substantially enhanced and updated our database of commercial properties by building an advanced analytic model for over 8 million commercial properties that give ensures information for 5 key building attributes, including building use, construction class, building age, number of stories in area. This brings the database to a total of 12.2 million commercial properties, and this data can be delivered to our Insurance customers' workflows in an automated and easy-to-use format. 
Additionally, during the quarter, we continued to advance our analytics and offerings in the fast-growing area of cyber risk with the addition of nationwide to the Verisk cyber data exchange. The cyber data exchange is a contributory database of aggregated and anonymized insurance data from participating cyber insurers globally. The insights and analytics that Verisk derives from this data help our Insurance customers make intelligent strategic decisions about their portfolios and select risk and benchmark their performance against peers. The cyber exchange is an important part of Verisk's Cyber Solutions suite, which is an end-to-end ecosystem that helps insurers and reinsurers to more quickly deliver new cyber programs or enhance existing ones. 
I'd like to take a minute to observe on recent developments related to our ongoing patent dispute with EagleView Technologies. We continue to disagree with the current outcome of the case and are aggressively pursuing all our legal and operational options. In September 2019, we recorded a $125 million legal reserve related to this matter. We filed our appeal with the original ruling at the end of the fourth quarter 2020. On February 16, the trial court granted EBT's motion for trouble damages as well as some interest and fees. We intend to appeal this ruling as well. As discussed in more detail in our 10-K, because our appeal is pending, we're unable to predict the ultimate outcome of this matter. Still, we remain committed to providing our customers with superior aerial imagery solutions and remain very excited about our partnership with Vexcel, which has not been impacted by this ruling. 
At Wood Mackenzie, we continued to expand our Lens Energy analytics platform. In the fourth quarter, we released Lens subsurface discovery on time and on budget, rounding out our 5 upstream solutions within the Lens platform. This module enables faster, more accurate decision-making for exploration and resource development teams, as they have access to a comprehensive global data set and can run custom analyses and perform benchmark marketing studies right into the workflows. Despite the softness in the energy end market driving industry consolidation, we continue to see demand for Lens across our different customer segments, which is reflected in increased adoption, constructive pricing and longer contract terms. Looking ahead, we are on track to launch a suite of modules related to the energy transition into the Lens platform, namely Lens Power, which will include global discovery and valuation as well as carbon emissions benchmarking solutions. 
In financial Services, we launched small business attributes, a new solution in partnership with Enigma Technologies that provides greater insights into the financial health of small businesses, which have been the hardest hit part of the economy during the pandemic. This solution offers our bank customers near real-time information about sales trends that can be used by a bank's risk underwriting and marketing teams so they can better serve small business customers. This partnership is a great example of how VFS is leveraging our unique data assets to extend and serve new segments of the financial services end market. 
On the acquisition front, in the fourth quarter, Verisk closed on the acquisition of Tornio, a leading provider of consumer behavioral data and intelligence. The acquisition will add Tornio's proprietary view of consumer buying journeys to Verisk's growing set of marketing solutions for the insurance and financial service markets, delivering better experiences and improving customer acquisition and retention for our customers. 
In addition, we've made great strides throughout 2020 with recently acquired companies. We have now owned FAST and Genscape for a full year. And I'm happy to share that we are having great success extending and accelerating the adoption of their solutions across our customer set as well as improving profitability through cost synergies. We're very pleased with these results as they are tracking ahead of our plans at the time of acquisition and are a great example of management's focus on delivering strong returns on the capital invested in acquisitions. 
2020 also marked another high point for our company's culture and our commitment to investing in our people and their skills. Despite the remote work environment, the Verisk team increased productivity, boosted connection and collaboration through internal communication tools and engaged in training and development courses through our many different platforms and across all levels of the organization. This year alone, we trained more than 700 teammates in our leadership and management development programs and in our Lean Six Sigma programs. Verisk teammates earned 900 Yellow Belt certifications and 70 Green Belt certifications. Lean Six Sigma is an embedded mindset across Verisk, and we continue to leverage this established methodology and set of tools to serve our customers better every day. 
Some examples of important accomplishments this year include: First, model developers worked to reduce the time spent collecting data and creating models, improving time to market from new models. Second, field representatives developed new time-saving procedures for completing and updating property surveys, increasing their productivity. And third, sales and support teams develop new processes to execute new contracts or amend current ones quicker with our customers. The benefits are reflected in increased productivity, high customer satisfaction and improved employee engagement. 
In fact, this year, our employee engagement score increased 8 points to 78%. And for the fifth consecutive year, Verisk received U.S. certification from the Great Place to Work Institute for Outstanding Workplace Culture. We also received first-time certification in the United Kingdom, India and Spain. 
Finally, I'd like to share my enthusiasm and my views on the recently announced leadership changes and expanded responsibilities for our executive management team. These changes reflect the thoughtful and strategic approach to our long-term growth and planning with the global organization and are a testament to the deep bench of talented leaders we have at Verisk. I'm pleased to share that both Mark Anquillare and Lee Shavel are taking on new leadership responsibilities within Verisk, and both have been elevated to the position of Group President. Mark Anquillare, who currently serves as Verisk's Chief Operating Officer, is adding oversight of the company's enterprise risk management function to his current responsibilities of leading the company's Insurance business and government-facing businesses. Our risk management operations will continue to be led by our very talented and seasoned team that work diligently every day to make sure that our technical infrastructure remains secure and that we are always using the most advanced data protection techniques. This move also more closely ties to our enterprise risk assessment and management with the core operations of our business. 
Lee Shavel, who currently serves as Verisk's Chief Financial Officer, will add oversight responsibility for the operations of our Energy and Specialized Markets segment and our Financial Services segment, bringing in an even more direct link between our capital allocation discipline and our business unit operations. We will continue to be supported by our deep and tenured finance organization, including our Chief Accounting Officer and Controller, David Grover; and our Treasurer, Brian Aird. 
Finally, I'm pleased to publicly welcome Kathy [ Carbeckles ] to Verisk that's our new General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. Kathy joins us from Chase Consumer Bank, where she most recently served as General Counsel. Kathy brings with her extensive experience in intellectual property and technology and significant expertise partnering with and advising boards of directors and management teams. I look forward to having Kathy formally join the team on April [ 6 ] and working with her to advance our long-term strategy. Kathy will replace Ken Thompson, who announced his retirement late last year. To ensure a smooth transition, Ken will continue with the company as Executive Counsel. Over the last 14 years, Ken has been an integral part of Verisk's success and a value partner and a friend to many across the organization. On behalf of the entire organization, I want to personally thank Ken for his dedication to Verisk and his counsel through this transition. We wish him much health and happiness in his retirement. 
And now I will turn the call over to Lee to cover our financial results."

First, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we have posted a quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website. Moving to the financial results for the fourth quarter. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue",1574,"Thanks, Scott. First, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we have posted a quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website. 
Moving to the financial results for the fourth quarter. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue grew 5.4% to $713 million. Net income increased 33% to $176 million, while diluted GAAP earnings per share grew 33.8% to $1.07, reflecting a $28 million acquisition-related earn-out expense in the prior year that did not reoccur. 
Moving to our organic constant currency results, adjusted for nonoperating items, as defined in the non-GAAP Financial Measures section of our press release. [indiscernible] In the fourth quarter, organic constant currency revenue grew 3.5%, led by continued strength in our Insurance segment. Our non-COVID-sensitive revenues, as we defined at the start of the pandemic, grew approximately 6.5% on a [ loan ] growth in our non-COVID-sensitive revenue revenues, representing approximately [indiscernible], reflects the durability and resilience of our primarily subscription-based business model. We did continue to experience, as we have since the onset of the pandemic, a negative impact from COVID-19 on certain of our products and services, largely transactional in nature, which represents the balance or approximately 15% of our consolidated revenues. These COVID-sensitive revenues declined approximately 12.5% on an OCC basis during the fourth quarter due to the performance across our 3 segments differed [indiscernible] experienced sequential improvement in these revenues as the underlying causal factors continued to abate, though the pace of recovery varies across the different solutions. 
On the Energy side, our consulting business remained under pressure from lower CapEx budgets at our customers but trends appear to have stabilized. 
And finally, within Financial Services, our COVID-sensitive revenues took a further step down as our bank customers reduce their spending levels in response to weakness across their lending portfolios. 
Despite the impact on revenue in the fourth quarter, we are pleased to report that we delivered solid EBITDA growth and expanded margins as the result of effective expense management. OCC-adjusted EBITDA growth was 4.9% in the fourth quarter. Total adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter, which includes both organic and inorganic revenue and adjusted EBITDA, was 48.2% in the quarter, representing leverage across the business. This margin level includes roughly 220 basis points of benefit from lower travel expenses, but also reflects a return to more normal pace of headcount growth and an increase in the pace of investment in our technological transformation, including our cloud transition costs. 
On that note, let's turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis. In the fourth quarter, Insurance segment revenues increased 7.4%, reflecting healthy growth in our industry standard insurance programs, catastrophe modeling solutions, repair cost estimating solutions and insurance software solutions. Similar to the third quarter, we experienced a modest benefit from storm-related revenues as a result of a more normal storm season in 2020 as compared to the very slow season in 2019. This was offset in part by a decline in certain transactional revenues that were negatively impacted by COVID-19. 
Adjusted EBITDA grew 12.2% in the fourth quarter, demonstrating strong margin expansion despite certain revenue declines, investment in our breakout areas and our cloud transition. Energy and Specialized Markets revenue decreased 3.9% in the fourth quarter due to declines in consulting and implementation projects and some modest headwinds related to consolidation in the end market. We were very pleased to see continued growth in our subscription-based core research and data analytic platforms and environmental health and safety service solutions, resulting in outperformance relative to the end market. We believe our strong performance is a function of the criticality of our solutions, the diversification of our revenue streams into breakout areas like the energy transition and the strength of our relationships in the industry. 
Adjusted EBITDA declined 19.5% in the fourth quarter, reflecting a catch-up of certain compensation expenses associated with furloughed employees that are onetime in nature. As a key partner to our energy customers, we continue to closely monitor the operating environment with a focus on consolidation in the upstream space and the potential impact of a broader, more climate-focused political agenda in the United States. We have a track record of managing through volatile times effectively and believe we are well positioned with our energy transition practice to capitalize on the global growth in spending across zero carbon technologies like solar, wind and energy storage. 
Financial Services revenue declined 13% in the quarter, reflecting the impact of certain contract transitions as well as lower levels of project spending from our bank customers stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic and fewer bankruptcies versus 2019 as a result of government support and forbearance programs. Adjusted EBITDA declined 28.1%, reflecting the negative impact of lower sales, while margins were impacted by certain portfolio transactions we took earlier in the year. 
We continue on the journey to transition VFS to a more sustainable subscription-based business and have taken actions that we believe benefit the business in the long run, but are likely to negatively impact our growth over the next few quarters. 
Our reported effective tax rate was 18.4% for the quarter compared to 23.2% in the prior year quarter. The quarterly rate came in lower than our expectations, owing to increased levels of stock option exercise, which depend on personal employee decisions and the Verisk's stock price. Looking forward to 2021, we expect that our full year tax rate will be between 20% and 22%, though there will likely be some quarterly variability related to the pace of employee stock option exercise. 
Adjusted net income was $209 million and adjusted diluted -- I'm sorry, diluted adjusted EPS was $1.27 for the fourth quarter 2020, up 10.8% and 12.4% from the prior year, respectively. These increases reflect solid top line growth, cost discipline in the business, a reduction in travel expenses as a result of COVID-19 and a lower average share count. 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $249 million for the quarter, up 41% from the prior year period, primarily due to increased customer collections, a reduction in income tax payments owing to higher levels of stock option exercise, the deferral of certain employer payroll taxes resulting from the CARES Act and a reduction in travel payments as a result of COVID-19. 
Capital expenditures were $72 million for the quarter and $247 million for 2020, including some onetime expenses associated with our office consolidations in Boston and London. CapEx came in at the lower end of our initial range as certain expenditures were delayed, owned to the pandemic. For the full year 2020, CapEx represented 8.9% of our total revenues. As we look to 2021, we expect CapEx to be in the range of $250 million to $280 million, reflecting our continued investment in our innovation agenda, our technological transformation and our people as well as the carryover certain expenditures that were delayed in 2020 as a result of the pandemic. Related to CapEx, we expect fixed asset depreciation and amortization to be within the range of $200 million to $215 million and intangible amortization to be approximately $165 million in 2021. Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to FX variability, the timing of purchases and the completion of projects and future M&A activity. 
During the fourth quarter, we returned $94 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. As Scott mentioned, I'm pleased to report that our Board of Directors has approved a 7% increase in our cash dividend to $0.29 per share this quarter and has authorized an additional $300 million for share repurchases, bringing our total available authorization to more than $500 million. 
For the full year 2020, we generated $1.1 billion in cash flow from operating activities, an increase of 11.7% over 2019, a strong result considering the challenging operating environment. We invested this cash flow back into our business through $247 million in capital expenditures and funded $285 million in acquisitions. We also returned $176 million in capital to shareholders in dividends and an additional $349 million through share repurchases. 
As we look to 2021, our strategy to deliver long-term sustainable growth remains unchanged, and we believe the stability and predictability of our subscription revenues will persist. However, we do expect certain COVID-19-related pressures on top line growth to continue, though we expect the impact to be less than it was in 2020. We remain confident these COVID impacts do not represent a structural change in our fundamental growth drivers and believe that as the underlying causal factors abate, we will show strong resilience and recovery. We also have confidence in our ability to manage the cost structure effectively to protect profitability, though we would remind you that cost comparisons will be more challenging as we begin to anniversary the onset of the pandemic in the second quarter. Taking this all together, we believe that as the COVID impacts abate, we can return to our long-term growth model of 7% organic constant currency revenue growth with core operating leverage, allowing EBITDA to grow faster than revenue, although it's difficult to predict that timing. 
We hope this provides some useful context for you, and we look forward to addressing your questions. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to 1 question. 
With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions."

And we have definitely given a lot of attention and energy to trying to make those investments and make them productive across all parts of the portfolio.

So first of all, let me kind of describe what we've done and what we think is rather unique. We have moved primarily to the OEM side of the equation. So think of GM, Honda, Honda and Ford, and we have aggregated information from those vehicles. And remember, access to those vehicles, those data is being harvested up of newer cars, right, because the history doesn't go back to allow harvesting. So every day, we have the largest personal auto runners [indiscernible] [ 2H ], they are using that data to do their own modeling, the [indiscernible] service, by the way or more likely, they're using our score to assess the driving behavior to offer discounts, market or actually price insurance. 
So if you think about kind of the future of insurance, which I think is where you're going, the historic rating over them is driven by [ 6 ] driving behavior from the standpoint of moving violations and product accidents, age, those types of things. Clearly, understanding the driving behavior from what's happening behind the wheel is probably more accurate and more relevant. 
So we think we're very well positioned. We think it will nicely integrate and does integrate with all the underwriting work we do when we talk about moving the data forward in underwriting an insurance policy, picking, selecting a risk and pricing it. 
To kind of answer your question generally, it is still a small part of our business, especially around the personal auto line of business, but we do believe it will grow. It will become the approach for rating going forward. 
Now I think your second question was a little bit about competitive advantage. We have some very unique and exclusive arrangements with, a, the OMEs. But more importantly, we feel that our datahug, being at the center of those OEMs and all the insurers that we know so well and we are integrated with, creates a unique relationship where they come to us once as opposed to integrate many times. We are trying to extend that out -- that information out beyond what I'll refer to as just the car manufacturers. But I think that hopefully describes to you a little bit about what we do and how we do it, really more focused on insurance than some of these other telematic solutions that are extending beyond insurance and trying to provide to marketing and other verticals."

You can't see any both, but I have a smile on my face. Let me share a little bit about that. First of all, what we're doing life is led by that acquisition of FAST, which is this, I'll call it, low-code, no-code solution for life insurers. What we've added is a bit of relationship and some analytics to the underwriting approach. So things like understanding from your voice, whether you're a smoker. Those are the type of things that we've added, and the life business in whole has done exceptionally well. We probably are not talking about it quite as much is because we'd typically focus a little bit on organic revenue growth. So I look forward to having some conversations about the first quarter next year when we become -- or going to become an organic part of our math. 
Separately and distinctly, again, when we talk about the resurgence and the great growth that what I'll refer as ISO or our underwriting business, we've had a very stable and strong business as it relates to our historic lost cost rolls and forms. But the growth that you're seeing in large part is driven by just light speed conscious set. It is taking a lot of data, not just our own proprietary data, but that, in combination with other third parties, scoring it so that we have a confidence level. So that as opposed to doing, first a, quote, providing that rate to a potential policyholder, they like it. And then you do all their run in writing to understand if there's any other accidents, moving violations, traffic. Typically, 33% of the time, that rate changes. That's very, very much [ unattractive ] to the policyholder, not the digital engagement people are looking for. So a bindable quote is really the heart of what has driven a lot of our underwriting and rating growth over the last year. And we are doing more, and we are extending kind of -- I'll call it from an investment perspective, doubling down as we speak."

However, as we mentioned, represent -- represented about a 220 [ basis point ] margin but also our managed [indiscernible] incentive compensation levels in the fourth quarter and over the quarter reflected an ability to manage that expense impact. 
Now naturally, as we move into a -- what is hopefully a more constructive environment, we will want to normalize the earnings level -- normalize the headcount level for the business to pursue the very attractive opportunities that we have with our clients. We have control, both over the level of, certainly, headcount that we are taking on and T&E. And our objective will be to manage that in a way with as much of the benefit as we can, but we are expecting that on year-over-year, particularly as we anniversary the onset of the pandemic, that we'll see an uptick. But we -- overall, we'll try to manage that in a way where we preserve our operating leverage, and that becomes clear as we talk about it through the course of the year."

Within Wood Mackenzie, the things that we would point out is that we saw modest but positive growth in the subscription side of the business. And so that, I think, is a reflection of the durability and the value of those products even in this more challenging environment. And so it also, I think, is reflective of the value of the investment that we've made in Lens because that subscription component, and particularly the pricing on renewals, has benefited from our clients' receptivity to what Lens provides them. So I think that's the core positive and a particular note in a challenging environment for the industry, where the end market, I think, has had a different experience. 
On the consulting side, that's where, on a year-over-year basis in reported revenues, we are still seeing that 30% year-over-year decline within that business. However, our sense is that our clients are engaging more actively on the consulting dialogue, and we feel better about where the pipeline is headed in that area. So that is -- has not been demonstrated the financial impact yet, but we feel a little bit better about the level of engagement with clients. 
And then within Power Advocate, we are experiencing some pressure, particularly on the implementation side of the equation for our clients. We've had some of our clients that, experiencing the pressure of this environment, have pulled back or reduced, but we still see strong demand over the near term for the cost management, supply chain dimensions of that product set as a whole. And I don't want to overlook also our health and safety business, which continues to contribute strong revenue growth within this segment as a whole as well as strong EBITDA growth and operating leverage within that business. So that gives you, I think, the 3 primary areas within that segment and some of the elements of the growth for that."

But when we think about -- when we talk about -- think about the expenses, we want to kind of remove the inorganic component so that we understand the trends. And I think simplistically, while our overall revenue growth rate was in kind of the 3.5% level, we were able to reduce overall expenses on a year-over-year basis as a function of headcount control and T&E. And so our frame of mind is as we're looking at the organic growth of the business, that we were able to make that adjustment in expenses downward, which allowed us to deliver the strong EBITDA growth performance, even despite that decline in the revenue growth. 
As we look ahead to 2020, we are expecting a higher level of growth if these trends continue with regard to the pandemic. And as a consequence, from an expense standpoint, we are expecting a higher growth rate. We're not expecting expenses to decline. And so the year-over-year comparisons are higher. We're going to try to manage those in a way where we preserve that operating leverage and hold on to as much of that benefit as much of that benefit as we practically can while still pursuing our client events. I know that doesn't put that in the context that you're asking, but it's kind of, I think, the best way to think about the overall performance of trends absent naturally, the impact from an M&A standpoint.

Hamzah, this is Lee. So it is a -- and while you were referring to it kind of in aggregate as a transactional business, we're really talking about probably a dozen to 20 individual products that have various transactional elements, everything from the consulting business at with Mackenzie, some of the consulting and the analytics projects in Financial Services, the claims business with auto claims that are driven by it. So you have a lot of different factors. And so if you can think about it over time, and if I describe it in 2020, we had some businesses that demonstrated, as the year progressed, a pickup in driving activity. 
And so when we talked about the improved performance within Insurance on our COVID-sensitive revenues, it was reflecting an earlier impact and benefit from the uptick in driving and driving activity and those -- that portion of that transactional business. While the consulting revenue on the energy side, which is not going to be tied as directly to a possible impact, is going to improve over a longer period. 
And in Financial Services, we were seeing a dynamic where the weakness in the fourth quarter reflected an increasing -- what we interpreted as increasing concern over potential credit losses, which caused them to pull back on some of their project analytics in the fourth quarter, where we typically see stronger elements. 
So to try to get to your -- to give you an answer is that as we look across all of these products, as we proceed through 2021, as things improve, we'll see -- we should see gradual improvements, but at different rates within each of those businesses. So there's no simple answer because it involves multiple products with differing levels of impact across that. So hopefully, that gives you some context, but I can't kind of define it more precisely for you."

Conversely, our COVID-sensitive revenues declined 11% on an OCC basis, yet, those revenue streams continue to show resilience as the underlying causal factors improve, and we have confidence in this relationship.  
Throughout the year, we've been very deliberate in our cost actions and have protected profitability by matching headcount growth with the trend in our revenue growth. As such, the pace of our hiring and our overall headcount growth has increased sequentially, following the moves that we took at the onset of the pandemic in early spring 2020. As a result, Verisk delivered strong organic-adjusted EBITDA growth and solid margin expansion throughout the year. Lee will provide more details on our performance in his financial review.  
2020 also exhibited the importance of our strong cash flow, the disciplined capital allocation mindset and our emphasis on creating long-term durable shareholder value. Despite the challenges of the operating environment during 2020, we were deliberate about our continued investment in our innovation agenda by inventing new solutions and enhancing existing ones. We also partnered with our customers to bring them solutions to help them be more automated and digitally connected during the pandemic. We funded the continued transformation of our technical infrastructure through cloud migration, tokenization and key data assets and the development of cutting-edge data fabric to underlie our analytics solutions. This is a journey we embarked on in earnest 2 years ago, and we have made significant progress moving our data sets and solutions to the cloud. Yet, we still returned over $500 million in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. And I'm pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has approved a 7% increase in our cash dividend and a $300 million increase in our share repurchase authorization to support ongoing capital returns.  
On the innovation front, our Insurance business continued to advance our existing solutions and introduced new innovations. In our commercial property business, we substantially enhanced and updated our database of commercial properties by building an advanced analytic model for over 8 million commercial properties that give insurers information for 5 key building attributes, including building use, construction class, building age, number of stories and area. This brings the database to a total of 12.2 million commercial properties, and this data can be delivered to our Insurance customers' workflows in an automated and easy-to-use format.  
Additionally, during the quarter, we continued to advance our analytics and offerings in the fast-growing area of cyber risk with the addition of Nationwide to the Verisk Cyber Data Exchange. The Cyber Data Exchange is a contributory database of aggregated and anonymized insurance data from participating cyber insurers globally. The insights and analytics that Verisk derives from this data help our insurance customers make intelligent strategic decisions about their portfolios and select risk and benchmark their performance against peers. The Cyber Exchange is an important part of Verisk's Cyber Solutions suite, which is an end-to-end ecosystem that helps insurers and reinsurers to more quickly deliver new cyber programs or enhance existing ones.  
I'd like to take a minute to observe on recent developments related to our ongoing patent dispute with EagleView Technologies. We continue to disagree with the current outcome of the case and are aggressively pursuing all our legal and operational options. In September 2019, we recorded a $125 million legal reserve related to this matter. We filed our appeal of the original ruling at the end of the fourth quarter 2020. On February 16, the trial court granted EVT's motion for trouble damages as well as some interest and fees. We intend to appeal this ruling as well. As discussed in more detail in our 10-K, because our appeal is pending, we're unable to predict the ultimate outcome of this matter. Still, we remain committed to providing our customers with superior aerial imagery solutions and remain very excited about our partnership with Vexcel, which has not been impacted by this ruling.  
At Wood Mackenzie, we continued to expand our Lens energy analytic platform. In the fourth quarter, we released Lens subsurface discovery on time and on budget, rounding out our 5 upstream solutions within the Lens platform. This module enables faster, more accurate decision-making for exploration and resource development teams as they have access to a comprehensive global data set and can run custom analyses and perform benchmarking studies right into the workflows. Despite the softness in the energy end market driving industry consolidation, we continue to see demand for Lens across our different customer segments, which is reflected in increased adoption, constructive pricing and longer contract terms. Looking ahead, we are on track to launch a suite of modules related to the energy transition into the Lens platform, namely Lens power, which will include global discovery and valuation as well as carbon emissions benchmarking solutions.  
In Financial Services, we launched small business attributes, a new solution in partnership with Enigma Technologies that provides greater insights into the financial health of small businesses, which have been the hardest hit part of the economy during the pandemic. This solution offers our bank customers near real-time information about sales trends that can be used by a bank's risk underwriting and marketing teams so they can better serve small business customers. This partnership is a great example of how VFS is leveraging our unique data assets to extend and serve new segments of the financial services end market.  
On the acquisition front, in the fourth quarter, Verisk closed on the acquisition of Jornaya, a leading provider of consumer behavioral data and intelligence. The acquisition will add Jornaya's proprietary view of consumer buying journeys to Verisk's growing set of marketing solutions for the insurance and financial service markets, delivering better experiences and improving customer acquisition and retention for our customers.  
In addition, we've made great strides throughout 2020 with recently acquired companies. We have now owned FAST and Genscape for a full year. And I'm happy to share that we are having great success extending and accelerating the adoption of their solutions across our customer set as well as improving profitability through cost synergies. We're very pleased with these results as they are tracking ahead of our plans at the time of acquisition and are a great example of management's focus on delivering strong returns on the capital invested in the acquisitions.  
2020 also marked another high point for our company's culture and our commitment to investing in our people and their skills. Despite the remote work environment, the Verisk team increased productivity, boosted connection and collaboration through internal communication tools and engaged in training and development courses through our many different platforms and across all levels of the organization. This year alone, we trained more than 700 teammates in our leadership and management development programs and in our Lean Six Sigma programs. Verisk teammates earned 900 Yellow Belt certifications and 70 Green Belt certifications. Lean Six Sigma is an embedded mindset across Verisk, and we continue to leverage this established methodology and set of tools to serve our customers better every day.  
Some examples of important accomplishments this year include: First, model developers worked to reduce the time spent collecting data and creating models, improving time to market for new models. Second, field representatives developed new time-saving procedures for completing and updating property surveys, increasing their productivity. And third, sales and support teams developed new processes to execute new contracts or amend current ones quicker with our customers. 
The benefits are reflected in increased productivity, high customer satisfaction and improved employee engagement. In fact, this year, our employee engagement score increased 8 points to 78%. And for the fifth consecutive year, Verisk received U.S. certification from the Great Place to Work Institute for outstanding workplace culture. We also received first-time certification in the United Kingdom, India and Spain.  
Finally, I'd like to share my enthusiasm and my views on the recently announced leadership changes and expanded responsibilities for our executive management team. These changes reflect the thoughtful and strategic approach to our long-term growth and planning with the global organization and are a testament to the deep bench of talented leaders we have at Verisk. I'm pleased to share that both Mark Anquillare and Lee Shavel are taking on new leadership responsibilities within Verisk, and both have been elevated to the position of Group President. Mark Anquillare, who currently serves as Verisk's Chief Operating Officer, is adding oversight of the company's enterprise risk management function to his current responsibilities of leading the company's Insurance business and government-facing businesses. Our risk management operations will continue to be led by our very talented and seasoned team that work diligently every day to make sure that our technical infrastructure remains secure and that we are always using the most advanced data protection techniques. This move also more closely ties to our enterprise risk assessment and management with the core operations of our business.  
Lee Shavel, who currently serves as Verisk's Chief Financial Officer, will add oversight responsibility for the operations of our Energy and Specialized Markets segment and our Financial Services segment, bringing in an even more direct link between our capital allocation discipline and our business unit operations. We will continue to be supported by our deep and tenured finance organization, including our Chief Accounting Officer and Controller, David Grover; and our Treasurer, Brian Aird.  
Finally, I'm pleased to publicly welcome Kathy Card Beckles to Verisk that's our new General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. Kathy joins us from Chase Consumer Bank, where she most recently served as General Counsel. Kathy brings with her extensive experience in intellectual property and technology and significant expertise partnering with and advising boards of directors and management teams. I look forward to having Kathy formally join the team on April 5 and working with her to advance our long-term strategy. 
Kathy will replace Ken Thompson, who announced his retirement late last year. To ensure a smooth transition, Ken will continue with the company as Executive Counsel. Over the last 14 years, Ken has been an integral part of Verisk's success and a valued partner and a friend to many across the organization. On behalf of the entire organization, I want to personally thank Ken for his dedication to Verisk and his counsel through this transition. We wish him much health and happiness in his retirement. 
And now I will turn the call over to Lee to cover our financial results."
1027055,702444445,2221720,"Verisk Analytics, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2021",2021-02-24,"Earnings Calls","Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Scott. First, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we have posted a quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website. Moving to the financial results for the fourth quarter. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue",1581,"Thanks, Scott. First, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we have posted a quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website. 
Moving to the financial results for the fourth quarter. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue grew 5.4% to $713 million. Net income increased 33% to $176 million, while diluted GAAP earnings per share grew 33.8% to $1.07, reflecting a $28 million acquisition-related earn-out expense in the prior year that did not reoccur. 
Moving to our organic constant currency results adjusted for nonoperating items, as defined in the non-GAAP Financial Measures section of our press release, we are very pleased with our operating results considering the impact from COVID-19. In the fourth quarter, organic constant currency revenue grew 3.5%, led by continued strength in our Insurance segment. Our non-COVID-sensitive revenues, as we defined at the start of the pandemic, grew approximately 6.5% on an organic constant currency basis. This sustained growth in our non-COVID-sensitive revenue revenues, representing approximately 85% of our total revenues, reflects the durability and resilience of our primarily subscription-based business model. We did continue to experience, as we have since the onset of the pandemic, a negative impact from COVID-19 on certain of our products and services, largely transactional in nature, which represents the balance or approximately 15% of our consolidated revenues. These COVID-sensitive revenues declined approximately 12.5% on an OCC basis during the fourth quarter though the performance across our 3 segments differed. 
In our Insurance segment, we continued to experience sequential improvement in these revenues as the underlying causal factors continued to abate, though the pace of recovery varies across the different solutions. 
On the Energy side, our consulting business remained under pressure from lower CapEx budgets at our customers, but trends appear to have stabilized. 
And finally, within Financial Services, our COVID-sensitive revenues took a further step down as our bank customers reduce their spending levels in response to weakness across their lending portfolios. 
Despite the impact on revenue in the fourth quarter, we are pleased to report that we delivered solid EBITDA growth and expanded margins as the result of effective expense management. OCC-adjusted EBITDA growth was 4.9% in the fourth quarter. Total adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter, which includes both organic and inorganic revenue and adjusted EBITDA, was 48.2% in the quarter, representing leverage across the business. This margin level includes roughly 220 basis points of benefit from lower travel expenses, but also reflects a return to more normal pace of headcount growth and an increase in the pace of investment in our technological transformation, including our cloud transition costs. 
On that note, let's turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis. In the fourth quarter, Insurance segment revenues increased 7.4%, reflecting healthy growth in our industry standard insurance programs, catastrophe modeling solutions, repair cost estimating solutions and insurance software solutions. Similar to the third quarter, we experienced a modest benefit from storm-related revenues as a result of a more normal storm season in 2020 as compared to the very slow season in 2019. This was offset in part by a decline in certain transactional revenues that were negatively impacted by COVID-19. 
Adjusted EBITDA grew 12.2% in the fourth quarter, demonstrating strong margin expansion despite certain revenue declines, investment in our breakout areas and our cloud transition. 
Energy and Specialized Markets revenue decreased 3.9% in the fourth quarter due to declines in consulting and implementation projects and some modest headwinds related to consolidation in the end market. We were very pleased to see continued growth in our subscription-based core research and data analytic platforms and environmental health and safety service solutions, resulting in outperformance relative to the end market. We believe our strong performance is a function of the criticality of our solutions, the diversification of our revenue streams into breakout areas like the energy transition and the strength of our relationships in the industry. 
Adjusted EBITDA declined 19.5% in the fourth quarter, reflecting a catch-up of certain compensation expenses associated with furloughed employees that are onetime in nature. 
As a key partner to our energy customers, we continue to closely monitor the operating environment with a focus on consolidation in the upstream space and the potential impact of a broader, more climate-focused political agenda in the United States. We have a track record of managing through volatile times effectively and believe we are well positioned with our energy transition practice to capitalize on the global growth in spending across zero carbon technologies like solar, wind and energy storage. 
Financial Services revenue declined 13% in the quarter, reflecting the impact of certain contract transitions as well as lower levels of project spending from our bank customers stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic and fewer bankruptcies versus 2019 as a result of government support and forbearance programs. Adjusted EBITDA declined 28.1%, reflecting the negative impact of lower sales, while margins were impacted by certain portfolio transactions we took earlier in the year. 
We continue on the journey to transition VFS to a more sustainable subscription-based business and have taken actions that we believe benefit the business in the long run, but are likely to negatively impact our growth over the next few quarters. 
Our reported effective tax rate was 18.4% for the quarter compared to 23.2% in the prior year quarter. The quarterly rate came in lower than our expectations, owing to increased levels of stock option exercise, which depend on personal employee decisions and the Verisk's stock price. Looking forward to 2021, we expect that our full year tax rate will be between 20% and 22%, though there will likely be some quarterly variability related to the pace of employee stock option exercise. 
Adjusted net income was $209 million and adjusted diluted -- I'm sorry, diluted adjusted EPS was $1.27 for the fourth quarter 2020, up 10.8% and 12.4% from the prior year, respectively. These increases reflect solid top line growth, cost discipline in the business, a reduction in travel expenses as a result of COVID-19 and a lower average share count. 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $249 million for the quarter, up 41% from the prior year period, primarily due to increased customer collections, a reduction in income tax payments owing to higher levels of stock option exercise, the deferral of certain employer payroll taxes resulting from the CARES Act and a reduction in travel payments as a result of COVID-19. 
Capital expenditures were $72 million for the quarter and $247 million for 2020, including some onetime expenses associated with our office consolidations in Boston and London. CapEx came in at the lower end of our initial range as certain expenditures were delayed, owing to the pandemic. For the full year 2020, CapEx represented 8.9% of our total revenues. As we look to 2021, we expect CapEx to be in the range of $250 million to $280 million, reflecting our continued investment in our innovation agenda, our technological transformation and our people as well as the carryover certain expenditures that were delayed in 2020 as a result of the pandemic. 
Related to CapEx, we expect fixed asset depreciation and amortization to be within the range of $200 million to $215 million and intangible amortization to be approximately $165 million in 2021. Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to FX variability, the timing of purchases and the completion of projects and future M&A activity. 
During the fourth quarter, we returned $94 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. As Scott mentioned, I'm pleased to report that our Board of Directors has approved a 7% increase in our cash dividend to $0.29 per share this quarter and has authorized an additional $300 million for share repurchases, bringing our total available authorization to more than $500 million. 
For the full year 2020, we generated $1.1 billion in cash flow from operating activities, an increase of 11.7% over 2019, a strong result considering the challenging operating environment. We invested this cash flow back into our business through $247 million in capital expenditures and funded $285 million in acquisitions. We also returned $176 million in capital to shareholders in dividends and an additional $349 million through share repurchases. 
As we look to 2021, our strategy to deliver long-term sustainable growth remains unchanged, and we believe the stability and predictability of our subscription revenues will persist. However, we do expect certain COVID-19-related pressures on top line growth to continue, though we expect the impact to be less than it was in 2020. We remain confident these COVID impacts do not represent a structural change in our fundamental growth drivers and believe that as the underlying causal factors abate, we will show strong resilience and recovery. We also have confidence in our ability to manage the cost structure effectively to protect profitability, though we would remind you that cost comparisons will be more challenging as we begin to anniversary the onset of the pandemic in the second quarter. Taking this all together, we believe that as the COVID impacts abate, we can return to our long-term growth model of 7% organic constant currency revenue growth with core operating leverage, allowing EBITDA to grow faster than revenue, although it's difficult to predict that timing. 
We hope this provides some useful context for you, and we look forward to addressing your questions. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk.

So we do think about the shape of our business overall, and it's very evident to everybody that we have a very strong insurance franchise. We believe that we know what are the elements of a great data analytic business. And our primary focus has been trying to bring those qualities to bear across everything that we do. And we have definitely given a lot of attention and energy to trying to make those investments and make them productive across all parts of the portfolio. 
And so we're constantly reviewing what we're doing kind of at the segment level and at the individual solution level, and we won't stop doing that. And if -- and those who are familiar with the history of the company know that if we ever get to the point where we conclude that something that we are doing is unlikely to be productive into the future, then we are not reluctant to respond to that kind of a conclusion. So this is an ongoing thought process. It's consistently a part of what we think about at the company."

So first of all, let me kind of describe what we've done and what we think is rather unique. We have moved primarily to the OEM side of the equation.

So first of all, let me kind of describe what we've done and what we think is rather unique. We have moved primarily to the OEM side of the equation. So think of GM, Honda, Hyundai and Ford, and we have aggregate information from those vehicles. And remember, access to those vehicles, those data, is being harvested off of newer cars, right, because the history doesn't go back to allow harvesting. So every day, we have more cars, more miles, and we are now tapped in to the largest insurers, many of the largest personal auto lenders, to which they are using that data to do their own modeling, which is opt-in service, by the way, or more likely, they're using our score to assess the driving behavior to offer discounts, market or actually price insurance. 
So if you think about kind of the future of insurance, which I think is where you're going, the historic rating over them is driven by sex, driving behavior from the standpoint of moving violations and car accidents, age, those types of things. Clearly, understanding the driving behavior from what's happening behind the wheel is probably more accurate and more relevant. 
So we think we're very well positioned. We think it will nicely integrate and does integrate with all the underwriting work we do when we talk about moving the data forward in underwriting an insurance policy, picking, selecting a risk and pricing it. 
To kind of answer your question generally, it is still a small part of our business, especially around the personal auto line of business, but we do believe it will grow. It will become the approach for rating going forward. 
Now I think your second question was a little bit about competitive advantage. We have some very unique and exclusive arrangements with, a, the OEMs. But more importantly, we feel that our data hub, being at the center of those OEMs and all the insurers that we know so well and we are integrated with, creates a unique relationship where they come to us once as opposed to integrate many times. We are trying to extend that out -- that information out beyond what I'll refer to as just the car manufacturers. But I think that hopefully describes to you a little bit about what we do and how we do it, really more focused on insurance than some of these other telematic solutions that are extending beyond insurance and trying to provide to marketing and other verticals."

You can't see me but I have a smile on my face. Let me share a little bit about that.

You can't see me but I have a smile on my face. Let me share a little bit about that. 
First of all, what we're doing in life is led by that acquisition of FAST, which is just, I'll call it, low-code, no-code solution for life insurers. What we've added is a bit of relationship and some analytics to the underwriting approach. So things like understanding from your voice whether you're a smoker. Those are the type of things that we've added, and the life business in whole has done exceptionally well. We probably are not talking about it quite as much is because we'd typically focus a little bit on organic revenue growth. So I look forward to having some conversations about the first quarter next year when we become -- or going to become an organic part of our math. 
Separately and distinctly, again, when we talk about the resurgent and the great growth that what I'll refer to as ISO or our underwriting business, we've had a very stable and strong business as it relates to our historic lost cost rolls and forms. But the growth that you're seeing, in large part, is driven by just LightSpeed [ conscious set ]. It is taking a lot of data, not just our own proprietary data, but that, in combination with other third parties, scoring it so that we have a confidence level. So that as opposed to doing, first, a quote, providing that rate to a potential policyholder, they like it. And then you do all their underwriting to understand if there's any other accidents, moving violations, traffic. Typically, 33% of the time, that rate changes. That's very, very much -- I mean, it's [ not very attractive ] to the policyholder, not the digital engagement people are looking for. So a bindable quote is really at the heart of what has driven a lot of our underwriting and rating growth over the last year. And we are doing more, and we are extending kind of -- I'll call it from an investment perspective, doubling down as we speak."

And it's certainly something that we're watching very carefully and expect to manage very actively in 2021. I think you characterized it accurately in terms of the -- we are expecting that as and if the pandemic impacts continue to abate over time, the revenue impact relative to our targeted growth rate should be more modest. So we're certainly hoping for an improvement in that regard. 
However, as you saw in our expense management in 2020 -- and not just including the T&E expense, which, as we mentioned, represent -- represented about a 220 basis point benefit to our margin but also our management of headcount levels, incentive compensation levels in the fourth quarter and over the course of 2020 reflected an ability to manage that expense impact. 
Now naturally, as we move into a what is hopefully a more constructive environment, we will want to normalize the earnings level -- normalize the headcount level for the business to pursue the very attractive opportunities that we have with our clients. We have control, both over the level of, certainly, headcount that we are taking on and T&E. And our objective will be to manage that in a way where we hold on to as much of the benefit that we experienced in 2020 as we can, but we are expecting that on year-over-year, particularly as we anniversary the onset of the pandemic, that we will see an uptick. 
But we -- overall, we'll try to manage that in a way where we preserve our operating leverage, and that becomes clearer as we talk about it through the course of the year."

And so that, I think,",335,"Yes. Thank you, Jeff. This is Lee. So I would break it down into a couple of influences. 
Within Wood Mackenzie, the things that we would point out is that we saw modest but positive growth in the subscription side of the business. And so that, I think, is a reflection of the durability and the value of those products even in this more challenging environment. And so it also, I think, is reflective of the value of the investment that we've made in Lens because that subscription component, and particularly the pricing on renewals, has benefited from our clients' receptivity to what Lens provides them. So I think that's the core positive and of particular note in a challenging environment for the industry, where the end market, I think, has had a different experience. 
On the consulting side, that's where, on a year-over-year basis in reported revenues, we are still seeing that 30% year-over-year decline within that business. However, our sense is that our clients are engaging more actively on the consulting dialogue, and we feel better about where the pipeline is headed in that area. So that is -- has not been demonstrated the financial impact yet, but we feel a little bit better about the level of engagement with clients. 
And then within PowerAdvocate, we are experiencing some pressure, particularly on the implementation side of the equation for our clients. We've had some of our clients that, experiencing the pressure of this environment, have pulled back or reduced. But we still see strong demand over the near term for the cost management, supply chain dimensions of that product set as a whole. And I don't want to overlook also our health and safety business, which continues to contribute strong revenue growth within this segment as a whole as well as strong EBITDA growth and operating leverage within that business. So that gives you, I think, the 3 primary areas within that segment and some of the elements of the growth for that."

But when we think about the expenses, we want to kind of remove the inorganic component so that we understand the trends. And I think simplistically, while our overall revenue growth rate was in kind of the 3.5% level, we were able to reduce overall expenses on a year-over-year basis as a function of headcount control and T&E. And so our frame of mind is as we're looking at the organic growth of the business, that we were able to make that adjustment in expenses downward, which allowed us to deliver the strong EBITDA growth performance, even despite that decline in the revenue growth. 
As we look ahead to 2020, we are expecting a higher level of growth if these trends continue with regard to the pandemic. And as a consequence, from an expense standpoint, we are expecting a higher growth rate. We're not expecting expenses to decline. And so the year-over-year comparisons are higher. But we're going to try to manage those in a way where we preserve that operating leverage and hold on to as much of that benefit as we practically can while still pursuing our client events. 
I know that doesn't put that in the context that you're asking, but it's kind of, I think, the best way to think about the overall performance of trends absent the naturally, the impact from an M&A standpoint.

Hamzah, this is Lee. So it is a -- and while you were referring to it kind of in aggregate as a transactional business, we're really talking about probably a dozen to 20 individual products that have various transactional elements, everything from the consulting business at Wood Mackenzie, some of the consulting and the analytics projects in Financial Services, the claims business with auto claims that are driven by it. So you have a lot of different factors. And so if you can think about it over time, and if I describe it in 2020, we had some businesses that demonstrated, as the year progressed, a pickup in driving activity. 
And so when we talked about the improved performance within Insurance on our COVID-sensitive revenues, it was reflecting an earlier impact and benefit from the uptick in driving and driving activity and those -- that portion of that transactional business. While the consulting revenue on the energy side, which is not going to be tied as directly to a causal impact, is going to improve over a longer period. 
And in Financial Services, we were seeing a dynamic where the weakness in the fourth quarter reflected an increasing -- what we interpreted as increasing concern over potential credit losses, which caused them to pull back on some of their project analytics in the fourth quarter, where we typically see stronger elements. 
So to try to get to your -- to give you an answer is that as we look across all of these products, as we proceed through 2021, as things improve, we'll see -- we should see gradual improvements, but at different rates within each of those businesses. So there's no simple answer because it involves multiple products with differing levels of impact across that. So hopefully, that gives you some context, but I can't kind of define it more precisely for you."

Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. 2021 is a special year here at Verisk as it marks our 50th anniversary as a company. For 50 years, our mission and purpose has been the same. We work nonstop in partnership with our customers, using data and insights to make a difference by helping protect people, economies, society and our planet. On this journey, we have used our unique data and combined it with advanced technologies in new ways to unlock meaningful insights about risk, becoming a global leader in cutting-edge analytics. And while we are very proud of our accomplishments over the last 50 years, it inspires us to look ahead to all the difference we can make over the next 50 years. 
I'm pleased to share that this year is off to a solid start, marked by continued growth in our subscription businesses. We delivered solid growth in insurance, a modest sequential improvement in our Energy segment, yet we had a challenging quarter within financial services. While certain of our businesses continue to be impacted by the pandemic, those revenue streams show resilience as the underlying causal factors improve, and we have confidence in this relationship. Lee will provide more detail in his financial review. 
For 2021, we remain focused on building long-term shareholder value, delivering for our customers through innovation and service, while also protecting the health and well-being of our teammates around the globe. Currently, most of our offices are operating in a phase 1 format, and are available for those employees who have volunteered to work from the office. We do have certain offices that have advanced to phase 2 and even phase 3 as conditions in their local markets allow, and employees are energized to be back in the office. Our global protection services team closely monitors directives from local governments and public health officials around the world as well as incorporates learnings from our local market experiences to make real-time decisions to maintain the safety of our people. To that end, our teams are closely monitoring the current situation in India in the face of a severe second wave of COVID. And we are providing relief and assistance to our India colleagues, including vaccination coverage, virtual medical services, emergency relief funds and other essential programs. To date, we have experienced minimal or no disruption to our business or the services we provide. 
Over the duration of the pandemic, our teams have proven they can transition efficiently into different work modes with minimal interruption and service to our customers. So while there remains some uncertainty around return-to-office timing across our many different markets, I have complete confidence that our 9,000-plus teammates at Verisk will continue to navigate through these times effectively and deliver the highest value to our customers. Throughout the pandemic, I've maintained a high level of engagement with our customers' CEOs across all 3 of our segments. Despite the virtual setting, the frequency of these meetings has increased, and the level of engagement and mutual respect has deepened. In these conversations, we are discussing our customers' highest strategic priorities. In all circumstances, we are receiving feedback that Verisk is a trusted and differentiated partner and that our solutions and innovations play a large and increasing role in our customers' journeys to becoming more digitally engaged, more automated and more efficient. These types of constructive meetings are happening across all levels of our organization, most recently within our underwriting and claims councils, which include representatives from our top 25 customers in the Insurance vertical. 
With regard to digital engagement, we continue to see very strong adoption of our virtual claims processing platform, claims experience, as insurers continue to find additional use cases for remote claims handling outside the pandemic. Our virtual claims tools enable our customers to conduct business at a time when in-person processes were not possible. But it also has the added benefit of settling claims with greater speed. In fact, virtual claims are paid on average 30% faster than the traditional process. 
We've recently added new features to enhance the solution, including remote measurement, object recognition and an automated damage assessment tool. We also are having success converting customers from transactional usage to long-term contracts with committed volumes as they build comfort with the tool and realize the value their remote claims processing can bring to their organization. 
One of the strongest signals of the deep and expanding relationships with our customers, in our view, is the fact that they entrust us with their data. I'm pleased to share that in the most recent year, 29 insurers have decided to newly contribute data to our ISO statistical database. This is the highest number of new participants in a single year over the last 10 years, and represents a range of different customers from insurtech start-ups to multistate carriers. 
On the sales front, we're having great success selling in virtual mode and remain committed to advancing our techniques with ongoing training across the many new virtual selling tools we employ. Our pipelines of new opportunities are some of the strongest in our history, and they continue to build. Our customers are more engaged with Verisk as a partner as evidenced by increased numbers of meetings, better attendance at our virtual conferences and contract renewals and signings of new deals that are longer in duration. 
On the innovation front, we continue to make advances with our solutions to drive digital engagement, automate processes and create a seamless interconnected ecosystem. What we at Verisk referred to as platforms analytic environments. While this is a journey we've been on for some time, the pandemic has catalyzed our customers to move forward with greater urgency and speed. These platforms analytic environments offer our customers deep integration into their workflows, and allow a massive amount of information to be rendered so that decisions can be made quickly and accurately. Often, these environments are more software intensive as we are utilizing the software to gather more data, automate more processes and become even more deeply embedded with our customers. These platforms are also driving healthy and profitable growth for Verisk across our verticals. 
Let me give you a few recent examples. Within life insurance, we are driving strong growth and profitability as we bundle the industry-leading module software offerings at FAST, with the data analytics we have developed across Verisk to create a full suite of life insurance solutions in 1 singular platform. We're having great success extending and accelerating the adoption of Fast solutions across our broad customer base and have a strong pipeline of future deals. In addition, we recently launched new analytics, including EHR triage engine and Life Risk Navigator. Electronic health record triage engine uses advanced data analytics and natural language processing to distill thousands of pages of electronic medical records into a short summary and provides an automated underwriting score, both of which reduce underwriting costs and speed up the process, and that leads to an improved buying experience for the end consumer. Life Risk Navigator is a cloud-based modeling platform that offers in-depth portfolio analytics to enhance risk selection, quantify changes in mortality rates and drive overall better decision making. Further, in March, we enhanced our capabilities in life insurance through the acquisition of 4C Solutions, a software advisory firm with expertise in group life insurance. The addition of 4C enables us to extend our expertise into the group life market and help address the needs for group life insurers and institutional annuity providers. While each solution is strong on its own, we believe we deliver even more value for our customers as these solutions are integrated into 1 holistic interconnected ecosystem. We are also delivering very strong growth at sequel as we help our customers in the specialty markets digitize and modernize. Sequel solutions create a truly integrated ecosystem across carriers, brokers and managing general agents throughout the specialty market, and we are bringing in new customers and expanding our suite of products across existing customers. We are also beginning to see traction in our global expansion of Sequel with new clients signed in the U.S. and Asia Pacific. To further enhance the value and capability of the Sequel ecosystem. We recently acquired a majority stake in white space software. The powerful combination of white space's digital placing platform with Sequel's pricing, distribution and policy administration applications, enables a seamless real-time quote-to-buying solution with straight through submissions for our existing and prospective customers. 
In our Energy business, we continue to make advances on the development of new modules and sales of new subscriptions for our Lens platform. Despite the softness in the energy end market, customers are recognizing the value and uniqueness of the platform, and this is reflected in new customer subscriptions and constructive pricing for customers that adopt Lens. Additionally, we have lots of interest in future releases for Lens, and already have a group of development partners in place to support Lens Power. Backed by the proprietary data assets of Wood Mackenzie and Genscape, Lens Power enables customers to maximize investment opportunities in clean energy and be on the forefront of the energy transition and further advances our market-leading position in the energy transition. We are well positioned to capitalize on the growing trends of countries and companies around the world, increasing investment toward renewables and green energy, and our solutions will help inform these critical decisions at the highest levels. 
Lens Power is part of a broader suite of solutions that we have within our energy segment to help our customers navigate the changing ESG landscape. We are seeing a positive market response to our energy customer solutions for improved management of supply chain risk and ESG priorities like emissions benchmarking and supplier diversity programs. Not only are we helping our customers with their ESG initiatives, we have also moved forward on our own ESG agenda. In early April, we released our annual CSR report, which you can find in the Corporate Social Responsibility section of our website. 
This year's report is notable for 3 reasons. First, the environmental section features our climate disclosure report, which speaks to the 4 pillars of TCFD: governance, risk and opportunities, risk management and metrics and targets. Our Board and senior management team are very engaged on these subjects, including climate change and climate transition, both on the risks we face, but equally important on the opportunities they present for our business. We've been helping customers understand, measure and manage risk associated with climate and weather for decades: wind storms, wildfire and flood risk, among others, and are building on a base of knowledge, data, predictive models, analytic expertise, industry-leading standards and investments that are already in play and serving our insurance and Energy customer scale. Second, we used the CSR report as the vehicle to deliver our first ever disclosure in accordance with [ SASB's ] recommendations for professional and commercial services companies. The disclosure includes baseline metrics around workforce composition, diversity, engagement and turnover. We intend to update those metrics in our CSR report each year. And finally, the CSR report calls out Verisk's approach to cybersecurity, a comprehensive document that describes our commitment and investments to strengthen data security and privacy. That commitment doesn't just exist on paper, but is reinforced through the mandatory training we conduct annually for all of our employees. We are very proud of the progress we made throughout 2020. Our Board and senior management team are very much engaged, and our entire organization is committed to continue to move forward our ESG agenda over the coming years. 
I'm confident we have the right strategy and team in place to meet our long-term growth objectives. Our deep domain expertise and relationships with our customers help inform our innovation agenda. And we are treating the year 2021 as one that provides a unique set of signals on the resilience of the different parts of our company, which we are pulling into our always-active capital process to ensure that our capital is deployed into the highest return opportunities. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Lee to cover our financial results."
1027055,710503207,2270246,"Verisk Analytics, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 05, 2021",2021-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott. First, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we have posted a quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website. Additionally, you may notice that we have a slightly new presentation of our financial statement",1754,"Thank you, Scott. First, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we have posted a quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website. Additionally, you may notice that we have a slightly new presentation of our financial statements. As Scott mentioned earlier, during the quarter, we closed on a majority investment in white space software. As a result, we now report net income and earnings per share attributable to Verisk. 
Moving to the financial results for the first quarter. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue grew 5.3% and to $726 million. Net income attributable to Verisk decreased 1.8% to $169 million, while diluted GAAP earnings per share attributable to Verisk declined 1% to [ $1.3], reflecting a $19 million gain on dispositions in the prior year that did not reoccur. 
Moving to our organic constant currency results, adjusted for nonoperating items, as defined in the non-GAAP Financial Measures section of our press release, we are very pleased with our operating results, considering the continued impact from COVID-19. In the first quarter, organic constant currency revenue grew 3.4%, led by continued strength in our Insurance segment, and modest sequential improvement in our Energy segment. This quarter's performance fundamentally reflected a year-over-year comparison to a largely pre-pandemic quarter, although we began to see progress in our COVID-sensitive revenues, which improved sequentially. Our non-COVID-sensitive revenues, as we defined at the start of the pandemic, grew approximately 4.9% on an organic constant currency basis, down from 6.5% rate in the fourth quarter, reflecting a lower level of catastrophe bond securitization activity at AIRR and a higher level of impact from consolidation in the insurance and energy segments. We did continue to experience, as we have since the onset of the pandemic, a negative impact from COVID-19 on certain of our products and services, largely transactional in nature, which represent the balance or approximately 15% of our revenues. However, we saw an improvement as certain of these products and services returned to growth on a year-over-year basis. COVID-sensitive revenues declined approximately 5.9% on an organic constant currency basis during the first quarter compared to the 12.5% decline in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of improved consulting activity in our energy sector, but also reflecting a return to growth of several products and services, particularly in the U.S. 
Despite the impact on revenue in the first quarter, we are pleased to report that we delivered solid EBITDA growth and expanded margins as a result of effective expense management and lower travel expenses. Organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth was 5.2% in the first quarter, up from 4.9% growth in the fourth quarter. Total adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter, which includes both organic and inorganic revenue and adjusted EBITDA, was 47.6% in the quarter, representing leverage across our Insurance and Energy verticals offset in part by weakness in Financial Services. This margin level includes roughly 150 basis points of benefit from lower travel expenses, but also reflects a return to a more normal pace of head count growth and an increase in the pace of investment in our technological transformation, including our cloud transition costs. 
On that note, let's turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis. In the first quarter, Insurance segment revenues increased 6%, reflecting healthy growth in our industry standard insurance programs, catastrophe modeling solutions, repair cost estimating solutions and insurance software solutions. We experienced a modest benefit from storm-related revenues as a result of the ice storms in Texas and the Southeast. However, this was more than offset by a lower level of securitization revenues in our catastrophe modeling business as issuance was lower year-over-year. In addition, we experienced declines in certain transactional revenues that were negatively impacted by COVID-19 as we had very minimal COVID impact in the first quarter of 2020. Adjusted EBITDA grew 8.3% in the first quarter while margins expanded 196 basis points, demonstrating strong margin expansion despite certain revenue declines, investment in our breakout areas and increased costs associated with our cloud transition. 
Energy and Specialized Markets revenue decreased 0.6% in the first quarter due to declines in consulting and implementation projects and some modest headwinds related to consolidation in the end market. Growth in core research and environmental health and safety service revenues was offset by declines in transactional and consulting revenues. We attribute our performance to the diversification of our revenue streams into higher growth breakout areas like the energy transition and chemicals, the broad range of end markets that we serve and the strength of our relationships in the industry. Adjusted EBITDA grew 6.6% in the first quarter, while margins expanded 237 basis points, reflecting continued cost discipline and the benefit of lower travel expenses. As a key partner to our Energy customers, we are deeply engaged with them, and part of their most strategic and important decisions. We have a track record of managing through volatile times effectively and believe we are well positioned with our energy transition solutions as well as our Lens platform to continue to outperform the end market and help our customers navigate this broad energy transition. 
Financial Services revenue declined 12.8% in the quarter, reflecting the continued impact of contract transitions that we undertook in 2020, and which will continue for the next 2 quarters as well as lower levels of project spending from our bank customers, stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic and fewer bankruptcies as a result of government support and forbearance programs. Adjusted EBITDA declined 74%, reflecting the negative impact of lower sales and a larger impact of corporate expense allocations on the segment's smaller base. We continue to make progress on our journey to transition Verisk Financial Services to a more sustainable subscription-based business. We are achieving the goals we have set for the business and have taken actions that we believe benefits the business in the long run, but are likely to continue to negatively impact our growth over the next few quarters. 
To that end, given the continued impact from COVID-19 and the contract transitions, we expect to see a similar level of revenue and profit performance in the second quarter of 2021. However, as the impact of the contract transitions abate, and our COVID-sensitive revenues improve, we anticipate a stronger back half of the year performance. 
Our reported effective tax rate was 22.5% compared to 20.8% in the prior year quarter. Mostly owing to lower stock option exercises in the current period. As we have discussed, there will likely continue to be some quarterly variability related to the impact of employee stock option exercises, which depends in part on the Verisk's stock price and employee personal decisions. As a result of a tax law change in the U.K., we now believe that our full year tax rate for 2021 will be between 23% and 25%, up from the 20% to 22% we had previously provided. This U.K. legislation was passed in March and will increase the U.K. corporate tax rate to 25% from 19% previously. This U.K. tax rate increase is likely to create variability in our quarterly rates as we expect we will be subject to a onetime noncash revaluation charge in the third quarter related to a deferred tax liability when the bill is expected to become law. Our best estimate at this time is that our quarterly rate in the third quarter will be in the range of 33% to 35%, but we expect this to be primarily onetime in nature and do not anticipate a material long-term impact from this increase. 
Adjusted net income was $203 million and diluted adjusted EPS was $1.23 for the first quarter 2021, up 4.6% and 5.1% from the prior year, respectively. These increases reflect solid top line growth, cost discipline in the business or reduction in travel expenses as a result of COVID-19 and a lower average share count. This was offset in part by a higher effective tax rate. 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $449 million for the quarter, up 24% from the prior year period, primarily due to increased customer collections and a reduction in travel payments as a result of COVID-19. Capital expenditures were $59 million for the quarter, up 12%. We continue to believe that CapEx will be in the range of $250 million to $280 million, reflecting our continued investment in our innovation agenda our technological transformation as well as the carryover of certain expenditures that were delayed in 2020 as a result of the pandemic. Related to capital expenditure, we expect fixed asset depreciation and amortization will be within the range of $200 million to $215 million. However, we now forecast intangible amortization to be approximately $180 million, reflecting the impact of recent acquisitions and changes in foreign currency rates. Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to foreign exchange variability, the timing of purchases and the completion of projects and future M&A activity. 
During the first quarter, we returned $147 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. In addition, in May, we repaid our 5.8% senior notes in the amount of $450 million through a combination of cash from operations and proceeds from our credit facility. Our strategy to deliver long-term sustainable growth remains unchanged, and we believe the stability and predictability of our subscription revenues will persist. As we approach the anniversary of the onset of the pandemic, we plan to continue to provide updates on our non-COVID and COVID-sensitive revenues to offer transparency on the recovery of our business. We remain confident the COVID impacts do not represent a structural change in our fundamental growth drivers and believe that as the underlying causal factors abate with the rollout of vaccinations and the opening of global economies, we will show strong resilience in recovery. 
We also have confidence in our ability to manage the cost structure effectively to protect profitability, that we would remind you that cost comparisons will be more challenging beginning in the second quarter. Taking this all together, we believe that as the COVID impacts abate, we can return to our long-term growth model of 7% organic constant currency revenue growth with core operating leverage, allowing EBITDA to grow faster than revenue, although it's difficult to predict that timing. 
We hope this provides some useful context for you, and we look forward to addressing your questions. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk. [Operator Instructions]

So it is everything from solar to wind to biomass. What differentiates us is a couple of things. One is we believe that we actually have unique data about really the supply side of those industries. In addition to that, we're able to relate the developments in that part of the energy ecosystem to the rest of the energy ecosystem. And that's really critical because that is what all the players in the energy space want to do, including the traditional hydrocarbon-based players. They are all very, very interested in how they modified who they are in order to move into this future.

Some earlier-stage business opportunities some later stage. We do try to manage those naturally in the -- overall, to deliver return clearly in excess of our cost of capital and for higher risk smaller projects at a level well above that at some premium, reflecting that higher risk. And I would say that on average, this, of course, is going to vary from project to project. But we're generally looking to achieve those types of returns on a 3- to 4-year time frame in order to get to an acceptable return with upside beyond that. That's the general parameters of the portfolio. And I think we also want to make it clear that, that is not just internal investment, but our external investment in M&A. We are evaluating the utilization of capital against both of those investment opportunities. Certainly, on the internal investment, the opportunities to leverage our existing assets and our position in infrastructure are substantially -- enable us to deliver higher returns we expect, but on lower investments. On the M&A front, they are larger investments from a scale standpoint, but we are clearly focusing on how we are adding value to those. And the success that we've had with life, the FAST acquisition with the Genscape acquisition, with the acquisition in our 3D area, all are evidence of our ability to deliver value, either through reduced costs or improved functionality of those businesses. So hopefully, that gives you some context in how we look at both the internal and the external investment, and some of the benchmarks that we use."

So if I was to prioritize our use of capital, I would actually start with internal investment, which is a genuine focal point. We're very happy to return capital to shareholders. We have a long track record of doing that, and we feel very good about that. And with respect to M&A, Lee was already talking about kind of how we look at it. I mean it's not as if we've earmarked some number of dollars or percentage of total capital available to go into M&A.

And David, it's interesting that the -- and it's not uncommon for folks to make a comparison between share repurchases and M&A. I will tell you that we think of it differently in that. We view M&A as more akin, and evaluate it relative to our internal investment because both of them are capital investments that we're making to generate return for shareholders both of those are subject to our return thresholds that we think are necessary to create value. And then if we are unable to find return opportunities in either of those. And I want to emphasize to Scott's point, we think there -- one of the strengths of Verisk is the breadth and the depth of opportunity for us to invest internally in new products at very high incremental returns across a broad range of client-driven opportunities in our industry sectors. But similarly, we see other opportunities on the M&A front. If we don't see acceptable returns in either of those ventures, then we view share repurchases as with dividends, an opportunity to return capital that we can't create value from in terms of higher returns. And then finally, with regard to dividends, the -- as you have seen, we have established the pattern of increasing that dividend. That becomes -- that remains subject to the Board's view on the dividend increase, but there is a recognition that companies that have demonstrated an ability to deliver consistent growth in the dividend over time, are rewarded for that discipline. We believe that it has introduced a valuable additional component to our investor base as more yield-oriented investors that are looking for both growth and yield have been very additive to our shareholder base. And so we think that, that is a useful additional component in our capital return strategy."

We believe that those contract transitions, I would just remind folks represented in part a rebalancing of our relationship with [ several ] of those contracts, shifting in our general strategy to move from less upfront revenues to more revenues extended over the relationship. So it reflects that. There is some upside in future periods that balance that impact. But the short answer is, in the quarter, it was about 2/3 of the impact. And as you mentioned, we expect that impact to be -- to follow for the next 2 quarters."

I appreciate what you're looking for. It's hard to quantify. I guess I would approach it this way. One way to think of it is, clearly, we had a benefit from T&E, the reduction that the -- elimination of travel. And we have described what the impact is from a margin standpoint of that, for instance, 150 basis points in this quarter. And we would expect that we would continue to see that benefit. And so we will see an increase in T&E expenses, but I think that's going to be a gradual increase over time. The other element is going to be compensation and our incentive compensation, in particular, where we're going to see a more normalized level. As we saw in 2020, the responsiveness of our compensation, particularly incentive compensation, flex down, we are expecting a more normalized return, so we'll see some increase in that, plus we are also beginning to normalize head count as we see demand from the businesses to support their overall growth. So there are a lot of factors. But as we move through 2021, one way to think about it is in reference to 2020. 2020, we saw the revenue impact, but we saw expenses decline more than the revenue impact, driving EBITDA growth of nearly 10% over that period. In 2021, I think we're going to see a recovery in revenue. But as we look at those comparisons, we will see higher expense growth. We still expect to be able to deliver EBITDA growth, but it will be driven by the pace of expense growth, fortunately which remains within our control. So our hope is that we will be able to manage that expense growth on the T&E, on the compensation front in terms of head count growth in order to continue to deliver growth, although not naturally at the same level that we were able to achieve in 2020. Another way to think of it is that we do expect that, that dynamic while will drive some reduction in margin, but we still are expecting to be able to retain, as we've said in the past, some meaningful level of the efficiencies that we achieved in 2020. I hope that gives you some direction towards your question, George."

So I would probably just point out that financial services clearly had a contribution to the overall growth rate in that regard. And as to your question on margin, I'm going to kind of go back to the way I answered the previous question, which was that clearly, we saw the margin benefit in 2020 and resulting from our -- the reduction of expenses to a greater degree than the decline in revenues. And looking ahead to 2021, where we will be coming out of this, we are expecting some revenue growth improvement, but that probably will be exceeded by the normalization of expenses. However, if you think about the responsiveness or the growth rates of those 2 lines, we are expecting that the rate of recovery from an expense standpoint will be slower, meaning that we will hope to hold on to some of that margin benefit that we experienced in 2020, but not all of it. So that is, I think, the outcome of our expectations at this point kind of looking at -- kind of reiterating that we are expecting that our margins still will be above where they were pre pandemic, but will probably come down as those -- as the expenses normalize."

I think we are doing extremely well, and I think we've highlighted some of the benefits of the Sequel acquisition, and just the progress that's been made there along with some of the work that we've done on the claims and underwriting front. As we think about other regions, we did highlight France and Germany. And I would say there, it's been a tougher sledding. We were looking for a combination of organic access as well as movement into maybe some businesses that provided services there, from an M&A perspective. I think we've done well from a cat bond perspective, cat modeling perspective, so [ their ] strong rate, just probably less progress with some of the other underwriting and claims in that France and Germany feel.

But do you sort of have any high-level color if that Financial Services business has changed structurally. I know a while back. And Lee, I know you weren't there at the time, but the health care business has structurally changed. And the government had gotten more involved, the business wasn't as global, and there were some other items. As you look at this business with new competition or other stuff, maybe diversifying away from banking customers has been slower. Do you have a sense of timeframe-wise, is that sort of you're still looking into that? Or do you guys have a pretty good view there already?"

And I think there are -- there is an external perspective and an internal perspective, if you're asking about the structural has the business changed structurally. And I think your primary question is from an external standpoint. And I would say that the presence of other players that serve that banking -- the banking industry, particularly as it relates to cards, it remains -- has remained relatively consistent. The large players, whether they're the credit euros or the network companies are there. They serve that industry. And the ferrous financial services entity, has, for a long time, competed very successfully within that environment, given the very unique nature of the data set and the unique relationships that they have with the industry. And they provide a service by integrating that data set and delivering it in a way that others aren't able to do. And so I don't believe that there has been a material change, but we are mindful of the competitive environment that they operate in. From the other perspective, from a structural change, I can say unequivocally that we have changed and improved the business in shifting it to more of a sustainable focus on growth within in the business with the steps that the management team has made. Some of those have had, obviously, a challenging financial impact in the short term, but we believe that the business is better positioned for the long term given those structural changes. So I wanted to address both parts of those questions."

When you sit -- and I actually related to the way that Lee was responding to that prior question about financial services. So if you kind of get to the top of sort of our business in that ecosystem, what you're looking at is global customers that are large, that are facing challenging issues in terms of how they're going to run their businesses in the future are calling increasingly upon data analytics to try to help them make these very, very important decisions and have only a few places that they can turn to outside of their own [ 4 ] walls in order to find support with respect to the kind of data analytics that they want to make the commercial decisions that they need to make. And then I would add to that one other point, which is the range of topics in the ecosystem that can be covered. And those have really expanded in light of the energy transition. And there was an earlier question about what do we do with respect to renewables, but I would point out also that in the energy space, there's a great sensitivity to topics of climate change. And so our ability to also observe on things like emissions is an important capability and its distinct capability. And so the summation of all of that for me, Gary, would be that you're right about the track record. I would point out, over the course of the last 5 years, there have been 2 relatively unprecedented shocks to the pricing of the commodity. And I'm not here to predict that there can't be any more of those, but they were pretty unusual, and in a relatively compressed period of time. Against that, I would put a very large global market with increasing appetite for data analytics of the kind that we provide. And so my summary on all of that would be that I look for this business to contribute at or above the targets we have as a company overall, we're going to hold it to that standard. So that really it."

And it is a function, as you've described, of our migration to the cloud, which is reducing the level of CapEx that we would have typically spent on hardware and infrastructure. Now offsetting that, but we still think it's not completely offsetting that benefit is an increasing level of internal software development intensity which is a function of some of the trends that Mark was talking about in terms of utilizing software opportunity as a way to activate and deliver our data sets and provide solutions for our clients. And so that is clearly an element that we think is added to our business. It's generating good returns. We never want the CapEx intensity metric to obscure our fundamental return objectives. So we do expect to see that improvement over time. It has probably been obscured by some of the real estate renovations that we have done recently that are included in that, but we are realizing real benefits in terms of reductions in CapEx and even OpEx and expenses related to infrastructure as a result of that. And some of those are being reinvested in some of the software development elements as we develop that component of our -- of the delivery of our data sets."

Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. 2021 is a special year here at Verisk as it marks our 50th anniversary as a company. For 50 years, our mission and purpose has been the same, we work nonstop in partnership with our customers, using data and insights to make a difference by helping protect people, economies, society and our planet. On this journey, we have used our unique data and combined it with advanced technologies in new ways to unlock meaningful insights about risk, becoming a global leader in cutting-edge analytics. And while we are very proud of our accomplishments over the last 50 years, it inspires us to look ahead to all the difference we can make over the next 50 years.  
I'm pleased to share that this year is off to a solid start, marked by continued growth in our subscription businesses. We delivered solid growth in Insurance, a modest sequential improvement in our Energy segment, yet we had a challenging quarter within Financial Services. While certain of our businesses continue to be impacted by the pandemic, those revenue streams show resilience as the underlying causal factors improve, and we have confidence in this relationship. Lee will provide more detail in his financial review.  
For 2021, we remain focused on building long-term shareholder value, delivering for our customers through innovation and service, while also protecting the health and well-being of our teammates around the globe. Currently, most of our offices are operating in a phase 1 format, and are available for those employees who have volunteered to work from the office. We do have certain offices that have advanced to phase 2 and even phase 3 as conditions in their local markets allow. And employees are energized to be back in the office.  
Our Global Protection Services team closely monitors directives from local governments and public health officials around the world as well as incorporates learnings from our local market experiences to make real-time decisions to maintain the safety of our people. To that end, our teams are closely monitoring the current situation in India in the face of a severe second wave of COVID. And we are providing relief and assistance to our India colleagues, including vaccination coverage, virtual medical services, emergency relief funds and other essential programs. To date, we have experienced minimal or no disruption to our business or the services we provide.  
Over the duration of the pandemic, our teams have proven they can transition efficiently into different work modes with minimal interruption in service to our customers. So while there remains some uncertainty around return-to-office timing across our many different markets, I have complete confidence that our 9,000-plus teammates at Verisk will continue to navigate through these times effectively and deliver the highest value to our customers. Throughout the pandemic, I've maintained a high level of engagement with our customers' CEOs across all 3 of our segments. Despite the virtual setting, the frequency of these meetings has increased, and the level of engagement and mutual respect has deepened. 
In these conversations, we are discussing our customers' highest strategic priorities. In all circumstances, we are receiving feedback that Verisk is a trusted and differentiated partner and that our solutions and innovations play a large and increasing role in our customers' journeys to becoming more digitally engaged, more automated and more efficient. These types of constructive meetings are happening across all levels of our organization, most recently within our underwriting and claims councils, which include representatives from our top 25 customers in the Insurance vertical.  
With regard to digital engagement, we continue to see very strong adoption of our virtual claims processing platform, Claim Experience, as insurers continue to find additional use cases for remote claims handling outside the pandemic. Our virtual claims tools enable our customers to conduct business at a time when in-person processes were not possible. But it also has the added benefit of settling claims with greater speed. In fact, virtual claims are paid on average 30% faster than the traditional process.  
We've recently added new features to enhance the solution, including remote measurement, object recognition and an automated damage assessment tool. We also are having success converting customers from transactional usage to long-term contracts with committed volumes as they build comfort with the tool and realize the value their remote claims processing can bring to their organization. One of the strongest signals of the deep and expanding relationships with our customers, in our view, is the fact that they entrust us with their data. I'm pleased to share that in the most recent year, 29 insurers have decided to newly contribute data to our ISO statistical database. This is the highest number of new participants in a single year over the last 10 years, and represents a range of different customers from insurtech start-ups to multistate carriers.  
On the sales front, we're having great success selling in virtual mode, and remain committed to advancing our techniques with ongoing training across the many new virtual selling tools we employ. Our pipelines of new opportunities are some of the strongest in our history, and they continue to build. Our customers are more engaged with Verisk as a partner as evidenced by increased numbers of meetings, better attendance at our virtual conferences and contract renewals and signings of new deals that are longer in duration.  
On the innovation front, we continue to make advances with our solutions to drive digital engagement, automate processes and create a seamless interconnected ecosystem. What we at Verisk refer to as platforms analytic environments. While this is a journey we've been on for some time, the pandemic has catalyzed our customers to move forward with greater urgency and speed. These platform's analytic environments offer our customers deep integration into their workflows, and allow a massive amount of information to be rendered so that decisions can be made quickly and accurately. Often, these environments are more software-intensive as we are utilizing the software to gather more data, automate more processes and become even more deeply embedded with our customers. These platforms are also driving healthy and profitable growth for Verisk across our verticals. 
Let me give you a few recent examples. Within life insurance, we are driving strong growth and profitability as we bundle the industry-leading module software offerings at FAST, with the data analytics we have developed across Verisk to create a full suite of life insurance solutions in 1 singular platform. We're having great success extending and accelerating the adoption of FAST's solutions across our broad customer base and have a strong pipeline of future deals. In addition, we recently launched new analytics, including EHR Triage Engine and Life Risk Navigator. Electronic health record triage engine uses advanced data analytics and natural language processing to distill thousands of pages of electronic medical records into a short summary. And provides an automated underwriting score, both of which reduce underwriting costs and speed up the process, and that leads to an improved buying experience for the end consumer. 
Life Risk Navigator is a cloud-based modeling platform that offers in-depth portfolio analytics to enhance risk selection, quantify changes in mortality rates and drive overall better decision making. Further, in March, we enhanced our capabilities in life insurance through the acquisition of 4C Solutions, a software advisory firm with expertise in group life insurance. The addition of 4C enables us to extend our expertise into the group life market and help address the needs for group life insurers and institutional annuity providers. While each solution is strong on its own, we believe we deliver even more value for our customers as these solutions are integrated into 1 holistic interconnected ecosystem. 
We are also delivering very strong growth at Sequel as we help our customers in the specialty markets digitize and modernize. Sequel solutions create a truly integrated ecosystem across carriers, brokers and managing general agents throughout the specialty market, and we are bringing in new customers and expanding our suite of products across existing customers. We are also beginning to see traction in our global expansion of Sequel with new clients signed in the U.S. and Asia Pacific. To further enhance the value and capability of the Sequel ecosystem, we recently acquired a majority stake in Whitespace Software. The powerful combination of Whitespace's digital placing platform with Sequel's pricing, distribution and policy administration applications, enables a seamless real-time quote-to-buying solution with straight through submissions for our existing and prospective customers. 
In our Energy business, we continue to make advances on the development of new modules and sales of new subscriptions for our Lens platform. Despite the softness in the energy end market, customers are recognizing the value and uniqueness of the platform, and this is reflected in new customer subscriptions and constructive pricing for customers that adopt Lens. Additionally, we have lots of interest in future releases for Lens, and already have a group of development partners in place to support Lens Power. Backed by the proprietary data assets of Wood Mackenzie and Genscape, Lens Power enables customers to maximize investment opportunities in clean energy and be on the forefront of the energy transition and further advances our market-leading position in the energy transition. We are well positioned to capitalize on the growing trends of countries and companies around the world, increasing investment toward renewables and green energy, and our solutions will help inform these critical decisions at the highest levels.  
Lens Power is part of a broader suite of solutions that we have within our Energy segment to help our customers navigate the changing ESG landscape. We are seeing a positive market response to our energy customer solutions for improved management of supply chain risk and ESG priorities like emissions benchmarking and supplier diversity programs. Not only are we helping our customers with their ESG initiatives, we have also moved forward on our own ESG agenda. In early April, we released our annual CSR report, which you can find in the Corporate Social Responsibility section of our website.  
This year's report is notable for 3 reasons. First, the Environmental section features our climate disclosure report, which speaks to the 4 pillars of TCFD: governance, risk and opportunities, risk management and metrics and targets. Our Board and senior management team are very engaged on these subjects, including climate change and climate transition, both on the risks we face, but equally important on the opportunities they present for our business. We've been helping customers understand, measure and manage risk associated with climate and weather for decades, wind storms, wildfire and flood risk, among others. And are building on a base of knowledge, data, predictive models, analytic expertise, industry-leading standards and investments that are already in play and serving our insurance and energy customer scale. 
Second, we used the CSR report as the vehicle to deliver our first ever disclosure in accordance with SASB's recommendations for professional and commercial services companies. The disclosure includes baseline metrics around workforce composition, diversity, engagement and turnover. We intend to update those metrics in our CSR report each year. And finally, the CSR report calls out Verisk's approach to cybersecurity, a comprehensive document that describes our commitment and investments to strengthen data security and privacy. That commitment doesn't just exist on paper, but is reinforced through the mandatory training we conduct annually for all of our employees. We are very proud of the progress we made throughout 2020. Our Board and senior management team are very much engaged, and our entire organization is committed to continue to move forward our ESG agenda over the coming years.  
I'm confident we have the right strategy and team in place to meet our long-term growth objectives. Our deep domain expertise and relationships with our customers help inform our innovation agenda. And we are treating the year 2021 as one that provides a unique set of signals on the resilience of the different parts of our company, which we are pulling into our always-active capital process to ensure that our capital is deployed into the highest return opportunities.  
Now I'll turn the call over to Lee to cover our financial results."

First, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we have posted a quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website. Additionally, you may notice that we have a slightly new presentation of our financial statement",1750,"Thank you, Scott. First, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we have posted a quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website. Additionally, you may notice that we have a slightly new presentation of our financial statements. As Scott mentioned earlier, during the quarter, we closed on a majority investment in Whitespace Software. As a result, we now report net income and earnings per share attributable to Verisk.  
Moving to the financial results for the first quarter. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue grew 5.3% to $726 million. Net income attributable to Verisk decreased 1.8% to $169 million, while diluted GAAP earnings per share attributable to Verisk declined 1% to $1.3, reflecting a $19 million gain on dispositions in the prior year that did not reoccur.  
Moving to our organic constant currency results. Adjusted for nonoperating items, as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, we are very pleased with our operating results, considering the continued impact from COVID-19. In the first quarter, organic constant currency revenue grew 3.4%, led by continued strength in our Insurance segment, and modest sequential improvement in our Energy segment. This quarter's performance fundamentally reflected a year-over-year comparison to a largely pre-pandemic quarter, although we began to see progress in our COVID-sensitive revenues, which improved sequentially. 
Our non-COVID-sensitive revenues, as we defined at the start of the pandemic, grew approximately 4.9% on an organic constant currency basis, down from 6.5% rate in the fourth quarter, reflecting a lower level of catastrophe bond securitization activity at AIR and a higher level of impact from consolidation in the Insurance and Energy segments. We did continue to experience, as we have since the onset of the pandemic, a negative impact from COVID-19 on certain of our products and services, largely transactional in nature, which represent the balance or approximately 15% of our revenues. However, we saw an improvement as certain of these products and services returned to growth on a year-over-year basis. 
COVID-sensitive revenues declined approximately 5.9% on an organic constant currency basis during the first quarter compared to the 12.5% decline in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of improved consulting activity in our energy sector, but also reflecting a return to growth of several products and services, particularly in the U.S.  
Despite the impact on revenue in the first quarter, we are pleased to report that we delivered solid EBITDA growth and expanded margins as a result of effective expense management and lower travel expenses. Organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth was 5.2% in the first quarter, up from 4.9% growth in the fourth quarter. Total adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter, which includes both organic and inorganic revenue and adjusted EBITDA, was 47.6% in the quarter, representing leverage across our Insurance and Energy verticals offset in part by weakness in Financial Services. This margin level includes roughly 150 basis points of benefit from lower travel expenses, but also reflects a return to a more normal pace of headcount growth and an increase in the pace of investment in our technological transformation, including our cloud transition costs.  
On that note, let's turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis. In the first quarter, Insurance segment revenues increased 6%, reflecting healthy growth in our industry standard insurance programs, catastrophe modeling solutions, repair cost estimating solutions and insurance software solutions. We experienced a modest benefit from storm-related revenues as a result of the ice storms in Texas and the Southeast. However, this was more than offset by a lower level of securitization revenues in our catastrophe modeling business as issuance was lower year-over-year. In addition, we experienced declines in certain transactional revenues that were negatively impacted by COVID-19 as we had very minimal COVID impact in the first quarter of 2020. Adjusted EBITDA grew 8.3% in the first quarter while margins expanded 196 basis points, demonstrating strong margin expansion despite certain revenue declines, investment in our breakout areas and increased costs associated with our cloud transition.  
Energy and Specialized Markets revenue decreased 0.6% in the first quarter due to declines in consulting and implementation projects and some modest headwinds related to consolidation in the end market. Growth in core research and environmental health and safety service revenues was offset by declines in transactional and consulting revenues. We attribute our performance to the diversification of our revenue streams into higher growth breakout areas like the energy transition and chemicals, the broad range of end markets that we serve and the strength of our relationships in the industry. 
Adjusted EBITDA grew 6.6% in the first quarter, while margins expanded 237 basis points, reflecting continued cost discipline and the benefit of lower travel expenses. As a key partner to our energy customers, we are deeply engaged with them, and part of their most strategic and important decisions. We have a track record of managing through volatile times effectively and believe we are well positioned with our energy transition solutions as well as our Lens platform to continue to outperform the end market and help our customers navigate this broad energy transition.  
Financial Services revenue declined 12.8% in the quarter, reflecting the continued impact of contract transitions that we undertook in 2020, and which will continue for the next 2 quarters as was well lower levels of project spending from our bank customers, stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic and fewer bankruptcies as a result of government support and forbearance programs. Adjusted EBITDA declined 74%, reflecting the negative impact of lower sales and a larger impact of corporate expense allocations on the segment's smaller base. We continue to make progress on our journey to transition Verisk Financial Services to a more sustainable subscription-based business. We are achieving the goals we have set for the business and have taken actions that we believe benefits the business in the long run, but are likely to continue to negatively impact our growth over the next few quarters.  
To that end, given the continued impacts from COVID-19 and the contract transitions, we expect to see a similar level of revenue and profit performance in the second quarter of 2021. However, as the impact of the contract transitions abate, and our COVID-sensitive revenues improve, we anticipate a stronger back half of the year performance.  
Our reported effective tax rate was 22.5% compared to 20.8% in the prior year quarter, mostly owing to lower stock option exercises in the current period. As we have discussed, there will likely continue to be some quarterly variability related to the impact of employee stock option exercises, which depends in part on the Verisk's stock price and employee personal decisions. As a result of a tax law change in the U.K., we now believe that our full year tax rate for 2021 will be between 23% and 25%, up from the 20% to 22% we had previously provided. 
This U.K. legislation was passed in March and will increase the U.K. corporate tax rate to 25% from 19% previously. This U.K. tax rate increase is likely to create variability in our quarterly rates as we expect we will be subject to a onetime noncash revaluation charge in the third quarter related to a deferred tax liability when the bill is expected to become law. Our best estimate at this time is that our quarterly rate in the third quarter will be in the range of 33% to 35%, but we expect this to be primarily onetime in nature and do not anticipate a material long-term impact from this increase.  
Adjusted net income was $203 million and diluted adjusted EPS was $1.23 for the first quarter 2021, up 4.6% and 5.1% from the prior year, respectively. These increases reflect solid top line growth, cost discipline in the business or reduction in travel expenses as a result of COVID-19 and a lower average share count. This was offset in part by a higher effective tax rate.  
Net cash provided by operating activities was $449 million for the quarter, up 24% from the prior year period, primarily due to increased customer collections and a reduction in travel payments as a result of COVID-19. Capital expenditures were $59 million for the quarter, up 12%. We continue to believe that CapEx will be in the range of $250 million to $280 million, reflecting our continued investment in our innovation agenda our technological transformation as well as the carryover of certain expenditures that were delayed in 2020 as a result of the pandemic. 
Related to capital expenditure, we expect fixed asset depreciation and amortization will be within the range of $200 million to $215 million. However, we now forecast intangible amortization to be approximately $180 million, reflecting the impact of recent acquisitions and changes in foreign currency rates. Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to foreign exchange variability, the timing of purchases and the completion of projects and future M&A activity.  
During the first quarter, we returned $147 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. In addition, in May, we repaid our 5.8% senior notes in the amount of $450 million, through a combination of cash from operations and proceeds from our credit facility. Our strategy to deliver long-term sustainable growth remains unchanged, and we believe the stability and predictability of our subscription revenues will persist. As we approach the anniversary of the onset of the pandemic, we plan to continue to provide updates on our non-COVID and COVID-sensitive revenues to offer transparency on the recovery of our business. We remain confident the COVID impacts do not represent a structural change in our fundamental growth drivers and believe that as the underlying causal factors abate with the rollout of vaccinations and the opening of global economies, we will show strong resilience in recovery.  
We also have confidence in our ability to manage the cost structure effectively to protect profitability, that we would remind you that cost comparisons will be more challenging beginning in the second quarter. Taking this all together, we believe that as the COVID impacts abate, we can return to our long-term growth model of 7% organic constant currency revenue growth with core operating leverage, allowing EBITDA to grow faster than revenue, although it's difficult to predict that timing.  
We hope this provides some useful context for you, and we look forward to addressing your questions. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk. [Operator Instructions]

Manav, thanks for the question. And I think as you can appreciate that we -- when we look at that investment portfolio, we think of it in that regard where we have a wide range of products with different time horizons and different levels of kind of kind of risk associated with them. Some earlier-stage business opportunities, some later stage. We do try to manage those naturally in the -- overall to deliver return clearly in excess of our cost of capital and for higher risk, smaller projects at a level well above that at some premium, reflecting that higher risk. 
And I would say that on average, this, of course, is going to vary from project to project. But we're generally looking to achieve those types of returns on a 3- to 4-year time frame in order to get to an acceptable return with upside beyond that. That's the general parameters of the portfolio. And I think we also want to make it clear that, that is not just internal investment, but our external investment in M&A. We are evaluating the utilization of capital against both of those investment opportunities. Certainly, on the internal investment, the opportunities to leverage our existing assets and our position in infrastructure are substantially -- enable us to deliver higher returns we expect, but on lower investments. 
On the M&A front, they are larger investments from a scale standpoint, but we are clearly focusing on how we are adding value to those. And the success that we've had with the life -- the FAST acquisition, with the Genscape acquisition, with the acquisition in our 3D area, all are evidence of our ability to deliver value, either through reduced costs or improved functionality of those businesses. So hopefully, that gives you some context in how we look at both the internal and the external investment, and some of the benchmarks that we use."

So I'm glad you added that last bit, David, because we have multiple forms for returning capital to shareholders. But even before that, I would really emphasize investment into the business to build these engines of growth. We -- you hear us talking all the time about platforms analytic environments. They are really the source of so many forms of goodness in terms of value for customers. And a result of them is that we have much stickier relationships, which are just that much more recurrent. So if I was to prioritize our use of capital, I would actually start with internal investment, which is a genuine focal point. 
We're very happy to return capital to shareholders. We have a long track record of doing that, and we feel very good about that. And with respect to M&A, Lee was already talking about kind of how we look at it. I mean it's not as if we've earmarked some number of dollars or percentage of total capital available to go into M&A. It's more a question, with that third leg, of whether or not the opportunity is compelling and meets our return hurdles.

I will tell you that we think of it differently in that. We view M&A as more akin, and evaluate it relative to our internal investment because both of them are capital investments that we're making to generate return for shareholders both of those are subject to our return thresholds that we think are necessary to create value. And then if we are unable to find return opportunities in either of those. And I want to emphasize to Scott's point, we think there -- one of the strengths of Verisk is the breadth and the depth of opportunity for us to invest internally in new products at very high incremental returns across a broad range of client-driven opportunities in our industry sectors. 
But similarly, we see other opportunities on the M&A front. If we don't see acceptable returns in either of those ventures, then we view share repurchases as with dividends, an opportunity to return capital that we can't create value from in terms of higher returns. And then finally, with regard to dividends, the -- as you have seen, we have established the pattern of increasing that dividend. That becomes -- that remains subject to the Board's view on the dividend increase, but there is a recognition that companies that have demonstrated an ability to deliver consistent growth in the dividend over time, are rewarded for that discipline. 
We believe that it has introduced a valuable additional component to our investor base as more yield-oriented investors that are looking for both growth and yield have been very additive to our shareholder base. And so we think that, that is a useful additional component in our capital return strategy."

I appreciate what you're looking for. It's hard to quantify. I guess I would approach it this way. One way to think of it is, clearly, we had a benefit from T&E, the reduction that the -- elimination of travel. And we have described what the impact is from a margin standpoint of that, for instance, 150 basis points in this quarter. And we would expect that we would continue to see that benefit. And so we will see an increase in T&E expenses, but I think that's going to be a gradual increase over time. The other element is going to be compensation and/or incentive compensation, in particular, where we're going to see a more normalized level. 
As we saw in 2020, the responsiveness of our compensation, particularly incentive compensation, flexed down. We are expecting a more normalized return, so we'll see some increase in that, plus we are also beginning to normalize headcount as we see demand from the businesses to support their overall growth. So there are a lot of factors. But as we move through 2021, one way to think about it is in reference to 2020. 2020, we saw the revenue impact, but we saw expenses decline more than the revenue impact, driving EBITDA growth of nearly 10% over that period. 
In 2021, I think we're going to see a recovery in revenue. But as we look at those comparisons, we will see higher expense growth. We still expect to be able to deliver EBITDA growth, but it will be driven by the pace of expense growth, fortunately which remains within our control. So our hope is that we will be able to manage that expense growth on the T&E, on the compensation front in terms of headcount growth in order to continue to deliver growth, although not naturally at the same level that we were able to achieve in 2020. 
Another way to think of it is that we do expect that, that dynamic will drive some reduction in margin, but we still are expecting to be able to retain, as we've said in the past, some meaningful level of the efficiencies that we achieved in 2020. I hope that gives you some direction towards your question, George."

So just wondering, Lee and maybe Scott, too, as you've maybe dug deeper into those businesses, any early findings, any areas for improvement or anything where you're saying, hey, this is maybe not as good of a fit than we thought historically. So any updates would be helpful on that front."

And the more that we feature those in the mix of what we do, in any part of Verisk, the business becomes very sticky, very resilient, grows well, represents a lot of value for customers. 
And I'll just say that -- and I'm going to pick Financial Services, in particular. The focus here at the moment is, first of all, make sure that we capture all the COVID-sensitive revenues as the environment changes. Make sure that we capture all those revenues back into the mix, one; and two, is the continued development of the platforms inside of Verisk Financial that will represent that same kind of Verisk ways, the Verisk model really for doing business. And that's really what we're focused on in the near term. And we're expected about both of those things as it relates to the business. So that, with respect to VFS in particular.

And really drilling into to complement the kind of the top-down view from a financials, the bottoms-up focus on products, on clients, on people to understand the underlying economics of the business. And one, I think, observation that it's worth pointing out is that, of course, what's happening at those businesses is not wholly represented in what you see within the quarter. 
We've talked about the contract transitions that, while clearly a negative impact within this quarter, represent very strong progress in the objective that we have. And the management team there has been moving very conservatively towards improving that base. And I continue to work with them to evaluate what that broader opportunity is and what the sustainable growth rate for profitability and value is over the long term, as I do with the Energy business. So we're actively engaged in it. I would just ask for everyone's patience as we work through that and evaluate the business as a whole rather than focusing on the specific quarter's results.

We pull -- and customers are able to pull underwriting information from us through those 2 platforms. [ ClaimSearch ], same thing. We are integrated in a way that we are partners. 
So there is a way that we partner very effectively. But at the same time, the world is heading towards analytics, so Dug Creek, Guidewire, as an example are doing more analytics, probably more focused on the individual insurer information as they process the claim, what it looked like over the last quarter. How the rates looked for that insurer last quarter. Where we tend to focus is we have this aggregated view of the industry. So our analytics is more benchmark, compared to other peers, it's an industry view. Let me also remind you that as we think about software, we're becoming more software intense. So Sequel software has been moving into United States, becoming certainly more a global player beyond the London market. So I think there is some more overlap with the 2, but we continue to work together to satisfy customers. 
So hopefully, that's responsive to the software play. And I'll just highlight because of the nature of our industry standard programs, we're integrated with almost every policy, even vendor. We are kind of across the board. So we'll continue to do that to share our content with any insurer or reinsurer that needs it."

We're actually seeing some stronger improvement on the spendings on the analytics as things open up. So hopefully, if that continues, we'll see strength in that regard.

On the expense front, yes, in the quarter, we had probably a heavier load of expense than we typically have. And so looking ahead, we would anticipate not as heavy an expense impact.

Naturally, you can look at the other -- the performance of the other business units from a revenue standpoint in Financial Services, in particular, with the contract transitions and the COVID sensitive. I think from an Energy and Specialized Markets, it was kind of a relatively flat quarter. 
So I would probably just point out that Financial Services clearly had a contribution to the overall growth rate in that regard. And as to your question on margin, I'm going to kind of go back to the way I answered the previous question, which was that clearly, we saw the margin benefit in 2020, resulting from our -- the reduction of expenses to a greater degree than the decline in revenues. And looking ahead to 2021, where we will be coming out of this, we are expecting some revenue growth improvement, but that probably will be exceeded by the normalization of expenses. 
However, if you think about the responsiveness or the growth rates of those 2 lines, we are expecting that the rate of recovery from an expense standpoint will be slower, meaning that we will hope to hold on to some of that margin benefit that we experienced in 2020, but not all of it. So that is, I think, the outcome of our expectations at this point. Kind of looking at -- kind of reiterating that we are expecting that our margins still will be above where they were pre-pandemic, but will probably come down as those -- as the expenses normalize."

The large players, whether they're the credit bureaus or the network companies are there. They serve that industry. 
And the Verisk Financial Services entity, has, for a long time, competed very successfully within that environment, given the very unique nature of the data set and the unique relationships that they have with the industry. And they provide a service by integrating that data set and delivering it in a way that others aren't able to do. And so I don't believe that there has been a material change, but we are mindful of the competitive environment that they operate in. From the other perspective, from a structural change, I can say unequivocally that we have changed and improved the business in shifting it to more of a sustainable focus on growth within the business with the steps that the management team has made.

And so it's just not clear to me that this business is positioned, particularly given the volatility inherent in the end market, to deliver to the long-term revenue growth targets you've set for the company. And on a number of occasions, actually said this business should outperform those over the long-term or growth faster than some of your other assets. So what is it you're planning for in a normal energy market if we're moving back into that today?"

Thank you for the question. Yes. When you sit -- and I actually relate it to the way that Lee was responding to that prior question about Financial Services. So if you kind of get to the top of sort of our business and that ecosystem,",361,"Yes. You bet, Gary. Thank you for the question. Yes. When you sit -- and I actually relate it to the way that Lee was responding to that prior question about Financial Services. So if you kind of get to the top of sort of our business and that ecosystem, what you're looking at is global customers that are large, that are facing challenging issues in terms of how they're going to run their businesses in the future, are calling increasingly upon data analytics to try to help them make these very, very important decisions. And have only a few places that they can turn to outside of their own 4 walls in order to find support with respect to the kind of data analytics that they want to make the commercial decisions that they need to make. 
And then I would add to that one other point, which is the range of topics in the ecosystem that can be covered. And those have really expanded in light of the energy transition. And there was an earlier question about what do we do with respect to renewables. But I would point out also that in the energy space, there's a great sensitivity to topics of climate change. And so our ability to also observe on things like emissions is an important capability and a distinct capability. 
And so the summation of all of that for me, Gary, would be that you're right about the track record. I would point out, over the course of the last 5 years, there have been 2 relatively unprecedented shocks to the pricing of the commodity. And I'm not here to predict that there can't be any more of those, but they were pretty unusual, and in a relatively compressed period of time. Against that, I would put a very large global market with increasing appetite for data analytics of the kind that we provide. And so my summary on all of that would be that I look for this business to contribute at or above the targets we have as a company overall. We're going to hold it to that standard. So that's really it."

A couple of years ago, you had -- the company had discussed sort of a glide path lower in capital intensity. Now of course, I think that was in large part on the Geomni business at the time. And since then, you've stepped up technology investment considerably. I guess I'm just wondering if you could level set for us today, how are you thinking about capital intensity over the next few years. As you get through more of the cloud projects, should we -- is the goal still that, that moderates a couple of points lower over time? Or where are you at now?"

And it is a function, as you've described, of our migration to the cloud, which is reducing the level of CapEx that we would have typically spent on hardware and infrastructure. Now offsetting that, but we still think it's not completely offsetting that benefit is an increasing level of internal software development intensity, which is a function of some of the trends that Mark was talking about in terms of utilizing software opportunity as a way to activate and deliver our data sets and provide solutions for our clients. 
And so that is clearly an element that we think is added to our business. It's generating good returns. We never want the CapEx intensity metric to obscure our fundamental return objectives. So we do expect to see that improvement over time. It has probably been obscured by some of the real estate renovations that we have done recently that are included in that, but we are realizing real benefits in terms of reductions in CapEx and even OpEx expenses related to infrastructure as a result of that. And some of those are being reinvested in some of the software development elements as we develop that component of our -- of the delivery of our data sets."

Thanks for joining us for our Q4 2020 earnings conference call. 
While 2020 was a year like no other, for everyone. At Verisk, it was a year that demonstrated the resilience and stability of our business model, the relevance and mission-critical nature of our solutions and our relentless focus on our customers. And this was all powered by the strength and creativity of our over 9,000 Verisk teammates around the globe, who I want to thank for their dedication and commitment to deliver on our core mission: To serve, add value and innovate during these challenging times.  
The net results in 2020 was another strong year of financial performance, marked by organic constant currency revenue growth of 4.1% and organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth of 11.6% after normalizing for the impact of the injunction related to roof measurement solutions.  
More importantly, in 2020, we delivered 6.9% (sic) [ 6.5% ] organic constant currency revenue growth in the 85% of our revenues that we identified as non-COVID sensitive, essentially in line with our long-term growth target. Conversely, our COVID-sensitive revenues declined 11% on an OCC basis, yet, those revenue streams continue to show resilience as the underlying causal factors improve, and we have confidence in its relationship.  
Throughout the year, we've been very deliberate in our cost actions and have protected profitability by matching headcount growth with the trend in our revenue growth. As such, the pace of our hiring and our overall headcount growth has increased sequentially, following the moves that we took at the onset of the pandemic in early spring 2020. As a result, Verisk delivered strong organic-adjusted EBITDA growth and solid margin expansion throughout the year. Lee will provide more details on our performance in his financial review.  
2020 also exhibited the importance of our strong cash flow, the disciplined capital allocation mindset and our emphasis on creating long-term durable shareholder value. Despite the challenges of the operating environment during 2020, we were deliberate about our continued investment in our innovation agenda by inventing new solutions and enhancing existing ones. We also partnered with our customers to bring them solutions to help them be more automated and digitally connected during the pandemic. We funded the continued transformation of our technical infrastructure through cloud migration, tokenization and key data assets and the development of cutting-edge data fabric to underlie our analytics solutions. 
This is a journey we embarked on in earnest 2 years ago, and we have made significant progress moving our data sets and solutions to the cloud. Yet, we still returned over $500 million in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. And I'm pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has approved a 7% increase in our cash dividend and a $300 million increase in our share repurchase authorization to support ongoing capital return.  
On the innovation front, our Insurance business continued to advance our existing solutions and introduced new innovations. In our commercial property business, we substantially enhanced and updated our database of commercial properties by building an advanced analytic model for over 8 million commercial properties that give insurers information for 5 key building attributes, including building use, construction class, building age, number of stories and area. This brings the database to a total of 12.2 million commercial properties, and this data can be delivered to our Insurance customers' workflows in an automated and easy-to-use format.  
Additionally, during the quarter, we continued to advance our analytics and offerings in the fast-growing area of cyber risk with the addition of Nationwide to the Verisk Cyber Data Exchange. The Cyber Data Exchange is a contributory database of aggregated and anonymized insurance data from participating cyber insurers globally. The insights and analytics that Verisk derives from this data help our insurance customers make intelligent strategic decisions about their portfolios and select risk and benchmark their performance against peers. The Cyber Exchange is an important part of Verisk's Cyber Solutions suite, which is an end-to-end ecosystem that helps insurers and reinsurers to more quickly deliver new cyber programs or enhance existing ones.  
I'd like to take a minute to observe on recent developments related to our ongoing patent dispute with EagleView Technologies. We continue to disagree with the current outcome of the case and are aggressively pursuing all our legal and operational options. In September 2019, we recorded a $125 million legal reserve related to this matter. We filed our appeal of the original ruling at the end of the fourth quarter 2020. On February 16, the trial court granted EVT's motion for trouble damages as well as some interest and fees. We intend to appeal this ruling as well. As discussed in more detail in our 10-K, because our appeal is pending, we're unable to predict the ultimate outcome of this matter. Still, we remain committed to providing our customers with superior aerial imagery solutions and remain very excited about our partnership with Vexcel, which has not been impacted by this ruling.  
At Wood Mackenzie, we continued to expand our Lens energy analytic platform. In the fourth quarter, we released Lens subsurface discovery on time and on budget, rounding out our 5 upstream solutions within the Lens platform. This module enables faster, more accurate decision-making for exploration and resource development teams as they have access to a comprehensive global data set and can run custom analyses and perform benchmarking studies right into the workflows. Despite the softness in the energy end market driving industry consolidation, we continue to see demand for Lens across our different customer segments, which is reflected in increased adoption, constructive pricing and longer contract terms. Looking ahead, we are on track to launch a suite of modules related to the energy transition into the Lens platform, namely Lens Power, which will include global discovery and valuation as well as carbon emissions benchmarking solutions.  
In Financial Services, we launched small business attributes, a new solution in partnership with Enigma Technologies that provides greater insights into the financial health of small businesses, which have been the hardest hit part of the economy during the pandemic. This solution offers our bank customers near real-time information about sales trends that can be used by a bank's risk underwriting and marketing teams so they can better serve small business customers. This partnership is a great example of how VFS is leveraging our unique data assets to extend and serve new segments of the financial services end market.  
On the acquisition front, in the fourth quarter, Verisk closed on the acquisition of Jornaya, a leading provider of consumer behavioral data and intelligence. The acquisition will add Jornaya's proprietary view of consumer buying journeys to Verisk's growing set of marketing solutions for the insurance and financial service markets, delivering better experiences and improving customer acquisition and retention for our customers.  
In addition, we've made great strides throughout 2020 with recently acquired companies. We have now owned FAST and Genscape for a full year. And I'm happy to share that we are having great success extending and accelerating the adoption of their solutions across our customer set as well as improving profitability through cost synergies. We're very pleased with these results as they are tracking ahead of our plans at the time of acquisition and are a great example of management's focus on delivering strong returns on the capital invested in the acquisitions.  
2020 also marked another high point for our company's culture and our commitment to investing in our people and their skills. Despite the remote work environment, the Verisk team increased productivity, boosted connection and collaboration through internal communication tools and engaged in training and development courses through our many different platforms and across all levels of the organization. This year alone, we trained more than 700 teammates in our leadership and management development programs and in our Lean Six Sigma programs. Verisk teammates earned 900 Yellow Belt certifications and 70 Green Belt certifications. Lean Six Sigma is an embedded mindset across Verisk, and we continue to leverage this established methodology and set of tools to serve our customers better every day.  
Some examples of important accomplishments this year include: First, model developers worked to reduce the time spent collecting data and creating models, improving time to market for new models. Second, field representatives developed new time-saving procedures for completing and updating property surveys, increasing their productivity. And third, sales and support teams developed new processes to execute new contracts or amend current ones quicker with our customers. 
The benefits are reflected in increased productivity, high customer satisfaction and improved employee engagement. In fact, this year, our employee engagement score increased 8 points to 78%. And for the fifth consecutive year, Verisk received U.S. certification from the Great Place to Work Institute for outstanding workplace culture. We also received first-time certification in the United Kingdom, India and Spain.  
Finally, I'd like to share my enthusiasm and my views on the recently announced leadership changes and expanded responsibilities for our executive management team. These changes reflect the thoughtful and strategic approach to our long-term growth and planning with the global organization and are a testament to the deep bench of talented leaders we have at Verisk. I'm pleased to share that both Mark Anquillare and Lee Shavel are taking on new leadership responsibilities within Verisk, and both have been elevated to the position of Group President. 
Mark Anquillare, who currently serves as Verisk's Chief Operating Officer, is adding oversight of the company's enterprise risk management function to his current responsibilities of leading the company's Insurance business and government-facing businesses. Our risk management operations will continue to be led by our very talented and seasoned team that work diligently every day to make sure that our technical infrastructure remains secure and that we are always using the most advanced data protection techniques. This move also more closely ties to our enterprise risk assessment and management with the core operations of our business.  
Lee Shavel, who currently serves as Verisk's Chief Financial Officer, will add oversight responsibility for the operations of our Energy and Specialized Markets segment and our Financial Services segment, bringing in an even more direct link between our capital allocation discipline and our business unit operations. Lee will continue to be supported by our deep and tenured finance organization, including our Chief Accounting Officer and Controller, David Grover; and our Treasurer, Brian Aird.  
Finally, I'm pleased to publicly welcome Kathy Card Beckles to Verisk that's our new General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. Kathy joins us from Chase Consumer Bank, where she most recently served as General Counsel. Kathy brings with her extensive experience in intellectual property and technology and significant expertise partnering with and advising Boards of Directors and management teams. I look forward to having Kathy formally join the team on April 5 and working with her to advance our long-term strategy. 
Kathy will replace Ken Thompson, who announced his retirement late last year. To ensure a smooth transition, Ken will continue with the company as Executive Counsel. Over the last 14 years, Ken has been an integral part of Verisk's success and a valued partner and a friend to many across the organization. On behalf of the entire organization, I want to personally thank Ken for his dedication to Verisk and his counsel through this transition. We wish him much health and happiness in his retirement. 
And now I will turn the call over to Lee to cover our financial results."

First, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we have posted a quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website. Moving to the financial results for the fourth quarter. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue",1582,"Thanks, Scott. First, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we have posted a quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website. 
Moving to the financial results for the fourth quarter. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue grew 5.4% to $713 million. Net income increased 33% to $176 million, while diluted GAAP earnings per share grew 33.8% to $1.07, reflecting a $28 million acquisition-related earn-out expense in the prior year that did not reoccur. 
Moving to our organic constant currency results adjusted for nonoperating items, as defined in the non-GAAP Financial Measures section of our press release, we are very pleased with our operating results considering the impact from COVID-19. In the fourth quarter, organic constant currency revenue grew 3.5%, led by continued strength in our Insurance segment. Our non-COVID-sensitive revenues, as we defined at the start of the pandemic, grew approximately 6.5% on an organic constant currency basis. 
This sustained growth in our non-COVID-sensitive revenue revenues, representing approximately 85% of our total revenues, reflects the durability and resilience of our primarily subscription-based business model. We did continue to experience, as we have since the onset of the pandemic, a negative impact from COVID-19 on certain of our products and services, largely transactional in nature, which represents the balance or approximately 15% of our consolidated revenues. These COVID-sensitive revenues declined approximately 12.5% on an OCC basis during the fourth quarter though the performance across our 3 segments differed. 
In our Insurance segment, we continued to experience sequential improvement in these revenues as the underlying causal factors continued to abate, though the pace of recovery varies across the different solutions. 
On the Energy side, our consulting business remained under pressure from lower CapEx budgets at our customers, but trends appear to have stabilized. 
And finally, within Financial Services, our COVID-sensitive revenues took a further step down as our bank customers reduced their spending levels in response to weakness across their lending portfolios. 
Despite the impact on revenue in the fourth quarter, we are pleased to report that we delivered solid EBITDA growth and expanded margins as the result of effective expense management. OCC-adjusted EBITDA growth was 4.9% in the fourth quarter. Total adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter, which includes both organic and inorganic revenue and adjusted EBITDA, was 48.2% in the quarter, representing leverage across the business. This margin level includes roughly 220 basis points of benefit from lower travel expenses, but also reflects a return to more normal pace of headcount growth and an increase in the pace of investment in our technological transformation, including our cloud transition costs. 
On that note, let's turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis. In the fourth quarter, Insurance segment revenues increased 7.4%, reflecting healthy growth in our industry standard insurance programs, catastrophe modeling solutions, repair cost estimating solutions and insurance software solutions. Similar to the third quarter, we experienced a modest benefit from storm-related revenues as a result of a more normal storm season in 2020 as compared to the very slow season in 2019. This was offset in part by a decline in certain transactional revenues that were negatively impacted by COVID-19. 
Adjusted EBITDA grew 12.2% in the fourth quarter, demonstrating strong margin expansion despite certain revenue declines, investment in our breakout areas and our cloud transition. 
Energy and Specialized Markets revenue decreased 3.9% in the fourth quarter due to declines in consulting and implementation projects and some modest headwinds related to consolidation in the end market. We were very pleased to see continued growth in our subscription-based core research and data analytic platforms and environmental health and safety service solutions, resulting in outperformance relative to the end market. We believe our strong performance is a function of the criticality of our solutions, the diversification of our revenue streams into breakout areas like the energy transition and the strength of our relationships in the industry. 
Adjusted EBITDA declined 19.5% in the fourth quarter, reflecting a catch-up of certain compensation expenses associated with furloughed employees that are onetime in nature. 
As a key partner to our energy customers, we continue to closely monitor the operating environment with a focus on consolidation in the upstream space and the potential impact of a broader, more climate-focused political agenda in the United States. We have a track record of managing through volatile times effectively and believe we are well positioned with our energy transition practice to capitalize on the global growth in spending across zero carbon technologies like solar, wind and energy storage. 
Financial Services revenue declined 13% in the quarter, reflecting the impact of certain contract transitions as well as lower levels of project spending from our bank customers stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic and fewer bankruptcies versus 2019 as a result of government support and forbearance programs. Adjusted EBITDA declined 28.1%, reflecting the negative impact of lower sales, while margins were impacted by certain portfolio transactions we took earlier in the year. 
We continue on the journey to transition VFS to a more sustainable subscription-based business and have taken actions that we believe benefit the business in the long run, but are likely to negatively impact our growth over the next few quarters. 
Our reported effective tax rate was 18.4% for the quarter compared to 23.2% in the prior year quarter. The quarterly rate came in lower than our expectations, owing to increased levels of stock option exercise, which depend on personal employee decisions and the Verisk's stock price. Looking forward to 2021, we expect that our full year tax rate will be between 20% and 22%, though there will likely be some quarterly variability related to the pace of employee stock option exercise. 
Adjusted net income was $209 million and adjusted diluted -- I'm sorry, and diluted adjusted EPS was $1.27 for the fourth quarter 2020, up 10.8% and 12.4% from the prior year, respectively. These increases reflect solid top line growth, cost discipline in the business, a reduction in travel expenses as a result of COVID-19 and a lower average share count. 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $249 million for the quarter, up 41% from the prior year period, primarily due to increased customer collections, a reduction in income tax payments owing to higher levels of stock option exercise, the deferral of certain employer payroll taxes resulting from the CARES Act and a reduction in travel payments as a result of COVID-19. 
Capital expenditures were $72 million for the quarter and $247 million for 2020, including some onetime expenses associated with our office consolidations in Boston and London. CapEx came in at the lower end of our initial range as certain expenditures were delayed, owing to the pandemic. For the full year 2020, CapEx represented 8.9% of our total revenues. As we look to 2021, we expect CapEx to be in the range of $250 million to $280 million, reflecting our continued investment in our innovation agenda, our technological transformation and our people as well as the carryover certain expenditures that were delayed in 2020 as a result of the pandemic. 
Related to CapEx, we expect fixed asset depreciation and amortization to be within the range of $200 million to $215 million and intangible amortization to be approximately $165 million in 2021. Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to FX variability, the timing of purchases and the completion of projects and future M&A activity. 
During the fourth quarter, we returned $94 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. As Scott mentioned, I'm pleased to report that our Board of Directors has approved a 7% increase in our cash dividend to $0.29 per share this quarter and has authorized an additional $300 million for share repurchases, bringing our total available authorization to more than $500 million. 
For the full year 2020, we generated $1.1 billion in cash flow from operating activities, an increase of 11.7% over 2019, a strong result considering the challenging operating environment. We invested this cash flow back into our business through $247 million in capital expenditures and funded $285 million in acquisitions. We also returned $176 million in capital to shareholders in dividends and an additional $349 million through share repurchases. 
As we look to 2021, our strategy to deliver long-term sustainable growth remains unchanged, and we believe the stability and predictability of our subscription revenues will persist. However, we do expect certain COVID-19-related pressures on top line growth to continue, though we expect the impact to be less than it was in 2020. We remain confident these COVID impacts do not represent a structural change in our fundamental growth drivers and believe that as the underlying causal factors abate, we will show strong resilience and recovery. 
We also have confidence in our ability to manage the cost structure effectively to protect profitability, though we would remind you that cost comparisons will be more challenging as we begin to anniversary the onset of the pandemic in the second quarter. Taking this all together, we believe that as the COVID impacts abate, we can return to our long-term growth model of 7% organic constant currency revenue growth with core operating leverage, allowing EBITDA to grow faster than revenue, although it's difficult to predict that timing. 
We hope this provides some useful context for you, and we look forward to addressing your questions. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk.

So we do think about the shape of our business overall, and it's very evident to everybody that we have a very strong insurance franchise. We believe that we know what are the elements of a great data analytic business. And our primary focus has been trying to bring those qualities to bear across everything that we do. And we have definitely given a lot of attention and energy to trying to make those investments and make them productive across all parts of the portfolio. 
And so we're constantly reviewing what we're doing kind of at the segment level and at the individual solution level, and we won't stop doing that. And if -- and those who are familiar with the history of the company know that if we ever get to the point where we conclude that something that we are doing is unlikely to be productive into the future, then we are not reluctant to respond to that kind of a conclusion. So this is an ongoing thought process. It's consistently a part of what we think about at the company."

So first of all, let me kind of describe what we've done and what we think is rather unique. We have moved primarily to the OEM side of the equation. So think of GM, Honda, Hyundai and Ford, and we have aggregate information from those vehicles. And remember, access to those vehicles, those data, is being harvested off of newer cars, right, because the history doesn't go back to allow harvesting. So every day, we have more cars, more miles, and we are now tapped in to the largest insurers, many of the largest personal auto writers, to which they are using that data to do their own modeling, which is opt-in service, by the way, or more likely, they're using our score to assess the driving behavior to offer discounts, market or actually price insurance. 
So if you think about kind of the future of insurance, which I think is where you're going, the historic rating over them is driven by sex, driving behavior from the standpoint of moving violations and car accidents, age, those types of things. Clearly, understanding the driving behavior from what's happening behind the wheel is probably more accurate and more relevant. 
So we think we're very well positioned. We think it will nicely integrate and does integrate with all the underwriting work we do when we talk about moving the data forward in underwriting an insurance policy, picking, selecting a risk and pricing it. 
To kind of answer your question generally, it is still a small part of our business, especially around the personal auto line of business, but we do believe it will grow. It will become the approach for rating going forward. 
Now I think your second question was a little bit about competitive advantage. We have some very unique and exclusive [indiscernible]  arrangements with, a, the OEMs. But more importantly, we feel that our data hub, being at the center of those OEMs and all the insurers that we know so well and we are integrated with, creates a unique relationship where they come to us once as opposed to integrate many times. We are trying to extend that out -- that information out beyond what I'll refer to as just the car manufacturers. But I think that hopefully describes to you a little bit about what we do and how we do it, really more focused on insurance than some of these other telematic solutions that are extending beyond insurance and trying to provide to marketing and other [ technical ]."

You can't see me but I have a smile on my face. Let me share a little bit about that. 
First of all, what we're doing in Life is led by that acquisition of FAST, which is this, I'll call it, low-code, no-code solution for life insurers. What we've added is a bit of relationship and some analytics to the underwriting approach. So things like understanding from your voice whether you're a smoker. Those are the type of things that we've added, and the life business in whole has done exceptionally well. We probably are not talking about it quite as much is because we'd typically focus a little bit on organic revenue growth. So I look forward to having some conversations probably  the first quarter next year when we become -- or going to become an organic part of our math. 
Separately and distinctly, again, when we talk about the resurgent and the great growth that what I'll refer to as ISO or underwriting business, we've had a very stable and strong business as it relates to our historic lost cost rolls and forms. But the growth that you're seeing, in large part, is driven by just LightSpeed [ conscious set ]. It is taking a lot of data, not just our own proprietary data, but that, in combination with other third parties, scoring it so that we have a confidence level. So that as opposed to doing, first, a quote, providing that rate to a potential policyholder, they like it. 
And then you do all their underwriting to understand if there's any other accidents, moving violations, traffic. Typically, 33% of the time, that rate changes. That's very, very much -- I mean, it's  [ not very attractive ] to the policyholder, not the digital engagement people are looking for. So a bindable quote is really at the heart of what has driven a lot of our underwriting and rating growth over the last year. And we are doing more, and we are extending kind of -- I'll call it from an investment perspective, doubling down as we speak."

And it's certainly something that we're watching very carefully and expect to manage very actively in 2021. I think you characterized it accurately in terms of the -- we are expecting that as and if the pandemic impacts continue to abate over time, the revenue impact relative to our targeted growth rate should be more modest. So we're certainly hoping for an improvement in that regard. 
However, as you saw in our expense management in 2020 -- and not just including the T&E expense, which, as we mentioned, represent -- represented about a 220 basis point benefit to our margin but also our management of headcount levels, incentive compensation levels in the fourth quarter and over the course of 2020 reflected an ability to manage that expense impact. 
Now naturally, as we move into a what is hopefully a more constructive environment, we will want to normalize the earnings level -- normalize the headcount level for the business to pursue the very attractive opportunities that we have with our clients. We have control, both over the level of, certainly, headcount that we are taking on and T&E. And our objective will be to manage that in a way where we hold on to as much of the benefit that we experienced in 2020 as we can, but we are expecting that on year-over-year, particularly as we anniversary the onset of the pandemic, that we will see an uptick. 
But we -- overall, we'll try to manage that in a way where we preserve our operating leverage, and that becomes clearer as we talk about it through the course of the year."

Within Wood Mackenzie, the things that we would point out is that we saw modest but positive growth in the subscription side of the business. And so that, I think, is a reflection of the durability and the value of those products even in this more challenging environment. And so it also, I think, is reflective of the value of the investment that we've made in Lens because that subscription component, and particularly the pricing on renewals, has benefited from our clients' receptivity to what Lens provides them. So I think that's the core positive and of particular note in a challenging environment for the industry, where the end market, I think, has had a different experience. 
On the consulting side, that's where, on a year-over-year basis in reported revenues, we are still seeing that 30% year-over-year decline within that business. However, our sense is that our clients are engaging more actively on the consulting dialogue, and we feel better about where the pipeline is headed in that area. So that is -- has not been demonstrated the financial impact yet, but we feel a little bit better about the level of engagement with clients. 
And then within PowerAdvocate, we are experiencing some pressure, particularly on the implementation side of the equation for our clients. We've had some of our clients that, experiencing the pressure of this environment, have pulled back or reduced. But we still see strong demand over the near term for the cost management, supply chain dimensions of that product set as a whole. And I don't want to overlook also our health and safety business, which continues to contribute strong revenue growth within this segment as a whole as well as strong EBITDA growth and operating leverage within that business. So that gives you, I think, the 3 primary areas within that segment and some of the elements of the growth for that."

But when we think about the expenses, we want to kind of remove the inorganic component so that we understand the trends. And I think simplistically, while our overall revenue growth rate was in kind of the 3.5% level, we were able to reduce overall expenses on a year-over-year basis as a function of headcount control and T&E. And so our frame of mind is as we're looking at the organic growth of the business, that we were able to make that adjustment in expenses downward, which allowed us to deliver the strong EBITDA growth performance, even despite that decline in the revenue growth. 
As we look ahead to 2020, we are expecting a higher level of growth if these trends continue with regard to the pandemic. And as a consequence, from an expense standpoint, we are expecting a higher growth rate. We're not expecting expenses to decline. And so the year-over-year comparisons are higher. But we're going to try to manage those in a way where we preserve that operating leverage and hold on to as much of that benefit as we practically can while still pursuing our client events.

So you have a lot of different factors. And so if you can think about it over time, and if I describe it in 2020, we had some businesses that demonstrated, as the year progressed, a pickup in driving activity. 
And so when we talked about the improved performance within Insurance on our COVID-sensitive revenues, it was reflecting an earlier impact in benefit from the uptick in driving and driving activity and those -- that portion of that transactional business. While the consulting revenue on the energy side, which is not going to be tied as directly to a causal impact, is going to improve over a longer period. 
And in Financial Services, we were seeing a dynamic where the weakness in the fourth quarter reflected an increasing -- what we interpreted as increasing concern over potential credit losses, which caused them to pull back on some of their project analytics in the fourth quarter, where we typically see stronger elements. 
So to try to get to your -- to give you an answer is that as we look across all of these products, as we proceed through 2021, as things improve, we'll see -- we should see gradual improvements, but at different rates within each of those businesses. So there's no simple answer because it involves multiple products with differing levels of impact across that.

And when we look at that in the fourth quarter and recognizing that it is fourth quarter, I would say that there was more of an impact on that -- on the transactional -- the contract transitions, and some of that involved kind of restructuring our contracts to better reflect the annuity nature of our business. 
We also had some contract transitions that were a result of some strategic exits from a portion of our businesses, but that probably had a more significant impact in the fourth quarter relative to some of the environmental impacts. And -- which were, as I described in the recent -- another question recently, was that we saw some weakness in the banks pulling back on some of their project -- their project analytics, which had an overall impact, negative impact. 
So those -- that gives you kind of a rough proportion, probably a little bit more on that contract transition, but there was also a meaningful impact from the -- from what we were seeing in the project analytics front."

Thanks for joining us for our Q4 2020 earnings conference call. 
While 2020 was a year like no other for everyone, at Verisk, it was a year that demonstrated the resilience and stability of our business model, the relevance and mission-critical nature of our solutions and our relentless focus on our customers. And this was all powered by the strength and creativity of our over 9,000 Verisk teammates around the globe, who I want to thank for their dedication and commitment to deliver on our core mission: to serve, add value and innovate during these challenging times. 
The net results in 2020 was another strong year of financial performance, marked by organic constant currency revenue growth of 4.1% and organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth of 11.6% after normalizing for the impact of the injunction related to roof measurement solutions. 
More importantly, in 2020, we delivered 6.9% organic constant currency revenue growth in the 85% of our revenues that we identified as non-COVID sensitive, essentially in line with our long-term growth target. Conversely, our COVID-sensitive revenues declined 11% on an OCC basis, yet, those revenue streams continue to show resilience as the underlying causal factors improve, and we have confidence in this relationship. 
Throughout the year, we've been very deliberate in our cost actions and have protected profitability by matching headcount growth with the trend in our revenue growth. As such, the pace of our hiring and our overall headcount growth has increased sequentially, following the moves that we took at the onset of the pandemic in early spring 2020. As a result, Verisk delivered strong organic-adjusted EBITDA growth and solid margin expansion throughout the year. Lee will provide more details on our performance in his financial review. 
2020 also exhibited the importance of our strong cash flow, the disciplined capital allocation mindset and our emphasis on creating long term, durable shareholder value. Despite the challenges of the operating environment during 2020, we were deliberate about our continued investment in our innovation agenda by inventing new solutions and enhancing existing ones. We also partnered with our customers to bring them solutions to help them be more automated and digitally connected during the pandemic. We funded the continued transformation of our technical infrastructure through cloud migration, tokenization of key data assets and the development of cutting-edge data fabric to underlie our analytic solutions. 
This is a journey we embarked on in earnest 2 years ago, and we have made significant progress moving our data sets and solutions to the cloud. Yet, we still returned over $500 million in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. And I'm pleased to announce that our Board of Directors has approved a 7% increase in our cash dividend and a $300 million increase in our share repurchase authorization to support ongoing capital return. 
On the innovation front, our Insurance business continued to advance our existing solutions and introduced new innovations. In our commercial property business, we substantially enhanced and updated our database of commercial properties by building an advanced analytic model for over 8 million commercial properties that give insurers information for 5 key building attributes, including building use, construction class, building age, number of stories and area. This brings the database to a total of 12.2 million commercial properties, and this data can be delivered to our Insurance customers' workflows in an automated and easy-to-use format. 
Additionally, during the quarter, we continued to advance our analytics and offerings in the fast-growing area of cyber risk with the addition of Nationwide to the Verisk Cyber Data Exchange. The Cyber Data Exchange is a contributory database of aggregated and anonymized insurance data from participating cyber insurers globally. The insights and analytics that Verisk derives from this data help our insurance customers make intelligent strategic decisions about their portfolios and select risk and benchmark their performance against peers. The Cyber Exchange is an important part of Verisk's Cyber Solutions suite, which is an end-to-end ecosystem that helps insurers and reinsurers more quickly deliver new cyber programs or enhance existing ones. 
I'd like to take a minute to observe on recent developments related to our ongoing patent dispute with EagleView Technologies. We continue to disagree with the current outcome of the case and are aggressively pursuing all our legal and operational options. In September 2019, we recorded a $125 million legal reserve related to this matter. We filed our appeal of the original ruling at the end of the fourth quarter 2020. On February 16, the trial court granted EVT's motion for treble damages as well as some interest and fees. We intend to appeal this ruling as well. As discussed in more detail on our 10-K, because our appeal is pending, we're unable to predict the ultimate outcome of this matter. Still, we remain committed to providing our customers with superior aerial imagery solutions and remain very excited about our partnership with Vexcel, which has not been impacted by this ruling.
At Wood Mackenzie, we continued to expand our Lens energy analytic platform. In the fourth quarter, we released Lens subsurface discovery on time and on budget, rounding out our 5 upstream solutions within the Lens platform. This module enables faster, more accurate decision-making for exploration and resource development teams as they have access to a comprehensive global data set and can run custom analyses and perform benchmarking studies right into the workflows. Despite the softness in the energy end market driving industry consolidation, we continue to see demand for Lens across our different customer segments, which is reflected in increased adoption, constructive pricing and longer contract terms. Looking ahead, we are on track to launch a suite of modules related to the energy transition into the Lens platform, namely Lens Power, which will include global discovery and valuation as well as carbon emissions benchmarking solutions. 
In Financial Services, we launched small business attributes, a new solution in partnership with Enigma Technologies that provides greater insights into the financial health of small businesses, which have been the hardest hit part of the economy during the pandemic. This solution offers our bank customers near real-time information about sales trends that can be used by a bank's risk underwriting and marketing teams so they can better serve small business customers. This partnership is a great example of how VFS is leveraging our unique data assets to extend and serve new segments of the financial services end market. 
On the acquisition front, in the fourth quarter, Verisk closed on the acquisition of Jornaya, a leading provider of consumer behavioral data and intelligence. The acquisition will add Jornaya's proprietary view of consumer buying journeys to Verisk's growing set of marketing solutions for the insurance and financial service markets, delivering better experiences and improving customer acquisition and retention for our customers. 
In addition, we've made great strides throughout 2020 with recently acquired companies. We have now owned FAST and Genscape for a full year. And I'm happy to share that we are having great success extending and accelerating the adoption of their solutions across our customer set as well as improving profitability through cost synergies. We're very pleased with these results as they are tracking ahead of our plans at the time of acquisition and are a great example of management's focus on delivering strong returns on the capital invested in the acquisitions. 
2020 also marked another high point for our company's culture and our commitment to investing in our people and their skills. Despite the remote work environment, the Verisk team increased productivity, boosted connection and collaboration through internal communication tools and engaged in training and development courses through our many different platforms and across all levels of the organization. This year alone, we trained more than 700 teammates in our leadership and management development programs and in our Lean Six Sigma programs. Verisk teammates earned 900 Yellow Belt certifications and 70 Green Belt certifications. Lean Six Sigma is an embedded mindset across Verisk, and we continue to leverage this established methodology and set of tools to serve our customers better every day. 
Some examples of important accomplishments this year include: First, model developers worked to reduce the time spent collecting data and creating models, improving time to market for new models. Second, field representatives developed new time-saving procedures for completing and updating property surveys, increasing their productivity. And third, sales and support teams developed new processes to execute new contracts or amend current ones quicker with our customers. 
The benefits are reflected in increased productivity, high customer satisfaction and improved employee engagement. In fact, this year, our employee engagement score increased 8 points to 78%. And for the fifth consecutive year, Verisk received U.S. certification from the Great Place to Work Institute for outstanding workplace culture. We also received first-time certification in the United Kingdom, India and Spain. 
Finally, I'd like to share my enthusiasm and my views on the recently announced leadership changes and expanded responsibilities for our executive management team. These changes reflect the thoughtful and strategic approach to our long-term growth and planning with the global organization and are a testament to the deep bench of talented leaders we have at Verisk. I'm pleased to share that both Mark Anquillare and Lee Shavel are taking on new leadership responsibilities within Verisk, and both have been elevated to the position of Group President. 
Mark Anquillare, who currently serves as Verisk's Chief Operating Officer, is adding oversight of the company's enterprise risk management function to his current responsibilities of leading the company's Insurance business and government-facing businesses. Our risk management operations will continue to be led by our very talented and seasoned team that work diligently every day to make sure that our technical infrastructure remains secure and that we are always using the most advanced data protection techniques. This move also more closely ties to our enterprise risk assessment and management with the core operations of our business. 
Lee Shavel, who currently serves as Verisk's Chief Financial Officer, will add oversight responsibility for the operations of our Energy and Specialized Markets segment and our Financial Services segment, bringing an even more direct link between our capital allocation discipline and our business unit operations. Lee will continue to be supported by our deep and tenured finance organization, including our Chief Accounting Officer and Controller, David Grover; and our Treasurer, Brian Aird. 
Finally, I'm pleased to publicly welcome Kathy Card Beckles to Verisk, that's our new General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. Kathy joins us from Chase Consumer Bank, where she most recently served as General Counsel. Kathy brings with her extensive experience in intellectual property and technology and significant expertise partnering with and advising Boards of Directors and management teams. I look forward to having Kathy formally join the team on April 5 and working with her to advance our long-term strategy. 
Kathy will replace Ken Thompson, who announced his retirement late last year. To ensure a smooth transition, Ken will continue with the company as Executive Counsel. Over the last 14 years, Ken has been an integral part of Verisk's success and a valued partner and a friend to many across the organization. On behalf of the entire organization, I want to personally thank Ken for his dedication to Verisk and his counsel through this transition. We wish him much health and happiness in his retirement. 
And now I will turn the call over to Lee to cover our financial results."
1027055,702444445,2287954,"Verisk Analytics, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2021",2021-02-24,"Earnings Calls","Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Scott. First, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we have posted a quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website. Moving to the financial results for the fourth quarter. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue",1582,"Thanks, Scott. First, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we have posted a quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website. 
Moving to the financial results for the fourth quarter. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue grew 5.4% to $713 million. Net income increased 33% to $176 million, while diluted GAAP earnings per share grew 33.8% to $1.07, reflecting a $28 million acquisition-related earn-out expense in the prior year that did not reoccur. 
Moving to our organic constant currency results adjusted for nonoperating items, as defined in the non-GAAP Financial Measures section of our press release, we are very pleased with our operating results considering the impact from COVID-19. In the fourth quarter, organic constant currency revenue grew 3.5%, led by continued strength in our Insurance segment. Our non-COVID-sensitive revenues, as we defined at the start of the pandemic, grew approximately 6.5% on an organic constant currency basis. 
This sustained growth in our non-COVID-sensitive revenues, representing approximately 85% of our total revenues, reflects the durability and resilience of our primarily subscription-based business model. We did continue to experience, as we have since the onset of the pandemic, a negative impact from COVID-19 on certain of our products and services, largely transactional in nature, which represents the balance or approximately 15% of our consolidated revenues. These COVID-sensitive revenues declined approximately 12.5% on an OCC basis during the fourth quarter though the performance across our 3 segments differed. 
In our Insurance segment, we continued to experience sequential improvement in these revenues as the underlying causal factors continued to abate, though the pace of recovery varies across the different solutions. 
On the Energy side, our consulting business remained under pressure from lower CapEx budgets at our customers, but trends appear to have stabilized. 
And finally, within Financial Services, our COVID-sensitive revenues took a further step down as our bank customers reduced their spending levels in response to weakness across their lending portfolios. 
Despite the impact on revenue in the fourth quarter, we are pleased to report that we delivered solid EBITDA growth and expanded margins as the result of effective expense management. OCC-adjusted EBITDA growth was 4.9% in the fourth quarter. Total adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter, which includes both organic and inorganic revenue and adjusted EBITDA, was 48.2% in the quarter, representing leverage across the business. This margin level includes roughly 220 basis points of benefit from lower travel expenses, but also reflects a return to more normal pace of headcount growth and an increase in the pace of investment in our technological transformation, including our cloud transition costs. 
On that note, let's turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis. In the fourth quarter, Insurance segment revenues increased 7.4%, reflecting healthy growth in our industry standard insurance programs, catastrophe modeling solutions, repair cost estimating solutions and insurance software solutions. Similar to the third quarter, we experienced a modest benefit from storm-related revenues as a result of a more normal storm season in 2020 as compared to the very slow season in 2019. This was offset in part by a decline in certain transactional revenues that were negatively impacted by COVID-19. 
Adjusted EBITDA grew 12.2% in the fourth quarter, demonstrating strong margin expansion despite certain revenue declines, investment in our breakout areas and our cloud transition. 
Energy and Specialized Markets revenue decreased 3.9% in the fourth quarter due to declines in consulting and implementation projects and some modest headwinds related to consolidation in the end market. We were very pleased to see continued growth in our subscription-based core research and data analytic platforms and environmental health and safety service solutions, resulting in outperformance relative to the end market. We believe our strong performance is a function of the criticality of our solutions, the diversification of our revenue streams into breakout areas like the energy transition and the strength of our relationships in the industry. 
Adjusted EBITDA declined 19.5% in the fourth quarter, reflecting a catch-up of certain compensation expenses associated with furloughed employees that are onetime in nature. 
As a key partner to our energy customers, we continue to closely monitor the operating environment with a focus on consolidation in the upstream space and the potential impact of a broader, more climate-focused political agenda in the United States. We have a track record of managing through volatile times effectively and believe we are well positioned with our energy transition practice to capitalize on the global growth in spending across zero carbon technologies like solar, wind and energy storage. 
Financial Services revenue declined 13% in the quarter, reflecting the impact of certain contract transitions as well as lower levels of project spending from our bank customers stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic and fewer bankruptcies versus 2019 as a result of government support and forbearance programs. Adjusted EBITDA declined 28.1%, reflecting the negative impact of lower sales, while margins were impacted by certain portfolio transactions we took earlier in the year. 
We continue on the journey to transition VFS to a more sustainable subscription-based business and have taken actions that we believe benefit the business in the long run, but are likely to negatively impact our growth over the next few quarters. 
Our reported effective tax rate was 18.4% for the quarter compared to 23.2% in the prior year quarter. The quarterly rate came in lower than our expectations, owing to increased levels of stock option exercise, which depend on personal employee decisions and the Verisk's stock price. Looking forward to 2021, we expect that our full year tax rate will be between 20% and 22%, though there will likely be some quarterly variability related to the pace of employee stock option exercise. 
Adjusted net income was $209 million and adjusted diluted -- I'm sorry, and diluted adjusted EPS was $1.27 for the fourth quarter 2020, up 10.8% and 12.4% from the prior year, respectively. These increases reflect solid top line growth, cost discipline in the business, a reduction in travel expenses as a result of COVID-19 and a lower average share count. 
Net cash provided by operating activities was $249 million for the quarter, up 41% from the prior year period, primarily due to increased customer collections, a reduction in income tax payments owing to higher levels of stock option exercise, the deferral of certain employer payroll taxes resulting from the CARES Act and a reduction in travel payments as a result of COVID-19. 
Capital expenditures were $72 million for the quarter and $247 million for 2020, including some onetime expenses associated with our office consolidations in Boston and London. CapEx came in at the lower end of our initial range as certain expenditures were delayed, owing to the pandemic. For the full year 2020, CapEx represented 8.9% of our total revenues. As we look to 2021, we expect CapEx to be in the range of $250 million to $280 million, reflecting our continued investment in our innovation agenda, our technological transformation and our people as well as the carryover of certain expenditures that were delayed in 2020 as a result of the pandemic. 
Related to CapEx, we expect fixed asset depreciation and amortization to be within the range of $200 million to $215 million and intangible amortization to be approximately $165 million in 2021. Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to FX variability, the timing of purchases and the completion of projects and future M&A activity. 
During the fourth quarter, we returned $94 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. As Scott mentioned, I'm pleased to report that our Board of Directors has approved a 7% increase in our cash dividend to $0.29 per share this quarter and has authorized an additional $300 million for share repurchases, bringing our total available authorization to more than $500 million. 
For the full year 2020, we generated $1.1 billion in cash flow from operating activities, an increase of 11.7% over 2019, a strong result considering the challenging operating environment. We invested this cash flow back into our business through $247 million in capital expenditures and funded $285 million in acquisitions. We also returned $176 million in capital to shareholders in dividends and an additional $349 million through share repurchases. 
As we look to 2021, our strategy to deliver long-term sustainable growth remains unchanged, and we believe the stability and predictability of our subscription revenues will persist. However, we do expect certain COVID-19-related pressures on top line growth to continue, though we expect the impact to be less than it was in 2020. We remain confident these COVID impacts do not represent a structural change in our fundamental growth drivers and believe that as the underlying causal factors abate, we will show strong resilience and recovery. 
We also have confidence in our ability to manage the cost structure effectively to protect profitability, though we would remind you that cost comparisons will be more challenging as we begin to anniversary the onset of the pandemic in the second quarter. Taking this all together, we believe that as the COVID impacts abate, we can return to our long-term growth model of 7% organic constant currency revenue growth with core operating leverage, allowing EBITDA to grow faster than revenue, although it's difficult to predict that timing. 
We hope this provides some useful context for you, and we look forward to addressing your questions. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk.

And we have definitely given a lot of attention and energy to trying to make those investments and make them productive across all parts of the portfolio. 
And so we're constantly reviewing what we're doing kind of at the segment level and at the individual solution level, and we won't stop doing that.

So first of all, let me kind of describe what we've done and what we think is rather unique. We have moved primarily to the OEM side of the equation. So think of GM, Honda, Hyundai and Ford, and we have aggregate information from those vehicles. And remember, access to those vehicles, those data, is being harvested off of newer cars, right, because the history doesn't go back to allow harvesting. So every day, we have more cars, more miles, and we are now tapped into the largest insurers, many of the largest personal auto writers, to which they are using that data to do their own modeling. It's an opt-in service, by the way. Or, more likely, they're using our score to assess the driving behavior to offer discounts, market or actually price insurance. 
So if you think about kind of the future of insurance, which I think is where you're going, the historic ring over them is driven by sex, driving behavior from the standpoint of moving violations and car accidents, age, those type of things. Clearly, understanding the driving behavior from what's happening behind the wheel is probably more accurate and more relevant.
So we think we're very well positioned. We think it will nicely integrate and does integrate with all the underwriting work we do when we talk about moving the data forward in underwriting an insurance policy, picking, selecting a risk and pricing it. 
To kind of answer your question generally, it is still a small part of our business, especially around the personal auto line of business, but we do believe it will grow. It will become the approach for rating going forward. 
Now I think your second question was a little bit about competitive advantage. We have some very unique and exclusive [indiscernible] arrangements with, a, the OEMs. But more importantly, we feel that our data hub, being at the center of those OEMs and all the insurers that we know so well and we are integrated with, creates a unique relationship where they come to us once as opposed to integrate many times. We are trying to extend that out -- that information out beyond what I'll refer to as just the car manufacturers. But I think that hopefully describes to you a little bit about what we do and how we do it, really more focused on insurance than some of these other telematic solutions that are extending beyond insurance and trying to provide to marketing and other technicals ."

You can't see me, but I have a smile on my face. Let me share a little bit about that. 
First of all, what we're doing in Life is led by that acquisition of FAST, which is this, I'll call it, low-code, no-code solution for life insurers. What we've added is a bit of relationship and some analytics to the underwriting approach. So things like understanding from your voice whether you're a smoker. Those are the type of things that we've added, and the life business in whole has done exceptionally well. We probably are not talking about it quite as much is because we'd typically focus a little bit on organic revenue growth. So I look forward to having some conversations probably the first quarter next year when we become -- or it becomes an organic part of our math. 
Separately and distinctly again, when we talk about the resurgent and the great growth that what I'll refer to as ISO or underwriting business, we've had a very stable and strong business as it relates to our historic lost cost rolls and forms. But the growth that you're seeing, in large part, is driven by this LightSpeed [ conscious set ]. It is taking a lot of data, not just our own proprietary data, but that, in combination with other third parties, scoring it so that we have a confidence level. So that, as opposed to doing, first a quote, providing that rate to a potential policyholder, they like it. And then you do all their underwriting to understand if there's any other accidents, moving violations, traffic. 
Typically, 33% of the time, that rate changes. That's very, very much -- I mean, it's very attractive to the policyholder, not the digital engagement people are looking for. So a bindable quote is really at the heart of what has driven a lot of our underwriting and rating growth over the last year. And we are doing more, and we are extending kind of -- I'll call it from an investment perspective, doubling down as we speak."

And it's certainly something that we're watching very carefully and expect to manage very actively in 2021. I think you characterized it accurately in terms of the -- we are expecting that as and if the pandemic impacts continue to abate over time, the revenue impact relative to our targeted growth rate should be more modest. So we're certainly hoping for an improvement in that regard. 
However, as you saw in our expense management in 2020 -- and not just including the T&E expense, which, as we mentioned, represented about a 220 basis point benefit to our margin, but also our management of headcount levels, incentive compensation levels in the fourth quarter and over the course of 2020, reflected an ability to manage that expense impact. 
Now, naturally, as we move into a -- what is hopefully a more constructive environment, we will want to normalize the earnings level -- normalize the headcount level for the business to pursue the very attractive opportunities that we have with our clients. We have control, both over the level of, certainly, headcount that we are taking on and T&E. And our objective will be to manage that in a way where we hold on to as much of the benefit that we experienced in 2020 as we can. But we are expecting that on year-over-year, particularly as we anniversary the onset of the pandemic, that we will see an uptick.
But we -- overall, we'll try to manage that in a way where we preserve our operating leverage, and that becomes clearer as we talk about it through the course of the year."

Within Wood Mackenzie, the things that we would point out is that we saw modest but positive growth in the subscription side of the business. And so that, I think, is a reflection of the durability and the value of those products even in this more challenging environment. And so it also, I think, is reflective of the value of the investment that we've made in Lens because that subscription component, and particularly the pricing on renewals, has benefited from our clients' receptivity to what Lens provides them. So I think that's the core positive and of particular note in a challenging environment for the industry, where the end market, I think, has had a different experience. 
On the consulting side, that's where, on a year-over-year basis in reported revenues, we are still seeing that 30% year-over-year decline within that business. However, our sense is that our clients are engaging more actively on the consulting dialogue, and we feel better about where the pipeline is headed in that area. So that is -- has not been demonstrated the financial impact yet, but we feel a little bit better about the level of engagement with clients. 
And then within PowerAdvocate, we are experiencing some pressure, particularly on the implementation side of the equation for our clients. We've had some of our clients that, experiencing the pressure of this environment, have pulled back or reduced. But we still see strong demand over the near term for the cost management, supply chain dimensions of that product set as a whole. And I don't want to overlook also our health and safety business, which continues to contribute strong revenue growth within this segment as a whole as well as strong EBITDA growth and operating leverage within that business. So that gives you, I think, the 3 primary areas within that segment and some of the elements of the growth for that."

But when we think about the expenses, we want to kind of remove the inorganic component so that we understand the trends. And I think simplistically, while our overall revenue growth rate was in kind of the 3.5% level, we were able to reduce overall expenses on a year-over-year basis as a function of headcount control and T&E. And so our frame of mind is as we're looking at the organic growth of the business, that we were able to make that adjustment in expenses downward, which allowed us to deliver the strong EBITDA growth performance, even despite that decline in the revenue growth. 
As we look ahead to 2020, we are expecting a higher level of growth if these trends continue with regard to the pandemic. And as a consequence, from an expense standpoint, we are expecting a higher growth rate. We're not expecting expenses to decline. And so the year-over-year comparisons are higher. But we're going to try to manage those in a way where we preserve that operating leverage and hold on to as much of that benefit as we practically can while still pursuing our client events. 
I know that doesn't put that in the context that you're asking, but it's kind of, I think, the best way to think about the overall performance of trends absent the naturally, the impact from an M&A standpoint.

So it is a -- and while you were referring to it kind of in aggregate as a transactional business, we're really talking about probably a dozen to 20 individual products that have various transactional elements, everything from the consulting business at Wood Mackenzie, some of the consulting and the analytics projects in Financial Services, the claims business with auto claims that are driven by it. So you have a lot of different factors. And so if you can think about it over time, and if I describe it in 2020, we had some businesses that demonstrated, as the year progressed, a pickup in driving activity. 
And so when we talked about the improved performance within Insurance on our COVID-sensitive revenues, it was reflecting an earlier impact in benefit from the uptick in driving and driving activity and those -- that portion of that transactional business. While the consulting revenue on the energy side, which is not going to be tied as directly to a causal impact, is going to improve over a longer period. 
And in Financial Services, we were seeing a dynamic where the weakness in the fourth quarter reflected an increasing -- what we interpreted as increasing concern over potential credit losses, which caused them to pull back on some of their project analytics in the fourth quarter, where we typically see stronger elements. 
So to try to get to your -- to give you an answer is that as we look across all of these products, as we proceed through 2021, as things improve, we'll see -- we should see gradual improvements, but at different rates within each of those businesses. So there's no simple answer because it involves multiple products with differing levels of impact across that.

Thanks for joining us for our second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. I'm pleased to share that Verisk delivered a strong second quarter result.

I'm pleased to share that Verisk delivered a strong second quarter result. The strength of our business model has been on full display since the start of the pandemic and continues in the recovery. We delivered solid top line and profit growth in every quarter last year despite the weak economic environment and operating challenges from lockdowns because of the consistent and durable growth in our subscription-based businesses. As expected, we are now fully participating in the recovery as our transactional businesses are showing strong resilience and rebounding with the rollout of vaccines and global economies opening up.
To be more specific, in the second quarter, Verisk delivered organic constant currency revenue growth of 6.3%, comprised of growth of 5.5% and are mostly subscription-based non-COVID-sensitive revenues, and growth of 12.1% in our mostly transactional COVID-sensitive revenues. In fact, certain of our transactional businesses have already returned to pre-COVID levels. We have confidence this general trend can continue and believe that as the COVID impacts fully abate we can return to delivering financial results in line with our long-term model. Lee will provide more details in his financial review.
These results were delivered through the hard work, dedication and consistent focus on our customers by our 9,000 employees around the globe. In many parts of the world, we've already begun welcoming our employees back to our offices, with a plan guided by our mission of protecting the health and well-being of our team members and in line with directives from local governments and public health officials. While our Global Protection Services team is keeping a close eye on developments with the delta variant, our teams are energized to work together in person again. In fact, Currently, more than half of our global offices are operating in a Phase 2 or 3 format. Across the U.S., we have plans to return to full use of our offices in September, unless circumstances change considerably.
We have implemented a return to office policy of [indiscernible] with customers and [indiscernible] This approach, which incorporates the best learnings from the pandemic, balances individual flexibility with the collaboration and creativity that stems from working together in person. We also believe that this flexible working policy will help to retain and attract the very best talent as we continue to grow in what is a very competitive hiring environment. Not only are we returning to office, we are also beginning to have certain in-person meetings with our customers, including on-site training and sales opportunities.
Given how effectively we've worked in a fully remote format, we have confidence that this return to office policy is the optimal design. Our computing and network capacity have consistently and comfortably exceeded what we require, and our teams have adjusted to using all the virtual collaboration tools we have implemented enterprise-wide.
On the topic of technology, we continue to make great strides on our efforts to modernize and optimize our technology platforms to always be best in class. As of today, we have effectively and seamlessly moved most of our applications off the mainframe. This has been a huge undertaking and is a great example of true collaboration and partnership between our IT teams and business units around the globe. In total, we currently have thousands of solutions running native in the cloud, including those that were moved from prior on-premise environments and those built native to the cloud. We are advancing our cloud-first strategy and currently have more than half of our compute environment running in the cloud.
The migration to the cloud is a multifaceted multistage project, and we are pacing this transition in lockstep with our customers to ensure that we are always delivering on their highest expectations. In addition, as we advance on this journey, the process is ever improving, and we are seeing real benefits in terms of pace of innovation, resiliency, security and compliance. Our ability to introduce new products and release updates to existing products in a quick and efficient manner is vastly improved because of our shift to the cloud. We are also able to onboard new customers and enter new geographies faster and with reduced capital intensity.
For example, we've successfully deployed our new cloud-based visualized ISO ClaimSearch platform to our P&C insurance customers. This modernized version of our industry-leading ClaimSearch platform provides a more engaging experience for thousands of claim adjusters and investigators and allows us to offer new features, functionality and solutions quickly and easily to customers through this platform.
In addition, our new insurance digital media contributory database will take advantage of the flexibility and efficiencies of cloud technology to process, store and analyze claim-related digital images from more than 160 insurers. Initially, we expect to receive over 8 million digital media files per week as this new offering ramps up to help insurers better detect potential fraud and increase settlement fee for meritorious claims. The cloud is also advancing our sales process as we can offer customers an easy and cost-beneficial way to pilot or trial new solutions that was previously much more cumbersome in Verisk's prior on-premise format. This allows customers to truly see in action the value of our solutions. Our sales team can then focus on converting those customers to long-term subscriptions.
The cloud has also made our solutions more resilient with less downtime as the duration of maintenance windows are greatly reduced. We no longer must take our cloud-native solutions off-line to do things like update or release new features or protect them with the latest security patches and protocols. We have also constructed a cloud security program that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to continuously monitor our entire environment, making us more secure and able to audit our entire process for full accountability.
And finally, the cloud makes it easier to keep applications and data that are running in local geographies to adhere to the increasing nuances of regulatory and compliance requirements that are geographically specific. As our business expands globally, this becomes an increasing benefit of cloud.
From a capital perspective, our cloud migration has reduced our ongoing need to spend on third-party hardware and software. We are reallocating those savings towards internal innovation and spending more on growth CapEx. We are leaning into our highest growth, highest return on invested capital organic opportunities across insurance and energy. 
Within Insurance, we have seen great success with the development of the LightSpeed platform. This organically developed data-forward platform has automated and improved the underwriting process for our customers and is driving strong top line growth within our ISO business as we have extended it across personal and commercial lines.
Specific to Commercial Lines, we've seen continued success in small commercial for business owners and commercial auto. With Lightspeed, we have augmented our AI and machine learning capabilities, introducing image analytics that will help present a holistic view of risk at the point of quote and ensure that small business owners get the coverage they need. We've also expanded our entity resolution and benchmarking data and analytics to help our diverse client base scale and increase their speed to market.
We are also accelerating our customers' journey towards 0 application questions, helping drive speed and efficiency. With over 80 traditional and insurtech customers leveraging Lightspeed commercial, we are enabling the industry to free up underwriting talent to focus on more complex risks and helping our customers become the carrier or managing general agent of choice in this fast-moving and profitable space.
Within energy, our internally developed cloud-based Lens platform is transforming the way customers interact with Mackenzie data as we are integrating our complex data sets seamlessly into their workflows. We have greatly reduced our research cycle times from days to hours, allowing us to commercialize solutions more quickly and update data in existing solutions more frequently. This empowers our customers with the data necessary to make timely and well-informed decisions about commodity markets around the globe. We are seeing strong value-based price realization and revenue growth, resulting in solid returns on capital for this platform.
The capital management discipline is also evidenced in our acquisition strategy. While interest and valuations for data analytic assets are high, we've been very selective and focused our attention only on assets where we can create incremental value by combining data sets for new solutions, leveraging our infrastructure or improving sales and distribution through our strong customer relationships and industry scale. Our recent acquisition of FAST is a great example of how we are leveraging our relationships across the industry to accelerate the adoption of FAST software, driving strong returns on invested capital.
On the engagement front, even in a mostly virtual mode, we continue to get ever closer to our customers. This engagement starts with the C-suite and runs through all levels of the organization. This is evidenced by increasing frequency of meetings, better attendance at our virtual events and increasing interest from customers to work with us as development partners. In fact, we recently announced 2 key development partners for our Lens Power solution, namely Vestas and Quinbrook. It has also translated into building sales pipelines and more sales opportunities. And we're having great success converting these sales opportunities into new contracts as we benefit from our ability to bundle our broad offerings to meet our customers' unique needs. This is particularly evident with our fastest-growing customer segment in insurtech.
On the innovation front, we recently launched the Cyber Risk Navigator, our cyber loss modeling application. This release represented a year-long effort to redevelop the platform from an on-premise solution to cloud-native SaaS solution. Given the scalability of the cloud, clients are now able to run analyses in minutes that used to take hours. It also provides us the ability to bring new features and model updates to the market quickly, rather than being tied to annual software releases, which is essential for a rapidly changing risk such as cyber. 
We also made great strides in advancing our offerings in the telematics space with the introduction of the DrivingDNA Score. This enhanced solution is powered by the unique data from Verisk Data Exchange that includes 260 billion miles and growing of robust driving behavior data from 8 million connected car drivers. The DrivingDNA Score enables our customers to enter and expand to the rapidly growing usage-based insurance market and is another key addition to our whole suite of telematics solutions.
Finally, I'm excited to share about the progress Verisk has made on our environmental stewardship commitments. We recently completed our 2020 greenhouse gas emissions inventory. And I'm pleased to report that, for the fourth straight year, we balanced 100% of Verisk's reported Scope 1, 2 and 3, including business air travel emissions, through a combination of purposeful reduction initiatives and investments in renewable energy certificates and carbon offsets. We remain focused on implementing meaningful physical and operational changes that will reduce our greenhouse gas emissions over the long term. Those include the consolidation of multiple Verisk offices in Boston and London into new energy-efficient business centers as well as the continuing strategic realignment of our data management activities to take advantage of the major efficiencies presented by cloud computing. Building on the progress we've already achieved to date, I'm also pleased to share that Verisk has committed to an absolute 21% reduction in our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 2024 compared with the 2019 baseline.
In developing the targets, Verisk collaborated with Ecometrika, an accomplished leader in the field of sustainability metrics, software and services. The resulting targets incorporate the latest science-based targets guidance aligned with the 1.5-degree Celsius global future. I look forward to updating you on our progress as we remain committed to addressing the very real impacts of climate change today and for the benefit of future generations.
I have great confidence that our focus on innovation and serving our customers will help us deliver on our long-term growth objectives, creating lasting shareholder value. As our business recovers from the short-term impacts of the pandemic, we continue to actively study the signs of resilience across the different parts of our company. Our dynamic capital process is designed to ensure that our capital is deployed into the highest-growth and highest-return opportunities.
With that, let me turn the call over to Lee to cover our financial results."

First, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we have posted a quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website.Moving to the financial results for the quarter. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue grew",1599,"Thank you, Scott. First, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we have posted a quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website.
Moving to the financial results for the quarter. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue grew 10.1% to $748 million. Net income attributable to Verisk decreased 14% to $154 million, while diluted GAAP earnings per share attributable to Verisk declined 13% to $0.94 per share. These declines are the result of a noncash revaluation charge related to the U.K. tax law change. Adjusting for the impact of the $0.21 per share noncash revaluation charge, diluted adjusted EPS increased 7% to $1.38.
Moving to our organic constant currency results. Adjusted for nonoperating items, as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, we were very pleased with our operating results, led by consistent growth in our subscription revenues and a recovery in our transactional revenues as our business rebounds from the COVID-related declines from last year. In the second quarter, organic constant currency revenue grew 6.3%, led by continued strength in our Insurance segment and sequential improvement in our Energy and Financial Services segment. Our non-COVID-sensitive revenues, as we defined at the beginning of the pandemic, increased 5.5% in the second quarter of 2021 as compared to the growth of 6.5% in the prior year quarter. This stable growth in our non-COVID-sensitive revenues, representing approximately 85% of our total revenues, reflects the durability and resilience of our primarily subscription model.
Our COVID-sensitive revenues, which represent 15% of our consolidated revenues, continued on a sequential improvement trend and returned to growth this quarter, increasing 12.1%. This compares to declines of 20% in the second quarter last year and the prior quarter performance of declines of 5.9%. Growth was primarily the result of improvements in consulting in our Energy segment and a return to pre-pandemic growth rates in many of our products and services within Insurance, particularly within the U.S. We did experience continued COVID-related weakness in our Financial Services segment as government forbearance programs are negatively impacting bankruptcy volumes.
Organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth was 4.2% in the second quarter, led by solid growth in Insurance and Energy, offset in part by weakness in Financial Services. Total adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter, which includes both organic and inorganic revenue and adjusted EBITDA, was 49.6% in the quarter, down 172 basis points on a year-over-year basis, but still above our pre-pandemic margin level of 46.6% recorded in the second quarter of 2019. Much of the decline is associated with the normalization of our costs as we anniversary the COVID benefits from last year, including reduced head count growth and lower incentive compensation. This margin also reflects an increase in the pace of investment in our technological transformation, including our cloud transition costs and the impact of acquisitions.
On that note, let's turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis. In the second quarter, Insurance segment revenues increased 7.8%, demonstrating strong resilience and recovery. We saw healthy growth in our industry standard insurance programs, catastrophe modeling solutions, repair cost estimating solutions and international insurance software solutions. We also experienced strong growth in transactional revenues, associated with an increased level of securitization revenues in our catastrophe modeling business, a modest benefit from storm-related revenue and double-digit recovery growth in our COVID-impacted revenues as we compare against declines last year. Adjusted EBITDA grew 6.6% in the second quarter while margins declined 148 basis points, reflecting a return to a normalized rate of head count growth compared to the prior year and higher year-over-year short-term incentive compensation expense. We also continue to invest in our breakout areas as well as our technology modernization, including our cloud transition.
Energy and Specialized Markets revenue increased 5% in the second quarter due to a recovery in our consulting and project-based revenues across Energy and Power, strong growth in environmental health and safety solutions and our energy transition research. Included in the quarter was revenue associated with the strategic consulting project that added approximately 1 point to segment growth. We continue to benefit from strong adoption of our Lens platform as customers are seeing the value of our integrated cloud-based data analytic environment. We remain a key part of our customers' most strategic conversations as they deal with the ever-changing energy landscape and our broad base of solutions across all commodities are mission-critical to our customers as they navigate through this dynamic environment. Adjusted EBITDA grew 8.4% in the second quarter, while margins expanded 74 basis points, reflecting continued cost discipline and leverage from sales growth. As we look to the remainder of 2021, we want to remind you that we have a very tough margin comparison in the third quarter associated with some head count reductions, furloughs and compensation adjustments that we made in reaction to the tough operating environment in 2020. However, some of these costs were reversed in the fourth quarter of 2020. All that said, we have a solid track record of managing through volatile times effectively and believe we are well positioned with our energy transition [indiscernible] our Lens platform to continue to outperform the market and help our customers navigate this broad energy transition. 
Financial Services revenue declined 8.1% in the quarter, reflecting the continued impact of contract transitions that we undertook in 2020 and will continue through the third quarter of 2021 as well as a lower level of bankruptcy revenue because of government support and forbearance program. 
Spend in analytics demonstrated stronger growth than expected as spending and advertising improved, which enabled us to reduce some of the negative impact on revenue growth from the contract transitions that we originally anticipated. Adjusted EBITDA declined 77% in the quarter, reflecting the negative impact of lower sales and a larger impact of corporate expense allocations on the segment's smaller base. We continue to believe that the actions we have taken with VFS over the last few years are setting the business on a stronger foundation from which to grow going forward.
Our reported effective tax rate was 35.6% compared to 20.4% in the prior year quarter. This higher tax rate is the result of an earlier-than-anticipated enactment of a U.K. tax law change that caused a noncash revaluation charge. This is simply a timing difference from our original expectations as the impact occurred in the second quarter instead of the third quarter as we had originally forecast. There is no change to full year results. Given the earlier timing of the tax law change and the fact that this charge was onetime in nature, we now expect our tax rate to approximate 20% to 22% for the second half of 2021. 
Adjusted net income was $191 million, and diluted adjusted EPS was $1.17 for the second quarter 2021. And adjusting for the impact of a $0.21 per share noncash revaluation charge related to the U.K. tax law change described earlier, diluted adjusted EPS increased 7% to $1.38. These increases reflect organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions and a lower average share count. Net cash provided by operating activities was $233 million for the quarter, down 6.5% from the prior year period. The prior year period cash flow benefited from a deferral in both federal income tax payments and certain employer payroll taxes as a result of the CARES Act, partly offset by earn-out payments. Year-to-date, net cash provided by operating activities was $682 million, reflecting growth of 11.4% versus the prior year period. Capital expenditures were $62.5 million for the quarter, up 10.2%. We continue to believe that CapEx will be in the range of $250 million to $280 million, reflecting our continued investment in our innovation agenda, our technological transformation as well as the carryover of certain expenditures that were delayed in 2020 as a result of the pandemic.
Related to CapEx, we expect fixed asset depreciation and amortization will be within the range of $200 million to $215 million and intangible amortization to be approximately $180 million, reflecting the impact of recent acquisitions and changes in foreign currency rates. Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to FX variability, the timing of purchases and the completion of projects and future M&A activity.
During the second quarter, we returned $197 million in capital to shareholders  through share repurchases and dividends as our strong cash flow allows us to invest behind our highest-return growth initiatives, but also return capital to shareholders consistently. Our strategy to deliver long-term and sustainable growth remains unchanged. We are encouraged by the recovery we are experiencing in our COVID-impacted businesses, and we believe the stability and predictability of our subscription revenues will persist. We also have confidence in our ability to manage the cost structure effectively to protect profitability. While we do have tough cost comparisons this year, we believe that we should retain some of the margin expansion we experienced in 2020, delivering margins ahead of our 2019 level of 47%.
Taking this all together, we believe that as the COVID impacts abate and the global economies continue to open up, we can return to our long-term growth model of 7% organic constant currency revenue growth, with core operating leverage allowing EBITDA to grow faster than revenue, although it is difficult to determine that -- to predict that timing.
We hope this provides some useful context for you, and we look forward to addressing your questions. We continue to appreciate all of the support and interest in Verisk. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions."

Scott here. Thanks for the question. Two things.

So it's not the case that in our -- in the pricing algorithm is a term which is significant, and that relates to the amount of premium that our customers are putting through their own books of business. Our solutions are priced according to the amount of profitability and growth that they generate for our customers. And every CEO that I speak to in the insurance industry, every one of them to a person considers their business -- to grow the business. And so they are leaning into new methods as a way of trying to grow their -- to grow their businesses. And we expect that to persist.
And it's always been the case actually that in our Insurance business we have grown considerably faster than the underlying product marketplace. And actually, that's true to the energy vertical as well. And why? Because our customers are trying to make increasing use of data analytics solutions. So we're not really yoked to the net written premium volumes in the insurance industry."

There are -- in every one of the verticals we serve, there's a fill in the blank tech, insurtech, fintech, energy tech. There's a list of players like that as long as both of your arms.
Our customers expect us to be providing innovation. That is one of the reasons why they lean into the relationship with us in the first place. So I think the nature of your question, Gary, was like this investment into that solution and what is the effect of that in terms of our growth. We pay attention to that. It would probably surprise you to know the relatively modest size of investment opportunities that all the way to the office of the CEO we're looking at because it's the lifeblood of our business.
And so we do -- we are resolving things down to the level of the individual solution, and we pay attention to how they're doing. And we make decisions about should we put more in because it looks very promising, should we pull back from it because it appears not to be gaining steam. We're doing that all the time. That is what we do on a moment-to-moment basis.
But when you talk about vitality, you really -- you have to take it holistically. Because as we said earlier in this call, by count of corporate entity, in the insurance industry, the most rapidly growing segment are the insuretechs, the new players. And I take such comfort in the fact that they show up with a clean sheet of paper. And they're rethinking everything. How are we going to build an insurance business?
And they seem so consistently to want to standardize on all of our solutions. That's vitality. Now they're adopting solutions that we -- in some cases, that we created years ago. But they're buying into them because they remain right at the leading edge. I mean, they're very insistent that everything be cloud-native, tech-forward. They just -- they're not even going to look at you if you're not that way. So I would just encourage you to understand vitality means a lot of things. It means the infusion of value into a solution that has been around for a long period of time as well as the new solution. It's new customers as well as existing customers.
But there's no question, if you pop all the way to the top of the organization and ask the question, look at that top line rate of organic revenue growth. One of the most powerful things that drives our growth is the adoption of solutions, whether it's a new solution by an existing customer or an existing but enhanced solution by a new customer. And the investing that we do in innovation is in support of all that. Mark, do you want to add something?"

And so I think some of that, there is a structural change. 
I also think over the longer term, as we adopt or adapt to the flexible work structure that Scott described in his comments that it will provide opportunities for us from a productivity, from a real estate cost standpoint to reduce some of those expenses over time. But of course, that follows kind of the lease -- the lease renewal process. But those will be things that we're able to achieve over time as well.
And then finally, the other element is compensation, and that is more directly tied to our overall performance against the growth targets and overall head count growth. And I think that will -- that's the element that is likely and we'll certainly hope is going to normalize consistent with the achievement of our revenue growth and our EBITDA growth."

And I don't see any change in that.
When you describe it that way, kind of stable normal environments are, all else equal, supportive. And you would have to expect over long periods of time, if you look at the marketplaces that we serve, they're very important elements of the economy. So a thesis which is they will remain important is a pretty sound one. And then actually, the demography of the customer sets inside of these verticals, they don't really change all that rapidly. Of course, we're always paying attention to that, but they don't tend to -- so you've got that as the background.
But there is no question that there is a huge dependence upon execution. The whole innovation agenda has to be done well. We have to dig in with our customers as development partners to make sure that we hit what's needed, that we get it to market faster. All of those things have a lot to do with returns on any given innovation investment that we've made. So that's very important.
And another thing, which -- I don't know, I suppose if you watch us really carefully over a long period of time, this would be evident, but I just want to highlight that there is a great deal of dynamic inside of what we're doing in terms of looking at the solution families and the solution sets that we've got and deciding where are they and where are they headed. And we have a very long track record. I'll just -- I'll pick the insurance vertical since it's the largest one for us. Investing more inside of things that are showing a lot of promise, but retiring in some cases, selling off solution sets that we have as well. And so it can all look -- it's kind of like the duck on top of the lake. It looks very steady, but underneath there's various paddling going on. And we get down to the level of individual solutions. Again, just using insurance as an example, through the years, we've retired a number of things that we were doing. We invented a whole lot of things. All of that is inside of getting to this long-term view of growth potential."

But that business, as we have seen and demonstrated, particularly with the Lens platform, the investment in the energy transition practice, has demonstrated their potential to move to similar levels of growth. And Financial Services has been undergoing a transition to a more focus on sustainable growth, reducing some of that volatility.

I think the important thing to emphasize here is that we believe that one of the strongest elements that we have, the strongest opportunities that we have to create value is investing internally within the business, as Scott has described, in the technology, in the data sets, in new services for our clients. And so we want to make certain that we are taking every advantage to where we think we can generate incremental growth, where we can generate high incremental returns on capital from that. So we start from the position of how much capital do we have available that we're generating from the business. What are our opportunities first to invest in the business in a way that takes advantage of those opportunities to generate growth and returns? Secondly, are there opportunities that we see in the M&A market to invest in businesses that we can create value by meaningfully improving their revenue growth through our distribution, utilizing their data sets more effectively or improving their technology? And FAST, as we've described, this has been a great example of that. Genscape in our energy business has been additive, has generated attractive returns on capital for us. So that's the second use.
And then the decision on share repurchases is really an outcome of capital do we have that we don't have an opportunity, we don't see an opportunity to invest to contribute to growth or returns on capital. So it is an outcome of our capital allocation process, not something that we target at the outset. So kind of taking your question, if we don't see those opportunities, if the M&A market doesn't present opportunities for us given where valuations are or the nature of the business to create value, then we would expect that excess capital to be returned either through the dividend or through increased share repurchases, but it will all be driven by that investment opportunity and our discipline."

So let me try to maybe provide some parameters. The way we're going about this is we really believe that insurer, in their search for the best experience to the customer, the digital engagement, they want information that's actionable and they can kind of have a bindable quote, meaning when you go online and you want to get a price, you don't want it to change. And basically, 33% or 40% of the cases, that price changes if you say I'm interested. And they do all this underwriting and pull the information. we're bringing all that information forward and the combination of data we have and analytics so that insurer has confidence to quote. And that's a big change. So that is noteworthy and important.
And what we've tried to do in kind of thinking about the opportunity here, we know who's providing that information. And we feel it's about $1 billion that's going to be type of market opportunity in the insurance space. So we simply have a lot of runway, especially on the personal line side.

There are several elements to it. And I know that you're asking it was in the context of cost, which I'll address. But I also want to make sure that there's an appreciation that there is a CapEx element of this. And",538,"Yes. Thank you, Jeff, for the question. There are several elements to it. And I know that you're asking it was in the context of cost, which I'll address. But I also want to make sure that there's an appreciation that there is a CapEx element of this. And then there is also the productivity element to this transition.
First, on the cost, you are taking on an additional cloud capacity from the provider before you are eliminating some of that legacy. So you have kind of a redundant period. In addition, you were taking on recoding expense for the applications as you migrate them into that new environment. And so as we have been implementing this process across hundreds of applications in our various businesses, you have that upfront cost that is -- has a negative cost impact, which we view as an investment. And we look at it on individual project-by-project basis. Our technology team does a great job tracking the specific costs and the savings, but think of this as rolling across the organization. And for the first year and second year, we are still in a net investment mode from a cost perspective within the business.
CapEx will be more limited going forward, so you will be extracting CapEx savings over time because the CapEx intensity of our technology footprint is declining, but that's something that's achieved over time. And we're beginning to experience that in this second year of the project, but that will continue naturally into the third year and beyond. And so if we think about OpEx and CapEx, we're still in a net investment mode in the second year. We would expect that in the third year that turns into a positive contribution.
Now the other thing to factor in is that, as Scott described on the CapEx front, that is -- it will enable us -- and this is also true on the OpEx front, to shift some of that OpEx into other investment areas. So when I've talked about margin in the past, I've described there is natural operating margin expansion on a pre-investment level, but then we consume a portion of that from an investment perspective, and that's where we generate incremental growth and returns. So we do believe that this will be additive going into the third year, and then we'll determine do we see investment opportunities to pursue that.
Beyond and riding on top of all of that is, I think, the more material benefit of this, which is the pace of innovation, the ability to associate more data sets to populate platforms that are creating a broader lift, I think, within the business and is sensed by, I think, a number of the questions in terms of its impact on our overall growth. So I wanted to give you kind of a comprehensive sense of the way that we are thinking about it.
And because of that complexity, I think it would be very limiting to kind of specifically just focus on the cost element of it. Yes, there will be cost benefits, but those have to be -- will be balanced by our investment decisions and then the broader impact from the transition."

And it does have some discrete elements associated with them. Just to call out a few of them, there will come a moment where we're no longer computing on mainframe. We're not fully at that point yet, but there -- I mean, we will have an event where we'll get out the sledgehammers and literally break up the cores inside the mainframe. And that -- we're already reducing the load on the mainframe, and we can find some ways to benefit from that. We run power data centers, 2 of them, in the United States. We will close them at some point. There are fixed costs associated with data centers. And so that will be an event, and we'll call out those events for you when we get to those.
And then something else, which I think is really extremely important, is that you used to buy compute capacity in relatively large chunks. And then as we move more towards the server environment, the chunks got smaller, but you're still buying chunks. In a world like that, anybody who's writing an algorithm, anybody who is demanding compute power, for them, you've already bought the capacity within limits. And so incrementally, it doesn't cost you anything. And in a world like that, you can actually be a little bit -- I don't want to use the word sloppy, but you can essentially use more compute capacity in how you want to get to the answer you're trying to get to. And maybe you don't have to cash that analysis you just did quite as much or you don't have to summarize at the column and row level once and then work through those derivatives, et cetera. My point here being that there should be an interaction between how you analyze for -- how you compute in the context of this and the way that you consume computing capacity. And in a very [indiscernible] we have to pay more attention to that than you used to. And so our development and analytics are responding and need to respond to that. But on the other side of the transition [indiscernible] differently about literally what do you encode before so that you can be efficient in your use of compute capacity. So what I'm saying is there's a multiyear thing here. But on the other side, it is actually very different than where you were into this transition. You don't run physical facilities. You don't run really large hardware and you think very differently about how you structure analysis. And that will just be a more -- that's a better world for a company like ours."

And it's mostly about digital workflows, et cetera. We see this all the time. And so we do pay attention to it.
I would just say also that there are a lot of reasons why our customers lean into a relationship with us. Some of it has to do with the breadth of our family of solutions. Some of it has to do with our proven track record. Some of it has to do with reliability. And customers really care about that when you're talking about an enterprise-level application. There are a lot of reasons. And we're powered by really, really strong content assets. And a lot of the fill in the blank tech start-ups, they don't start with content. So we never walk around feeling overly confident. We're very aware of these developments, but we do feel as if we start out in a very strong place in this discussion. And we like talking to these fill in the blank techs. And they like talking to us. So if there's some place where 1 plus 1 can be greater than 2, we're very alert to that."

So I would say that we are -- when we look at our COVID-sensitive revenues across the business as a whole, we're looking at it business by business. And so we are seeing some recovery, stronger recovery in certain areas, for instance, on the property side. We've seen in the insurance front probably the strongest recovery. Some recovery in driving, although driving is -- would not be what we would describe as fully recovered at this point.
In Energy and Specialized Markets, we are seeing a strong rebound in consulting revenues, so that is demonstrating relatively robust recovery. We're also seeing some strengthening in our new subscriptions, which will flow in over time, I think, reflecting some of the improved pricing dynamics. Whereas in DFS, there is an element, which I refer to our spend-informed analytics, which because of advertising and marketing, we have seen an uplift. And that's performing better than we expected, but the bankruptcy element of our business is still experiencing the challenges of all of the government support out there in the environment. And so that's yet to recover.
It becomes very difficult to kind of quantify how far -- how much of a recovery. I would say it's certainly a partial recovery, not a full recovery, but the trends that we see, we expect to see continuing improvement in that recovery for the business. It's probably worth noting in our insurance -- in the Insurance and in the Energy and Specialized Markets business, our COVID-sensitive revenues were up 20% year-over-year. Financial Services are still seeing a year-over-year decline, even though we've seen an improvement in spend-informed analytics and a deterioration -- or not a deterioration, but kind of the same level of declines on the bankruptcy side. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of texture across the business for some of the trends that we're seeing. 
I would also note, naturally, it should come as no surprise, that our travel business internationally is still suffering significantly from very low international travel. And so that's an important component."

Thanks for asking that question as a follow-up in that regard. So I think it is a good distinction to make that the consulting element is where we are seeing that recovery on the COVID-sensitive side and focusing on the subscription side of the business, and I kind of want to build on my earlier comments, the impact of Lens, which has been very positively received by a lot of our clients, has been generating significant contract renewals with price increases in the mid- to high single digits.
Now there are 2 elements to that in terms of its ongoing impact. One is going to be the rolling impact of that as subscriptions become -- come up for renewal. And the second element of that is that then, again, that subscription is something that will phase in over time given the nature of that. But the important point from my perspective is that we are seeing a very positive uptake. Clients are working with Lens. We've gotten several operational assessments. They've been very positive. And we've been able to achieve those price increases. So that will be based upon our feedback so far, a slow rolling but an improvement to the growth in that business, even before we also begin to utilize that platform to expand that customer set and the applications.
We also are still experiencing some impact from the last cycle, loss of 1 client in the energy space and some consolidation in the upstream area that is having a near-term impact on the research component. So that's another element that's factoring into it. But I think the distinction that you made is relevant. Hopefully, that differentiates that near-term consulting boost against what we see as constructive longer-term trends from Lens and the pricing experience that we've had and how that should flow through over time within the business."

And one thing I would first emphasize is that they have been very focused on trying to integrate the data sets that we have from the various businesses and move from a more compartmentalized approach to the business to a focus on our broader client objectives. And in fact, Lisa has implemented some organizational changes that support that approach and focus from the business, which we think moves that to a more effectively integrated platform for our businesses. And we have also taken the steps structurally to move that business from a more consulting-oriented revenue base to more sustainable growth. And we are seeing that from a new business signing and pipeline perspective in the way that we are bringing on new business and how we're structuring it and the types of business.
To your question, one thing that's important to emphasize is that Verisk's Financial Services, in many ways, has been an intellectual capital engine for much of the rest of the business. A lot of what they have learned in dealing with very large data sets and integrating them, managing them, data architecture elements have been exported to the rest of the business. Many of the data scientists, including our CTO, Nick Daffan, our Chief Analytics Officer, have come from that background and are -- we're drawing from their expertise. So there are other elements of the -- of what they've contributed to Verisk has been helpful. We are pulling from some of those externalized elements in a variety of ways analytically to develop new products, the replatforming of Argus 2.0 is an example of where we've been able to draw from some of that external expertise. So I think there is a good dialogue across the 2 entities. And we also look for interactions between the credit dimensions that Verisk Financial Services have and some of the insurance elements of our business to inform and generate new opportunities."

So just to expand on that answer just a hair, so if you look at sort of over -- I'd say, over the course of the decade, you go back a decade ago, it was either -- basically, what we were doing was going to market either through our own platforms or our solutions were operating more as point solutions and most of the integration was occurring customer by customer. They were doing their own integration.
So now that's where it's where we are today and where we're headed into the future. We are more platforms than we were, significantly more platform than we were. And that is constructive inside of the growth of our business now and into the future. And if you actually look at the pattern of investment, what are we spending money on, a great deal of it and a lot more than it used to be, is on developing software, which you should hear us building our own platforms.
But when we strike a relationship with a third party that is itself providing a platform. It's -- we're analyzing that in the context of, well, okay, we could go direct the customer through the integration themselves. But basically, that third-party platform that isn't ours is substituting for the customer's own integration efforts, but not in a way that it impacts the underlying value of what it is that we provide, which is being integrated and over there.

Element is naturally the impact from COVID on the business on our COVID-sensitive revenues, which clearly had an impact on spend informed activity, bankruptcy activity and even some of the bank consulting revenue.
And so when we are evaluating, and we are constantly evaluating what we do with all of our businesses and what are our options to optimize the value of that, the right time frame that we think is to look at what's the structural transitions and the impact from COVID. And so certainly, 2022 should be what we believe is a much more normalized level from a revenue, revenue growth and from a margin perspective that informs our view of the more normal operating state of the business as well as a sense of how the structural changes that we have implemented and the operating changes will demonstrate their impact more clearly in terms of growth at a top line and an EBITDA level.

So in that situation, when we look at the rapidly changing landscape within power, I think it's important, Manav, to understand kind of a legacy perception of where Wood Mackenzie was from an oil and gas market resource asset pricing orientation and their expertise and where they have evolved and where they -- their potential to continue to evolve in an environment where the energy transition from carbon-based to alternative tools and all of the capital decision, investment decision, expense decisions that this client base investors are addressing is we are incredibly well positioned. And Lens is the platform that puts us in the space to be able to capture the rapid growth in data sets and analytics for that business. We're already seeing it, as I indicated, in terms of the pricing on the legacy product. We're seeing it in the growth in our energy transition revenues, both on a consulting and subscription basis within chemicals. You saw an acquisition in metals and mining, which have increasing relevance given the importance of battery raw materials.
And so we view Wood Mackenzie and PowerAdvocate, our primary energy businesses, as positioning themselves very well for capturing the growth in demand for those products. And we see through the impact on consulting revenues and some of the challenges on the subscription basis that growth potential ahead. So I think it's a combination of both that future opportunity and the success that we've had to date in moving that business forward.
One piece of evidence from that, if you look at a number of our competitors in that space, I think you will see very differentiated performance from a revenue growth and an earnings growth perspective, reflecting the significant progress that we've made in moving it from that legacy orientation around the upstream oil and gas sector."

And we are implementing as we speak, and that will be a very nice and very substantial run. Because as we implement, what we will get is I'll refer to it as subscription-types of revenue. And as they put on new products and there's new volumes, we would see increased revenue on each of those lines.
So the major wins across the life insurance software platform space, it's been with FAST, in almost every case that we're aware of. And again, those are new logos as well as extension into other solutions or products within existing customers. So hopefully, that answers your question. And what I did try to at least kind of conclude in there, we have significantly increased the investment to make sure we transition to the SaaS environment, to transition to the cloud. We've extended both our capabilities through acquisition and build."

I'm pleased to share that Verisk delivered a strong second quarter result. The strength of our business model has been on full display since the start of the pandemic and continues in the recovery. We delivered solid top line and profit growth in every quarter last year despite the weak economic environment and operating challenges from lockdowns because of the consistent and durable growth in our subscription-based businesses. As expected, we are now fully participating in the recovery as our transactional businesses are showing strong resilience and rebounding with the rollout of vaccines and global economies opening up.
To be more specific in the second quarter, Verisk delivered organic constant currency revenue growth of 6.3%, comprised of growth of 5.5% and are mostly subscription-based non-COVID-sensitive revenues, and growth of 12.1% in our mostly transactional COVID-sensitive revenues. In fact, certain of our transactional businesses have already returned to pre-COVID levels. We have confidence this general trend can continue and believe that as the COVID impacts fully abate, we can return to delivering financial results in line with our long-term model. Lee will provide more details in his financial review.
These results were delivered through the hard work, dedication and consistent focus on our customers by our 9,000 employees around the globe. In many parts of the world, we've already begun welcoming our employees back to our offices, with a plan guided by our mission of protecting the health and well-being of our team members and in line with directives from local governments and public health officials. While our Global Protection Services team is keeping a close eye on developments with the delta variant, our teams are energized to work together in person again. In fact, Currently, more than half of our global offices are operating in a Phase 2 or 3 format. Across the U.S., we have plans to return to full use of our offices in September, unless circumstances change considerably.
We have implemented a return to office policy of  3 days in the office, 4 with customers and 2 days for hub. This approach, which incorporates the best learnings from the pandemic, balances individual flexibility with the collaboration and creativity that stems from working together in person. We also believe that this flexible working policy will help to retain and attract the very best talent as we continue to grow in what is a very competitive hiring environment. Not only are we returning to office, we are also beginning to have certain in-person meetings with our customers, including on-site training and sales opportunities.
Given how effectively we've worked in a fully remote format, we have confidence that this return to office policy is the optimal design. Our computing and network capacity have consistently and comfortably exceeded what we require, and our teams have adjusted to using all the virtual collaboration tools we have implemented enterprise-wide.
On the topic of technology. We continue to make great strides on our efforts to modernize and optimize our technology platforms to always be best in class. As of today, we have effectively and seamlessly moved most of our applications off the mainframe. This has been a huge undertaking and is a great example of true collaboration and partnership between our IT teams and business units around the globe. In total, we currently have thousands of solutions running native in the cloud, including those that were moved from prior on-premise environments and those built native to the cloud. We are advancing our cloud-first strategy and currently have more than half of our compute environment running in the cloud.
The migration to the cloud is a multifaceted multistage project, and we are pacing this transition in lockstep with our customers to ensure that we are always delivering on their highest expectations. In addition, as we advance on this journey, the process is ever improving, and we are seeing real benefits in terms of pace of innovation, resiliency, security and compliance. Our ability to introduce new products and release updates to existing products in a quick and efficient manner is vastly improved because of our shift to the cloud. We are also able to onboard new customers and enter new geographies faster and with reduced capital intensity.
For example, we've successfully deployed our new cloud-based visualized ISO ClaimSearch platform to our P&C insurance customers. This modernized version of our industry-leading ClaimSearch platform provides a more engaging user experience for thousands of claim adjusters and investigators, and allows us to offer new features, functionality and solutions quickly and easily to customers through this platform.
In addition, our new insurance digital media contributory database will take advantage of the flexibility and efficiencies of cloud technology to process, store and analyze claim-related digital images from more than 160 insurers. Initially, we expect to receive over 8 million digital media files per week as this new offering ramps up to help insurers better detect potential fraud and increase settlement fee for meritorious claims. The cloud is also advancing our sales process as we can offer customers an easy and cost-beneficial way to pilot or trial new solutions that was previously much more cumbersome in Verisk's prior on-premise format. This allows customers to truly see in action the value of our solutions. Our sales team can then focus on converting those customers to long-term subscriptions.
The cloud has also made our solutions more resilient with less downtime as the duration of maintenance windows are greatly reduced. We no longer must take our cloud-native solutions off-line to do things like update or release new features or protect them with the latest security patches and protocols. We have also constructed a cloud security program that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to continuously monitor our entire environment, making us more secure and able to audit our entire process for full accountability.
And finally, the cloud makes it easier to keep applications and data that are running in local geographies to adhere to the increasing nuances of regulatory and compliance requirements that are geographically specific. As our business expands globally, this becomes an increasing benefit of cloud.
From a capital perspective, our cloud migration has reduced our ongoing need to spend on third-party hardware and software. We are reallocating those savings towards internal innovation and spending more on growth CapEx. We are leaning into our highest growth, highest return on invested capital organic opportunities across insurance and energy. 
Within Insurance, we have seen great success with the development of the LightSpeed platform. This organically developed data-forward platform has automated and improved the underwriting process for our customers, and is driving strong top line growth within our ISO business as we have extended it across personal and commercial lines.
Specific to Commercial Lines, we've seen continued success in small commercial for business owners and commercial auto. With LightSpeed, we have augmented our AI and machine learning capabilities, introducing image analytics that will help present a holistic view of risk at the point of quote and ensure that small business owners get the coverage they need. We've also expanded our entity resolution and benchmarking data and analytics to help our diverse client base scale and increase their speed to market.
We are also accelerating our customers' journey towards 0 application questions, helping drive speed and efficiency. With over 80 traditional and InsurTech customers, leveraging LightSpeed commercial, we are enabling the industry to free up underwriting talent to focus on more complex risks and helping our customers become the carrier or managing general agent of choice in this fast-moving and profitable space.
Within energy, our internally developed cloud-based Lens platform is transforming the way customers interact with the Mackenzie data as we are integrating our complex data sets seamlessly into their workflows. We have greatly reduced our research cycle times from days to hours, allowing us to commercialize solutions more quickly and update data in existing solutions more frequently. This empowers our customers with the data necessary to make timely and well-informed decisions about commodity markets around the globe. We are seeing strong value-based price realization and revenue growth, resulting in solid returns on capital for this platform.
The capital management discipline is also evidenced in our acquisition strategy. While interest and valuations for data analytic assets are high, we've been very selective and focused our attention only on assets where we can create incremental value by combining data sets for new solutions, leveraging our infrastructure or improving sales and distribution, through our strong customer relationships and industry scale. Our recent acquisition of FAST is a great example of how we are leveraging our relationships across the industry to accelerate the adoption of FAST software, driving strong returns on invested capital.
On the engagement front, even in a mostly virtual mode, we continue to get ever closer to our customers. This engagement starts with the C-suite and runs through all levels of the organization. This is evidenced by increasing frequency of meetings, better attendance at our virtual events and increasing interest from customers to work with us as development partners. In fact, we recently announced 2 key development partners for our Lens Power solution, namely Vestas and Quinbrook. It has also translated into building sales pipelines and more sales opportunities. And we're having great success converting these sales opportunities into new contracts as we benefit from our ability to bundle our broad offerings to meet our customers' unique needs. This is particularly evident with our fastest-growing customer segment in InsurTech.
On the innovation front, we recently launched the Cyber Risk Navigator, our cyber risk modeling application. This release represented a year-long effort to redevelop the platform from an on-premise solution to cloud-native SaaS solution. Given the scalability of the cloud, clients are now able to run analyses in minutes that used to take hours. It also provides us the ability to bring new features and model updates to the market quickly, rather than being tied to annual software releases, which is essential for a rapidly changing risk such as cyber. 
We also made great strides in advancing our offerings in the telematics space with the introduction of the DrivingDNA Score. This enhanced solution is powered by the unique data from Verisk Data Exchange, that includes 260 billion miles and growing of robust driving behavior data from 8 million connected car drivers. The DrivingDNA Score enables our customers to enter and expand to the rapidly growing usage-based insurance market and is another key addition to our whole suite of telematics solutions.
Finally, I'm excited to share about the progress Verisk has made on our environmental stewardship commitments. We recently completed our 2020 greenhouse gas emissions inventory. And I'm pleased to report that, for the fourth straight year, we balanced 100% of Verisk's reported Scope 1, 2 and 3, including business air travel emissions, through a combination of purposeful reduction initiatives and investments in renewable energy certificates and carbon offsets. We remain focused on implementing meaningful physical and operational changes that will reduce our greenhouse gas emissions over the long term. Those include the consolidation of multiple Verisk offices in Boston and London into new energy-efficient business centers as well as the continuing strategic realignment of our data management activities, to take advantage of the major efficiencies presented by cloud computing. Building on the progress we've already achieved to date, I'm also pleased to share that Verisk has committed to an absolute 21% reduction in our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 2024 compared with the 2019 baseline.
In developing the targets, Verisk collaborated with Ecometrica, an accomplished leader in the field of sustainability metrics, software and services. The resulting targets incorporate the latest science-based targets guidance, aligned with the 1.5-degree celsius global future. I look forward to updating you on our progress as we remain committed to addressing the very real impacts of climate change today and for the benefit of future generations.
I have great confidence that our focus on innovation and serving our customers will help us deliver on our long-term growth objectives, creating lasting shareholder value. As our business recovers from the short-term impacts of the pandemic, we continue to actively study the signs of resilience across the different parts of our company. Our dynamic capital process is designed to ensure that our capital is deployed into the highest-growth and highest-return opportunities.
With that, let me turn the call over to Lee to cover our financial results."
1027055,1673293104,2362840,"Verisk Analytics, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2021",2021-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Verisk Analytics, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Scott. First, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we have posted a quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website.Moving to the financial results for the quarter. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue grew",1600,"Thank you, Scott. First, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we have posted a quarterly earnings presentation that is available on our website.
Moving to the financial results for the quarter. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue grew 10.1% to $748 million. Net income attributable to Verisk decreased 14% to $154 million, while diluted GAAP earnings per share attributable to Verisk declined 13% to $0.94 per share. These declines are the result of a noncash revaluation charge related to the U.K. tax law change. Adjusting for the impact of the $0.21 per share noncash revaluation charge, diluted adjusted EPS increased 7% to $1.38.
Moving to our organic constant currency results. Adjusted for nonoperating items, as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, we were very pleased with our operating results, led by consistent growth in our subscription revenues and recovery in our transactional revenues as our business rebounds from the COVID-related declines from last year. In the second quarter, organic constant currency revenue grew 6.3%, led by continued strength in our Insurance segment and sequential improvement in our Energy and Financial Services segment. Our non-COVID-sensitive revenues, as we defined at the beginning of the pandemic, increased 5.5% in the second quarter of 2021 as compared to the growth of 6.5% in the prior year quarter. This stable growth in our non-COVID-sensitive revenues, representing approximately 85% of our total revenues, reflects the durability and resilience of our primarily subscription model.
Our COVID-sensitive                 revenues, which represent 15% of our consolidated revenues, continued on a sequential improvement trend and returned to growth this quarter, increasing 12.1%. This compares to declines of 20% in the second quarter last year and the prior quarter performance of declines of 5.9%. Growth was primarily the result of improvements in consulting in our Energy segment and a return to pre-pandemic growth rates in many of our products and services within Insurance, particularly within the U.S. We did experience continued COVID-related weakness in our Financial Services segment as government forbearance programs are negatively impacting bankruptcy volumes.
Organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth was 4.2% in the second quarter, led by solid growth in Insurance and Energy, offset in part by weakness in Financial Services. Total adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter, which includes both organic and inorganic revenue and adjusted EBITDA, was 49.6% in the quarter, down 172 basis points on a year-over-year basis, but still above our pre-pandemic margin level of 46.6% recorded in the second quarter of 2019. Much of the decline is associated with the normalization of our costs as we anniversary the COVID benefits from last year, including reduced head count growth and lower incentive compensation. This margin also reflects an increase in the pace of investment in our technological transformation, including our cloud transition costs and the impact of acquisitions.
On that note, let's turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis. In the second quarter, Insurance segment revenues increased 7.8%, demonstrating strong resilience and recovery. We saw healthy growth in our industry standard insurance programs, catastrophe modeling solutions, repair cost estimating solutions and international insurance software solutions. We also experienced strong growth in transactional revenues, associated with an increased level of securitization revenues in our catastrophe modeling business, a modest benefit from storm-related revenue and double-digit recovery growth in our COVID-impacted revenues as we compare against declines last year. Adjusted EBITDA grew 6.6% in the second quarter while margins declined 148 basis points, reflecting a return to a normalized rate of head count growth compared to the prior year and higher year-over-year short-term incentive compensation expense. We also continue to invest in our breakout areas as well as our technology modernization, including our cloud transition.
Energy and Specialized Markets revenue increased 5% in the second quarter due to a recovery in our consulting and project-based revenues across Energy and Power, strong growth in environmental health and safety solutions and our energy transition research. Included in the quarter was revenue associated with the strategic consulting project that added approximately 1 point to segment growth. We continue to benefit from strong adoption of our Lens platform as customers are seeing the value of our integrated cloud-based data analytic environment. We remain a key part of our customers' most strategic conversations as they deal with the ever-changing energy landscape and our broad base of solutions across all commodities are mission-critical to our customers as they navigate through this dynamic environment. 
Adjusted EBITDA grew 8.4% in the second quarter, while margins expanded 74 basis points, reflecting continued cost discipline and leverage from sales growth. As we look to the remainder of 2021, we want to remind you that we have a very tough margin comparison in the third quarter, associated with some head count reductions, furloughs and compensation adjustments that we made in reaction to the tough operating environment in 2020. However, some of these costs were reversed in the fourth quarter of 2020. All that said, we have a solid track record of managing through volatile times effectively and believe we are well-positioned with our energy transition solutions as well as our Lens platform to continue to outperform the end market and help our customers navigate this broad energy transition. 
Financial Services revenue declined 8.1% in the quarter, reflecting the continued impact of contract transitions that we undertook in 2020 and will continue through the third quarter of 2021 as well as a lower level of bankruptcy revenue because of government support and forbearance program. 
Spend informed analytics demonstrated stronger growth than expected as spending and advertising improved, which enabled us to reduce some of the negative impact on revenue growth from the contract transitions that we originally anticipated. Adjusted EBITDA declined 77% in the quarter, reflecting the negative impact of lower sales and a larger impact of corporate expense allocations on the segment's smaller base. We continue to believe that the actions we have taken with E&S over the last few years are setting the business on a stronger foundation from which to grow going forward.
Our reported effective tax rate was 35.6% compared to 20.4% in the prior year quarter. This higher tax rate is the result of an earlier-than-anticipated enactment of a U.K. tax law change that caused a noncash revaluation charge. This is simply a timing difference from our original expectations as the impact occurred in the second quarter instead of the third quarter as we had originally forecast. There is no change to full year results. Given the earlier timing of the tax law change and the fact that this charge was onetime in nature, we now expect our tax rate to approximate 20% to 22% for the second half of 2021. 
Adjusted net income was $191 million, and diluted adjusted EPS was $1.17 for the second quarter 2021, adjusting for the impact of a $0.21 per share noncash revaluation charge related to the U.K. Tax Law change described earlier, diluted adjusted EPS increased 7% to $1.38. These increases reflect organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions and a lower average share count. Net cash provided by operating activities was $233 million for the quarter, down 6.5% from the prior year period. The prior year period cash flow benefited from a deferral in both federal income tax payments and certain employer payroll taxes as a result of the CARES Act, partly offset by earn-out payments. 
Year-to-date, net cash provided by operating activities was $682 million, reflecting growth of 11.4% versus the prior year period. Capital expenditures were $62.5 million for the quarter, up 10.2%. We continue to believe that CapEx will be in the range of $250 million to $280 million, reflecting our continued investment in our innovation agenda, our technological transformation as well as the carryover of certain expenditures that were delayed in 2020 as a result of the pandemic.
Related to CapEx, we expect fixed asset depreciation and amortization will be within the range of $200 million to $215 million and intangible amortization to be approximately $180 million, reflecting the impact of recent acquisitions and changes in foreign currency rates. Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to FX variability, the timing of purchases and the completion of projects and future M&A activity.
During the second quarter, we returned $197 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends as our strong cash flow allows us to invest behind our highest-return growth initiatives, but also return capital to shareholders consistently. Our strategy to deliver long-term and sustainable growth remains unchanged. We are encouraged by the recovery we are experiencing in our COVID-impacted businesses, and we believe the stability and predictability of our subscription revenues will persist. We also have confidence in our ability to manage the cost structure effectively to protect profitability. While we do have tough cost comparisons this year, we believe that we should retain some of the margin expansion we experienced in 2020, delivering margins ahead of our 2019 level of 47%.
Taking this all together, we believe that as the COVID impacts abate and the global economies continue to open up, we can return to our long-term growth model of 7% organic constant currency revenue growth, with core operating leverage allowing EBITDA to grow faster than revenue, although it is difficult to determine that -- to predict that timing.
We hope this provides some useful context for you, and we look forward to addressing your questions. We continue to appreciate all of the support and interest in Verisk. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions."

And every CEO that I speak to in the insurance industry, every one of them to a person considers their business -- to grow the business. And so they are leaning into new methods as a way of trying to grow their businesses. And we expect that to persist.
And it's always been the case actually that in our Insurance business, we have grown considerably faster than the underlying product marketplace. And actually, that's true to the energy vertical as well. And why? Because our customers are trying to make increasing use of data analytics solutions. So we're not really yoked to the net written premium volumes in the insurance industry."

We're providing them what's the cost of lumber, as an example, which has been a very significant inflationary item. And their repair cost estimates are reflected that -- are reflecting that increase. We are very much into the world of social inflation, right? The cost of litigation and the cost of claims is up as a result of that. So that -- those trends are reflected in our loss costs. That's the pricing they do. It's reflected in the repair cost estimates. It's reflected in how they underwrite a property or any insurance risk, and I'd like to think that we are at the lead in thinking for them on that topic."

And I wanted to ask a little bit about that. You talked about how the tech modernization progress you're making is accelerating the ability to innovate and reducing CapEx, which you're trading that off for higher capital spending on innovation and new products. I guess a 2-parter. As we think about innovation broadly across the company, do you keep internally -- or can you help us think about like the concept of a vitality index? How much more is all of this change you're doing contributing to growth from innovation?
And then secondly, do you see that benefit more as something that should allow you continue to deliver to the long-term 7% revenue growth target that you have? Or is there potential as that innovation accelerates that you could begin to outperform that target more meaningfully as innovation and new products become a larger part of your revenue?"

We do feel very good about the shape of our business, where we sit in the flow of what is happening in the business world. One of the most important things happening in the economy is businesses becoming the better, more analytic digital version of themselves. And that is fundamentally what is in and around and underneath our business and that we enjoy these tremendous relationships with our customers founded upon trust and some really, really valuable and distinctive solutions. That's our business.
And the environment in which we're doing our work, obviously, the pandemic has had an effect as it did on everybody. But over longer periods of time, there are these very constructive trends. And so that's kind of fundamentally our growth story. Against that, our customers look to us to be their fill in the blank tech partner. There are -- in every one of the verticals we serve, there's a fill in the blank tech, InsurTech, fintech, energy tech. There's a list of players like that as long as both of your arms.
Our customers expect us to be providing innovation. That is one of the reasons why they lean into the relationship with us in the first place. So I think the nature of your question, Gary, was like this investment into that solution and what is the effect of that in terms of our growth. We pay attention to that. It would probably surprise you to know the relatively modest size of investment opportunities that all the way to the office of the CEO we're looking at because it's the lifeblood of our business.
And so we do -- we are resolving things down to the level of the individual solution, and we pay attention to how they're doing. And we make decisions about should we put more in because it looks very promising, should we pull back from it because it appears not to be gaining steam. We're doing that all the time. That is what we do on a moment-to-moment basis.
But when you talk about vitality, you really -- you have to take it holistically. Because as we said earlier in this call, by count of corporate entity, in the insurance industry, the most rapidly growing segment are the InsurTechs, the new players. And I take such comfort in the fact that they show up with a clean sheet of paper. And they're rethinking everything. How are we going to build an insurance business?
And they seem so consistently to want to standardize on all of our solutions. That's vitality. Now they're adopting solutions that we -- in some cases, that we created years ago. But they're buying into them because they remain right at the leading edge. I mean, they're very insistent that everything be cloud-native, tech-forward. They just -- they're not even going to look at you if you're not that way. So I would just encourage you to understand vitality means a lot of things. It means the infusion of value into a solution that has been around for a long period of time as well as the new solution. It's new customers as well as existing customers.
But there's no question, if you pop all the way to the top of the organization and ask the question, look at that top line rate of organic revenue growth. One of the most powerful things that drives our growth is the adoption of solutions, whether it's a new solution by an existing customer or an existing but enhanced solution by a new customer. And the investing that we do in innovation is in support of all that. Mark, do you want to add something?"

But I think to your point on the travel and entertainment side, I think there are structural savings that we are -- we'll be able to take advantage of over time. And so I think some of that, there is a structural change. 
I also think over the longer term, as we adopt or adapt to the flexible work structure that Scott described in his comments that it will provide opportunities for us from a productivity, from a real estate cost standpoint to reduce some of those expenses over time. But of course, that follows kind of the lease renewal process. But those will be things that we're able to achieve over time as well.
And then finally, the other element is compensation, and that is more directly tied to our overall performance against the growth targets and overall head count growth. And I think that will -- that's the element that is likely and we'll certainly hope is going to normalize consistent with the achievement of our revenue growth and our EBITDA growth."

And I don't see any change in that. When you describe it that way, kind of stable normal environments are, all else equal, supportive. And you would have to expect over long periods of time, if you look at the marketplaces that we serve, they're very important elements of the economy. So a thesis, which is -- they will remain important is a pretty sound one. And then actually, the demography of the customer set inside of these verticals, they don't really change all that rapidly. Of course, we're always paying attention to that, but they don't tend to -- so you've got that as the background.
But there is no question that there is a huge dependence upon execution. The whole innovation agenda has to be done well. We have to dig in with our customers as development partners to make sure that we hit what's needed, that we get it to market faster. All of those things have a lot to do with returns on any given innovation investment that we've made. So that's very important. And another thing, which -- I don't know, I suppose if you watch us really carefully over a long period of time, this would be evident, but I just want to highlight that there is a great deal of dynamic inside of what we're doing in terms of looking at the solution families and the solution sets that we've got and deciding where are they and where are they headed. 
And we have a very long track record. I'll just -- I'll pick the insurance vertical since it's the largest one for us. Investing more inside of things that are showing a lot of promise, but retiring in some cases, selling off solution sets that we have as well. And so it can all look -- it's kind of like the duck on top of the lake. It looks very steady, but underneath, there's various paddling going on. And we get down to the level of individual solutions. Again, just using insurance as an example, through the years, we've retired a number of things that we were doing. We invented a whole lot of things. All of that is inside of getting to this long-term view of growth potential."

But if you look at the underlying insurance business, it gets consistently delivered on that 7% organic growth area, where there have been negative impacts from that is it has either been because of some of the nearer-term cyclical elements associated with the energy business. But that business, as we have seen and demonstrated, particularly with the Lens platform, the investment in the energy transition practice, has demonstrated their potential to move to similar levels of growth. And Financial Services has been undergoing a transition to a more focus on sustainable growth, reducing some of that volatility. So I want to make certain that you appreciate that underneath the space is a consistent track record of delivering on that potential, with some of the other elements as we move down this path of investing in the platform in order to -- for us to deliver the value of those rapidly growing data sets, improved platforms against the business.

I think the important thing to emphasize here is that we believe that one of the strongest elements that we have, the strongest opportunities that we have to create value is investing internally within the business, as Scott has described, in the technology, in the data sets, in new services for our clients. And so we want to make certain that we are taking every advantage to where we think we can generate incremental growth, where we can generate high incremental returns on capital from that. So we start from the position of how much capital do we have available that we're generating from the business. What are our opportunities first to invest in the business, in a way that takes advantage of those opportunities to generate growth and returns? Secondly, are there opportunities that we see in the M&A market to invest in businesses that we can create value by meaningfully improving their revenue growth through our distribution, utilizing their data sets more effectively or improving their technology? And FAST, as we've described, this has been a great example of that. Genscape in our energy business has been additive, has generated attractive returns on capital for us. So that's the second use.
And then the decision on share repurchases is really an outcome of what capital do we have that we don't have an opportunity, we don't see an opportunity to invest, to contribute to growth or returns on capital. So it is an outcome of our capital allocation process, not something that we target at the outset. So kind of taking your question, if we don't see those opportunities, if the M&A market doesn't present opportunities for us given where valuations are or the nature of the business to create value, then we would expect that excess capital to be returned either through the dividend or through increased share repurchases, but it will all be driven by that investment opportunity and our discipline."

So let me try to maybe provide some parameters. The way we're going about this is we really believe that insurer, in their search for the best experience to the customer, the digital engagement, they want information that's actionable and they can kind of have a bindable quote, meaning when you go online and you want to get a price, you don't want it to change. And basically, 33% to 40% of the cases, that price changes, if you say I'm interested. And they do all this underwriting and pull the information. we're bringing all that information forward and the combination of data we have and analytics so that the insurer has confidence to quote. And that's a big change. So that is noteworthy and important.
And what we've tried to do in kind of thinking about the opportunity here, we know who's providing that information. And we feel it's about $1 billion that's going to be type of market opportunity in the insurance space. So we simply have a lot of runway, especially on the personal line side.

In addition, you were taking on recoding expense for the applications as you migrate them into that new environment. And so as we have been implementing this process across hundreds of applications in our various businesses, you have that upfront cost that is a negative cost impact, which we view as an investment. And we look at it on individual project-by-project basis. Our technology team does a great job tracking the specific costs and the savings, but think of this as rolling across the organization. 
And for the first year and second year, we are still in a net investment mode from a cost perspective within the business. CapEx will be more limited going forward, so you will be extracting CapEx savings over time because the CapEx intensity of our technology footprint is declining, but that's something that's achieved over time. And we're beginning to experience that in this second year of the project, but that will continue naturally into the third year and beyond. And so if we think about OpEx and CapEx, we're still in a net investment mode in the second year. We would expect that in the third year that turns into a positive contribution.
Now the other thing to factor in is that, as Scott described on the CapEx front, that is -- it will enable us -- and this is also true on the OpEx front, to shift some of that OpEx into other investment areas. So when I've talked about margin in the past, I've described there is natural operating margin expansion on a pre-investment level, but then we consume a portion of that from an investment perspective, and that's where we generate incremental growth and returns. So we do believe that this will be additive going into the third year, and then we'll determine do we see investment opportunities to pursue that.
Beyond and riding on top of all of that is, I think, the more material benefit of this, which is the pace of innovation, the ability to associate more data sets to populate platforms that are creating a broader lift, I think, within the business and is sensed by, I think, a number of the questions in terms of its impact on our overall growth. So I wanted to give you kind of a comprehensive sense of the way that we are thinking about it. And because of that complexity, I think it would be very limiting to kind of specifically just focus on the cost element of it. Yes, there will be cost benefits, but those have to be -- will be balanced by our investment decisions and then the broader impact from the transition."

I do think of this transition as being an event at a moment in time. And it does have some discrete elements associated with them. Just to call out a few of them, there will come a moment where we're no longer computing on mainframe. We're not fully at that point yet, but there -- I mean, we will have an event where we'll get out the sledgehammers and literally break up the cores inside the mainframe. And that -- we're already reducing the load on the mainframe, and we can find some ways to benefit from that. We run power data centers, 2 of them, in the United States. We will close them at some point. There are fixed costs associated with data centers. And so that will be an event, and we'll call out those events for you when we get to those.
And then something else, which I think is really extremely important, is that you used to buy compute capacity in relatively large chunks. And then as we move more towards the server environment, the chunks got smaller, but you're still buying chunks. In a world like that, anybody who's writing an algorithm, anybody who is demanding compute power, for them, you've already bought the capacity within limits. And so incrementally, it doesn't cost you anything. And in a world like that, you can actually be a little bit -- I don't want to use the word sloppy, but you can essentially use more compute capacity in how you want to get to the answer you're trying to get to. 
And maybe you don't have to cash that analysis you just did quite as much or you don't have to summarize at the column and row level once, and then work through those derivatives, et cetera. My point here being that there should be an interaction between how you analyze for -- how you compute in the context of analysis and the way that you consume computing capacity. And in a variabalized world, you have to pay more attention to that than you used to. And so our development and analytics are responding and need to respond to that. But on the other side of the transition you actually think differently about literally what do you encode that you did before so that you can be efficient in your use of compute capacity. 
So what I'm saying is there's a multiyear thing here. But on the other side, it is actually very different than where you were into this transition. You don't run physical facilities. You don't run really large hardware and you think very differently about how you structure analysis. And that will just be a more -- that's a better world for a company like ours."

I would just say also that there are a lot of reasons why our customers lean into a relationship with us. Some of it has to do with the breadth of our family of solutions. Some of it has to do with our proven track record. Some of it has to do with reliability. And customers really care about that when you're talking about an enterprise-level application. There are a lot of reasons. And we're powered by really, really strong content assets. And a lot of the fill-in-the-blank tech start-ups, they don't start with content.

So I would say that we are -- when we look at our COVID-sensitive revenues across the business as a whole, we're looking at it business-by-business. And so we are seeing some recovery, stronger recovery in certain areas, for instance, on the property side. We've seen in the insurance front probably the strongest recovery. Some recovery in driving, although driving is -- would not be what we would describe as fully recovered at this point.
In Energy and Specialized Markets, we are seeing a strong rebound in consulting revenues, so that is demonstrating relatively robust recovery. We're also seeing some strengthening in our new subscriptions, which will flow in over time, I think, reflecting some of the improved pricing dynamics. Whereas in DFS, there is an element, which I refer to our spend-informed analytics, which because of advertising and marketing, we have seen an uplift. And that's performing better than we expected, but the bankruptcy element of our business is still experiencing the challenges of all of the government support out there in the environment. And so that's yet to recover.
It becomes very difficult to kind of quantify how far -- how much of a recovery. I would say it's certainly a partial recovery, not a full recovery, but the trends that we see, we expect to see continuing improvement in that recovery for the business. And it's probably worth noting in our insurance -- in the Insurance and in the Energy and Specialized Markets business, our COVID-sensitive revenues were up 20% year-over-year. Financial Services are still seeing a year-over-year decline, even though we've seen an improvement in spend-informed analytics and a deterioration -- or not a deterioration, but kind of the same level of declines on the bankruptcy side. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of texture across the business for some of the trends that we're seeing. 
I would also note, naturally, it should come as no surprise, that our travel business internationally is still suffering significantly from very low international travel. And so that's an important component."

Thanks for asking that question as a follow-up in that regard. So I think it is a good distinction to make that the consulting element is where we are seeing that recovery on the COVID-sensitive side and focusing on the subscription side of the business, and I kind of want to build on my earlier comments. The impact of Lens, which has been very positively received by a lot of our clients, has been generating significant contract renewals with price increases in the mid- to high single digits.
Now there are 2 elements to that in terms of its ongoing impact. One is going to be the rolling impact of that as subscriptions become -- come up for renewal. And the second element of that is that then, again, that subscription is something that will phase in over time given the nature of that. But the important point from my perspective is that we are seeing a very positive uptake. Clients are working with Lens. We've gotten several operational assessments. They've been very positive. And we've been able to achieve those price increases. So that will be based upon our feedback so far, a slow rolling but an improvement to the growth in that business, even before we also begin to utilize that platform to expand that customer set and the applications.
We also are still experiencing some impact from the last cycles, loss of 1 client in the energy space and some consolidation in the upstream area that is having a near-term impact on the research component. So that's another element that's factoring into it. But I think the distinction that you made is relevant. Hopefully, that differentiates that near-term consulting boost against what we see as constructive longer-term trends from Lens, and the pricing experience that we've had and how that should flow through over time within the business."

And in fact, Lisa has implemented some organizational changes that support that approach and focus from the business, which we think moves that to a more effectively integrated platform for our businesses. And we have also taken the steps structurally to move that business from a more consulting-oriented revenue base to more sustainable growth. And we are seeing that from a new business signing and pipeline perspective in the way that we are bringing on new business and how we're structuring it and the types of business.
To your question, one thing that's important to emphasize is that Verisk's Financial Services, in many ways, has been an intellectual capital engine for much of the rest of the business. A lot of what they have learned in dealing with very large data sets and integrating them, managing them, data architecture elements have been exported to the rest of the business. Many of the data scientists, including our CIO, Nick Daffan; our Chief Analytics Officer, Vikas Vats, have come from that background and are -- we're drawing from their expertise. So there are other elements of the -- of what they've contributed to Verisk has been helpful. We are pulling from some of those externalized elements in a variety of ways analytically to developing new products, the replatforming of Argus 2.0 is an example of where we've been able to draw from some of that external expertise. So I think there is a good dialogue across the 2 entities. And we also look for interactions between the credit dimensions that Verisk Financial Services have and some of the insurance elements of our business to inform and generate new opportunities."

They were doing their own integration.
So now that's where it's where we are today and where we're headed into the future. We are more platforms than we were, significantly more platform than we were. And that is constructive inside of the growth of our business now and into the future. And if you actually look at the pattern of investment, what are we spending money on, a great deal of it and a lot more than it used to be, is on developing software, which you should hear us building our own platforms.
But when we strike a relationship with a third party that is itself, providing a platform. It's -- we're analyzing that in the context of, well, okay, we could go direct the customer through the integration themselves. But basically, that third-party platform that isn't ours is substituting for the customer's own integration efforts, but not in a way that it impacts the underlying value of what it is that we provide, which is being integrated and over there.

And so when we are evaluating, and we are constantly evaluating what we do with all of our businesses and what are our options to optimize the value of that, the right time frame that we think is to look at what's the structural transitions and the impact from COVID. And so certainly, 2022 should be what we believe is a much more normalized level from a revenue, revenue growth and from a margin perspective that informs our view of the more normal operating state of the business as well as a sense of how the structural changes that we have implemented and the operating changes will demonstrate their impact more clearly in terms of growth at a top line and an EBITDA level.

We're already seeing it, as I indicated, in terms of the pricing on the legacy product. We're seeing it in the growth in our energy transition revenues, both on a consulting and subscription basis within chemicals. You saw an acquisition in metals and mining, which have increasing relevance given the importance of battery raw materials.
And so we view Wood Mackenzie and PowerAdvocate, our primary energy businesses, as positioning themselves very well for capturing the growth in demand for those products. And we see through the impact on consulting revenues and some of the challenges on the subscription basis that growth potential ahead. So I think it's a combination of both that future opportunity and the success that we've had to date in moving that business forward. One piece of evidence from that, if you look at a number of our competitors in that space, I think you will see very differentiated performance from a revenue growth and an earnings growth perspective, reflecting the significant progress that we've made in moving it from that legacy orientation around the upstream oil and gas sector."

So first of all, with regard to international software, so the most part that represents our Sequel offering. So we were talking a little bit about platforms before the [indiscernible] the claim systems. We are a player in the                 market. We are the most significant player in the                 market. And that is about growth in customers. That is about extension of different solutions and products, including some of the acquisitions we did that helped extend that platform, line space, roll block sequel, all of those are this interconnected ecosystem. And we've taken that capability as it relates to, for the most part, specialty and commercial lines, and started to extend it outside of the U.K. and even into the United States. So those are good wins, those are good extensions and it's been very positive. 
If I was to go over to the FAST side, which is the life side of things, what we've done is we've infused it with some analytics. But in large part, what you're seeing is, there are some very major life insurers who've made some very major decisions, and they've chosen FAST. These are very long-term contracts, 5 and 10 years. And we are implementing as we speak, and that will be a very nice and very substantial run. Because as we implement, what we will get is I'll refer to it as subscription-types of revenue. And as they put on new products and there's new volumes, we would see increased revenue on each of those lines.
So the major wins across the life insurance software platform space, it's been with FAST, in almost every case that we're aware of. And again, those are new logos as well as extension into other solutions or products within existing customers. So hopefully, that answers your question. And what I did try to at least kind of conclude in there, we have significantly increased the investment to make sure we transition to the SaaS environment, to transition to the cloud. We've extended both our capabilities through acquisition and build."

Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. I'm pleased to share that Verisk delivered a solid third quarter result, building on our deep domain expertise, innovative offerings and strong relationships with our customers. Specifically, Verisk delivered organic constant currency revenue growth of 5.1% and organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth of 2.1% for the third quarter. What I find encouraging is looking at the results on a 2-year basis to adjust for the lumpiness related to the pandemic. In this view, Verisk delivered 2-year cumulative organic constant currency revenue growth of 8.7% and organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth of 16.8%, demonstrating strong core operating leverage and a sequential improvement in the second quarter. 
Lee will provide more details in his comprehensive financial review. Across insurance, we are seeing strong demand for our products as our customers are striving to become more digital and more automated and are turning to Verisk's solutions to help them. Engagement with our customers remains at very high levels. As we continue our virtual work and our sales force and customer service teams are doing an excellent job staying connected. In fact, we recently hosted our Signature underwriting conference called Verisk Velocity, again, in a virtual format. This year's event was another success with over 600 attendees participating across 27 different thematic sessions. This year's focus was accelerating the digital transformation and developing new ways to increase efficiency and improve underwriting outcomes to better serve their customers. 
Strong customer engagement within insurance is translating into strong sales, with growing ACVs, longer contract terms and very robust sales pipelines. To that end, we've been very successful penetrating the new insurtech companies as they can take advantage of the full suite of Verisk's solutions across underwriting and claims. Additionally, with our more traditional P&C customer base, we are also having success leveraging our scale and our comprehensive insurance solution offering. These are 2 of our competitive advantages. By bundling our solutions together, we're driving increased adoption of new solutions across many different customer segments, and these bundles are proving to be quite sticky. 
One area of growth we are particularly excited about is our international expansion within insurance, which is predominantly in the U.K. today, but we see a long runway as we expand our analytic capabilities within the U.K. and extend our global footprint into new developed markets. Within our Sequel business in the U.K., we are building out a truly integrated and digital ecosystem across carriers, syndicates, brokers and managing general agents throughout the specialty market. and we are bringing in new customers and expanding our suite of products across existing ones. 
Most recently, we made a tuck-in acquisition of Ignite software systems, a SaaS platform that includes policy administration, rating engine and digital engagement for brokers, managing general agents and insureds. This acquisition expands Sequel's capabilities and enable Sequel to add a modular API-driven SaaS platform to the Sequel suite of products. Within our core underwriting, we are using the time-tested playbook that has worked in the U.S. for years using proprietary data assets to help better price and understand risk and extending to the U.K. with our data in Richmond Hub. Data Insight Hub is enabling the digitization of the personal and commercial lines insurance in the U.K. deploying a data forward strategy to prefill key data elements and provide predictive analytics that help customers with risk assessment and pricing. 
Our recent investment in Hug Hub extends these capacities upstream to support the ecosystem at point of sale and distribution. Our international travel business has experienced significant declines due to pandemic-related travel restrictions but we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of the rebound with cross-border capital returns. On the claims front, and consistent with our focus on the insurance business and international expansion, we recently announced the acquisition of ACTINEO, a market leader for personal injury claims digitalization and medical assessment in Germany. ACTINEO will be integrated into our broader Verisk Claims Europe business and should provide a strong platform to grow our footprint across Continental Europe and establish Verisk as the Pan-European leader in the personal injury and medical nonpractice sectors. We are encouraged by the opportunity to create incremental value by helping deploy ACTINEO technology and services across Europe and leveraging customer relationships. We also plan to introduce other claims solutions to these key European markets. 
And lastly, we are excited about the growth opportunity within international markets for our extreme event business. In June, we released an on-time update to our Japan Typhoon and earthquake models. These updates reflect the latest science and learnings from recent catastrophes in Japan. Our extreme of that business has very strong share in the key Japanese market with both primary insurers and reinsurers as customers. Both of whom rely on our models for the quality of the science and the local knowledge that we incorporate through our partnerships with local insurers. Within the Energy segment, we're seeing a strong uptake of our new and innovative solutions including our energy transition and chemicals research as well as our innovative lens platform. We are realizing double-digit growth in ACV for contracts that include lens as our customers recognize the value of this innovative solution. Importantly, lens is being adopted by customers across industries, including upstream oil and gas, financial services and power and renewables. Moreover, with roughly 10% of our customer base on lens today, we see a long runway for growth as we expand its use cases to include additional commodities and geographies over the next few years. 
You've heard me say before that at Verisk, we are moving ever closer to our customers and that we are on an exciting and successful journey to deliver best-in-class customer experiences. Our collaborations with management leaders, along with a customer-first mindset, helped power this journey. Customer experience is not just the responsibility of our dedicated customer service teams, but it runs throughout the entire organization. In the third quarter, colleagues from every part of Verisk participated in Verisk's Discover CX Summit. It was a moment in time when we came together to listen, learn and collaborate on how we can be better partners for our customers. Leaders across every area of the company is sampled to focus on learning CX best practices, and we have emerged with a robust pipeline of ideas that I believe will lead to innovative solutions and outcomes that benefit our customers and Verisk. 
On the personnel front, I'm pleased to publicly welcome Sunita Holzer, as our new Chief Human Resources Officer; and Diane Greene as our new Head of Inclusion Diversity in Blog. Sunita brings with her 3 decades of enterprise-level human resources leadership across several industries, including technology and insurance. Diane brings a business-centric mindset to D&B from her decade-long experience as a business leader in the payroll and HR solutions industry. At a time when attracting and retaining diverse talent is top of mind for every business I am really excited about partnering with Sunita and Diane to develop a comprehensive and differentiated human capital strategy for Verisk and foster our diverse, inclusive and equitable culture. 
Finally, we are committed to enhancing shareholder value and as part of that commitment to allocating capital to the highest growth and highest return opportunities. Accordingly, Verisk has been undertaking a bottoms-up review of our businesses and portfolio composition. Our review is ongoing with a focus on the most value-creative path for sustainable growth and success and doing what's in the best interest of our shareholders and all of Verisk's stakeholders. As we've said previously, we believe that portfolio changes are probable in the next 2 to 3 quarters, subject to market conditions. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Lee to cover our financial results."

First, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we've posted a quarterly earnings presentation that's available on our website. Moving to the financial results for the quarter. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue grew 8% to",1144,"Thanks, Scott. First, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we've posted a quarterly earnings presentation that's available on our website. Moving to the financial results for the quarter. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue grew 8% to $759 million. Net income attributable to Verisk increased 8.6% to $202 million while diluted GAAP earnings per share attributable to Verisk increased 10.7% to $1.24. 
Moving to our organic constant currency results. Adjusted for nonoperating items, as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, we are very pleased with our operating results, led by continued and consistent growth in our subscription revenues. In the third quarter, organic constant currency revenue grew 5.1%, driven by continued strength in our Insurance segment and modest growth in energy and specialized markets. This was offset in part by weakness in the Financial Services segment as we experienced the final quarter of impact from the contract restructurings as well as continued COVID-related impacts. Our non-COVID-sensitive revenues, as we defined at the beginning of the pandemic, increased 5.6% in the third quarter, which was consistent with results reported in the second quarter 2021 despite tougher year-over-year comparisons, as our non-COVID-sensitive revenues included 7.8% in the third quarter of 2020. 
The stable growth in our non-COVID-sensitive revenues, representing approximately 85% of our total revenues reflects the durability and resilience of our primarily subscription model and the mission-critical nature of our solutions. Our COVID-sensitive revenues which represent 15% of our consolidated revenues increased 1.6% as compared to declines of 10% in the third quarter last year. Growth was primarily the result of improvements in consulting in our Energy segment and a return to pre-pandemic growth rates in many of our products and services within insurance, particularly within the U.S. We did experience continued COVID-related weakness in our Financial Services segment as COVID forbearance programs are negatively impacting bankruptcy volumes. 
To be specific, our COVID-sensitive revenues increased 8% and 12% within the Insurance and Energy segments, respectively, but registered declines of 28% within financial services. It's also important to note that, that 28% decline also included the impact of the contract restructuring that we have described previously and which ended in the third quarter. Given that Financial Services is the segment with the largest percentage of COVID-sensitive transactional revenues, this had a disproportionate impact on the overall result. 
Organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth was 2.1% in the third quarter. Organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth was impacted by tough comparisons as we took aggressive cost actions in the third quarter of 2020 in response to the pandemic across all our segments. Total adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes both organic and inorganic revenue and adjusted EBITDA, was 49.9% in the quarter, down 221 basis points on a year-over-year basis but still well above our pre-pandemic margin level of 47.4% recorded in the third quarter of 2019. Much of the decline is associated with the normalization of our costs as we anniversary the COVID benefits from last year, including reduced headcount and lower incentive compensation. This level of margin also includes approximately 100 basis points of headwind from our ongoing technological transformation, including our cloud transition costs, which we absorbed into our cost structure. 
On that note, let's turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis. In the third quarter, Insurance segment revenues increased 7.4%, demonstrating strong resilience in recovery. We saw healthy growth in our industry standard insurance programs, repair cost estimating solutions, claims analytics solutions, catastrophe modeling, life insurance solutions and international insurance software solutions. We also experienced solid growth in transactional revenues, including 8% growth in our COVID impacted revenues as we compared against flattish results last year. We also experienced a modest benefit to growth from storm-related revenue resulting from Hurricane Ida. Adjusted EBITDA grew 4.8% in the third quarter while margins declined 200 basis points to 55.9%, reflecting a return to a normalized rate of headcount growth compared to the prior year and higher year-over-year short-term incentive compensation expense. Nevertheless, this quarter's margin is still 300 basis points above our pre-pandemic levels recorded in 2019 and continues to reflect accelerated investment in our breakout areas like life insurance and telematics as well as our technology modernization, including our cloud transition. 
Energy and Specialized Markets revenue increased 2.5% in the third quarter due to recovery in our consulting and project-based revenues across energy and power. Strong growth in environmental health and safety solutions and in our breakout solutions, including energy transition and chemicals. We continue to benefit from strong adoption of our Lens platform as customers are seeing the value of our integrated cloud-based data data analytical environment, and we are very pleased with their contributions to our annualized contract value progression over the course of the last 2 quarters. 
Adjusted EBITDA declined 2.6% in the third quarter while margins contracted 300 basis points, reflecting tough comparisons from last year when we enacted headcount reductions, furloughs and compensation adjustments in reaction to the challenging operating environment in 2020. This was still well above the 33.3% margin we reported in the third quarter of 2019 before the pandemic. We remind you that some of the costs taken in the third quarter were reversed in the fourth quarter of 2020, making for easier comparisons in fourth quarter '21. 
Within our Energy segment, we are working to combine the proprietary data assets, skill sets, infrastructure, expertise and deep capabilities of our Wood Mackenzie Genscape and PowerAdvocate businesses. Specifically, we are taking the best of breed from each business and combining it with a common data architecture as the backbone. This modern and flexible data architecture will enable more efficient and effective sharing of data, thus accelerating the innovation process for new solutions in key areas like supply chain, cost management, power and renewables, chemicals, hydrogen, carbon and metals and mining. This will also empower stronger cross-sell of solutions across the various customer bases, particularly in the global power and renewable sector as we help our global customers navigate this broader energy transition. 
Financial Services [Audio Gap] next year, we should retain much of the margin expansion we experienced in 2020, delivering margins ahead of our 2019 pre-pandemic level of 47%. Further, we believe that as the COVID impacts continue to abate and global economies further open up we can return to our long-term growth model of 7% organic constant currency revenue growth with core operating leverage, allowing EBITDA to grow faster than revenue. We hope this provides some useful context for you, and we look forward to addressing your questions. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk. Given the large number of analysts we have covering us, we ask that you limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up.

So we have a very dynamic way of assessing the underlying factor costs associated with repairing a structure.

So the depth of the data and the speed of the data both help us to give really reliable signals to our customers.

There are unique conditions associated with the pandemic. But it's -- that's just kind of a particular inside of the general case. So it's speed, it's automation, it's depth of data.

So we have very well-established pathways for recruiting talent into the company that can be from industry, that can be at the entry level. A lot of our focus is on hiring technical talent. Something that we've been doing for years now actually is to go right to the head end of the data analytics and data science educational pipelines and basically sort of build our own programs, where we bring people in as really as their first encounter with industry and then lead them through a series of development activities and deploy them into the business. We have found doing things like that to actually be more cost constructive than simply going out and sort of hand-to-hand combat with other tech companies. We do hire people from name brand technology companies, but we have found that our own efforts to cultivate our own team have been highly reported, and that's not just data science, that is cloud architecture, that is software development. That applies everywhere basically. 
And we like, I think most companies have experienced a degree of the need to be extra alerts to retaining talent coming out of the disrupted or moving through the disruptive moment that we've been in. But actually, our experience has been pretty good. On trend relative to where we've been prior to the pandemic, it's not that different for us. So yes, we're paying attention. Yes, it's important. We have a diverse set of talent sources. And I would mention here that we operate not only in the United States, but also in other economies around the world, including we have a very large footprint in India, which gives us additional options for staffing our team."

I think a lot of businesses are struggling on that front from a reputing retention standpoint. That's 1 dimension of it. I think we would recognize that there probably are some -- we're anticipating some higher costs as most companies are, but we're also experiencing some savings as we adapt to this new environment. We are working through our real estate portfolio, finding efficiencies as we are adopting more remote work. I think our belief is that the level of travel expense is going to be lower than it was previously. And so while we are experiencing some of those pandemic induced inflationary pressures from a recruiting standpoint that I think all companies are. We also are generating probably more net benefits from that. 
And then finally, I would say on the retention standpoint, there are -- 1 thing that we often have to take into account is what is the cost of attrition. You have to bring somebody else in, you have to bring them up the curve. Sometimes that creates opportunities. But often, we find that a -- that you can realize some attractive efficiencies by retaining the talent upfront as opposed to allowing that talent to a trip. So all of those are factors as we think about that cost out."

So thank you, Alex. Let me try to give you some context. And I think the most important thing that -- the most important element that I would draw your attention to because I think it represents where we are seeing the most significant impact from our investment in Lens. And I want to differentiate it from the fact that within energy transition and within chemicals, those are businesses that we had invested in 12, 18 months or so ago and have already been generating double-digit growth there becoming a more significant component of that. But what we are experiencing more recently, which isn't reflected in the revenue numbers yet is the -- our ability to increase the pricing for Lens delivered products. The Lens platform has enabled us to -- has enabled us to demonstrate to clients improved ability to access and interact with the data sets with the analytics. And as I've described before, we have been able to translate that into double-digit price increases for those products where Lens is now a component of what we do. That is contributing directly to the reference that I made to the increase in our subscription growth annualized contract values where we have seen mid-single digits and more recently high single-digit increases and the overall level of that. As those of you that follow other companies with kind of an ACV dynamic, that immediately hits ACV, but it will be realized over time. The other point that I would emphasize that we mentioned is that we currently are only approximately 10% penetrated into our customer base. And so as we further penetrate that customer base, and add more products onto the Lens platform over time, it has a multiplicative effect on the revenue opportunity. And so that's where I would specifically draw your attention in terms of representing the growth opportunity. And for me, certainly, the return opportunity on the investment that we've made in Lens that encourages further investment and acceleration of many of those products. All of that is supported by the ongoing growth. Certainly, anyone I expect on this call has seen the level of focus in the energy transition from all of the press around COP26 is driving nearly incessant demand for our expertise and our perspectives on the energy transition. And then finally, as we pointed out, the consulting element of the business is also experiencing that cyclical uplift of strength in the sector. So hopefully, that gives you some context around what we are experiencing and how we expect that will continue to translate into an improved growth performance as we look ahead."

One of the challenges is that there are a lot of elements that factor into margin. And I appreciate you raising kind of the shorter-term dimension, there were in the third quarter some impacts on margin. Part of that, which we described were some an exceptionally difficult comparison to the third quarter, particularly in energy and specialized markets because of some of the furlough compensation reductions that we took in that period that normalized in this period. And some of that will be -- you will see a corresponding kind of rebound in the fourth quarter when we reverse those based upon the performance of the business. So that's an element that is more acute in the third quarter. In addition, we had some higher level of legal expenses in the third quarter across some of our businesses that, again, was an acute short-term effect. There will be -- so all of that is kind of to say that in the third quarter, there was probably a higher level of expense than we would normally expect impacting margins that they were still above where we were pre pandemic. But going forward, I don't think we expect that same acute impact, there will be ongoing normalization potentially on travel, potentially on compensation as things normalize. But I think that we will still be able to hold on to some meaningful portion of that structural benefit that we've had through the pandemic. Hopefully, that helps you dissect a little bit of the short -- some of the short-term elements that impacted us a little heavily in the third quarter and our expectations ahead."

Data and analytics, I think we've kind of gone that way for a while. Clearly, the other 2 things are kind of intersecting but it's this digital engagement as well as this push towards automation, which we kind of refer to as this interconnected ecosystem. What insurers are trying to do, and you probably experience if you want to go online, you get an auto growth, you can get very quick and efficient amount of growth in a very automated way because all the information about you is about. It's all publicly available. You would clearly provide for yes the privacy. And what we're trying to do is make that experience available to not just personal auto, of homeowners, small commercial, and you have the ability to now get a quote very efficiently, very effectively using what I refer to as both data and analytics to make it cheaper, more efficient and more accurate. And it's all interconnected in a way the digital experience that small business owner or you, as a homeowner, have the ability to get that foot live. And that's where the push is both on the insurtech side as well as the traditional insurers. And I'm proud to say that we were kind of at the forefront of helping people do that. And I think there's a lot of runway there because it's both reducing the cost for insurers as well as creating a better experience for those policyholders. So we'll look forward to that continuing in the coming couple of years. 
I think the next question was a little bit about the vitality impact, I think that we feel like the solutions we have are as robust and as numerous as we've ever had. There's a lot going on at Verisk. I'm excited about it. That's both on the claims side. I think that's on the underwriting side. And I know that we always talk about verticals. I think there's opportunities to take with some of the things that we do today and focus them on insurance, but also see if there's a way to horizontally get into other verticals. And I think that's an exciting dimension as well. As an example, a lot of things we do with climate and climate change. Corporates need to know as we think about ESG and resiliency. Those are the type of things that get us excited, but we're still on the -- certainly early days. So thanks for the question."

So I'm very reluctant to make any forecast of what that is going to be because I think it will depend upon the business circumstances and the environment at the time. 
I do think that we have been able to realize savings, some of which are structural and which we think we will be able to retain over time in terms of real estate costs and probably a lower level of travel.

So that dimension, I think, is also difficult to predict and is our most significant expense from at about 70% of our overall operating expenses. So that would be just the other area that I think is an uncertain variable. Naturally, we have more control on that.

We have consultants that also do that work. So there's competition on that front. There are in kind of thought pieces around what's happening I think with Bloomberg New Energy, they are providing competition. And I think most other large energy data players are certainly looking to take advantage of the demand for analytics and data in the new energy space. We do think that our competitive advantage in that area is 1 that we have been applying and developing our specific data sets on the upstream space in the -- in our power advocate area in terms of what companies are spending on infrastructure for facilities, new generation capabilities, as well as our familiarity with the real-time data that we acquired from our Genscape, which is part of the rationale for why we think that's additive. So we have, I think, a very valuable data set, and we have a great brand and reputation in the energy sector. So there is other competition, but we feel as though we're very competitively differentiated."

The claims process is a very central part of what we do on behalf of all insurers. And 1 of the things that applies when you're the kind of data analytic company that we are is that methodologies can travel across national boundaries, but you still need data at the local level in order to be able to do analysis that is relevant for the local level. And fundamentally, that's what ACTINEO provides. So they are in a particular part of the P&C world in Germany, where they face auto and then sort of the medical issues that arise from automobile access. And that's the part of the marketplace therein. So the growth that it's going to occur relative to ACTINEO will be along a couple of dimensions. One is being potent in Central Europe, we will seek opportunities to push the method out into other national economies. But secondly, we've got a whole set of claims solutions where the methodologies are perfectly applicable to the German market. Now we will have a beachhead in which to go in behind the relationships with the German companies that come along with that canal and now present our other solutions basically. And then we'll do what we always do, which is aggregate ideally, contributory data, which is specific and which is even unique inside these customer relationships and then just have the cumulative benefit of a deeper connection with customers, more forms of value because we have more kinds of data. But within general categories like claims, underwriting is another general category."

It actually is not that big a line when you talk about direct written premium. So sort of the emergence of cyber cover is, in many ways, actually still waiting to happen. But we take a very broad -- our positioning is that we have the broadest set of offerings of all with respect to cybersecure asking about us versus other providers because we sort of we're sort of soup to nuts in the cyberspace. So we model way upfront so that you can have a high-level portfolio view of the amount of cyber risk you might be holding as an insurer in your portfolio, we actually can diligence individual companies for the cyber risk that they represent and that can be used in the risk selection and underwriting process. 
And then on the back end, we've actually got a completely unique activity, which is through our PCS unit where in the same way that insurers tell us after a natural disaster exactly what they're progressively with time, they tell us what their actual claims experience was denominated. We now have a variety of insurers who are doing that with us in the cyber well. So there isn't any other company that does those 3 things that I just mentioned.

That is not the way that we think not at all. So I think that's the primary answer to your question, but I will go back to what Mark said before, 1 of the really nice opportunities for our company is a function of the fact that you get to observe so much of the economy through the mechanism of insurance because almost everything is insured, maybe it's not as completely insured as it should be. But more or less, every category of asset is insured. So you get to see kind of what's going on economy-wide. And my point here is that we really like solutions where I'll call it the killer app grows up in the insurance vertical. But then if it's extensible to other customer groups, well, great. Particularly, if it doesn't need to be modified very much in order for it to be relevant to that next customer group. So I'm really sending you 2 messages here, and I think they're clear, and I hope we have them distinct, which is we don't need to platform ourselves in other verticals. We are interested in following from the powerful place of the insurance industry and the killer apps inside of the insurance industry, if they have applicability in other places, that's good business. And we'll pursue that all day. But we want it yolked to the power plays where we start."

And so that, we believe, is the more material secular trend within the business that as opposed to existing within those discrete upstream, midstream, downstream chemical elements now looking at data across that and building an architecture that allows us to meet those growing needs. I do think that some of this cyclical short-term uplift is encouraging more adoption of those broader applications that we've described. there is a bit of a tailwind effect that we're beginning to experience certainly on the subscription side.

Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our third quarter 2021 earnings conference call. I'm pleased to share that Verisk delivered a solid third quarter result, building on our deep domain expertise, innovative offerings and strong relationships with our customers. Specifically, Verisk delivered organic constant currency revenue growth of 5.1% and organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth of 2.1% for the third quarter. 
What I find encouraging is looking at the results on a 2-year basis to adjust for the lumpiness related to the pandemic. In this view, Verisk delivered 2-year cumulative organic constant currency revenue growth of 8.7% and organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth of 16.8%, demonstrating strong core operating leverage and a sequential improvement in the second quarter.  
Lee will provide more details in his comprehensive financial review. Across insurance, we are seeing strong demand for our products as our customers are striving to become more digital and more automated and are turning to Verisk's solutions to help them. Engagement with our customers remains at very high levels. As we continue our virtual work and our sales force and customer service teams are doing an excellent job staying connected. In fact, we recently hosted our Signature underwriting conference called Verisk Velocity, again, in a virtual format. 
This year's event was another success with over 600 attendees participating across 27 different thematic sessions. This year's focus was accelerating the digital transformation and developing new ways to increase efficiency and improve underwriting outcomes to better serve their customers.  
Strong customer engagement within insurance is translating into strong sales, with growing ACVs, longer contract terms and very robust sales pipelines. To that end, we've been very successful penetrating the new InsureTech companies as they can take advantage of the full suite of Verisk's solutions across underwriting and claims. Additionally, with our more traditional P&C customer base, we are also having success leveraging our scale and our comprehensive insurance solution offering. These are 2 of our competitive advantages. By bundling our solutions together, we're driving increased adoption of new solutions across many different customer segments, and these bundles are proving to be quite sticky.  
One area of growth we are particularly excited about is our international expansion within insurance, which is predominantly in the U.K. today, but we see a long runway as we expand our analytic capabilities within the U.K. and extend our global footprint into new developed markets. Within our Sequel business in the U.K., we are building out a truly integrated and digital ecosystem across carriers, syndicates, brokers and managing general agents throughout the specialty market. And we are bringing in new customers and expanding our suite of products across existing ones.  
Most recently, we made a tuck-in acquisition of Ignite software Systems, a SaaS platform that includes policy administration, rating engine and digital engagement for brokers, managing general agents and insureds. This acquisition expands Sequel's capabilities and enable Sequel to add a modular API-driven SaaS platform to the Sequel suite of products. Within our core underwriting, we are using the time-tested playbook that has worked in the U.S. for years using proprietary data assets to help better price and understand risk and extending to the U.K. with our data in Richmond Hub. Data Insight Hub is enabling the digitization of the personal and commercial lines insurance in the U.K. deploying a data forward strategy to prefill key data elements and provide predictive analytics that help customers with risk assessment and pricing.  
Our recent investment in HUG HUB extends these capacities upstream to support the ecosystem at point of sale and distribution. Our international travel business has experienced significant declines due to pandemic-related travel restrictions, but we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of the rebound with cross-border capital returns. On the claims front, and consistent with our focus on the insurance business and international expansion, we recently announced the acquisition of Actineo, a market leader for personal injury claims digitalization and medical assessment in Germany. Actineo will be integrated into our broader Verisk Claims Europe business and should provide a strong platform to grow our footprint across Continental Europe and establish Verisk as the Pan-European leader in the personal injury and medical nonpractice sectors. 
We are encouraged by the opportunity to create incremental value by helping deploy Actineo technology and services across Europe and leveraging customer relationships. We also plan to introduce other claims solutions to these key European markets.  
And lastly, we are excited about the growth opportunity within international markets for our extreme event business. In June, we released an on-time update to our Japan Typhoon and earthquake models. These updates reflect the latest science and learnings from recent catastrophes in Japan. Our extreme of that business has very strong share in the key Japanese market with both primary insurers and reinsurers as customers. Both of whom rely on our models for the quality of the science and the local knowledge that we incorporate through our partnerships with local insurers. 
Within the Energy segment, we're seeing a strong uptake of our new and innovative solutions including our energy transition and chemicals research as well as our innovative lens platform. We are realizing double-digit growth in ACV for contracts that include lens as our customers recognize the value of this innovative solution. Importantly, lens is being adopted by customers across industries, including upstream oil and gas, financial services and power and renewables. Moreover, with roughly 10% of our customer base on lens today, we see a long runway for growth as we expand it's use cases to include additional commodities and geographies over the next few years.  
You've heard me say before that at Verisk, we are moving ever closer to our customers and that we are on an exciting and successful journey to deliver best-in-class customer experiences. Our collaborations with management leaders, along with a customer-first mindset, helped power this journey. Customer experience is not just the responsibility of our dedicated customer service teams, but it runs throughout the entire organization. 
In the third quarter, colleagues from every part of Verisk participated in Verisk's Discover CX Summit. It was a moment in time when we came together to listen, learn and collaborate on how we can be better partners for our customers. Leaders across every area of the company is sampled to focus on learning CX best practices, and we have emerged with a robust pipeline of ideas that I believe will lead to innovative solutions and outcomes that benefit our customers and Verisk.  
On the personnel front, I'm pleased to publicly welcome Sunita Holzer, as our new Chief Human Resources Officer; and Dianne Greene as our new Head of Inclusion, Diversity & Belonging. Sunita brings with her 3 decades of enterprise-level human resources leadership across several industries, including technology and insurance. Dianne brings a business-centric mindset to ID&B from her decade-long experience as a business leader in the payroll and HR solutions industry. At a time when attracting and retaining diverse talent is top of mind for every business, I am really excited about partnering with Sunita and Dianne to develop a comprehensive and differentiated human capital strategy for Verisk and foster our diverse, inclusive and equitable culture.  
Finally, we are committed to enhancing shareholder value and as part of that commitment to allocating capital to the highest growth and highest return opportunities. Accordingly, Verisk has been undertaking a bottoms-up review of our businesses and portfolio composition. Our review is ongoing with a focus on the most value-creative path for sustainable growth and success and doing what's in the best interest of our shareholders and all of Verisk's stakeholders. As we've said previously, we believe that portfolio changes are probable in the next 2 to 3 quarters, subject to market conditions.  
With that, I will turn the call over to Lee to cover our financial results."

First, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we've posted a quarterly earnings presentation that's available on our website. Moving to the financial results for the quarter.

First, I would like to bring to everyone's attention that we've posted a quarterly earnings presentation that's available on our website. Moving to the financial results for the quarter. On a consolidated and GAAP basis, revenue grew 8% to $759 million. Net income attributable to Verisk increased 8.6% to $202 million while diluted GAAP earnings per share attributable to Verisk increased 10.7% to $1.24.  
Moving to our organic constant currency results. Adjusted for nonoperating items, as defined in the non-GAAP financial measures section of our press release, we are very pleased with our operating results, led by continued and consistent growth in our subscription revenues. 
In the third quarter, organic constant currency revenue grew 5.1%, driven by continued strength in our insurance segment and modest growth in energy and specialized markets. This was offset in part by weakness in the Financial Services segment as we experienced the final quarter of impact from the contract restructurings as well as continued COVID-related impacts. Our non-COVID-sensitive revenues, as we defined at the beginning of the pandemic, increased 5.6% in the third quarter, which was consistent with results reported in the second quarter 2021 despite tougher year-over-year comparisons, as our non-COVID-sensitive revenues included 7.8% in the third quarter of 2020.  
The stable growth in our non-COVID-sensitive revenues, representing approximately 85% of our total revenues reflects the durability and resilience of our primarily subscription model and the mission-critical nature of our solutions. Our COVID-sensitive revenues which represent 15% of our consolidated revenues increased 1.6% as compared to declines of 10% in the third quarter last year. Growth was primarily the result of improvements in consulting in our Energy segment and a return to pre-pandemic growth rates in many of our products and services within insurance, particularly within the U.S. 
We did experience continued COVID-related weakness in our Financial Services segment as COVID forbearance programs are negatively impacting bankruptcy volumes.  
To be specific, our COVID-sensitive revenues increased 8% and 12% within the Insurance and Energy segments, respectively, but registered declines of 28% within financial services. It's also important to note that, that 28% decline also included the impact of the contract restructuring that we have described previously and which ended in the third quarter. Given that Financial Services is the segment with the largest percentage of COVID-sensitive transactional revenues, this had a disproportionate impact on the overall result.  
Organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth was 2.1% in the third quarter. Organic constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth was impacted by tough comparisons as we took aggressive cost actions in the third quarter of 2020 in response to the pandemic across all our segments. Total adjusted EBITDA margin, which includes both organic and inorganic revenue and adjusted EBITDA, was 49.9% in the quarter, down 221 basis points on a year-over-year basis, but still well above our pre-pandemic margin level of 47.4% recorded in the third quarter of 2019. 
Much of the decline is associated with the normalization of our costs as we anniversary the COVID benefits from last year, including reduced headcount and lower incentive compensation. This level of margin also includes approximately 100 basis points of headwind from our ongoing technological transformation, including our cloud transition costs, which we absorbed into our cost structure.  
On that note, let's turn to our segment results on an organic constant currency basis. In the third quarter, Insurance segment revenues increased 7.4%, demonstrating strong resilience in recovery. We saw healthy growth in our industry standard insurance programs, repair cost estimating solutions, claims analytics solutions, catastrophe modeling, life insurance solutions and international insurance software solutions. 
We also experienced solid growth in transactional revenues, including 8% growth in our COVID impacted revenues as we compared against flattish results last year. We also experienced a modest benefit to growth from storm-related revenue resulting from Hurricane Ida. Adjusted EBITDA grew 4.8% in the third quarter while margins declined 200 basis points to 55.9%, reflecting a return to a normalized rate of headcount growth compared to the prior year and higher year-over-year short-term incentive compensation expense. 
Nevertheless, this quarter's margin is still 300 basis points above our pre-pandemic levels recorded in 2019 and continues to reflect accelerated investment in our breakout areas like life insurance and telematics as well as our technology modernization, including our cloud transition.  
Energy and Specialized Markets revenue increased 2.5% in the third quarter due to recovery in our consulting and project-based revenues across energy and power. Strong growth in environmental health and safety solutions and in our breakout solutions, including energy transition and chemicals. We continue to benefit from strong adoption of our Lens platform as customers are seeing the value of our integrated cloud-based data analytical environment, and we are very pleased with their contributions to our annualized contract value progression over the course of the last 2 quarters.  
Adjusted EBITDA declined 2.6% in the third quarter while margins contracted 300 basis points, reflecting tough comparisons from last year when we enacted headcount reductions, furloughs and compensation adjustments in reaction to the challenging operating environment in 2020. This was still well above the 33.3% margin we reported in the third quarter of 2019 before the pandemic. We remind you that some of the costs taken in the third quarter were reversed in the fourth quarter of 2020, making for easier comparisons in fourth quarter '21.  
Within our Energy segment, we are working to combine the proprietary data assets, skill sets, infrastructure, expertise and deep capabilities of our Wood Mackenzie Genscape and PowerAdvocate businesses. Specifically, we are taking the best of breed from each business and combining it with a common data architecture as the backbone. This modern and flexible data architecture will enable more efficient and effective sharing of data, thus accelerating the innovation process for new solutions in key areas like supply chain, cost management, power and renewables, chemicals, hydrogen, carbon and metals and mining. 
This will also empower stronger cross-sell of solutions across the various customer bases, particularly in the global power and renewable sector as we help our global customers navigate this broader energy transition.  
Financial services revenue declined 13.5% in the quarter, reflecting the final quarter of impact from the contract transitions that we undertook in 2020 as well as a lower level of bankruptcy revenue because of government support and forbearance program. 
Spend in form analytics demonstrated strong growth as spending and advertising levels continue to improve as the economy emerges from COVID. Adjusted EBITDA declined 42% in the quarter, reflecting the negative impact of lower sales and a larger impact of corporate expense allocations on the segment's smaller base. Total adjusted EBITDA margins were 19%, still down from the prior year, but an improvement from the first half of 2021 as a result of expense discipline and lower bad debt expense. 
Our reported effective tax rate was 20.8% compared to 22.6% in the prior year quarter, in line with our expectations. Looking ahead, we expect our tax rate to approximate 18% to 20% for the fourth quarter of 2021. The adjusted net income increased 7.4% to $234 million and diluted adjusted EPS increased 9% to $1.44 for the third quarter of 2021. These increases reflect organic growth in the business, contributions from acquisitions, a lower tax rate and a lower average share count. Net cash provided by operating activities was $285 million for the quarter, up 38% from the prior year period. The prior year period's cash flow was negatively impacted by the timing of certain federal income tax payments and certain employer payroll taxes because of the CARES Act. Year-to-date, net cash provided by operating activities was $967 million, reflecting growth of 18% versus the prior year period. Capital expenditures were $61.4 million for the quarter, down 5% versus last year, reflecting cost savings on third-party hardware and software as we move to the cloud. 
We continue to believe that CapEx for 2021 should be in the range of $250 million to $280 million, reflecting our continued investment in our innovation agenda. Our technological transformation as well as the carryover of certain expenditures that were delayed in 2020 as a result of the pandemic. Related to Capex, we expect fixed asset depreciation and amortization should be within the range of $200 million to $215 million and intangible amortization to be approximately $175 million. Both depreciation and amortization elements are subject to FX variability, the timing of purchases and the completion of projects and future M&A activity. 
During the third quarter, we returned $197 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends as our strong cash flow allows us to invest behind our highest growth and highest return capital initiatives, but also return capital to shareholders consistently. 
In summary, we are not sitting still at Verisk as demonstrated by our third quarter performance and Scott's earlier comments regarding our portfolio review. Looking ahead, we have confidence in our ability to manage the cost structure to protect profitability. We continue to believe that we have tough cost comparisons relative to the COVID impact in quarters last year, we should retain much of the margin expansion we experienced in 2020, delivering margins ahead of our 2019 pre-pandemic level of 47%. 
Further, we believe that the COVID impacts continue to abate and global economies further open up, we can return to our long-term growth model of 7% organic constant currency revenue growth with core operating leverage allowing EBITDA to grow faster than revenue. 
We hope this provides some useful context for you, and we look forward to addressing your questions. We continue to appreciate all the support and interest in Verisk.

And then when loss occurs, how to think about the value of the loss and whether the claims amount of loss is accurate. So we're really across the entire insurance value chain. And 1 of the things that helps us to be so relevant for our customers is the speed with which we ingest data signals, which tell us what's going on in the market, and then translate them into a forward view and provide that to our customers. 
So 1 of the things we do is to move as rapidly as the environment is moving. So you referenced Xactware. So just to pick that 1 in particular. So we have a very dynamic way of assessing the underlying factor costs associated with repairing a structure. And the speed with which we update the data helps our customers stay ahead of where the likely next claim is going to be with respect to cost. 
So the depth of the data and the speed of the data both help us to give really reliable signals to our customers. And yes, I mean, the insurance companies are looking to respond to a marketplace that has been moving around a fair amount. But that's really kind of always the case. There are unique conditions associated with the pandemic. But it's -- that's just kind of a particular inside of the general case. So it's speed, it's automation, it's depth of data.

So we have very well-established pathways for recruiting talent into the company that can be from industry, that can be at the entry level. A lot of our focus is on hiring technical talent. Something that we've been doing for years now actually is to go right to the head end of the data analytics and data science educational pipelines and basically sort of build our own programs, where we bring people in as really as their first encounter with industry and then lead them through a series of development activities and deploy them into the business. 
We have found doing things like that to actually be more cost constructive than simply going out and sort of hand-to-hand combat with other tech companies. We do hire people from name brand technology companies, but we have found that our own efforts to cultivate our own team have been highly reported, and that's not just data science, that is cloud architecture, that is software development. That applies everywhere basically. 
And we like, I think most companies have experienced a degree of the need to be extra alerts to retain talent coming out of the disrupted or moving through the disruptive moment that we've been in. But actually, our experience has been pretty good. On trend relative to where we've been prior to the pandemic, it's not that different for us. So yes, we're paying attention. Yes, it's important. We have a diverse set of talent sources. And I would mention here that we operate not only in the United States, but also in other economies around the world, including we have a very large footprint in India, which gives us additional options for staffing our team."

We are working through our real estate portfolio, finding efficiencies as we are adopting more remote work. I think our belief is that the level of travel expense is going to be lower than it was previously. And so while we are experiencing some of those pandemic induced inflationary pressures from a recruiting standpoint that I think all companies are. We also are generating probably more net benefits from that. 
And then finally, I would say on the retention standpoint, there are -- 1 thing that we often have to take into account is what is the cost of attrition. You have to bring somebody else in, you have to bring them up the curve. Sometimes that creates opportunities. But often, we find that a -- that you can realize some attractive efficiencies by retaining the talent upfront as opposed to allowing that talent to a trip.

So thank you, Alex. Let me try to give you some context. And I think the most important thing that -- the most important element that I would draw your attention to because I think it represents where we are seeing the most significant impact from our investment in Lens. And I want to differentiate it from the fact that within energy transition and within chemicals, those are businesses that we had invested in 12, 18 months or so ago and have already been generating double-digit growth there becoming a more significant component of that. 
But what we are experiencing more recently, which isn't reflected in the revenue numbers yet is the -- our ability to increase the pricing for Lens delivered products. The Lens platform has enabled us to -- has enabled us to demonstrate to clients improved ability to access and interact with the data sets with the analytics. And as I've described before, we have been able to translate that into double-digit price increases for those products where Lens is now a component of what we do. 
That is contributing directly to the reference that I made to the increase in our subscription growth annualized contract values where we have seen mid-single digits and more recently high single-digit increases in the overall level of that. As those of you that follow other companies with kind of an ACV dynamic, that immediately hits ACV, but it will be realized over time. The other point that I would emphasize that we mentioned is that we currently are only approximately 10% penetrated into our customer base. And so as we further penetrate that customer base, and add more products onto the Lens platform over time, it has a multiplicative effect on the revenue opportunity. 
And so that's where I would specifically draw your attention in terms of representing the growth opportunity. And for me, certainly, the return opportunity on the investment that we've made in Lens that encourages further investment and acceleration of many of those products. All of that is supported by the ongoing growth. Certainly, anyone I expect on this call has seen the level of focus in the energy transition from all of the press around COP26 is driving nearly incessant demand for our expertise and our perspectives on the energy transition. 
And then finally, as we pointed out, the consulting element of the business is also experiencing that cyclical uplift of strength in the sector. So hopefully, that gives you some context around what we are experiencing and how we expect that will continue to translate into an improved growth performance as we look ahead."

One of the challenges is that there are a lot of elements that factor into margin. And I appreciate you raising kind of the shorter-term dimension, there were in the third quarter some impacts on margin. Part of that, which we described were some an exceptionally difficult comparison to the third quarter, particularly in energy and specialized markets because of some of the furlough compensation reductions that we took in that period that normalized in this period. And some of that will be -- you will see a corresponding kind of rebound in the fourth quarter when we reverse those based upon the performance of the business. 
So that's an element that is more acute in the third quarter. In addition, we had some higher level of legal expenses in the third quarter across some of our businesses that, again, was an acute short-term effect. There will be -- so all of that is kind of to say that in the third quarter, there was probably a higher level of expense than we would normally expect impacting margins that they were still above where we were pre pandemic. But going forward, I don't think we expect that same acute impact. 
There will be ongoing normalization potentially on travel, potentially on compensation as things normalize. But I think that we will still be able to hold on to some meaningful portion of that structural benefit that we've had through the pandemic. Hopefully, that helps you dissect a little bit of the short -- some of the short-term elements that impacted us a little heavily in the third quarter and our expectations ahead."

Data and Analytics, I think we've kind of gone that way for a while. Clearly, the other 2 things are kind of intersecting, but it's this digital engagement as well as this push towards automation, which we kind of refer to as this interconnected ecosystem. 
What insurers are trying to do, and you probably experience if you want to go online, you get an auto growth, you can get very quick and efficient amount of growth in a very automated way because all the information about you is available. It's all publicly available. You would clearly provide for yes the privacy. And what we're trying to do is make that experience available to not just personal auto,  homeowners, small commercial, and you have the ability to now get a quote very efficiently, go very effectively using what I refer to as both data and analytics to make it cheaper, more efficient and more accurate. And it's all interconnected in a way the digital experience that small business owner or you, as a homeowner, have the ability to get that quote live. And that's where the push is both on the InsureTech side as well as the traditional insurers. 
And I'm proud to say that we were kind of at the forefront of helping people do that. And I think there's a lot of runway there because it's both reducing the cost for insurers as well as creating a better experience for those policyholders. So we'll look forward to that continuing in the coming couple of years. 
I think the next question was a little bit about the vitality impact, I think that we feel like the solutions we have are as robust and as numerous as we've ever had. There's a lot going on at Verisk. I'm excited about it. That's both on the claims side. I think that's on the underwriting side. And I know that we always talk about verticals. I think there's opportunities to take with some of the things that we do today and focus them on insurance, but also see if there's a way to horizontally get into other verticals. And I think that's an exciting dimension as well. As an example, a lot of things we do with climate and climate change. Corporates need to know as we think about ESG and resiliency. Those are the type of things that get us excited, but we're still on the -- certainly early days. So thanks for the question."

There is no 1 that collects as broad or provides us comprehensive benchmarking service in that context. And so to a degree, that is a less competitive space for us. 
We're -- we do see more competition is around some of the consulting aspects of the business outside of that benchmarking. And in some of our businesses, such as in fraud detection, naturally, there are a lot of small companies and businesses that are offering similar defection, fraud avoidance types of solutions.

One of the things that's happening is we're doing more development in the cloud. So we've got lots of new things that we're doing that will consume cycles in the cloud in the future that we just literally didn't use to do.

And then obviously, the environment in terms of safety and regulatory aspects is unknown as well. So I'm very reluctant to make any forecast of what that is going to be because I think it will depend upon the business circumstances and the environment at the time. 
I do think that we have been able to realize savings, some of which are structural and which we think we will be able to retain over time in terms of real estate costs and probably a lower level of travel.

There are in kind of thought pieces around what's happening I think with Bloomberg New Energy, they are providing competition. And I think most other large energy data players are certainly looking to take advantage of the demand for analytics and data in the new energy space. 
We do think that our competitive advantage in that area is 1 that we have been applying and developing our specific data sets on the upstream space in the -- in our power advocate area in terms of what companies are spending on infrastructure for facilities, new generation capabilities, as well as our familiarity with the real-time data that we acquired from our Genscape, which is part of the rationale for why we think that's additive.

The claims process is a very central part of what we do on behalf of all insurers. And 1 of the things that applies when you're the kind of data analytic company that we are is that methodologies can travel across national boundaries, but you still need data at the local level in order to be able to do analysis that is relevant for the local level. And fundamentally, that's what ACTINEO provides. So they are in a particular part of the P&C world in Germany, where they face auto and then sort of the medical issues that arise from automobile access. 
And that's the part of the marketplace therein. So the growth that it's going to occur relative to ACTINEO will be along a couple of dimensions. One is being potent in Central Europe, we will seek opportunities to push the method out into other national economies. But secondly, we've got a whole set of claims solutions where the methodologies are perfectly applicable to the German market. Now we will have a beachhead in which to go in behind the relationships with the German companies that come along with that canal and now present our other solutions basically. 
And then we'll do what we always do, which is aggregate ideally, contributory data, which is specific and which is even unique inside these customer relationships and then just have the cumulative benefit of a deeper connection with customers, more forms of value because we have more kinds of data.

So we model way upfront so that you can have a high-level portfolio view of the amount of cyber risk you might be holding as an insurer in your portfolio, we actually can diligence individual companies for the cyber risk that they represent and that can be used in the risk selection and underwriting process. 
And then on the back end, we've actually got a completely unique activity, which is through our PCS unit where in the same way that insurers tell us after a natural disaster exactly what they're progressively with time, they tell us what their actual claims experience was denominated. We now have a variety of insurers who are doing that with us in the cyber well. So there isn't any other company that does those 3 things that I just mentioned.

So I think that's the primary answer to your question, but I will go back to what Mark said before, 1 of the really nice opportunities for our company is a function of the fact that you get to observe so much of the economy through the mechanism of insurance because almost everything is insured, maybe it's not as completely insured as it should be. But more or less, every category of asset is insured. 
So you get to see kind of what's going on economy-wide. And my point here is that we really like solutions where I'll call it the killer app grows up in the insurance vertical. But then if it's extensible to other customer groups, well, great. Particularly, if it doesn't need to be modified very much in order for it to be relevant to that next customer group. So I'm really sending you 2 messages here, and I think they're clear, and I hope we have them distinct, which is we don't need to platform ourselves in other verticals. We are interested in following from the powerful place of the insurance industry and the killer apps inside of the insurance industry, if they have applicability in other places, that's good business.

And so that, we believe, is the more material secular trend within the business that as opposed to existing within those discrete upstream, midstream, downstream chemical elements now looking at data across that and building an architecture that allows us to meet those growing needs. 
I do think that some of this cyclical short-term uplift is encouraging more adoption of those broader applications that we've described.

And maybe this was a little bit implicit in your question, Andrew. Over the course of the last 7 years, there have been 2 remarkable price shocks in the underlying commodity, particularly oil and gas, petroleum, -- There has been a Brexit, and there's been a pandemic. 
Hopefully, the next pandemic is decades away from now. the U.K. can only Brexit once. And the first of the 2 price shocks was totally supply-led. It was basically Saudi Arabia, sort of flexing muscle with Russia. And I think it's interesting to consider the fact that on a go-forward basis, Saudi Aramco now answers to market forces in a way that it didn't 7 years ago, where it was kind of like the Digibank for the Royal family. 
So I think the environment is different than it has been over the last 7 years. And we're structurally different in that our exposure to that as a result of the development of our data businesses, the growth of other elements has substantially muted the impact of that. There will still be some impact that we've described, but it is much less acute than it would have been certainly 3 years ago."
