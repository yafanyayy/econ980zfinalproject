As always, we appreciate your continued trust and investment in ONEOK. Joining me on today's call is Walt Hulse, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Strategy and Corporate Affairs; and Kevin Burdick, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Also available to answer your questions are [indiscernible] Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids; and Jeff Kelly, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas. Before we discuss our 2020 results and 2021 guidance, I want to first express my deep appreciation for our employees who have been working tirelessly through recent extreme winter weather in the U.S. from North Dakota to the Gulf Coast. They have continued to meet the needs of our customers, while faced with personal challenges of their own homes, losing power, without water, freezing pipes, you name it. I continue to be amazed by all that they do to provide exceptional customer service under very challenging circumstances. 
After a year like 2020, and so far in 2021, it's understandable to want to focus on what's ahead. But first, I'd like to highlight several operating, financial and ESG-related accomplishments achieved during a challenging 2020. ONEOK's adjusted EBITDA grew 6% year-over-year despite a global pandemic, reduced worldwide energy demand and depressed financial markets. Our resilient business, the advantages of our integrated assets and the dedication of our employees has never been more evident. The credit goes to those employees who have continued to prioritize the health and safety of the communities, families and fellow employees. Whether continuing to report on-site in order to monitor assets and systems or juggling the complexities of working from home, all of our employees are critical in keeping natural gas and natural gas liquids flowing on our systems, and these energy products are critical for the economy to quickly recover from this pandemic. 
From an ESG perspective, we received numerous recognitions this year, including recently being known, an industry mover in the S&P Global Sustainability Awards and the only North American energy company included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index. ONEOK also was the only Oklahoma based company to receive a perfect score of 100 in  2021 Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality index. 
We formed a stand-alone environmental sustainability team back in mid-2017 that accelerated our ongoing environmental stewardship efforts. In collaboration with those efforts, we recently created a group charged with the commercial development of renewable energy and low-cost on projects. The team is actively researching opportunities that will complement our extensive midstream assets and expertise and not only lower our greenhouse gas emissions, but also help enhance the vital role we expect to play in a future transition to a low-carbon economy. 
Opportunities under evaluation include the further electrification of compression assets, potential carbon capture and storage opportunities, sourcing renewable energy for operations and other longer-term opportunities such as hydrogen transportation and storage. As we develop these opportunities, we'll remain disciplined in our capital approach, applying similar project criteria in terms of return thresholds, contractual commitments and operational fit, just as we do on other projects. 
We accomplished a great deal in 2020. And financially, we ended the year stronger than we started it, with improved leverage and a more solid balance sheet. Strategic financial decisions and strong operating performance has positioned the company for another year of earnings growth in 2021. Yesterday, we announced our 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $2.90 billion to $3.2 billion, which is a 12% year-over-year increase compared with the midpoint. As the fundamentals of our business continue to improve, we're more likely to end the year at the higher end of our earnings guidance range and will likely adjust guidance upward accordingly. 
Earnings growth in 2021 isn't dependent on significant increases in producer activity or on sustained higher commodity prices, although we have seen both in recent months. The earnings power of our assets and available capacity from completed projects enables growth even in an environment continuing to rebound from 2020. Kevin will talk more about the key operational drivers of our guidance shortly. 
Let me touch briefly on the Dakota access pipeline. Since we provided our original outlook in July, we believe that the potential impact to ONEOK, if [indiscernible] were shut down, has significantly decreased. Producers have had time to secure alternative crude transportation, and we've seen crude oil prices increase, making rail transportation even more feasible. We believe that even if [indiscernible] is shut down quickly after a ruling in April, the earnings impact to ONEOK in 2021 would be less than $50 million of EBITDA, assuming the pipeline was shut down for the remainder of the year. We remain confident in the long-term resiliency of our business, our well positioned in integrated assets and especially our employees in these challenging times. While world events have resulted in volatile times, ONEOK's businesses remain resilient, and we'll continue to provide essential services for decades to come, delivering much needed natural gas liquids and natural gas to our customers. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Walt."

One ONEOK's fourth quarter and full year 2020 adjusted EBITDA totaled $742 million and $2.72 billion, respectively, representing year-over-year increases of 12% for the fourth quarter and 6% for the full year. Distributable cash flow was",724,"Thank you, Terry. One ONEOK's fourth quarter and full year 2020 adjusted EBITDA totaled $742 million and $2.72 billion, respectively, representing year-over-year increases of 12% for the fourth quarter and 6% for the full year. Distributable cash flow was nearly $520 million in the fourth quarter, a 6% increase compared with 2019. We also generated more than $100 million of distributable cash flow in excess of dividends paid during the quarter. 
At December 31, net debt-to-EBITDA on an annualized run rate basis was 4.6x compared with 4.8x at the end of 2019. Proactive financial steps taken through 2020 and earnings contributions from completed projects enabled us to improve our leverage metrics despite challenging market conditions. We continue to manage our leverage toward 4x or less and maintain 3.5x as a longer-term aspirational goal. 
We ended 2020 with no borrowings outstanding on our $2.5 billion credit facility and approximately $525 million of cash. ONEOK is now rated investment-grade by 3 major credit rating agencies, as Fitch issued a first-time rating of BBB with a stable outlook in November. Additionally, Moody's and S&P both reaffirmed ONEOK's investment-grade ratings in 2020. 
We proactively paid off upcoming debt maturities, and we're opportunistic in repurchasing nearly $225 million of debt through open market repurchases in 2020. We currently have no debt maturities due before 2022. 
We ended up achieving cost savings of more than $150 million last year compared with our original plan, and would expect a good portion of that to carry over into 2021. 
Last month, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of [ $0. 935 ] or [ $3. 74 ] in on an annualized basis, unchanged from the previous quarter. As Terry mentioned, with yesterday's earnings announcement, we provided a 2021 financial guidance, including a net income midpoint of more than $1.2 billion and an adjusted EBITDA midpoint of $3.05 billion, a 12% increase compared with 2020. 
Earnings expectations are supported by increasing producer activity, ample capacity and efficiency gains from recently completed projects and the continued opportunity for flared gas capture and strong gas to oil ratios in the Williston Basin. Additionally, due to higher natural gas and propane prices, driven by extreme weather across our operating areas over the past 2 weeks, our natural gas pipelines and natural gas liquids segments benefited from our ability to supply increased demand to meet critical needs during this time. We expect benefits from these short-term opportunities to be partially offset by decreased natural gas and natural gas liquid volumes from well freeze ups. But to still represent upside to our guidance midpoint. 
Our 2021 guidance assumes first quarter WTI crude prices at the current strip and assumes a range of $45 to $50 for the remainder of the year. From a producer activity standpoint, we are also assuming volume levels that correspond with a $45 to $50 WTI range. Sustained higher prices will lead to a quicker volume ramp and drive earnings towards the higher end of our guidance range. 
Total capital expenditures for 2021, including growth and maintenance capital, are expected to range between $525 million and $675 million, a more than 70% decrease compared with 2020. 
This range reflects improved producer activity levels and volume expectations, including capital to complete the Bear Creek plant expansion and associated field infrastructure later this year, which we referenced on our third quarter call. Conversations with producers in the Dunn County area of the Williston Basin remain extremely positive and the likelihood of meeting this additional capital this year is high. The original adjusted EBITDA multiple of 4 to 6x still holds for this project with the multiple [indiscernible] remaining capital being much lower. 
In terms of 2020 capital expenditures, we completed an expansion of our Elk Creek pipeline in December, another example of low capital operating leverage on our system. The $100 million expansion increased capacity by 60,000 barrels per day, and provides added transportation capacity on our most efficient pipeline out of the Williston Basin. As we like to remind people, every 25,000 barrels per day of NGLs from the region contributes approximately $100 million of annual EBITDA to ONEOK. 
Financially, our priorities in 2021 remain largely unchanged, with our primary focus on debt reduction and investing alongside our customers. 
I'll now turn the call over to Kevin for a closer look at our operations."
293889,701217709,2219551,"ONEOK, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2021",2021-02-23,"Earnings Calls","ONEOK, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Walt. I'll start with a quick recap of fourth quarter operations and then discuss 2021 growth drivers. In our natural gas liquids segment, fourth quarter raw feed throughput from the Rockies region increased 13% from the third quarter 2020 and",1249,"Thank you, Walt. I'll start with a quick recap of fourth quarter operations and then discuss 2021 growth drivers. In our natural gas liquids segment, fourth quarter raw feed throughput from the Rockies region increased 13% from the third quarter 2020 and 24% year-over-year. In January, propane plus volumes from the region exceeded our fourth quarter average despite typical winter weather challenges. In the Mid-Continent region, ethane on our system decreased nearly 40,000 barrels per barrels per day in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter, primarily due to high ethane inventories from hurricane-related petrochemical outages in the third quarter. 
In the Permian Gulf Coast region, raw feed throughput volumes were lower in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter due to the short-term fractionation-only contract that rolled off as well as a third-party plant outage and reduced ethane on our system. 
Moving on to the natural gas gathering and processing segment. In the Rocky Mountain region, fourth quarter volume -- fourth quarter processed volumes increased 16% compared with the third quarter and 11% year-over-year as nearly all curtailed volume came back online. The return of volume with a high fee percentage in the Rockies, combined with lower volumes in the Mid-Continent, drove the segment's average fee rate to $1.04 per MMBtu compared with $0.94 per MMBtu in the third quarter. 
In the natural gas pipeline segment, we reported another strong quarter of stable fee-based earnings with firm capacity 95% contracted. The segment continues to provide ONEOK with firm fee-based earnings driven by end-use demand. You can find more detailed information on our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results in our earnings materials. 
Now moving on to 2021. As we sit today, the operating environment is much improved from even a few months ago. Conversations with our customers remain positive, and we're seeing increasing producer activity across our operations. Our 2021 volume guidance at the midpoint would result in a 7% increase in total NGL volume and a 5% increase in total natural gas processing volumes compared with 2020. 
In the natural gas liquids segment, we expect volume growth to be driven by projects completed in 2019 and 2020, continued growth from well completions and the ramp of new plant connections and expansions completed in 2020 and 2021. 
In the Williston Basin, the recent low-cost expansion of our Elk Creek pipeline increased its capacity to 300,000 barrels per day, and increased our total NGL capacity from the region to 440,000 barrels per day. With this expansion, we have ample capacity to transport our Williston and Powder River Basin volumes, exclusively on the Elk Creek pipeline at the beginning of this year, which reduces transportation costs paid the overland pass pipeline and is expected to result ithe $40 million to $50 million in additional earnings in 2021. The Elk Creek expansion provides added capacity, which is also available for potential ethane recovery, if needed. 
Our current NGL volume guidance does not assume Williston Basin ethane recovery, but does assume partial Mid-Continent ethane recovery. We currently have approximately 100,000 barrels per day of incremental ethane opportunity in both the Mid-Continent and Williston Basin. 
As we look forward, domestic and international petrochemical demand and export dynamics look strong, but we continue to expect ethane volumes on our system to fluctuate throughout 2021. With available pipeline capacity between Conway and Mont Belvieu, the differential between the 2 market centers is expected to be near the historical average of $0.02 to $0.03 per gallon for ethane. However, so far in 2021, we've seen prices for several of the NGL products fluctuate outside of this range. Recent extreme winter weather and the resulting increase in propane prices in the Mid-Continent created opportunities for both our optimization and marketing business as we utilize our pipeline and storage assets to meet market needs. 
In the Permian Gulf Coast region, our firm contract to offload 25,000 barrels per day on third-party NGL pipeline expired at the end of 2020, and these volumes are now flowing on our system, eliminating the additional transportation costs. 
From a federal land perspective, we estimate that less than 10% of our NGL volume is from acreage on Federal lands, primarily in the Permian Basin. 
Moving on to the natural gas gathering and processing segment. Higher 2021 volumes are expected to come from the Williston Basin. There are currently 16 rigs operating in the basin with 8 on our dedicated acreage. Our conversations with producers indicate that in the current pricing environment, they expect to bring more rigs back to the region once weather improves in the spring. There also remains a large inventory of drilled the uncompleted wells in the basin, with more than 650 basin-wide and more than 375 on our dedicated acreage. The capture of additional flared natural gas in the region remains an opportunity. The latest North Dakota data, which is for the month of December, showed the state achieving a record of 94% gas capture. This leaves approximately 185 million cubic feet per day still flaring in the basin, with approximately half of that on 1 of its dedicated acres. Increasing rig activity, flared gas capture, DUCs and continually increasing gas to oil ratios will provide solid tailwinds for volume growth in the region. 
At the midpoint of our guidance, we expect a 17% increase in 2021 processed volumes compared with 2020, which would result in an average volume greater than 1.2 billion cubic feet per day. We expect to connect between 275 and 325 wells in the region this year, which would be 25 completions per month at the midpoint. The segment's average fee rate is expected to range between $0.95 and $1 in 2021 based on our volume mix assumptions for the year. 
As we said previously, nearly 80% of our dedicated acreage in the Williston Basin is on private land, The smaller portion on Federal land is primarily outside of the core Basin acreage, where little to no activity was expected. In the Mid-Continent region, we expect to connect 30 wells in 2021, the same amount connected in 2020. Flat rig activity and natural production declines in the region are factored into our volume guidance for the year. However, producers have indicated that with strengthening commodity prices, particularly natural gas and NGLs, they are evaluating adding rigs in the [indiscernible] areas. 
In the natural gas pipeline segment, we expect transportation capacity to be approximately 95% contracted in 2021. As we've experienced recent extreme cold temperatures across our operating areas, we've continued to transport natural gas on our extensive natural gas pipeline systems to the markets that need it most. Our well positioned assets and connectivity with end use customers have enabled us to provide services on our pipelines to meet higher demand during this critical time. 
In both the Permian and Mid-Continent areas, we're experiencing a significant reduction of supply due to well freeze offs. ONEOK's more than 52 billion cubic feet of natural gas storage assets, which are primarily located in the Mid-Continent we're able to bridge the supply shortfall by providing natural gas to meet critical needs. Some of the gas provided from storage is owned by ONEOK, which we retain through our transportation contracts and sell as part of our normal course of operations. 
While these were short-term weather events, our preparedness, and our ability to quickly react and adjust services for customers highlights operational flexibility and financial upside in an already financially stable segment. 
Terry, that concludes my remarks."

As it relates to northern border and potential for ethane, just that potential still exists as you see volumes continue to increase in the basin. On the gas side, that high BTu gas is going to go into northern border. And so the math just continues to work with the blended content or the heat content is going to go up, which, over time, is going to drive the need to pull that back down a little bit. Northern border proposed the tariff, forecasting to go back and work with shippers and producers and other stakeholders in the region.

And then just, in answering the question about the rigs, you said it was below 20. If I do my math, you needed 25 wells to stay flat per month. When I divide that by 2, as I think about 2 miles per rig, but so we more around 13 or 14 rigs. Just wondering if you could clarify those points."

Also available to answer your questions are Sheridan Swords, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids, and Jeff Kelly, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas. 
Before we discuss our 2020 results and 2021 guidance, I want to first express my deep appreciation for our employees who have been working tirelessly through recent extreme winter weather in the U.S. from North Dakota to the Gulf Coast. They have continued to meet the needs of our customers, while faced with personal challenges of their own homes, losing power, without water, freezing pipes, you name it. I continue to be amazed by all that they do to provide exceptional customer service under very challenging circumstances. 
After a year like 2020, and so far in 2021, it's understandable to want to focus on what's ahead. But first, I'd like to highlight several operating, financial and ESG-related accomplishments achieved during a challenging 2020. ONEOK's adjusted EBITDA grew 6% year-over-year despite a global pandemic, reduced worldwide energy demand and depressed financial markets. Our resilient business, the advantages of our integrated assets and the dedication of our employees has never been more evident. The credit goes to those employees who have continued to prioritize the health and safety of the communities, families and fellow employees. Whether continuing to report on-site in order to monitor assets and systems or juggling the complexities of working from home, all of our employees are critical in keeping natural gas and natural gas liquids flowing on our systems, and these energy products are critical for the economy to quickly recover from this pandemic. 
From an ESG perspective, we received numerous recognitions this year, including recently being named, an industry mover in the S&P Global Sustainability Awards and the only North American energy company included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index. ONEOK also was the only Oklahoma based company to receive a perfect score of 100 in 2021 Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality index. 
We formed a stand-alone environmental sustainability team back in mid-2017 that accelerated our ongoing environmental stewardship efforts. In collaboration with those efforts, we recently created a group charged with the commercial development of renewable energy and low carbon projects. The team is actively researching opportunities that will complement our extensive midstream assets and expertise and not only lower our greenhouse gas emissions, but also helped enhance the vital role we expect to play in a future transition to a low-carbon economy. 
Opportunities under evaluation include the further electrification of compression assets, potential carbon capture and storage opportunities, sourcing renewable energy for operations and other longer-term opportunities such as hydrogen transportation and storage. As we develop these opportunities, we'll remain disciplined in our capital approach, applying similar project criteria in terms of return thresholds, contractual commitments and operational fit, just as we do on other projects. 
We accomplished a great deal in 2020. And financially, we ended the year stronger than we started it, with improved leverage and a more solid balance sheet. Strategic financial decisions and strong operating performance has positioned the company for another year of earnings growth in 2021. Yesterday, we announced our 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $2.90 billion to $3.2 billion, which is a 12% year-over-year increase compared with the midpoint. As the fundamentals of our business continue to improve, we're more likely to end the year at the higher end of our earnings guidance range and will likely adjust guidance upward accordingly. 
Earnings growth in 2021 isn't dependent on significant increases in producer activity or on sustained higher commodity prices, although we have seen both in recent months. The earnings power of our assets and available capacity from completed projects enables growth even in an environment continuing to rebound from 2020. Kevin will talk more about the key operational drivers of our guidance shortly. 
Let me touch briefly on the Dakota access pipeline. Since we provided our original outlook in July, we believe that the potential impact to ONEOK, if DAPL were shut down, has significantly decreased. Producers have had time to secure alternative crude transportation, and we've seen crude oil prices increase, making rail transportation even more feasible. We believe that even if DAPL is shut down quickly after a ruling in April, the earnings impact to ONEOK in 2021 would be less than $50 million of EBITDA, assuming the pipeline was shut down for the remainder of the year. We remain confident in the long-term resiliency of our business, our well positioned integrated assets and especially our employees in these challenging times. While world events have resulted in volatile times, ONEOK's businesses remain resilient, and we'll continue to provide essential services for decades to come, delivering much needed natural gas liquids and natural gas to our customers. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Walt."

One ONEOK's fourth quarter and full year 2020 adjusted EBITDA totaled $742 million and $2.72 billion, respectively, representing year-over-year increases of 12% for the fourth quarter and 6% for the full year. Distributable cash flow was",717,"Thank you, Terry. One ONEOK's fourth quarter and full year 2020 adjusted EBITDA totaled $742 million and $2.72 billion, respectively, representing year-over-year increases of 12% for the fourth quarter and 6% for the full year. Distributable cash flow was nearly $520 million in the fourth quarter, a 6% increase compared with 2019. We also generated more than $100 million of distributable cash flow in excess of dividends paid during the quarter. 
At December 31, net debt-to-EBITDA on an annualized run rate basis was 4.6x compared with 4.8x at the end of 2019. Proactive financial steps taken through 2020 and earnings contributions from completed projects enabled us to improve our leverage metrics despite challenging market conditions. We continue to manage our leverage toward 4x or less and maintain 3.5x as a longer-term aspirational goal. 
We ended 2020 with no borrowings outstanding on our $2.5 billion credit facility and approximately $525 million of cash. ONEOK is now rated investment-grade by 3 major credit rating agencies, as Fitch issued a first-time rating of BBB with a stable outlook in November. Additionally, Moody's and S&P both reaffirmed ONEOK's investment-grade ratings in 2020. 
We proactively paid off upcoming debt maturities, and we're opportunistic in repurchasing nearly $225 million of debt through open market repurchases in 2020. We currently have no debt maturities due before 2022. 
We ended up achieving cost savings of more than $150 million last year compared with our original plan and would expect a good portion of that to carry over into 2021. 
Last month, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.935 or $3.74 on an annualized basis, unchanged from the previous quarter. As Terry mentioned, with yesterday's earnings announcement, we provided 2021 financial guidance, including a net income midpoint of more than $1.2 billion and an adjusted EBITDA midpoint of $3.05 billion, a 12% increase compared with 2020. 
Earnings expectations are supported by increasing producer activity, ample capacity and efficiency gains from recently completed projects and the continued opportunity for flared gas capture and strong gas to oil ratios in the Williston Basin. Additionally, due to higher natural gas and propane prices, driven by extreme weather across our operating areas over the past 2 weeks, our natural gas pipelines and natural gas liquids segments benefited from our ability to supply increased demand to meet critical needs during this time. We expect benefits from these short-term opportunities to be partially offset by decreased natural gas and natural gas liquid volumes from well freeze ups, that still represent upside to our guidance midpoints. 
Our 2021 guidance assumes first quarter WTI crude prices at the current strip and assumes a range of $45 to $50 for the remainder of the year. From a producer activity standpoint, we are also assuming volume levels that correspond with a $45 to $50 WTI range. Sustained higher prices will lead to a quicker volume ramp and drive earnings towards the higher end of our guidance range. 
Total capital expenditures for 2021, including growth and maintenance capital, are expected to range between $525 million and $675 million, a more than 70% decrease compared with 2020. 
This range reflects improved producer activity levels and volume expectations, including capital to complete the Bear Creek plant expansion and associated field infrastructure later this year, which we referenced on our third quarter call. Conversations with producers in the Dunn County area of the Williston Basin remain extremely positive and the likelihood of meeting this additional capital this year is high. The original adjusted EBITDA multiple of 4 to 6x still holds for this project with the multiple on the incremental remaining capital being much lower. 
In terms of 2020 capital expenditures, we completed an expansion of our Elk Creek pipeline in December, another example of low capital operating leverage on our system. The $100 million expansion increased capacity by 60,000 barrels per day and provides added transportation capacity on our most efficient pipeline out of the Williston Basin. As we like to remind people, every 25,000 barrels per day of NGLs from the region contributes approximately $100 million of annual EBITDA to ONEOK. 
Financially, our priorities in 2021 remain largely unchanged, with our primary focus on debt reduction and investing alongside our customers. 
I'll now turn the call over to Kevin for a closer look at our operations."
293889,701217709,2219738,"ONEOK, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2021",2021-02-23,"Earnings Calls","ONEOK, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Walt. I'll start with a quick recap of fourth quarter operations and then discuss 2021 growth drivers. In our natural gas liquids segment, fourth quarter raw feed throughput from the Rockies region increased 13% from the third quarter 2020 and",1247,"Thank you, Walt. I'll start with a quick recap of fourth quarter operations and then discuss 2021 growth drivers. In our natural gas liquids segment, fourth quarter raw feed throughput from the Rockies region increased 13% from the third quarter 2020 and 24% year-over-year. In January, propane plus volumes from the region exceeded our fourth quarter average despite typical winter weather challenges. In the Mid-Continent region, ethane on our system decreased nearly 40,000 barrels per barrels per day in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter, primarily due to high ethane inventories from hurricane-related petrochemical outages in the third quarter. 
In the Permian Gulf Coast region, raw feed throughput volumes were lower in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter due to the short-term fractionation-only contract that rolled off as well as a third-party plant outage and reduced ethane on our system. 
Moving on to the natural gas gathering and processing segment. In the Rocky Mountain region, fourth quarter volume -- fourth quarter processed volumes increased 16% compared with the third quarter and 11% year-over-year as nearly all curtailed volume came back online. The return of volume with a high fee percentage in the Rockies, combined with lower volumes in the Mid-Continent, drove the segment's average fee rate to $1.04 per MMBtu compared with $0.94 per MMBtu in the third quarter. 
In the natural gas pipeline segment, we reported another strong quarter of stable fee-based earnings with firm capacity 95% contracted. The segment continues to provide ONEOK with firm fee-based earnings driven by end-use demand. You can find more detailed information on our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results in our earnings materials. 
Now moving on to 2021. As we sit today, the operating environment is much improved from even a few months ago. Conversations with our customers remain positive, and we're seeing increasing producer activity across our operations. Our 2021 volume guidance at the midpoint would result in a 7% increase in total NGL volume and a 5% increase in total natural gas processing volumes compared with 2020. 
In the natural gas liquids segment, we expect volume growth to be driven by projects completed in 2019 and 2020, continued growth from well completions and the ramp of new plant connections and expansions completed in 2020 and 2021. 
In the Williston Basin, the recent low-cost expansion of our Elk Creek pipeline increased its capacity to 300,000 barrels per day and increased our total NGL capacity from the region to 440,000 barrels per day. With this expansion, we have ample capacity to transport our Williston and Powder River Basin volumes, exclusively on the Elk Creek pipeline at the beginning of this year, which reduces transportation costs paid the overland pass pipeline and is expected to result in $40 million to $50 million in additional earnings in 2021. The Elk Creek expansion provides added capacity, which is also available for potential ethane recovery, if needed. 
Our current NGL volume guidance does not assume Williston Basin ethane recovery but does assume partial Mid-Continent ethane recovery. We currently have approximately 100,000 barrels per day of incremental ethane opportunity in both the Mid-Continent and Williston Basin. 
As we look forward, domestic and international petrochemical demand and export dynamics look strong, but we continue to expect ethane volumes on our system to fluctuate throughout 2021. With available pipeline capacity between Conway and Mont Belvieu, the differential between the 2 market centers is expected to be near the historical average of $0.02 to $0.03 per gallon for ethane. However, so far in 2021, we've seen prices for several of the NGL products fluctuate outside of this range. Recent extreme winter weather and the resulting increase in propane prices in the Mid-Continent created opportunities for both our optimization and marketing business as we utilize our pipeline and storage assets to meet market needs. 
In the Permian Gulf Coast region, our firm contract to offload 25,000 barrels per day on third-party NGL pipeline expired at the end of 2020, and these volumes are now flowing on our system, eliminating the additional transportation costs. 
From a federal land perspective, we estimate that less than 10% of our NGL volume is from acreage on Federal lands, primarily in the Permian Basin. 
Moving on to the natural gas gathering and processing segment. Higher 2021 volumes are expected to come from the Williston Basin. There are currently 16 rigs operating in the basin with 8 on our dedicated acreage. Our conversations with producers indicate that in the current pricing environment, they expect to bring more rigs back to the region once weather improves in the spring. There also remains a large inventory of drilled the uncompleted wells in the basin, with more than 650 basin-wide and more than 375 on our dedicated acreage. The capture of additional flared natural gas in the region remains an opportunity. The latest North Dakota data, which is for the month of December, showed the state achieving a record of 94% gas capture. This leaves approximately 185 million cubic feet per day still flaring in the basin, with approximately half of that on ONEOK's dedicated acreage. Increasing rig activity, flared gas capture, DUCs and continually increasing gas to oil ratios will provide solid tailwinds for volume growth in the region. 
At the midpoint of our guidance, we expect a 17% increase in 2021 processed volumes compared with 2020, which would result in an average volume greater than 1.2 billion cubic feet per day. We expect to connect between 275 and 325 wells in the region this year, which would be 25 completions per month at the midpoint. The segment's average fee rate is expected to range between $0.95 and $1 in 2021 based on our volume mix assumptions for the year. 
As we said previously, nearly 80% of our dedicated acreage in the Williston Basin is on private land. The smaller portion on Federal land is primarily outside of the core Basin acreage, where little to no activity was expected. In the Mid-Continent region, we expect to connect 30 wells in 2021, the same amount connected in 2020. Flat rig activity and natural production declines in the region are factored into our volume guidance for the year. However, producers have indicated that with strengthening commodity prices, particularly natural gas and NGLs, they are evaluating adding rigs in the stackings period.
In the natural gas pipeline segment, we expect transportation capacity to be approximately 95% contracted in 2021. As we've experienced recent extreme cold temperatures across our operating areas, we've continued to transport natural gas on our extensive natural gas pipeline systems to the markets that need it most. Our well positioned assets and connectivity with end use customers have enabled us to provide services on our pipelines to meet higher demand during this critical time. 
In both the Permian and Mid-Continent areas, we're experiencing a significant reduction of supply due to well freeze offs. ONEOK's more than 52 billion cubic feet of natural gas storage assets, which are primarily located in the Mid-Continent, we're able to bridge the supply shortfall by providing natural gas to meet critical needs. Some of the gas provided from storage is owned by ONEOK, which we retain through our transportation contracts and sell as part of our normal course of operations. 
While these were short-term weather events, our preparedness, and our ability to quickly react and adjust services for customers highlights operational flexibility and financial upside in an already financially stable segment. 
Terry, that concludes my remarks."

As it relates to northern border and potential for ethane, just that potential still exists as you see volumes continue to increase in the basin.

And so the math just continues to work with the blended content or the heat content is going to go up, which, over time, is going to drive the need to pull that back down a little bit. Northern border proposed the tariff, forecasting to go back and work with shippers and producers and other stakeholders in the region.

So much is written about what the basin needs to hold production flat that all that is typically crude oil based.

ONEOK's solid first quarter results are providing positive momentum as we enter warmer operating months, volumes on our system and our outlook for the year continues to improve, supporting the increase to our financial guidance which we announced yesterday. Even without the weather-related earnings impact in the first quarter, our base business earnings increased compared with the fourth quarter. But while the quarter's results were positive, winter storm Uri did provide us with significant operational challenges that I want to highlight. 
Our employees' preparation before the extreme weather event and hard work during it enabled us to operate with very few interruptions. Operations teams ensured our assets were weatherized for extreme conditions, and that our employees were on-site and prepared to make the necessary adjustments to keep that running. Many of our employees were faced with challenges of their own, including limited or no heat, running water or electricity at their own homes, but still work to help ONEOK provide essential natural gas and NGLs when needed most. 
Despite these extraordinary weather conditions, we continue to meet the critical needs of our customers, including natural gas utilities and electric power plants. Our natural gas pipeline and storage assets were particularly well positioned to address the needs for natural gas. The segment's ability to continue providing reliable service helps meet increased natural gas demand and contributed to higher adjusted EBITDA during the quarter. Kevin will provide more details in a moment. 
Despite weather-related volume impacts across our operations, strength in our base business was evident in our Rocky Mountain region, NGL and natural gas volumes during the quarter. The Williston Basin continues to outperform expectations and provide us with solid and stable earnings. 
As I've said before, ONEOK's earnings growth in 2021 is not dependent on increased rig activity or increasing commodity prices. The opportunities available to us are from a robust drilled but uncompleted well inventory, increased natural gas capture and rising gas to oil ratios in the Williston Basin and increasing ethane demand. 
The opportunity for earnings growth without the need for significant investment is unique to ONEOK and our strategic assets in key operating areas. 
With yesterday's earnings announcement, we raised expectations for 2021 and now expect adjusted EBITDA growth of more than 17% compared with 2020. Our higher guidance expectations include the latest producer forecasts and drilling plans, and our earnings range also includes the potential impact from a shutdown of the Dakota access pipeline. 
Increasing producer activity, higher commodity prices and strengthening energy markets have further enhanced our view of 2021 and are setting up to provide positive momentum as we exit the year. 
As we look toward 2022, high single to low double-digit growth in EBITDA appears reasonable in the $50 to $70 per barrel price range when you adjust 2021 for the approximately $90 million weather impact to revised guidance. We also continue to look for opportunities outside of our traditional growth drivers to enhance our businesses. 
Our sustainability and renewables teams continue to actively research opportunities that will complement our extensive midstream assets and expertise. They're focusing on opportunities to lower our greenhouse gas emissions while enhancing profitability. Further strengthening the vital role we expect to play in a low-carbon economy. 
Opportunities under evaluation include the further electrification of compression assets, potential carbon capture and storage projects, sourcing renewable energy for operations and other longer term investments, such as hydrogen transportation and storage. And as always, we'll remain disciplined in our capital approach as we develop these opportunities. Demand for the products we transport remain strong. The pandemic and recent weather events have further highlighted the importance of natural gas, NGLs and the many end-use products they help create, which all play a vital role in helping us to lead safer and healthier lives. Our ability to transport these products safely and responsibly to markets is key to their ultimate end use. This quarter once again proved our ability to do that, even in the most extreme conditions. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Walt to discuss our financial performance and updated 2021 guidance."
293889,710056020,2260733,"ONEOK, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2021",2021-04-28,"Earnings Calls","ONEOK, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Terry. With yesterday's earnings announcement, we increased our 2021 net income and earnings per share guidance 10% and adjusted EBITDA guidance 5% compared with our original expectations provided in late February.

With yesterday's earnings announcement, we increased our 2021 net income and earnings per share guidance 10% and adjusted EBITDA guidance 5% compared with our original expectations provided in late February. We now expect a net income midpoint of $1.35 billion or $3.02 per share, and an adjusted EBITDA midpoint of $3.2 billion this year. 
At the segment level, we increased 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance for the natural gas gathering and processing and natural gas pipeline segments, primarily due to increasing producer activity from higher commodity prices and incorporating the results of the first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA guidance for the natural gas liquids segment decreased slightly, primarily due to reduced volumes and lower ethane demand in the first quarter related to winter storm Uri. 
Total capital expenditures for 2021, including growth and maintenance capital, remain unchanged from our original expectations of $525 million to $675 million, a more than 70% decrease compared with 2020. This range includes capital to complete the Bear Creek plant expansion and associated field infrastructure in the fourth quarter of this year and a low-cost expansion of the Arbuckle II pipeline in the second quarter. 
Now a brief overview of our first quarter financial performance. ONEOK's first quarter 2021 net income totaled $386 million or $0.86 per share. First quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $866 million, a 24% increase year-over-year and a 17% increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2020. Distributable cash flow was more than $660 million in the first quarter. A 27% increase year-over-year and a 28% increase compared with the fourth quarter 2020. First quarter dividend coverage was nearly 1.6x, and we generated more than $245 million of distributable cash flow in excess of dividends paid during the quarter. 
Our March 31 net debt-to-EBITDA on an annualized run rate basis was 3.98x compared with 4.6x at the end of 2020. We ended the quarter -- the first quarter with no borrowings on our $2.5 billion credit facility and more than $400 million of cash. Earlier this month, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.935 or $3.74 per share on an annualized basis, unchanged from the previous quarter. Healthy earnings in the first quarter provided momentum for 2021 and helped to accelerate our deleveraging efforts. 
As Terry mentioned, increasing producer activity, ample capacity on our systems, and the continued opportunity for flared gas capture and strong guest to oil ratios in the Williston Basin and increasing ethane demand continue to support our base business and increase financial expectations this year. 
I'll now turn the call over to Kevin for a closer look at our operations."
293889,710056020,2260733,"ONEOK, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2021",2021-04-28,"Earnings Calls","ONEOK, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Walt.

Winter storm Uri impacted operations across all 3 of our business segments in February. Reduced volumes due to well freeze offs, especially in the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast Permian regions, increased electricity cost and customer facility outages presented challenges during the quarter. However, our ability to meet increased demand for natural gas and NGLs during the period helped to more than offset the volume impacts. Volumes across our operations returned quickly following the extreme weather with NGL raw feed throughput and and natural gas processing volumes in the Rocky Mountain region in March, exceeding our first quarter 2021 averages. 
Let's take a closer look at each of our businesses. Starting with the natural gas pipeline segment. The safe and reliable operations of our pipeline and storage assets through the storm provided critical transportation services and storage withdrawals for our customers. In addition, we sold 5.2 Bcf of natural gas, which we previously held in inventory into the market in the first quarter 2021 to help meet the increased demand. This compares with 1.2 Bcf that we sold in the first quarter of 2020. Our ability to provide reliable service throughout the extreme weather conditions highlights the importance of market connected pipelines and storage assets and the value of these vital services. Since the storm, we've received increased interest from customers seeking additional long-term transportation and storage capacity on our system. This morning, we initiated an open season for more than 1 Bcf of incremental firm storage capacity at our West Texas storage assets. 
In our natural gas liquids segment, first quarter 2021 earnings increased compared with the fourth quarter of 2020 despite the volume impact from winter storm Uri. System-wide volumes were reduced by an average of approximately 64,000 barrels per day during the quarter, with the largest impacts in the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast Permian regions. During the first quarter, increased optimization and marketing activities in the segment related primarily to higher commodity prices and wider spreads between Conway and Mont Belvieu prices, presented opportunities to utilize our integrated NGL pipeline and storage assets to meet market needs, helping to partially offset volume and cost-related impacts. 
First quarter raw feed throughput from the Rocky Mountain region increased 4% compared with the fourth quarter of 2020 and 20% year-over-year despite an 11,000 barrel per day impact from winter storm Uri. As we sit today, volumes from the region have reached more than 300,000 barrels per day. 
During the quarter, ethane volumes on our system in the Rocky Mountain region increased compared with the fourth quarter 2020 as we incented some ethane recovery, which we have talked about in the past. 
On a short-term basis, we were able to incent recovery by purchasing ethane at several gas plants at a premium value to natural gas, selling it into the Mont Belvieu ethane market and collecting the difference while increasing producer netbacks and NGL volumes on our system. Continued ethane recovery from the region will depend on regional natural gas and ethane pricing and is not included in our updated guidance. 
Economics in the Mid-Continent region also provided the opportunity to incentivize ethane recovery and we continue to expect partial recovery in the region throughout the remainder of the year, which is included in our guidance. In the Permian Basin, we saw increased ethane rejection in the first quarter. Overall, petrochemical facility outages related to winter storm Uri reduced demand for ethane during the quarter. We expect ethane recovery in the Permian Basin to continue ramping back up as petrochemical demand returns following February storm impacts with a return to near full recovery in the second half of 2021. 
Discretionary ethane that can be recovered on our system in both the Mid-Continent and Rocky Mountain regions remains approximately 100,000 barrels per day. In the Rockies region, full recovery would provide an opportunity for $400 million in an annual adjusted EBITDA at full rates. Our opportunity for recovery in either region at any given time will fluctuate based on regional natural gas pricing, ethane economics and potential incentivized recovery. 
Moving on to the natural gas gathering and processing segment. In the Rocky Mountain region, first quarter processed volumes increased 5% year-over-year despite colder-than-normal weather in February. In March, volumes exceeded 1.2 billion cubic feet per day, a level we can maintain even without increased producer activity. Our ability to capture additional flared gas rising gas to oil ratios and a large inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells on our acreage are the key drivers of our 2021 volume expectations. 
Recent producer M&A activity in the Williston Basin has highlighted new drilling plans on acreage that, in some cases, may not have been developed in the near term, but now likely will be. And indications from several of our producers in the basin, point to increasing activity in the second half of 2021, particularly in Dunn County. In response to this, we've resumed construction on our Bear Creek processing plant expansion and expected to be complete in the fourth quarter of this year. Once complete, we will have approximately 1.7 Bcf per day of processing capacity in the basin, and we'll be able to grow our volumes with minimal capital as producer activity levels increase. 
In the first quarter, we connected 38 wells in the Rocky Mountain region and expect to connect more than 300 this year. Based on very recent producers completion schedules we expect a significant increase in well connect in the second and third quarter as completion activity picks up with improved weather. There are currently 16 rigs operating in the basin with 8 on our dedicated acreage, and there continues to be a large inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells with more than 650 basin-wide and approximately 350 on our dedicated acreage. With 8 completion crews currently operating in the basin, no additional activity or crews are needed to hold natural gas production flat on our acreage or reach our well connect guidance for the year. Any additional completion crews would present upside to our guidance. As the current DUC inventory gets worked down, we expect producers to bring rigs back to the basin to replenish the inventory levels, providing tailwinds as we move into 2022. 
[Audio Gap] 
Continued opportunity for us to bring this volume onto our system and help further reduce flaring in the basin. 
The gathering and processing segment's average fee rate remained $1.04 per MMBtu during the quarter, unchanged from the fourth quarter 2020. Winter storm Uri reduced mid-continent volumes by approximately 30 million cubic feet per day for the quarter, causing the average fee rate mix to shift more 
[Audio Gap] 
our activity levels in the Mid-Continent region or the Powder River Basin. However, both areas have received attention as commodity prices have strengthened. Any increasing activity in those areas would be an added tailwind to our 2021 expectations and provide volume momentum into 2022. 
Terry, that concludes my remarks."

That's a key focus. We have done some of that. We've got a lot of electric compression operating today, particularly in the Williston Basin. But we also have some big units down in Oklahoma. So we know how to do it, and we expect to continue to steadily increase our fleet of electric compression. So that's that's a key focus.

Conversations with customers, not just our G&P customers, but as Sheridan and his team work with their customers across all the basins. It's just that we anticipate increasing activity. We've seen prices stabilize here appear at a nice level. Clearly that can generate fantastic returns in most every basin we're in. The gas to oil ratio increasing in the Bakken gives us more confidence that you're going to continue to see those volumes tick up. So there's just a lot of factors that go into that. And I think a key as we have conversations with the producers, particularly in the Bakken, the note is as they're going to work the DUC inventory, I know a lot's been written about, well, where are the rigs? Well, they're going to work their DUC inventory down first, and then as that declines and it gets back to more of a normalized rate, then we'll probably see, and we expect to see rigs come back based on our conversations with them. So all those reasons are why we think in the back half of the year, you will see an increase and a tick up, not necessarily in completion crews, but in rigs. And that will provide the momentum as we go into '22."

ONEOK's solid first quarter results are providing positive momentum as we enter warmer operating months. Volumes on our system and our outlook for the year continues to improve, supporting the increase to our financial guidance which we announced yesterday. Even without the weather-related earnings impact in the first quarter, our base business earnings increased compared with the fourth quarter. But while the quarter's results were positive, Winter Storm Uri did provide us with significant operational challenges that I want to highlight.
Our employees' preparation before the extreme weather event and hard work during it enabled us to operate with very few interruptions. Operations teams ensured our assets were weatherized for extreme conditions, and that our employees were on-site and prepared to make the necessary adjustments to keep our assets running. Many of our employees were faced with challenges of their own, including limited or no heat, running water or electricity at their own homes, but still worked to help ONEOK provide essential natural gas and NGLs when needed most. Despite these extraordinary winter -- weather conditions, we continued to meet the critical needs of our customers, including natural gas utilities and electric power plants.
Our natural gas pipeline and storage assets were particularly well positioned to address the needs for natural gas. The segment's ability to continue providing reliable service helps meet increased natural gas demand and contributed to higher adjusted EBITDA during the quarter. Kevin will provide more details in a moment.
Despite weather-related volume impacts across our operations, strength in our base business was evident in our Rocky Mountain region NGL and natural gas volumes during the quarter. The Williston Basin continues to outperform expectations and provide us with solid and stable earnings.
As I've said before, ONEOK's earnings growth in 2021 is not dependent on increased rig activity or increasing commodity prices. The opportunities available to us are from a robust drilled but uncompleted well inventory, increased natural gas capture and rising gas to oil ratios in the Williston Basin and increasing ethane demand. The opportunity for earnings growth without the need for significant investment is unique to ONEOK and our strategic assets in key operating areas.
With yesterday's earnings announcement, we raised expectations for 2021 and now expect adjusted EBITDA growth of more than 17% compared with 2020. Our higher guidance expectations include the latest producer forecasts and drilling plans, and our earnings range also includes the potential impact from a shutdown of the Dakota access pipeline. Increasing producer activity, higher commodity prices and strengthening energy markets have further enhanced our view of 2021 and are setting up to provide positive momentum as we exit the year.
As we look toward 2022, high single to low double-digit growth in EBITDA appears reasonable in the $50 to $70 per barrel price range when you adjust 2021 for the approximately $90 million weather impact to revised guidance. We also continue to look for opportunities outside of our traditional growth drivers to enhance our businesses.
Our sustainability and renewables teams continue to actively research opportunities that will complement our extensive midstream assets and expertise. They're focusing on opportunities to lower our greenhouse gas emissions while enhancing profitability, further strengthening the vital role we expect to play in a low-carbon economy.
Opportunities under evaluation include the further electrification of compression assets, potential carbon capture and storage projects, sourcing renewable energy for operations and other longer term investments, such as hydrogen transportation and storage. And as always, we'll remain disciplined in our capital approach as we develop these opportunities.
Demand for the products we transport remain strong. The pandemic and recent weather events have further highlighted the importance of natural gas, NGLs and the many end-use products they help create, which all play a vital role in helping us to lead safer and healthier lives. Our ability to transport these products safely and responsibly to markets is key to their ultimate end use. This quarter once again proved our ability to do that, even in the most extreme conditions.
With that, I will turn the call over to Walt to discuss our financial performance and updated 2021 guidance."
293889,710056020,2261030,"ONEOK, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2021",2021-04-28,"Earnings Calls","ONEOK, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Terry. With yesterday's earnings announcement, we increased our 2021 net income and earnings per share guidance 10% and adjusted EBITDA guidance 5% compared with our original expectations provided in late February.

With yesterday's earnings announcement, we increased our 2021 net income and earnings per share guidance 10% and adjusted EBITDA guidance 5% compared with our original expectations provided in late February. We now expect a net income midpoint of $1.35 billion or $3.02 per share, and an adjusted EBITDA midpoint of $3.2 billion this year.
At the segment level, we increased 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance for the natural gas gathering and processing and natural gas pipeline segments, primarily due to increasing producer activity from higher commodity prices and incorporating the results of the first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA guidance for the natural gas liquids segment decreased slightly, primarily due to reduced volumes and lower ethane demand in the first quarter related to Winter Storm Uri.
Total capital expenditures for 2021, including growth and maintenance capital, remain unchanged from our original expectations of $525 million to $675 million, a more than 70% decrease compared with 2020. This range includes capital to complete the Bear Creek plant expansion and associated field infrastructure in the fourth quarter of this year and a low-cost expansion of the Arbuckle II pipeline in the second quarter.
Now a brief overview of our first quarter financial performance. ONEOK's first quarter 2021 net income totaled $386 million or $0.86 per share. First quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $866 million, a 24% increase year-over-year and a 17% increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2020. Distributable cash flow was more than $660 million in the first quarter, a 27% increase year-over-year and a 28% increase compared with the fourth quarter 2020.
First quarter dividend coverage was nearly 1.6x, and we generated more than $245 million of distributable cash flow in excess of dividends paid during the quarter. Our March 31 net debt to EBITDA on an annualized run rate basis was 3.98x compared with 4.6x at the end of 2020. We ended the quarter -- the first quarter with no borrowings on our $2.5 billion credit facility and more than $400 million of cash. Earlier this month, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.935 or $3.74 per share on an annualized basis, unchanged from the previous quarter.
Healthy earnings in the first quarter provided momentum for 2021 and helped to accelerate our deleveraging efforts. As Terry mentioned, increasing producer activity, ample capacity on our systems, and the continued opportunity for flared gas capture and strong gas to oil ratios in the Williston Basin and increasing ethane demand continue to support our base business and increase financial expectations this year.
I'll now turn the call over to Kevin for a closer look at our operations."

Winter Storm Uri impacted operations across all 3 of our business segments in February. Reduced volumes due to well freeze-offs, especially in the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast Permian regions, increased electricity cost and customer facility outages presented challenges during the quarter. However, our ability to meet increased demand for natural gas and NGLs during the period helped to more than offset the volume impacts. Volumes across our operations returned quickly following the extreme weather with NGL raw feed throughput and natural gas processing volumes in the Rocky Mountain region in March exceeding our first quarter 2021 averages.
Let's take a closer look at each of our businesses. Starting with the natural gas pipeline segment. The safe and reliable operations of our pipeline and storage assets through the storm provided critical transportation services and storage withdrawals for our customers. In addition, we sold 5.2 Bcf of natural gas, which we previously held in inventory, into the market in the first quarter 2021 to help meet the increased demand. This compares with 1.2 Bcf that we sold in the first quarter of 2020.
Our ability to provide reliable service throughout the extreme weather conditions highlights the importance of market-connected pipelines and storage assets and the value of these vital services. Since the storm, we've received increased interest from customers seeking additional long-term transportation and storage capacity on our system. This morning, we initiated an open season for more than 1 Bcf of incremental firm storage capacity at our West Texas storage assets.
In our natural gas liquids segment, first quarter 2021 earnings increased compared with the fourth quarter of 2020 despite the volume impact from Winter Storm Uri. System-wide volumes were reduced by an average of approximately 64,000 barrels per day during the quarter, with the largest impacts in the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast Permian regions.
During the first quarter, increased optimization and marketing activities in the segment related primarily to higher commodity prices and wider spreads between Conway and Mont Belvieu prices, presented opportunities to utilize our integrated NGL pipeline and storage assets to meet market needs, helping to partially offset volume and cost-related impacts.
First quarter raw feed throughput from the Rocky Mountain region increased 4% compared with the fourth quarter of 2020 and 20% year-over-year despite an 11,000 barrel per day impact from Winter Storm Uri. As we sit today, volumes from the region have reached more than 300,000 barrels per day.
During the quarter, ethane volumes on our system in the Rocky Mountain region increased compared with the fourth quarter 2020 as we incented some ethane recovery, which we have talked about in the past. On a short-term basis, we were able to incent recovery by purchasing ethane at several gas plants at a premium value to natural gas, selling it into the Mont Belvieu ethane market and collecting the difference while increasing producer netbacks and NGL volumes on our system. Continued ethane recovery from the region will depend on regional natural gas and ethane pricing and is not included in our updated guidance.
Economics in the Mid-Continent region also provided the opportunity to incentivize ethane recovery and we continue to expect partial recovery in the region throughout the remainder of the year, which is included in our guidance. In the Permian Basin, we saw increased ethane rejection in the first quarter. Overall, petrochemical facility outages related to Winter Storm Uri reduced demand for ethane during the quarter. We expect ethane recovery in the Permian Basin to continue ramping back up as petrochemical demand returns following February storm impacts with a return to near full recovery in the second half of 2021.
Discretionary ethane that can be recovered on our system in both the Mid-Continent and Rocky Mountain regions remains approximately 100,000 barrels per day. In the Rockies region, full recovery would provide an opportunity for $400 million in an annual adjusted EBITDA at full rates. Our opportunity for recovery in either region at any given time will fluctuate based on regional natural gas pricing, ethane economics and potential incentivized recovery.
Moving on to the natural gas gathering and processing segment. In the Rocky Mountain region, first quarter processed volumes increased 5% year-over-year despite colder-than-normal weather in February. In March, volumes exceeded 1.2 billion cubic feet per day, a level we can maintain even without increased producer activity. Our ability to capture additional flared gas, rising gas to oil ratios and a large inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells on our acreage are the key drivers of our 2021 volume expectations.
Recent producer M&A activity in the Williston Basin has highlighted new drilling plans on acreage that, in some cases, may not have been developed in the near term, but now likely will be. And indications from several of our producers in the basin point to increasing activity in the second half of 2021, particularly in Dunn County. In response to this, we've resumed construction on our Bear Creek processing plant expansion and expect it to be complete in the fourth quarter of this year. Once complete, we will have approximately 1.7 Bcf per day of processing capacity in the basin, and we'll be able to grow our volumes with minimal capital as producer activity levels increase.
In the first quarter, we connected 38 wells in the Rocky Mountain region and expect to connect more than 300 this year. Based on very recent producers completion schedules, we expect a significant increase in well connects in the second and third quarter as completion activity picks up with improved weather. There are currently 16 rigs operating in the basin with 8 on our dedicated acreage, and there continues to be a large inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells with more than 650 basin-wide and approximately 350 on our dedicated acreage.
With 8 completion crews currently operating in the basin, no additional activity or crews are needed to hold natural gas production flat on our acreage or reach our well connect guidance for the year. Any additional completion crews would present upside to our guidance. As the current DUC inventory gets worked down, we expect producers to bring rigs back to the basin to replenish the inventory levels, providing tailwinds as we move into 2022.
Additionally, as of February, approximately 100 million cubic feet per day of natural gas flaring remained on our dedicated acreage, presenting a continued opportunity for us to bring this volume onto our system and help further reduce flaring in the basin. The gathering and processing segment's average fee rate remained $1.04 per MMBtu during the quarter, unchanged from the fourth quarter 2020. Winter Storm Uri reduced Mid-Continent volumes by approximately 30 million cubic feet per day for the quarter, causing the average fee rate mix to shift more towards the Rocky Mountain volumes, driving the higher average rate.
We now expect the fee rate for 2021 to average close to the high end of our $0.95 to $1 per MMBtu guidance range. The segment's 2021 guidance does not assume increasing producer activity levels in the Mid-Continent region or the Powder River Basin. However, both areas have received attention as commodity prices have strengthened. Any increasing activity in those areas would be an added tailwind to our 2021 expectations and provide volume momentum into 2022.
Terry, that concludes my remarks."

That's a key focus.
We have done some of that. We've got a lot of electric compression operating today, particularly in the Williston Basin. But we also have some big units down in Oklahoma. So we know how to do it, and we expect to continue to steadily increase our fleet of electric compression. So that's a key focus.

And that ex storm, you're sort of intimating that '22 can grow by high single digits or low double digit. I guess, kind of back of the envelope, that sounds like about $3.4 billion. I was wondering if you can talk about the momentum a little bit.
And in the answers to your previous questions, you have talked about the completions towards the end of the year and so forth. So kind of understand the cadence with respect to '21. But how have the conversations changed with producers with oil now in the 60s for some time? Like how they evolve since February? Is that where some of the momentum is coming from? Or is it strictly related to gas/oil recoveries and NGL recoveries?"

Conversations with customers, not just our G&P customers, but as Sheridan and his team work with their customers across all the basins. It's just that we anticipate increasing activity. We've seen prices stabilize here, appear at a nice level. Clearly, that can generate fantastic returns in most every basin we're in. The gas to oil ratio increasing in the Bakken gives us more confidence that you're going to continue to see those volumes tick up.
So there's just a lot of factors that go into that. And I think a key -- as we have conversations with the producers, particularly in the Bakken, the note is as they're going to work the DUC inventory, I know a lot's been written about, well, where are the rigs? Well, they're going to work their DUC inventory down first, and then as that declines and it gets back to more of a normalized rate, then we'll probably see and we expect to see rigs come back based on our conversations with them.
So all those reasons are why we think in the back half of the year, you will see an increase and a tick up, not necessarily in completion crews, but in rigs. And that will provide the momentum as we go into '22."

If you think about -- we've talked previously about the impact, we believe, to DAPL at this point and talking to our customers is quite small. Given the time that's now passed, we're well into the year, the pipeline is still operating, and there's still not a clear path of what's going to happen to it.
The EIS is supposed to be complete by the, I think, March of '22. So even in the scenario where it would get shut down, I don't know that there's that much impact to '22 as everybody believes that process is going to -- will ultimately get the permit. So from that standpoint, that's how we're thinking about DAPL.
Just -- and on the rig counts, we kind of answered that previously that we absolutely believe there'll be an uptick in rigs and activity levels in the second half of this year. As to what that exactly looks like as we move into '22, that remains to be seen, and that's why the range is provided."

But down in Texas and even in parts of Oklahoma, we don't quite -- we don't do it as robustly as we do in Williston.
So I think there's a lot to be learned from producers who operate in a hostile environment all the time. A lot can be shared with producers down in Texas and how to weatherize. But -- I mean a lot of issues stem from the fact that it's difficult in terms of wellhead production to weatherize. And especially if the electric power is getting shut off on you, too, if you're a producer and you're trying to -- you've got heat tracing and insulation that requires electric power and then your power is getting shut off, it makes -- you're froze up.
So I can speak for ONEOK. We did a great job weatherizing, and that's how we were able to continue to operate. We had very few facilities go down due to freezing, and we had large volumes of gas coming out of storage that made up for the wellhead supply that froze off. We just continued to make deliveries. And those deliveries and the market demand was going up dramatically.
So even in the face of rising demand because of the cold temperatures, we are able to rock and roll and maintain deliveries. And fortunately, this cold snap only lasted about 10 days.

Thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest and investment in our company. For 32 of my almost 40-year career, I had the good fortune to work with the assets and the people through various companies that are now a part of ONEOK.
I'm excited and honored to be back. This company has a strong experienced management team and a talented workforce, and we are all looking forward to the future. On today's call, we'll be discussing ONEOK's strong performance in the second quarter, and I'll provide a few of my initial thoughts as to how the management team and I will continue to build on the accomplishments of those that preceded me in this role.
I'm also looking forward to reacquainting or meeting many of you in the near future. Joining me on today's call is Walt Hulse the Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Strategy and Corporate Affairs; and Kevin Burdick, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.
Also available to answer your questions are Sheridan Swords, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids; and Chuck Kelley, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas. I'd like to first start off this call by recognizing and congratulating Terry on his retirement and thanking him for his availability to advise me in my new role.
ONEOK has seen tremendous growth and success under Terry's leadership the last 7 years as he's navigated the company through several growth cycles and industry challenges, including delivering strong results during a pandemic. Terry championed many companies successes, the transition to higher fee-based business model with less commodity price exposure, significant improvements in company-wide safety and environmental performance, the successful ONEOK Partners merger transaction and the completion of more than $10 billion in capital growth projects to name just a few of his many accomplishments. 
The company has grown in many ways since I was here last, and I'm looking forward to building on what Terry, the Board, the leadership team and ONEOK's 3,000 employees have achieved. It's been extraordinary. During this first month on the job, I've been refamiliarizing myself with our business, holding strategy and planning meetings with the team and most importantly, listening.
I've met with my leadership team and many employees to hear more about their focus areas. These introductions and conversations are very important and will continue. What you can expect from me as a CEO is that we will be disciplined and intentional in all that we do and continue to encourage a culture that promotes safety, reliability, employee engagement, value creation and environmental responsibility.
These principles have served One Oak well for decades and will continue to be a key element of our daily operations and business decisions going forward. The energy systems today were designed to operate on the consumers' requirements for affordability, reliability and resiliency.
We will continue to focus on meeting our customers' needs while also transforming these energy systems to drive the overall lowering of greenhouse gas emissions. Yesterday, we reported a strong second quarter financial result, supported by increasing volumes across our system.
The energy and economic backdrop continues to improve with producer activity accelerating in demand for NGLs and natural gas strengthening. Kevin will talk more in detail about how we're addressing those needs. But first, I'll turn the call over to Walt to discuss our financial performance."

With yesterday's earnings announcement, we updated our 2021 financial guidance expectations. Our view of 2021 continues to improve as we now expect 2021 adjusted EBITDA to be above the midpoint of our guidance range of $3.05 billion to $3.35 billion that we provided back in April.
Our outlook for growth in 2022 has continued to strengthen. Higher commodity prices, accelerating producer activity and the rising guest oil ratio in the Williston Basin provide a tailwind into next year.
With available capacity across our operations and the completion of our Bear Creek plant expansion later this year, significant earnings power remains across our assets without the need for significant capital investment. The strengthening momentum going into 2022 makes us confident that we will achieve or exceed the '22 outlook we have discussed on previous calls.
Now for a brief overview of our second quarter financial performance. ONEOK's second quarter 2021 net income totaled $342 million or $0.77 per share. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $802 million, a 50% increase year-over-year and a 3% increase compared with the first quarter 2021 after backing out the benefit from Winter Storm Yuri.
We ended the second quarter with a higher inventory of unfractionated NGLs due to planned and unplanned outages at some of our fractionation facilities. We expect to recognize $12.5 million of earnings in the second half of 2021 as our current inventory is fractionated and sold, the majority of which will be recognized in the third quarter.
Distributable cash flow was $570 million in the second quarter and dividend coverage was nearly 1.4x. We generated more than $150 million of distributable cash flow in excess of dividends paid during the quarter. Our June 30 net debt-to-EBITDA on an annualized run rate basis was 4.3x. And we continue to work towards our goal of sub-4x.
We ended the second quarter with no borrowings outstanding on our $2.5 billion credit facility and nearly $375 million in cash. In July, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.935 or $3.74 per share on an annualized basis, unchanged from the previous quarter. Our strong balance sheet, ample liquidity and increasing EBITDA from volume growth in our system provides a solid financial backdrop and flexibility as we enter the second half of the year.
I'll now turn the call over to Kevin for an operational update."
293889,1673413069,2362662,"ONEOK, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2021",2021-08-04,"Earnings Calls","ONEOK, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Walt. Our second quarter NGL raw feed throughput and natural gas processing volumes increased compared with the first quarter 2021 and driven by increasing producer activity, ethane recovery and gas to oil ratios that continue to rise in the Wi",1265,"Thank you, Walt. Our second quarter NGL raw feed throughput and natural gas processing volumes increased compared with the first quarter 2021 and driven by increasing producer activity, ethane recovery and gas to oil ratios that continue to rise in the Williston Basin.
We expect these tailwinds to carry into the second half of the year and into 2022. In our natural gas liquids segment, total NGL raw feed throughput volumes increased 17% compared with the first quarter 2021.
Second quarter raw feed throughput from the Rocky Mountain region increased 18% compared with the first quarter 2021 and more than 85% compared with the second quarter 2020, which included significant production curtailments resulting from the pandemic. 
As a reference point, volumes reached approximately 330,000 barrels per day in this region early this month. At this volume level, we still have more than 100,000 barrels per day of NGL pipeline capacity from the region, allowing us to capture increasing volumes on our system including volume from a new 250 million cubic feet per day third-party plant that came online in early July and expansion of another third-party plant that is underway, and our Bear Creek plant expansion, which is expected to be complete in the first half of the fourth quarter this year.
Total Mid-Continent region raw feed throughput volumes increased 16% compared with the first quarter 2021 and 10% compared with the second quarter 2020. The Arbuckle II expansion was completed in the second quarter, increasing its capacity up to 500,000 barrels per day, adding additional transportation capacity between the Mid-Continent region and the Gulf Coast.
In the Permian Basin, NGL volumes increased 16% compared with the first quarter 2021, primarily as a result of increased ethane recovery and producer activity. Petrochemical demand continues to strengthen and has seen support from a continuing global pandemic recovery.
This led to increased ethane recovery across our system in the second quarter. Ethane volumes on our system in the Rocky Mountain region increased compared with the first quarter 2021 as we continue to incent some ethane recovery on a short-term basis.
Continued ethane recovery in the Rockies in the second half of 2021 will depend on regional natural gas and ethane pricing. We have not included ethane recovery from the Rockies for the remainder of the year and our updated financial guidance. Ethane volumes on our Mid-Continent system increased compared with the first quarter 2021 due to both favorable recovery economics and some incentivized recovery.
We continue to forecast partial ethane recovery in our guidance for the second half of the year in this region. Ethane volumes in the Permian Basin increased in the second quarter compared with the first quarter of 2021. We continue to expect the basin to be in near full recovery in the second half of the year. Discretionary ethane on our system or said differently, the amount of ethane that we estimate could be operationally recovered at any given time, but is not economic to recover at current prices without incentives, is approximately 225,000 barrels per day.
Of that total opportunity, 125,000 barrels per day are available in the Rocky Mountain region and 100,000 barrels per day in the Mid-Continent. Full recovery in the Rockies region would provide an opportunity for $500 million in annual adjusted EBITDA at full rates. Moving on to the natural gas gathering and processing segment.
In the Rocky Mountain region, second quarter processed volumes averaged more than 1.25 billion cubic feet per day, an increase of 6% compared with the first quarter 2021 and more than 50% year-over-year. An outage at one of our plants, which has since come back online, decreased second quarter volumes by approximately 15 million cubic feet per day.
Toward the end of June, volumes reached 1.3 billion cubic feet per day, and we have line of sight to even higher processed volumes later in the year given the recent increase in completion crews and rigs in the basin. Conversations with our producers in the region continue to point to higher activity levels in the second half of 2021 and 2022, particularly in Dunn County, where construction on our Bear Creek processing plant is on track for completion in the first half of the fourth quarter of this year. 
Once in service, we will have approximately 1.7 billion cubic feet per day of processing capacity in the basin, and we'll be able to grow our volumes with minimal capital. In the second quarter, we connected 84 wells in the Rocky Mountain region and still expect to connect more than 300 this year.
Based on the most recent producer completion schedules, we expect a significant increase in well connects in the second half of the year with some producers aligning the timing of well completions closer to the completion of Bear Creek.
There are currently 23 rigs operating in the basin with 9 on our dedicated acreage, and there continues to be a large inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells with more than 650 basin-wide and approximately 325 on our dedicated acreage.
We expect the current DUC inventory to get work down before we see producers bring back more rigs to the basin to replenish inventory levels. As we said last quarter, the 8 completion crews currently operating in the basin is enough to reach our well Connect guidance for the year Any additional completion crews would present upside to our guidance.
Rising gas to oil ratios and natural gas flaring in the basin continue to present opportunities for volume growth without the need for additional producer activity. Since 2016, GORs have increased more than 75%.
Recent projections from the North Dakota Pipeline Authority show that even in a flat crude oil production environment, GORs could increase an additional 45% in the next 7 years. This could add 1.3 billion cubic feet per day of gas production and approximately 150,000 barrels per day of C3+ NGL volume to the basin during that same time period. Again, this growth in natural gas is only based on increasing GORs and assumes flat crude oil production.
Any growth in crude oil would be upside to those projections. We've added a new slide in our earnings materials to show these latest North Dakota projections, which include various production scenarios. During the second quarter, the Gathering and Processing segment's average fee rate increased to $1.06 per MMBtu, driven by higher Rocky Mountain region volumes. We now expect the fee rate for 2021 and to average between $1 and $1.05 per MMBtu.
The Mid-Continent region average process volumes increased 4% compared with the first quarter 2021 as volumes returned following freeze offs in the first quarter. While the region has received some attention as commodity prices strengthen, producer activity has been more moderate than other areas.
In the Natural Gas Pipelines segment, the segment reported a solid quarter of stable fee-based earnings, the decrease in earnings year-over-year was driven by a onetime contract settlement that provided a $13.5 million benefit to earnings in the second quarter of 2020.
We continue to see increased interest from our customers for additional long-term transportation and storage capacity on our system following the extreme winter weather events earlier this year. Since the first quarter, we have renewed or recontracted additional long-term storage capacity in both Texas and Oklahoma, including a successful open season for more than 1 billion cubic feet of incremental firm storage capacity at our West Texas storage assets.
We'll continue to work with customers to contract additional long-term capacity as we head into the winter heating season. Pierce, that concludes my remarks."

Maybe to position and sorry, Pierce, to put you on the hotspot hot seat right off the back here. But I was wondering if we can talk about your thoughts around buybacks and CapEx for 2022. And I imagine there's not much on the CapEx front, just sort of given where you are at this point right now, maybe a completion of the frozen frac at this point just with the higher ethane recovery in Kevin's comments about with respect to GORs. But outside of that doesn't appear to be much on the CapEx side.
I want to sort of take the soft outlooks that have been presented in the past, a $3.5 billion to $4 billion has kind of been thrown around is a potential '22 run rate. It sort of suggests the leverage for what is going to be sub to 4x leverage ratio target. Does this set up for buybacks in '22?
If so, how should we think about execution around buybacks? Or have I got the thought process on CapEx. Just curious on your thoughts."

And we're starting to see some of our end goals in the near term coming forward.
And as we get closer to our goals of sub-4x leverage, then obviously, we will expand the horizon of things that we'll look at from a capital allocation. And I think we spent time with peers. We'll look at all of our options as we go forward. You're right that there isn't any major CapEx project on the horizon here. We really doubled the capacity of our long-haul pipes in the NGL business over the last several years and that gives us a lot of running room going forward.
You highlighted that we have a couple of projects that we paused back with the pandemic. And over the course of next year or 2 as producer activity picks up, I would assume that we'll likely clean some of those up and finish them up to meet our customers' needs.
But it's really going to be routine growth and smaller growth projects that are very attractive going forward. So we'll have plenty of free cash flow to continue to deleverage and then look at all of those capital allocation opportunities over the next couple of years."

I think it's more about what's changing in the energy industry. I think we can probably all agree that the energy systems across the United States, it's going to be very important that we continue to transition into a lower carbon energy system across United States.
So really, it's about how we at ONEOK and the assets people and the skill sets that we have are actually going to transform with that energy system. I view that as a 3-step process. First of all, you got to understand what the transformation of the energy systems look like, then you prepare for that -- for what you've learned and what you understand and then you innovate.
And I think that's the 3 focus areas that I would say that we have going forward is understanding where we are preparing and innovating for the future, while at the same time, continuing to grow the base business that we have and the use of natural gas and natural gas liquids because I think the global pool, most countries are not where we are in the United States as far as the maturity of our systems and the transparency that we have in the energy systems here in the United States.
So I think that's going to continue to pull for natural gas demand as well as natural gas liquids growth. While at the same time, we're going to be able to use the skill sets and the talents that we have in our company to transform. I do think transformation is a better word than transition. Transition to me indicates that you're going to leave one thing and go to another. Transformation, in my opinion, it means that you're going to use something that you have and maybe use it a little bit slightly different in the future to meet some of the problems that we have. I do think it's important for the United States to lead in the effort of lower carbon because I think the other parts of the world can learn from what we do, although there's only 6.6 million gigatons of CO2 emissions in the United States versus 51 gigatons over the globe.
So we're a small percentage, but I think it's important for the U.S. to lead in these efforts. And I do feel like that ONEOK is positioned over a long period of time, a lot of these things, as you look at CNG and hydrogen and LNG for long haul and carbon sequestration and capturing methane. Those are all going to be opportunities that we experience over the next several decades."

You haven't been collecting that when you're doing it more opportunistically. And when you do provide more ethane to the market this way, it sort of puts a lid on what prices can be. So curious, how do you balance this and make sure you don't provide too much supply that it negatively impacts the spread economics and other basins that you're in? And what really has to happen in order for producers to sign up for long-term contracts for ethane TNS out of the Bakken. Is it really only a firm BTU resolution on Northern Border?"

So it's an ongoing process that we look at every month, and we try to make that determination. That's why we don't bring all the ethane out of the Bakken that we could. We could incentivize more, but we just bring what we feel is the right amount of ethane to come out.
And really on your question of what would it take for producers sign up for ethane, they have already signed up for ethane. They have the option today whether or not to bring ethane on the system or not to bring ethane on the system. We have the capacity for them and they signed up for a certain amount of capacity.
What it really comes down to now is what is going to drive the price high enough that we would get a full TNF rate or the full $0.28 that the ethane would come out. And what's going to need to happen for that is you're going to need to continue to have a strong ethane to ethylene spread like we have today, very, very widespread, so that ethane can continue to rise, prices continue wise and the pet kins can continue to make money off of that.
The second thing is you need to have more demand. And then we need to see more exports coming out, there is more export capacity out there, and we need to see more crackers. And in the second quarter of next year, the ExxonMobic cracker is going to come online as well. So that's going to bring on more demand.
And I think the third thing you need to look at is you need to look at the regional gas prices between the Bakken and the other areas. So if we would see the Bakken gas prices dip down like we typically see in the summer. I think all those things together if they work that you have a possibility of an opportunity to see ethane come out of the Bakken at full prices."

I'm going to kick it over to Chuck here just a second because he can give you some updates on what we're doing as it relates to some of the RNG efforts.
But the CNG and LNG for the long haul, I think, is another thing that could be a possibility. Hydrogen is probably out into the future because primarily, right now, you can't take a certain amount of hydrogen based on the tariffs,  intrastate and on the interest rate and the intrastate assets across the United States. But I do think that's a developing opportunity. It's left to be seen economically, how that stuff plays out.
And then you got carbon sequestration because 24% of all the carbon a minute of the 6.6 gigatons actually comes from electric generation from coal, oil and natural gas, primarily coal and natural gas. So I think that's going to be important to solve that equation. And of course, transportation has about 28% of that 6.6 gigatons.
So if you converted all the cars today to EVs, then you just switch the problem from a transportation over to electric generation. And then so you didn't really solve the problem.

But I think more importantly, as far as what these opportunities do is they make the existing natural gas pipelines in the United States relevant. Instead of just moving methane that you traditionally get from the wellheads, you're actually capturing methane that is emitted to the air, which is 25x more potent than the CO2.
So you get the uplift in the CO2 equivalents and so you get the extra benefit of removing that. And you're using existing assets to help other industries reduce their environmental footprint. So the relevancy of it is the important part as opposed to some great business opportunity to boost your EBITDA.
It's really designed around the relevancy of making essentially 2.6 million miles of pipeline in the United States, very important to the energy transformation future."

And the Mid-Continent area, which is defined as Southwest Kansas and the Texas Panhandle in Oklahoma, is a net exporter of natural gas even during the month of February, during the middle of winter to the tune of about 3 Bcf a day. That turned back between the demand that we saw in the Mid-Continent and the lack of production for various reasons to basically only 5% exports.
So the real issue is to talk about resiliency of the supply chain and how we can potentially get gas in those kind of situations back from maybe the southeast up into the Mid-Continent if it ever happens again. So those are things that we would be looking at. But it really is looking at not necessarily the capacity that's there today or the contracting of that capacity we are addressing a little bit of that, which is some uptick in storage and some additional volumes there.
But that's not going to get you through a second winter storm year. So it's going to have to be a holistic approach between the exploration and production folks, the midstream folks and the utilities to really get us to a point where we can take on another winter storm ore.
I will say volumetrically, there were very, very few customers lost in the state of Oklahoma. And so that biometrically was a very positive for us. The issue was where the price went to, not necessarily the stability and the reliability of being able to perform. So I think the focus needs to be on resiliency and there's going to be a lot of people that's going to be involved in that process."

I'm also looking forward to reacquainting or meeting many of you in the near future. Joining me on today's call is Walt Hulse, the Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Strategy and Corporate Affairs; and Kevin Burdick, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.
Also available to answer your questions are Sheridan Swords, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids; and Chuck Kelley, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas. I'd like to first start off this call by recognizing and congratulating Terry on his retirement and thanking him for his availability to advise me in my new role.
ONEOK has seen tremendous growth and success under Terry's leadership the last 7 years as he's navigated the company through several growth cycles and industry challenges, including delivering strong results during a pandemic. Terry championed many companies successes, the transition to higher fee-based business model with less commodity price exposure, significant improvements in company-wide safety and environmental performance, the successful ONEOK Partners merger transaction and the completion of more than $10 billion in capital growth projects to name just a few of his many accomplishments. 
The company has grown in many ways since I was here last, and I'm looking forward to building on what Terry, the Board, the leadership team and ONEOK's 3,000 employees have achieved. It's been extraordinary. During this first month on the job, I've been refamiliarizing myself with our business, holding strategy and planning meetings with the team and most importantly, listening.
I've met with my leadership team and many employees to hear more about their focus areas. These introductions and conversations are very important and will continue. What you can expect from me as a CEO is that we will be disciplined and intentional in all that we do and continue to encourage a culture that promotes safety, reliability, employee engagement, value creation and environmental responsibility.
These principles have served ONEOK well for decades and will continue to be a key element of our daily operations and business decisions going forward. The energy systems today were designed to operate on the consumers' requirements for affordability, reliability and resiliency.
We will continue to focus on meeting our customers' needs while also transforming these energy systems to drive the overall lowering of greenhouse gas emissions. Yesterday, we reported a strong second quarter financial result, supported by increasing volumes across our system.
The energy and economic backdrop continues to improve with producer activity accelerating and demand for NGLs and natural gas strengthening. Kevin will talk more in detail about how we're addressing those needs. But first, I'll turn the call over to Walt to discuss our financial performance."

With yesterday's earnings announcement, we updated our 2021 financial guidance expectations. Our view of 2021 continues to improve as we now expect 2021 adjusted EBITDA to be above the midpoint of our guidance range of $3.05 billion to $3.35 billion that we provided back in April.
Our outlook for growth in 2022 has continued to strengthen. Higher commodity prices, accelerating producer activity and the rising gas to oil ratio in the Williston Basin provide a tailwind into next year.
With available capacity across our operations and the completion of our Bear Creek plant expansion later this year, significant earnings power remains across our assets without the need for significant capital investment. The strengthening momentum going into 2022 makes us confident that we will achieve or exceed the '22 outlook we have discussed on previous calls.
Now for a brief overview of our second quarter financial performance. ONEOK's second quarter 2021 net income totaled $342 million or $0.77 per share. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $802 million, a 50% increase year-over-year and a 3% increase compared with the first quarter 2021 after backing out the benefit from winter storm Uri.
We ended the second quarter with a higher inventory of unfractionated NGLs due to planned and unplanned outages at some of our fractionation facilities. We expect to recognize $12.5 million of earnings in the second half of 2021 as our current inventory is fractionated and sold, the majority of which will be recognized in the third quarter.
Distributable cash flow was $570 million in the second quarter and dividend coverage was nearly 1.4x. We generated more than $150 million of distributable cash flow in excess of dividends paid during the quarter. Our June 30 net debt-to-EBITDA on an annualized run rate basis was 4.3x. And we continue to work towards our goal of sub-4x.
We ended the second quarter with no borrowings outstanding on our $2.5 billion credit facility and nearly $375 million in cash. In July, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.935 or $3.74 per share on an annualized basis, unchanged from the previous quarter. Our strong balance sheet, ample liquidity and increasing EBITDA from volume growth in our system provides a solid financial backdrop and flexibility as we enter the second half of the year.
I'll now turn the call over to Kevin for an operational update."
293889,1673413069,2363147,"ONEOK, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2021",2021-08-04,"Earnings Calls","ONEOK, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Walt. Our second quarter NGL raw feed throughput and natural gas processing volumes increased compared with the first quarter 2021 and driven by increasing producer activity, ethane recovery and gas to oil ratios that continue to rise in the Wi",1264,"Thank you, Walt. Our second quarter NGL raw feed throughput and natural gas processing volumes increased compared with the first quarter 2021 and driven by increasing producer activity, ethane recovery and gas to oil ratios that continue to rise in the Williston Basin.
We expect these tailwinds to carry into the second half of the year and into 2022. In our natural gas liquids segment, total NGL raw feed throughput volumes increased 17% compared with the first quarter 2021.
Second quarter raw feed throughput from the Rocky Mountain region increased 18% compared with the first quarter 2021 and more than 85% compared with the second quarter 2020, which included significant production curtailments resulting from the pandemic. 
As a reference point, volumes reached approximately 330,000 barrels per day in this region early this month. At this volume level, we still have more than 100,000 barrels per day of NGL pipeline capacity from the region, allowing us to capture increasing volumes on our system including volume from a new 250 million cubic feet per day third-party plant that came online in early July and expansion of another third-party plant that is underway, and our Bear Creek plant expansion, which is expected to be complete in the first half of the fourth quarter this year.
Total Mid-Continent region raw feed throughput volumes increased 16% compared with the first quarter 2021 and 10% compared with the second quarter 2020. The Arbuckle II expansion was completed in the second quarter, increasing its capacity up to 500,000 barrels per day, adding additional transportation capacity between the Mid-Continent region and the Gulf Coast.
In the Permian Basin, NGL volumes increased 16% compared with the first quarter 2021, primarily as a result of increased ethane recovery and producer activity. Petrochemical demand continues to strengthen and has seen support from a continuing global pandemic recovery.
This led to increased ethane recovery across our system in the second quarter. Ethane volumes on our system in the Rocky Mountain region increased compared with the first quarter 2021 as we continue to incent some ethane recovery on a short-term basis.
Continued ethane recovery in the Rockies in the second half of 2021 will depend on regional natural gas and ethane pricing. We have not included ethane recovery from the Rockies for the remainder of the year in our updated financial guidance. Ethane volumes on our Mid-Continent system increased compared with the first quarter 2021 due to both favorable recovery economics and some incentivized recovery.
We continue to forecast partial ethane recovery in our guidance for the second half of the year in this region. Ethane volumes in the Permian Basin increased in the second quarter compared with the first quarter of 2021. We continue to expect the basin to be in near full recovery in the second half of the year. 
Discretionary ethane on our system or said differently, the amount of ethane that we estimate could be operationally recovered at any given time, but is not economic to recover at current prices without incentives, is approximately 225,000 barrels per day.
Of that total opportunity, 125,000 barrels per day are available in the Rocky Mountain region and 100,000 barrels per day in the Mid-Continent. Full recovery in the Rockies region would provide an opportunity for $500 million in annual adjusted EBITDA at full rates. 
Moving on to the natural gas gathering and processing segment. In the Rocky Mountain region, second quarter processed volumes averaged more than 1.25 billion cubic feet per day, an increase of 6% compared with the first quarter 2021 and more than 50% year-over-year. An outage at one of our plants, which has since come back online, decreased second quarter volumes by approximately 15 million cubic feet per day.
Towards the end of June, volumes reached 1.3 billion cubic feet per day, and we have line of sight to even higher processed volumes later in the year given the recent increase in completion crews and rigs in the basin. 
Conversations with our producers in the region continue to point to higher activity levels in the second half of 2021 and 2022, particularly in Dunn County, where construction on our Bear Creek processing plant is on track for completion in the first half of the fourth quarter of this year. 
Once in service, we will have approximately 1.7 billion cubic feet per day of processing capacity in the basin, and we'll be able to grow our volumes with minimal capital. In the second quarter, we connected 84 wells in the Rocky Mountain region and still expect to connect more than 300 this year.
Based on the most recent producer completion schedules, we expect a significant increase in well connects in the second half of the year with some producers aligning the timing of well completions closer to the completion of Bear Creek.
There are currently 23 rigs operating in the basin with 9 on our dedicated acreage, and there continues to be a large inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells with more than 650 basin-wide and approximately 325 on our dedicated acreage.
We expect the current DUC inventory to get work down before we see producers bring back more rigs to the basin to replenish inventory levels. As we said last quarter, the 8 completion crews currently operating in the basin is enough to reach our well connect guidance for the year. Any additional completion crews would present upside to our guidance.
Rising gas to oil ratios and natural gas flaring in the basin continue to present opportunities for volume growth without the need for additional producer activity. Since 2016, GORs have increased more than 75%.
Recent projections from the North Dakota Pipeline Authority show that even in a flat crude oil production environment, GORs could increase an additional 45% in the next 7 years. This could add 1.3 billion cubic feet per day of gas production and approximately 150,000 barrels per day of C3+ NGL volume to the basin during that same time period. Again, this growth in natural gas is only based on increasing GORs and assumes flat crude oil production.
Any growth in crude oil would be upside to those projections. We've added a new slide in our earnings materials to show these latest North Dakota projections, which include various production scenarios. During the second quarter, the Gathering and Processing segment's average fee rate increased to $1.06 per MMBtu, driven by higher Rocky Mountain region volumes. We now expect the fee rate for 2021 to average between $1 and $1.05 per MMBtu.
The Mid-Continent region average process volumes increased 4% compared with the first quarter 2021 as volumes returned following freeze offs in the first quarter. While the region has received some attention as commodity prices strengthened, producer activity has been more moderate than other areas.
In the Natural Gas Pipelines segment, the segment reported a solid quarter of stable fee-based earnings, the decrease in earnings year-over-year was driven by a onetime contract settlement that provided a $13.5 million benefit to earnings in the second quarter of 2020.
We continue to see increased interest from our customers for additional long-term transportation and storage capacity on our system following the extreme winter weather events earlier this year. Since the first quarter, we have renewed or recontracted additional long-term storage capacity in both Texas and Oklahoma, including a successful open season for more than 1 billion cubic feet of incremental firm storage capacity at our West Texas storage assets.
We'll continue to work with customers to contract additional long-term capacity as we head into the winter heating season. Pierce, that concludes my remarks."

Maybe to position and sorry, Pierce, to put you on the hotspot, hot seat right off the back here. But I was wondering if we can talk about your thoughts around buybacks and CapEx for 2022. And I imagine there's not much on the CapEx front, just sort of given where you are at this point right now, maybe a completion of the frozen frac at this point just with the higher ethane recovery in Kevin's comments about C3+ with respect to GORs. But outside of that doesn't appear to be much on the CapEx side.
I want to sort of take the soft outlooks that have been presented in the past, a $3.5 billion to $4 billion has kind of been thrown around as a potential '22 run rate. It sort of suggests the leverage for what is going to be sub to 4x leverage ratio target. Does this set up for buybacks in '22?
If so, how should we think about execution around buybacks? Or have I got the thought process wrong on CapEx. Just curious on your thoughts."

Well, sure, basically, I would agree with your assessment of the tailwinds that are behind our business today, and we're excited about the opportunities that are forward. And the cash flows that we'll generate from that will continue to enhance our deleveraging strategy that's been in place for quite some time. And we're starting to see some of our end goals in the near term coming forward.
And as we get closer to our goals of sub-4x leverage, then obviously, we will expand the horizon of things that we'll look at from a capital allocation. And I think we spent time with peers. We'll look at all of our options as we go forward. You're right that there isn't any major CapEx project on the horizon here. We really doubled the capacity of our long-haul pipes in the NGL business over the last several years and that gives us a lot of running room going forward.
You highlighted that we have a couple of projects that we paused back with the pandemic. And over the course of next year or 2 as producer activity picks up, I would assume that we'll likely clean some of those up and finish them up to meet our customers' needs.
But it's really going to be routine growth and some smaller growth projects that are very attractive going forward. So we'll have plenty of free cash flow to continue to deleverage and then look at all of those capital allocation opportunities over the next couple of years."

I think it's more about what's changing in the energy industry. I think we can probably all agree that the energy systems across the United States, it's going to be very important that we continue to transition into a lower carbon energy system across United States.
So really, it's about how we at ONEOK and the assets and the people and the skill sets that we have are actually going to transform with that energy system. I view that as a 3-step process. First of all, you got to understand what the transformation of the energy systems look like, then you prepare for that -- for what you've learned and what you understand and then you innovate.
And I think that's the 3 focus areas that I would say that we have going forward is understanding where we are preparing and innovating for the future, while at the same time, continuing to grow the base business that we have and the use of natural gas and natural gas liquids because I think the global pool, most countries are not where we are in the United States as far as the maturity of our systems and the transparency that we have in the energy systems here in the United States.
So I think that's going to continue to pull for natural gas demand as well as natural gas liquids growth. While at the same time, we're going to be able to use the skill sets and the talents that we have in our company to transform. I do think transformation is a better word than transition.
Transition to me indicates that you're going to leave one thing and go to another. Transformation, in my opinion, it means that you're going to use something that you have and maybe use it a little bit slightly different in the future to meet some of the problems that we have. 
I do think it's important for the United States to lead in the effort of lower carbon because I think the other parts of the world can learn from what we do, although there's only 6.6 million gigatons of CO2 emissions in the United States versus 51 gigatons over the globe.
So we're a small percentage, but I think it's important for the U.S. to lead in these efforts. And I do feel like that ONEOK is positioned over a long period of time, a lot of these things, as you look at CNG and hydrogen and LNG for long haul and carbon sequestration and capturing methane. Those are all going to be opportunities that we experience over the next several decades."

I thought I would maybe start with an ethane question. This quarter, you guys took up more ethane in the Bakken. And you talk about 25,000 barrels per day of ethane extraction being an incremental $100 million, but that's predicated on you collecting the full $0.28 T&F.
You haven't been collecting that when you're doing it more opportunistically. And when you do provide more ethane to the market this way, it sort of puts a lid on what prices can be. So curious, how do you balance this and make sure you don't provide too much supply that it negatively impacts the frac spread economics in other basins that you're in? And what really has to happen in order for producers to sign up for long-term contracts for ethane TNS out of the Bakken. Is it really only a firm BTU resolution on Northern Border?"

I think in your first question on how do we determine how much ethane you bring out of the Bakken and what's the right amount before putting a lid on ethane prices. Really, what we try to understand is where the next incremental ethane will come out, is that coming off our system or somebody else's system.
And so if we don't bring it out of our system is somebody else can bring ethane out of their side of the system then we will lose the whole uplift that we'll have from buying it at gas and selling it at ethane value. So it's an ongoing process that we look at every month, and we try to make that determination. That's why we don't bring all the ethane out of the Bakken that we could. We could incentivize more, but we just bring what we feel is the right amount of ethane to come out.
And really on your question of what would it take for producers sign up for ethane, they have already signed up for ethane. They have the option today whether or not to bring ethane on the system or not to bring ethane on the system. We have the capacity for them and they signed up for a certain amount of capacity.
What it really comes down to now is what is going to drive the price high enough that we would get a full TNF rate or the full $0.28 that the ethane would come out. And what's going to need to happen for that is you're going to need to continue to have a strong ethane to ethylene spread like we have today, very, very widespread, so that ethane can continue to rise, prices continue to rise and the pet kilns can continue to make money off of that.
The second thing is you need to have more demand. And then we need to see more exports coming out, there is more export capacity out there, and we need to see more crackers. And in the second quarter of next year, the ExxonMobil SABIC cracker is going to come online as well. So that's going to bring on more demand.
And I think the third thing you need to look at is you need to look at the regional gas prices between the Bakken and the other areas. So if we would see the Bakken gas prices dip down like we typically see in the summer. I think all those things together if they work that you have a possibility of an opportunity to see ethane come out of the Bakken at full prices."

So we've got room to run, and we've got room to run on the NGL side. As we get closer to those numbers that would start with the floor, we're probably going to have to have some downstream additions that like MB-5 and things like that, that would need to be completed.

I'm going to kick it over to Chuck here just a second because he can give you some updates on what we're doing as it relates to some of the RNG efforts.
But the CNG and LNG for the long haul, I think, is another thing that could be a possibility. Hydrogen is probably out into the future because primarily, right now, you can't take a certain amount of hydrogen based on the tariffs, from the intrastate, and intrastate assets across the United States. But I do think that's a developing opportunity. It's left to be seen economically how that stuff plays out.
And then you got carbon sequestration because 24% of all the carbon a minute of the 6.6 gigatons actually comes from electric generation from coal, oil and natural gas, primarily coal and natural gas. So I think that's going to be important to solve that equation. And of course, transportation has about 28% of that 6.6 gigatons.
So if you converted all the cars today to EVs, then you just switch the problem from a transportation over to electric generation. And then so you didn't really solve the problem.

But I think more importantly as far as what these opportunities do is they make the existing natural gas pipelines in the United States relevant. Instead of just moving methane that you traditionally get from the wellheads, you're actually capturing methane that is emitted to the air, which is 25x more potent than the CO2.
So you get the uplift in the CO2 equivalents and so you get the extra benefit of removing that. And you're using existing assets to help other industries reduce their environmental footprint. So the relevancy of it is the important part as opposed to some great business opportunity to boost your EBITDA.
It's really designed around the relevancy of making essentially 2.6 million miles of pipeline in the United States, very important to the energy transformation future."

And the Mid-Continent area, which is defined as Southwest Kansas and the Texas Panhandle in Oklahoma, is a net exporter of natural gas even during the month of February, during the middle of winter to the tune of about 3 Bcf a day. That turned back between the demand that we saw in the Mid-Continent and the lack of production for various reasons to basically only 5% exports.
So the real issue is to talk about resiliency of the supply chain and how we can potentially get gas in those kind of situations back from maybe the southeast up into the Mid-Continent if it ever happens again. So those are things that we would be looking at. But it really is looking at not necessarily the capacity that's there today or the contracting of that capacity, we are addressing a little bit of that, which is some uptick in storage and some additional volumes there.
But that's not going to get you through a second winter storm Uri. So it's going to have to be a holistic approach between the exploration and production folks, the midstream folks and the utilities to really get us to a point where we can take on another winter storm Uri.
I will say volumetrically, there were very, very few customers lost in the state of Oklahoma. And so that biometrically was a very positive for us. The issue was where the price went to, not necessarily the stability and the reliability of being able to perform. So I think the focus needs to be on resiliency and there's going to be a lot of people that's going to be involved in that process."

Thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest and investment in our company.

I'm excited and honored to be back. This company has a strong experienced management team and a talented workforce, and we are all looking forward to the future. On today's call, we'll be discussing ONEOK's strong performance in the second quarter, and I'll provide a few of my initial thoughts as to how the management team and I will continue to build on the accomplishments of those that preceded me in this role.
I'm also looking forward to reacquainting or meeting many of you in the near future. Joining me on today's call is Walt Hulse, the Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Strategy and Corporate Affairs; and Kevin Burdick, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.
Also available to answer your questions are Sheridan Swords, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids; and Chuck Kelley, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas. I'd like to first start off this call by recognizing and congratulating Terry on his retirement and thanking him for his availability to advise me in my new role.
ONEOK has seen tremendous growth and success under Terry's leadership the last 7 years as he's navigated the company through several growth cycles and industry challenges, including delivering strong results during a pandemic. Terry championed many companies successes, the transition to higher fee-based business model with less commodity price exposure, significant improvements in company-wide safety and environmental performance, the successful ONEOK Partners merger transaction and the completion of more than $10 billion in capital growth projects to name just a few of his many accomplishments. 
The company has grown in many ways since I was here last, and I'm looking forward to building on what Terry, the Board, the leadership team and ONEOK's 3,000 employees have achieved. It's been extraordinary. During this first month on the job, I've been refamiliarizing myself with our business, holding strategy and planning meetings with the team and most importantly, listening.
I've met with my leadership team and many employees to hear more about their focus areas. These introductions and conversations are very important and will continue. What you can expect from me as a CEO is that we will be disciplined and intentional in all that we do and continue to encourage a culture that promotes safety, reliability, employee engagement, value creation and environmental responsibility.
These principles have served ONEOK well for decades and will continue to be a key element of our daily operations and business decisions going forward. The energy systems today were designed to operate on the consumers' requirements for affordability, reliability and resiliency.
We will continue to focus on meeting our customers' needs while also transforming these energy systems to drive the overall lowering of greenhouse gas emissions. Yesterday, we reported a strong second quarter financial result, supported by increasing volumes across our system.
The energy and economic backdrop continues to improve with producer activity accelerating and demand for NGLs and natural gas strengthening. Kevin will talk more in detail about how we're addressing those needs. But first, I'll turn the call over to Walt to discuss our financial performance."

With yesterday's earnings announcement, we updated our 2021 financial guidance expectations. Our view of 2021 continues to improve as we now expect 2021 adjusted EBITDA to be above the midpoint of our guidance range of $3.05 billion to $3.35 billion that we provided back in April.
Our outlook for growth in 2022 has continued to strengthen. Higher commodity prices, accelerating producer activity and the rising gas to oil ratio in the Williston Basin provide a tailwind into next year.
With available capacity across our operations and the completion of our Bear Creek plant expansion later this year, significant earnings power remains across our assets without the need for significant capital investment. The strengthening momentum going into 2022 makes us confident that we will achieve or exceed the '22 outlook we have discussed on previous calls.
Now for a brief overview of our second quarter financial performance. ONEOK's second quarter 2021 net income totaled $342 million or $0.77 per share. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $802 million, a 50% increase year-over-year and a 3% increase compared with the first quarter 2021 after backing out the benefit from winter storm Uri.
We ended the second quarter with a higher inventory of unfractionated NGLs due to planned and unplanned outages at some of our fractionation facilities. We expect to recognize $12.5 million of earnings in the second half of 2021 as our current inventory is fractionated and sold, the majority of which will be recognized in the third quarter.
Distributable cash flow was $570 million in the second quarter and dividend coverage was nearly 1.4x. We generated more than $150 million of distributable cash flow in excess of dividends paid during the quarter. Our June 30 net debt-to-EBITDA on an annualized run rate basis was 4.3x. And we continue to work towards our goal of sub-4x.
We ended the second quarter with no borrowings outstanding on our $2.5 billion credit facility and nearly $375 million in cash. In July, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.935 or $3.74 per share on an annualized basis, unchanged from the previous quarter. Our strong balance sheet, ample liquidity and increasing EBITDA from volume growth in our system provides a solid financial backdrop and flexibility as we enter the second half of the year.
I'll now turn the call over to Kevin for an operational update."

Our second quarter NGL raw feed throughput and natural gas processing volumes increased compared with the first quarter 2021 and driven by increasing producer activity, ethane recovery and gas to oil ratios that continue to rise in the Wi",1264,"Thank you, Walt. Our second quarter NGL raw feed throughput and natural gas processing volumes increased compared with the first quarter 2021 and driven by increasing producer activity, ethane recovery and gas to oil ratios that continue to rise in the Williston Basin.
We expect these tailwinds to carry into the second half of the year and into 2022. In our natural gas liquids segment, total NGL raw feed throughput volumes increased 17% compared with the first quarter 2021.
Second quarter raw feed throughput from the Rocky Mountain region increased 18% compared with the first quarter 2021 and more than 85% compared with the second quarter 2020, which included significant production curtailments resulting from the pandemic. 
As a reference point, volumes reached approximately 330,000 barrels per day in this region early this month. At this volume level, we still have more than 100,000 barrels per day of NGL pipeline capacity from the region, allowing us to capture increasing volumes on our system including volume from a new 250 million cubic feet per day third-party plant that came online in early July and expansion of another third-party plant that is underway, and our Bear Creek plant expansion, which is expected to be complete in the first half of the fourth quarter this year.
Total Mid-Continent region raw feed throughput volumes increased 16% compared with the first quarter 2021 and 10% compared with the second quarter 2020. The Arbuckle II expansion was completed in the second quarter, increasing its capacity up to 500,000 barrels per day, adding additional transportation capacity between the Mid-Continent region and the Gulf Coast.
In the Permian Basin, NGL volumes increased 16% compared with the first quarter 2021, primarily as a result of increased ethane recovery and producer activity. Petrochemical demand continues to strengthen and has seen support from a continuing global pandemic recovery.
This led to increased ethane recovery across our system in the second quarter. Ethane volumes on our system in the Rocky Mountain region increased compared with the first quarter 2021 as we continue to incent some ethane recovery on a short-term basis.
Continued ethane recovery in the Rockies in the second half of 2021 will depend on regional natural gas and ethane pricing. We have not included ethane recovery from the Rockies for the remainder of the year in our updated financial guidance. Ethane volumes on our Mid-Continent system increased compared with the first quarter 2021 due to both favorable recovery economics and some incentivized recovery.
We continue to forecast partial ethane recovery in our guidance for the second half of the year in this region. Ethane volumes in the Permian Basin increased in the second quarter compared with the first quarter of 2021. We continue to expect the basin to be in near full recovery in the second half of the year. 
Discretionary ethane on our system or said differently, the amount of ethane that we estimate could be operationally recovered at any given time, but is not economic to recover at current prices without incentives, is approximately 225,000 barrels per day.
Of that total opportunity, 125,000 barrels per day are available in the Rocky Mountain region and 100,000 barrels per day in the Mid-Continent. Full recovery in the Rockies region would provide an opportunity for $500 million in annual adjusted EBITDA at full rates. 
Moving on to the natural gas gathering and processing segment. In the Rocky Mountain region, second quarter processed volumes averaged more than 1.25 billion cubic feet per day, an increase of 6% compared with the first quarter 2021 and more than 50% year-over-year. An outage at one of our plants, which has since come back online, decreased second quarter volumes by approximately 15 million cubic feet per day.
Towards the end of June, volumes reached 1.3 billion cubic feet per day, and we have line of sight to even higher processed volumes later in the year given the recent increase in completion crews and rigs in the basin. 
Conversations with our producers in the region continue to point to higher activity levels in the second half of 2021 and 2022, particularly in Dunn County, where construction on our Bear Creek processing plant is on track for completion in the first half of the fourth quarter of this year. 
Once in service, we will have approximately 1.7 billion cubic feet per day of processing capacity in the basin, and we'll be able to grow our volumes with minimal capital. In the second quarter, we connected 84 wells in the Rocky Mountain region and still expect to connect more than 300 this year.
Based on the most recent producer completion schedules, we expect a significant increase in well connects in the second half of the year with some producers aligning the timing of well completions closer to the completion of Bear Creek.
There are currently 23 rigs operating in the basin with 9 on our dedicated acreage, and there continues to be a large inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells with more than 650 basin-wide and approximately 325 on our dedicated acreage.
We expect the current DUC inventory to get work down before we see producers bring back more rigs to the basin to replenish inventory levels. As we said last quarter, the 8 completion crews currently operating in the basin is enough to reach our well connect guidance for the year. Any additional completion crews would present upside to our guidance.
Rising gas to oil ratios and natural gas flaring in the basin continue to present opportunities for volume growth without the need for additional producer activity. Since 2016, GORs have increased more than 75%.
Recent projections from the North Dakota Pipeline Authority show that even in a flat crude oil production environment, GORs could increase an additional 45% in the next 7 years. This could add 1.3 billion cubic feet per day of gas production and approximately 150,000 barrels per day of C3+ NGL volume to the basin during that same time period. Again, this growth in natural gas is only based on increasing GORs and assumes flat crude oil production.
Any growth in crude oil would be upside to those projections. We've added a new slide in our earnings materials to show these latest North Dakota projections, which include various production scenarios. During the second quarter, the Gathering and Processing segment's average fee rate increased to $1.06 per MMBtu, driven by higher Rocky Mountain region volumes. We now expect the fee rate for 2021 to average between $1 and $1.05 per MMBtu.
The Mid-Continent region average process volumes increased 4% compared with the first quarter 2021 as volumes returned following freeze offs in the first quarter. While the region has received some attention as commodity prices strengthened, producer activity has been more moderate than other areas.
In the Natural Gas Pipelines segment, the segment reported a solid quarter of stable fee-based earnings, the decrease in earnings year-over-year was driven by a onetime contract settlement that provided a $13.5 million benefit to earnings in the second quarter of 2020.
We continue to see increased interest from our customers for additional long-term transportation and storage capacity on our system following the extreme winter weather events earlier this year. Since the first quarter, we have renewed or recontracted additional long-term storage capacity in both Texas and Oklahoma, including a successful open season for more than 1 billion cubic feet of incremental firm storage capacity at our West Texas storage assets.
We'll continue to work with customers to contract additional long-term capacity as we head into the winter heating season. Pierce, that concludes my remarks."

Maybe to position and sorry, Pierce, to put you on the hotspot, hot seat right off the back here. But I was wondering if we can talk about your thoughts around buybacks and CapEx for 2022. And I imagine there's not much on the CapEx front, just sort of given where you are at this point right now, maybe a completion of the frozen frac at this point just with the higher ethane recovery in Kevin's comments about C3+ with respect to GORs. But outside of that doesn't appear to be much on the CapEx side.
I want to sort of take the soft outlooks that have been presented in the past, a $3.5 billion to $4 billion has kind of been thrown around as a potential '22 run rate. It sort of suggests the leverage for what is going to be sub to 4x leverage ratio target. Does this set up for buybacks in '22?
If so, how should we think about execution around buybacks? Or have I got the thought process wrong on CapEx. Just curious on your thoughts."

And the cash flows that we'll generate from that will continue to enhance our deleveraging strategy that's been in place for quite some time. And we're starting to see some of our end goals in the near term coming forward.
And as we get closer to our goals of sub-4x leverage, then obviously, we will expand the horizon of things that we'll look at from a capital allocation. And I think we spent time with peers. We'll look at all of our options as we go forward. You're right that there isn't any major CapEx project on the horizon here. We really doubled the capacity of our long-haul pipes in the NGL business over the last several years and that gives us a lot of running room going forward.
You highlighted that we have a couple of projects that we paused back with the pandemic. And over the course of next year or 2 as producer activity picks up, I would assume that we'll likely clean some of those up and finish them up to meet our customers' needs.
But it's really going to be routine growth and some smaller growth projects that are very attractive going forward. So we'll have plenty of free cash flow to continue to deleverage and then look at all of those capital allocation opportunities over the next couple of years."

I think it's more about what's changing in the energy industry. I think we can probably all agree that the energy systems across the United States, it's going to be very important that we continue to transition into a lower carbon energy system across United States.
So really, it's about how we at ONEOK and the assets and the people and the skill sets that we have are actually going to transform with that energy system. I view that as a 3-step process. First of all, you got to understand what the transformation of the energy systems look like, then you prepare for that -- for what you've learned and what you understand and then you innovate.
And I think that's the 3 focus areas that I would say that we have going forward is understanding where we are preparing and innovating for the future, while at the same time, continuing to grow the base business that we have and the use of natural gas and natural gas liquids because I think the global pool, most countries are not where we are in the United States as far as the maturity of our systems and the transparency that we have in the energy systems here in the United States.
So I think that's going to continue to pull for natural gas demand as well as natural gas liquids growth. While at the same time, we're going to be able to use the skill sets and the talents that we have in our company to transform. I do think transformation is a better word than transition.
Transition to me indicates that you're going to leave one thing and go to another. Transformation, in my opinion, it means that you're going to use something that you have and maybe use it a little bit slightly different in the future to meet some of the problems that we have. 
I do think it's important for the United States to lead in the effort of lower carbon because I think the other parts of the world can learn from what we do, although there's only 6.6 million gigatons of CO2 emissions in the United States versus 51 gigatons over the globe.
So we're a small percentage, but I think it's important for the U.S. to lead in these efforts. And I do feel like that ONEOK is positioned over a long period of time, a lot of these things, as you look at CNG and hydrogen and LNG for long haul and carbon sequestration and capturing methane. Those are all going to be opportunities that we experience over the next several decades."

I thought I would maybe start with an ethane question. This quarter, you guys took up more ethane in the Bakken. And you talk about 25,000 barrels per day of ethane extraction being an incremental $100 million, but that's predicated on you collecting the full $0.28 T&F.
You haven't been collecting that when you're doing it more opportunistically. And when you do provide more ethane to the market this way, it sort of puts a lid on what prices can be. So curious, how do you balance this and make sure you don't provide too much supply that it negatively impacts the frac spread economics in other basins that you're in? And what really has to happen in order for producers to sign up for long-term contracts for ethane TNS out of the Bakken. Is it really only a firm BTU resolution on Northern Border?"

I think in your first question on how do we determine how much ethane you bring out of the Bakken and what's the right amount before putting a lid on ethane prices. Really, what we try to understand is where the next incremental ethane will come out, is that coming off our system or somebody else's system.
And so if we don't bring it out of our system is somebody else can bring ethane out of their side of the system then we will lose the whole uplift that we'll have from buying it at gas and selling it at ethane value. So it's an ongoing process that we look at every month, and we try to make that determination. That's why we don't bring all the ethane out of the Bakken that we could. We could incentivize more, but we just bring what we feel is the right amount of ethane to come out.
And really on your question of what would it take for producers sign up for ethane, they have already signed up for ethane. They have the option today whether or not to bring ethane on the system or not to bring ethane on the system. We have the capacity for them and they signed up for a certain amount of capacity.
What it really comes down to now is what is going to drive the price high enough that we would get a full TNF rate or the full $0.28 that the ethane would come out. And what's going to need to happen for that is you're going to need to continue to have a strong ethane to ethylene spread like we have today, very, very widespread, so that ethane can continue to rise, prices continue to rise and the pet kilns can continue to make money off of that.
The second thing is you need to have more demand. And then we need to see more exports coming out, there is more export capacity out there, and we need to see more crackers. And in the second quarter of next year, the ExxonMobil SABIC cracker is going to come online as well. So that's going to bring on more demand.
And I think the third thing you need to look at is you need to look at the regional gas prices between the Bakken and the other areas. So if we would see the Bakken gas prices dip down like we typically see in the summer. I think all those things together if they work that you have a possibility of an opportunity to see ethane come out of the Bakken at full prices."

I'm going to kick it over to Chuck here just a second because he can give you some updates on what we're doing as it relates to some of the RNG efforts.
But the CNG and LNG for the long haul, I think, is another thing that could be a possibility. Hydrogen is probably out into the future because primarily, right now, you can't take a certain amount of hydrogen based on the tariffs, from the intrastate, and intrastate assets across the United States. But I do think that's a developing opportunity. It's left to be seen economically how that stuff plays out.
And then you got carbon sequestration because 24% of all the carbon a minute of the 6.6 gigatons actually comes from electric generation from coal, oil and natural gas, primarily coal and natural gas. So I think that's going to be important to solve that equation. And of course, transportation has about 28% of that 6.6 gigatons.
So if you converted all the cars today to EVs, then you just switch the problem from a transportation over to electric generation. And then so you didn't really solve the problem. So Chuck, I'm going to let you kind of talk a little bit about our R&D opportunities and what we've already done and then are doing."

But I think more importantly as far as what these opportunities do is they make the existing natural gas pipelines in the United States relevant. Instead of just moving methane that you traditionally get from the wellheads, you're actually capturing methane that is emitted to the air, which is 25x more potent than the CO2.
So you get the uplift in the CO2 equivalents and so you get the extra benefit of removing that. And you're using existing assets to help other industries reduce their environmental footprint. So the relevancy of it is the important part as opposed to some great business opportunity to boost your EBITDA.
It's really designed around the relevancy of making essentially 2.6 million miles of pipeline in the United States, very important to the energy transformation future."

And the Mid-Continent area, which is defined as Southwest Kansas and the Texas Panhandle in Oklahoma, is a net exporter of natural gas even during the month of February, during the middle of winter to the tune of about 3 Bcf a day. That turned back between the demand that we saw in the Mid-Continent and the lack of production for various reasons to basically only 5% exports.
So the real issue is to talk about resiliency of the supply chain and how we can potentially get gas in those kind of situations back from maybe the southeast up into the Mid-Continent if it ever happens again. So those are things that we would be looking at. But it really is looking at not necessarily the capacity that's there today or the contracting of that capacity, we are addressing a little bit of that, which is some uptick in storage and some additional volumes there.
But that's not going to get you through a second winter storm Uri. So it's going to have to be a holistic approach between the exploration and production folks, the midstream folks and the utilities to really get us to a point where we can take on another winter storm Uri.
I will say volumetrically, there were very, very few customers lost in the state of Oklahoma. And so that biometrically was a very positive for us.

Also available to answer your questions are Sheridan Swords, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids; and Chuck Kelley, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas. 
Yesterday, we announced strong third quarter earnings results and increased our 2021 financial guidance expectations. Our third quarter results were driven by NGL and natural gas volume growth on our system, the result of increasing producer activity and improving market demand. As world economics continue to recover from the pandemic, we're seeing demand continue to recover for natural gas and NGLs. And we're focused on helping to meet that increasing demand for these critical energy products, particularly as we head into the winter months. As we look forward, we continue to coordinate with our customers on future growth expectations and are focused on innovation throughout the company. 
In September, we announced a greenhouse gas emissions reduction target, marking another major environmental milestone for our company. Our goal is to achieve an absolute 30% reduction or 2.2 million metric tons of our combined Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030, compared with 2019 levels. We will undertake a number of strategic emission reduction measures to meet this target, including the further electrification of certain natural gas compression assets, implementing additional methane mitigation through best management practices, system optimizations in collaborating with our utility providers to increase the use of low-carbon energy for our operations, just to name a few. As we continue to evaluate low-carbon opportunities, we remain focused on those that will complement our operations and capabilities while providing long-term stakeholder value. As we have additional detail on specific projects or future emission reduction activities, we'll share that information and our progress toward our 2030 target.

With yesterday's earnings announcement, we once again increased our 2021 financial guidance expectations and narrowed our ranges. We now expect net income of $1.43 billion to $1.55 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $3.325 billion to $3.425",413,"Thank you, Pierce. With yesterday's earnings announcement, we once again increased our 2021 financial guidance expectations and narrowed our ranges. We now expect net income of $1.43 billion to $1.55 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $3.325 billion to $3.425 billion with a midpoint of $3.375 billion. This represents a 10% increase in our net income and EPS guidance midpoint and a 5% increase in our adjusted EBITDA midpoint compared with our previous guidance. Our higher expectations are driven by continued volume strength in the Rocky Mountain region and Permian Basin, increased demand for natural gas storage and transportation and higher commodity prices. Our 2021 capital expenditures are expected to be closer to the higher end of our guidance range of $525 million to $675 million as a result of increased producer activity and project timing. We continually work with our customers to evaluate their future capacity needs and supply expectations and will align our projects and capital investment with those needs. 
Our outlook for growth in 2022 continues to strengthen, driven by increasing producer activity and rising gas/oil ratio in the Williston Basin, along with the recent completion of our Bear Creek plant expansion. Additionally, new ethane demand from new and expanding petrochemical facilities is expected to come online before the end of the year. Kevin will provide more detail on each of these shortly. 
Now for a brief overview of our third quarter performance. ONEOK's third quarter 2021 net income totaled $392 million or $0.88 per share, a 26% increase compared with the third quarter 2020 and a 15% increase compared with the prior quarter. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $865 million, a 16% increase year-over-year and an 8% increase compared with the second quarter of 2021. Our September 30 net debt-to-EBITDA on an annualized run rate basis was 4.0x, and we have line of sight to be in sub-4x in the near future. We ended the third quarter with no borrowings outstanding on our $2.5 billion credit facility and nearly $225 million of cash on the balance sheet. 
We continue to proactively manage our balance sheet and upcoming debt maturities. Earlier this week, we redeemed the remaining $536 million of senior notes due February 2022. Our next debt maturity is not until October of 2022. 
In October, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.935 or $3.74 per share on an annualized basis, unchanged from the previous quarter. 
I'll now turn the call over to Kevin for an operational update."
293889,1684382981,2423104,"ONEOK, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2021",2021-11-03,"Earnings Calls","ONEOK, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Walt. In our Natural Gas Liquids segment, total NGL raw feed throughput volumes increased 5% compared with the second quarter of 2021 and 10% year-over-year, averaging nearly 1.3 million barrels per day, our highest NGL volume to date. Third qu",977,"Thank you, Walt. In our Natural Gas Liquids segment, total NGL raw feed throughput volumes increased 5% compared with the second quarter of 2021 and 10% year-over-year, averaging nearly 1.3 million barrels per day, our highest NGL volume to date. Third quarter raw feed throughput from the Rocky Mountain region increased 5% with the second -- compared with the second quarter 2021 and nearly 50% compared with the third quarter 2020. Volume growth was driven by increased producer activity in the region, ethane recovery and increasing volumes from recently connected third-party plants, including a 250 million cubic feet per day third-party plant that came online in July. Raw feed throughput volumes from the Mid-Continent and the Permian Basin also increased. Permian volumes increased 12% compared with the second quarter of 2021, driven by higher ethane recovery and producer activity levels. We also connected an additional third-party plant in the basin during the quarter. The segment was also able to utilize our integrated assets to capture the benefit of location and commodity price differentials during the third quarter, providing additional earnings on top of our primarily fee-based results. 
Petrochemical demand continues to strengthen as facilities have returned to normal operations following Hurricane Ida and as the pandemic recovery continues. 2 new petrochemical plants coming online before the end of the year could provide more than 160,000 barrels per day of additional ethane demand once fully operational. This additional capacity, combined with strong ethane exports, should support a wider ethane to natural gas differential in 2022. 
Ethane volumes on our system in the Rocky Mountain region increased compared with the second quarter 2021 as we incented additional ethane recovery during the third quarter. Recovery continued in October and is also expected throughout November, given current regional natural gas and ethane prices. In other regions, we continue to forecast partial ethane recovery in the Mid-Continent and near full recovery in the Permian for the remainder of the year. All of these assumptions are included in our increased financial guidance for 2021. Any additional ethane recovered would provide upside to our 2021 expectations. 
Discretionary ethane on our system is now more than 225,000 barrels per day. Of that total opportunity, more than 125,000 barrels per day are available in the Rocky Mountain region and 100,000 barrels per day in the Mid-Continent. As NGL volumes continue to grow across our systems, so does the discretionary ethane. 
Moving on to the natural gas gathering and processing segment. In the Rocky Mountain region, third quarter processed volumes averaged nearly 1.3 billion cubic feet per day, a 2% increase compared with the second quarter 2021 and nearly 25% increase year-over-year. Scheduled plant maintenance at 4 of our processing facilities, which have since come back online, decreased third quarter volumes by approximately 30 million cubic feet per day for the quarter. We estimate that approximately 14 to 15 rigs, which can drill approximately 300 wells per year, is enough to maintain 1.4 billion cubic feet per day of production behind our system. Any additional rigs, combined with the rising gas to oil ratios of wells already connected to our system would provide additional volume growth. 
Conversations with our producers in the region continue to point to higher activity levels through the end of the year and into 2022. There are currently 32 rigs and 10 completion crews operating in the basin, with 17 rigs and 5 completion crews on our dedicated acreage. This is more than enough activity to grow gas production on our acreage. In addition to the rigs currently operating in the basin, there remains a large inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells, with more than 520 basin-wide and approximately 300 on our dedicated acreage, compared with about 400 DUCs on our dedicated acreage at this time last year. 
In the third quarter, we connected 72 wells in the Rocky Mountain region. And in October, we connected more than 30 additional wells. Based on the most recent producer completion schedule, we still expect to connect more than 300 wells this year. With our Bear Creek plant expansion and related compressor stations now complete and in service, we should see a significant number of well completions in the fourth quarter in Dunn County as producers have timed their completions with the start-up of our expansion to avoid flaring. The new plant will accommodate increasing volumes as it ramps to full capacity over the next 2 to 3 years. With Bear Creek II's completion, we now have approximately 1.7 billion cubic feet per day of processing capacity in the basin. 
We continue to see increased activity in the Mid-Continent region, with 2 rigs now operating on our acreage and 10 wells connected during the third quarter. Sustained higher natural gas and NGL prices to drive a continued increase in activity next year. During the third quarter, the Gathering and Processing segment's fee rate averaged $1.02 per MMBtu compared with $0.94 per MMBtu in the third quarter of 2020. Changes in our average fee rates continue to be driven by our volume and contract mix each quarter. We still expect the fee rate for 2021 to average between $1 and $1.05 per MMBtu. 
On to the Natural Gas Pipelines segment. This segment's stable fee-based earnings continued to drive solid results, with adjusted EBITDA increasing 8% compared with the prior quarter. As we enter the winter heating season, we continue to see increased interest from customers for additional long-term transportation and storage capacity on our system following the extreme winter weather events earlier this year. The segment's market connected pipelines and more than 52 billion cubic feet of natural gas storage provide critical services to customers year-round, but especially during the winter. As always, we're working with our customers to understand their needs and to help meet increasing demand in the coming months. 
Pierce, that concludes my remarks."

You've got Bear Creek now in service. Is it also fair to assume that you potentially have some PPI inflators on some of your assets like Elk Creek and so forth? 
And so just kind of wondering how to think about ONEOK as we sort of head into 2022. In the past, you've talked about a $3.5 billion to $4 billion upside potential. Is that the case?

In addition to that, you've got, like I said in the remarks, ethane demand coming on the system, which could drive additional ethane recovery as we think about 2022. So that's where I think the tailwinds are. But to your -- you asked a question there about kind of inflators on our contracts. In our NGL segment and our G&P segment, the vast majority of our contracts do have escalators on the fee rates. So we're covered as we think about inflation and other things like that.

I'm not going to give you a number because that will flow with our -- as we provide you guidance early next year. But the way we think about capital, we're constantly evaluating what our customers' needs are and what our capacities are. So rather we're talking about processing, gathering and/or processing needs in the Bakken, frac capacity needs in Belvieu, other pipeline needs maybe on West Texas, we're evaluating all of the information from our customers about what their plans are as we move into '22 and then factoring that in. 
So the great position we're in, as you mentioned, Elk Creek, but even should we need additional frac capacity like an NV5 to restart that paused project, we've already spent a significant amount of that money. So both the additional capital we would need to provide that capacity as well as the time we would need to deliver the capacity, we're in really good shape because we might only need, say, 12 to 18 months to finish up a frac. And the pipeline, we've already got pipe ordered and bought. So we don't have that exposure. So these projects that could come back are in really good shape. We don't have to spend a lot of money, and we can do them relatively quickly."

Yesterday, we announced strong third quarter earnings results and increased our 2021 financial guidance expectations. Our third quarter results were driven by NGL and natural gas volume growth on our system, the result of increasing producer activity and improving market demand. As world economics continue to recover from the pandemic, we're seeing demand continue to recover for natural gas and NGLs. And we're focused on helping to meet that increasing demand for these critical energy products, particularly as we head into the winter months. As we look forward, we continue to coordinate with our customers on future growth expectations and are focused on innovation throughout the company.  
In September, we announced a greenhouse gas emissions reduction target, marking another major environmental milestone for our company. Our goal is to achieve an absolute 30% reduction or 2.2 million metric tons of our combined Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030, compared with 2019 levels. We will undertake a number of strategic emission reduction measures to meet this target, including the further electrification of certain natural gas compression assets, implementing additional methane mitigation through best management practices, system optimizations in collaborating with our utility providers to increase the use of low-carbon energy for our operations, just to name a few. As we continue to evaluate low-carbon opportunities, we remain focused on those that will complement our operations and capabilities while providing long-term stakeholder value. As we have additional detail on specific projects or future emission reduction activities, we'll share that information and our progress toward our 2030 target.

With yesterday's earnings announcement, we once again increased our 2021 financial guidance expectations and narrowed our ranges. We now expect net income of $1.43 billion to $1.55 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $3.325 billion to $3.425",414,"Thank you, Pierce. With yesterday's earnings announcement, we once again increased our 2021 financial guidance expectations and narrowed our ranges. We now expect net income of $1.43 billion to $1.55 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $3.325 billion to $3.425 billion with a midpoint of $3.375 billion. This represents a 10% increase in our net income and EPS guidance midpoints and a 5% increase in our adjusted EBITDA midpoint compared with our previous guidance. Our higher expectations are driven by continued volume strength in the Rocky Mountain region and Permian Basin, increased demand for natural gas storage and transportation and higher commodity prices. Our 2021 capital expenditures are expected to be closer to the higher end of our guidance range of $525 million to $675 million as a result of increased producer activity and project timing. We continually work with our customers to evaluate their future capacity needs and supply expectations and will align our projects and capital investment with those needs.  
Our outlook for growth in 2022 continues to strengthen, driven by increasing producer activity and rising gas to oil ratio in the Williston Basin, along with the recent completion of our Bear Creek plant expansion. Additionally, new ethane demand from new and expanding petrochemical facilities is expected to come online before the end of the year. Kevin will provide more detail on each of these shortly.  
Now for a brief overview of our third quarter performance. ONEOK's third quarter 2021 net income totaled $392 million or $0.88 per share, a 26% increase compared with the third quarter 2020 and a 15% increase compared with the prior quarter. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $865 million, a 16% increase year-over-year and an 8% increase compared with the second quarter 2021. Our September 30 net debt-to-EBITDA on an annualized run rate basis was 4.0x, and we have line of sight to be in sub-4x in the near future. We ended the third quarter with no borrowings outstanding on our $2.5 billion credit facility and nearly $225 million of cash on the balance sheet.  
We continue to proactively manage our balance sheet and upcoming debt maturities. Earlier this week, we redeemed the remaining $536 million of senior notes due February 2022. Our next debt maturity is not until October of 2022.  
In October, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.935 or $3.74 per share on an annualized basis, unchanged from the previous quarter.

In our natural gas liquids segment, total NGL raw feed throughput volumes increased 5% compared with the second quarter of 2021 and 10% year-over-year, averaging nearly 1.3 million barrels per day, our highest NGL volume to date. Third qu",976,"Thank you, Walt. In our natural gas liquids segment, total NGL raw feed throughput volumes increased 5% compared with the second quarter of 2021 and 10% year-over-year, averaging nearly 1.3 million barrels per day, our highest NGL volume to date. Third quarter raw feed throughput from the Rocky Mountain region increased 5% with the second -- compared with the second quarter 2021 and nearly 50% compared with the third quarter 2020. Volume growth was driven by increased producer activity in the region, ethane recovery and increasing volumes from recently connected third-party plants, including a 250 million cubic feet per day third-party plant that came online in July. Raw feed throughput volumes from the Mid-Continent and the Permian Basin also increased. Permian volumes increased 12% compared with the second quarter 2021, driven by higher ethane recovery and producer activity levels. We also connected an additional third-party plant in the basin during the quarter. The segment was also able to utilize our integrated assets to capture the benefit of location and commodity price differentials during the third quarter, providing additional earnings on top of our primarily fee-based results.  
Petrochemical demand continues to strengthen as facilities have returned to normal operations following Hurricane Ida and as the pandemic recovery continues. 2 new petrochemical plants coming online before the end of the year could provide more than 160,000 barrels per day of additional ethane demand once fully operational. This additional capacity, combined with strong ethane exports, should support a wider ethane to natural gas differential in 2022.  
Ethane volumes on our system in the Rocky Mountain region increased compared with the second quarter 2021 as we incented additional ethane recovery during the third quarter. Recovery continued in October and is also expected throughout November, given current regional natural gas and ethane prices. In other regions, we continue to forecast partial ethane recovery in the Mid-Continent and near full recovery in the Permian for the remainder of the year. All of these assumptions are included in our increased financial guidance for 2021. Any additional ethane recovered would provide upside to our 2021 expectations.  
Discretionary ethane on our system is now more than 225,000 barrels per day. Of that total opportunity, more than 125,000 barrels per day are available in the Rocky Mountain region and 100,000 barrels per day in the Mid-Continent. As NGL volumes continue to grow across our systems, so does the discretionary ethane.  
Moving on to the natural gas gathering and processing segment. In the Rocky Mountain region, third quarter processed volumes averaged nearly 1.3 billion cubic feet per day, a 2% increase compared with the second quarter 2021 and nearly 25% increase year-over-year. Scheduled plant maintenance at 4 of our processing facilities, which have since come back online, decreased third quarter volumes by approximately 30 million cubic feet per day for the quarter. We estimate that approximately 14 to 15 rigs, which can drill approximately 300 wells per year, is enough to maintain 1.4 billion cubic feet per day of production behind our system. Any additional rigs, combined with the rising gas to oil ratios of wells already connected to our system would provide additional volume growth.  
Conversations with our producers in the region continue to point to higher activity levels through the end of the year and into 2022. There are currently 32 rigs and 10 completion crews operating in the basin, with 17 rigs and 5 completion crews on our dedicated acreage. This is more than enough activity to grow gas production on our acreage. In addition to the rigs currently operating in the basin, there remains a large inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells with more than 520 basin-wide and approximately 300 on our dedicated acreage, compared with about 400 DUCs on our dedicated acreage at this time last year.  
In the third quarter, we connected 72 wells in the Rocky Mountain region. And in October, we connected more than 30 additional wells. Based on the most recent producer completion schedules, we still expect to connect more than 300 wells this year. With our Bear Creek plant expansion and related compressor stations now complete and in service, we should see a significant number of well completions in the fourth quarter in Dunn County as producers have timed their completions with the start-up of our expansion to avoid flaring. The new plant will accommodate increasing volumes as it ramps to full capacity over the next 2 to 3 years. With Bear Creek II's completion, we now have approximately 1.7 billion cubic feet per day of processing capacity in the basin.  
We continue to see increased activity in the Mid-Continent region, with 2 rigs now operating on our acreage and 10 wells connected during the third quarter. Sustained higher natural gas and NGL prices to drive a continued increase in activity next year. During the third quarter, the gathering and processing segment's fee rate averaged $1.02 per MMBtu compared with $0.94 per MMBtu in the third quarter of 2020. Changes in our average fee rates continue to be driven by our volume and contract mix each quarter. We still expect the fee rate for 2021 to average between $1 and $1.05 per MMBtu.  
On to the natural gas pipelines segment. This segment's stable fee-based earnings continued to drive solid results, with adjusted EBITDA increasing 8% compared with the prior quarter. As we enter the winter heating season, we continue to see increased interest from customers for additional long-term transportation and storage capacity on our system following the extreme winter weather events earlier this year. The segment's market connected pipelines and more than 52 billion cubic feet of natural gas storage provide critical services to customers year-round, but especially during the winter. As always, we're working with our customers to understand their needs and to help meet increasing demand in the coming months.  
Pierce, that concludes my remarks."

In addition to that, you've got, like I said in the remarks, ethane demand coming on the system, which could drive additional ethane recovery as we think about 2022. So that's where I think the tailwinds are. But to your -- you asked a question there about kind of inflators on our contracts. In our NGL segment and our G&P segment, the vast majority of our contracts do have escalators on the fee rates. So we're covered as we think about inflation and other things like that.

But with additional third-party plants online in the second half, GOR trends and that sort of pent-up volumes dynamic you mentioned in anticipation of Bear Creek, can you just frame for us what capital could look like in the G&P or just broadly in 2022?"

I'm not going to give you a number because that will flow with our -- as we provide you guidance early next year. But the way we think about capital, we're constantly evaluating what our customers' needs are and what our capacities are. So rather we're talking about processing, gathering and/or processing needs in the Bakken, frac capacity needs in Belvieu, other pipeline needs maybe on West Texas, we're evaluating all of the information from our customers about what their plans are as we move into '22 and then factoring that in. 
So the great position we're in, as you mentioned, Elk Creek, but even should we need additional frac capacity like in MB-5 to restart that paused project, we've already spent a significant amount of that money. So both the additional capital we would need to provide that capacity as well as the time we would need to deliver the capacity, we're in really good shape because we might only need, say, 12 to 18 months to finish up a frac. And the pipeline, we've already got pipe ordered and bought. So we don't have that exposure. So these projects that could come back are in really good shape. We don't have to spend a lot of money, and we can do them relatively quickly."

That's what producers are telling us. But if you get some weather, could those be delayed? I think the key -- potentially so. But I think the key is we have kind of this arbitrary cutoff at December 31. Well, the well connects are going to get done, whether it's in -- on December 15 or January 15. So as we think -- if we back up and look at the trends over the next several months, clearly, we've got optimism of where we're going to be. But I think, yes, you've hit on there.
