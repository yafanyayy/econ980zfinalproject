Thanks for joining the call this morning. Let me start with the headlines for the full year results. We delivered strong top and bottom line growth and exceeded our previous outlook. We significantly increased o",749,"Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining the call this morning. 
Let me start with the headlines for the full year results. We delivered strong top and bottom line growth and exceeded our previous outlook. We significantly increased our brand and capability investments and improved our market shares. We generated excellent cost savings and cash flow, and we returned significant cash to shareholders. 
Now let's cover the details of our results, starting with sales. Full year net sales were $19.1 billion. That's up 4% year-on-year and included a 2-point drag from currency rates. Organic sales grew 6%, with healthy underlying performance and increased demand related to COVID-19. Volumes were up 4%, and net selling prices and product mix each increased 1%. Mike is going to provide some more color on our top line and market share performance in just a few minutes. 
Moving on to profitability. Full year adjusted gross margin was 37.1%, up 210 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted gross profit increased 10%. We generated $575 million of cost savings from our FORCE and restructuring programs. That was well above our initial target and slightly better than we expected in October. 
For 2021, we're targeting $400 million to $460 million in total cost savings. Commodities were favorable by $175 million in 2020, although they turned inflationary in the fourth quarter. We're planning for commodity inflation of $450 million to $600 million in 2021. Costs are projected to increase broadly in most areas, including pulp and recycled fiber, resin, superabsorbent and distribution expenses. Other manufacturing costs were higher in 2020, including costs related to COVID-19. Foreign currencies were also a headwind, reducing operating profit at a high single-digit rate. 
Moving further down the P&L. Between-the-lines spending was up 110 basis points as a percent of sales. That was driven by advertising, which was up 90 basis points. SG&A spending also increased and included higher incentive compensation, along with capability-building investments. Adjusted operating margin was 18.7%, up 90 basis points, and adjusted operating profit grew 9%. 
In terms of company profitability for 2021, the midpoint of our planning assumptions implies a 70 basis point decline in adjusted operating margin. And while there are a number of moving pieces, it's likely that adjusted gross margin will be down somewhat more than that. 
Turning back to 2020 results. Full year adjusted earnings per share were $7.74, up 12%. Our October guidance was for earnings of $7.50 to $7.65. 
In addition to the strong growth in adjusted operating profit, the bottom line benefited from higher equity income, a lower share count and a slight decline in adjusted effective tax rate. 
Now let's turn to cash flow [indiscernible]. Cash provided by operations was an all-time record $3.7 billion, up $1 billion year-on-year, reflecting outstanding working capital performance and strong earnings. Cash flow is expected to be down year-on-year in 2021 driven by higher cash taxes and working capital. Nonetheless, cash flow should remain strong and well above 2019's level. 
Capital spending was $1.2 billion in 2020, in line with plan and the prior year. We plan to spend between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion in 2021, including activity for our restructuring program and a pickup in growth projects. Based on an initial outlook at longer-term opportunities, we believe spending will be elevated again in 2022. 
On capital allocation, dividends and share repurchases totaled $2.15 billion. That's the 10th consecutive year we've returned at least $2 billion to shareholders. We expect to return a similar level of cash to shareholders in 2021. And as mentioned in the earnings release, our Board has already approved our 49th consecutive annual dividend increase and authorized a new $5 billion share repurchase program. 
Let me finish with a short update on our restructuring program. We continue to make significant progress as we head into the last year of this program. We're about 85% to 90% through the total pretax charges, which we've increased somewhat to reflect delays as a result of COVID-19 and costs for additional savings opportunities. So far, we've generated $420 million of savings and expect to achieve between $540 million and [ $560 ] million of savings by the end of 2021. Our original savings estimate was $500 million to $550 million. Finally, at this point, cash payments are about 75% to 80% complete. 
Overall, it was an excellent year financially while we invested more in the business for the long term and navigated the COVID-19 environment. 
I'll now turn the call over to Mike."
283857,655634364,2180857,"Kimberly-Clark Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 25, 2021",2021-01-25,"Earnings Calls","Kimberly-Clark Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Maria. Good morning, everyone. Hey, let me begin by saying that I am very proud of our K-C team and our accomplishments in 2020. We work tirelessly to protect the health and safety of each other by setting and maintaining strict safety protocol",844,"Thank you, Maria. Good morning, everyone. Hey, let me begin by saying that I am very proud of our K-C team and our accomplishments in 2020. We work tirelessly to protect the health and safety of each other by setting and maintaining strict safety protocols, all of which are in place today. We kept our global supply chain running and safely serve the needs of our consumers and customers, and in many cases, delivering record output. 
At the same time, we delivered healthy top line growth across our portfolio, gain market share, invested and strengthened long-term brand fundamentals and delivered strong financial results. 
Looking more closely at our business segments, we saw excellent performance in personal care with 5% organic sales growth and strong share performance. In North America, organic sales rose 6% driven by broad-based growth in baby and child care. Our market shares were up nicely on both Huggies diapers and GoodNites youth pants. 
In D&E markets, personal care organic sales were also up 6% despite volatile market conditions. More specifically, personal care organic sales were up double digits in China, India and South Africa, up high single digits in Eastern Europe and up low single digits in Latin America. We also improved our share positions in many D&E markets. 
Looking at our other segments, organic sales were up 13% in consumer tissue and down 7% in K-C Professional. As expected, both businesses experienced the effect of COVID-19 and the shift to more consumers working from home. We're pleased with how our K-C team managed through that volatility. 
To meet elevated demand in consumer tissue, we significantly reduced our SKU count and leveraged our global supply network to increase production, including support from KCP. We continue to focus on category expanding and brand building programs while improving our market execution. Those actions helped us gain market share for Kleenex facial tissue in North America and Europe. 
In KCP, where the washroom category continues to be a significant part of our business, we made good progress pivoting the growth opportunities in other parts of the business, including in wipers and safety products. Sales of those products were up double digits in North America. 
Importantly, we grew or maintained market share in approximately 60% of the 80 key cohorts that we track. I'm pleased to see our brands winning in the marketplace. 
Overall, our results were strong, and I'm encouraged by the way we executed in 2020. 
Next, I'll turn to our outlook for 2021. We expect a more challenging environment, especially compared to last year. More specifically, we expect some of the net benefit from COVID dynamics, including higher consumer demand, to reverse. In addition, commodity costs are rising globally, and we're also reflecting our latest view on economic conditions and birth rate trends. 
Despite these factors, we're confident in our ability to deliver top line growth and expect to strengthen our market positions and improve our company for long-term value creation. 
Our plans call for total sales growth of 4% to 6% in 2021, and that includes 2 points from the Softex acquisition and a 1- to 2-point benefit from currencies. We expect to grow organic sales of 1% to 2%. We plan to leverage and scale our brand-building capabilities and investments that we've made over the past 2 years. 
We have a healthy innovation pipeline, including near-term launches for Huggies in North America, China, Eastern Europe and Latin America. And we've also upgraded products for our global Kotex brand in several markets. 
We expect to benefit from selective pricing actions and other revenue management programs, but we're not currently planning for broad-based list price increases. And we'll continue to make capability and technology investments to drive long-term success. 
On advertising, spending should be similar to 2020 levels, and this reflects the increases we've made over the last 2 years and confidence in the strong ROIs from digital. We believe this level of investment is sufficient to support our growth plans in the current environment. 
On the bottom line, we're targeting adjusted earnings per share of $7.75 to $8. That's [ evened ] up 3% year-on-year. We're focused on delivering our annual plan while managing the quarter-to-quarter volatility that could be higher than normal in this environment. 
Finally, because of the different COVID dynamics in 2020 and 2021, we think it is relevant to consider our performance over both years. So on that basis, using the midpoint of our 2021 outlook, we're projecting to grow organic sales approximately 4% and to increase adjusted earnings per share 7% on average over that 2-year period. Those growth rates are slightly above our medium-term objectives. 
In conclusion, we're on track with K-C Strategy 2022, and we're managing effectively through a very challenging environment. We're improving our top line and strengthening our brands, our market positions and our company for the long term. We continue to be optimistic about our opportunities to deliver balanced and sustainable growth and create shareholder value. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. And so now we'll be happy to take your questions."

Lauren, the 2020 outlook definitely reflects our confidence in our ability to sustain healthy brand performance, but we do expect to have a net drag due to the COVID overlap or the COVID-affected demand overlap from 2020. So that 1 to 2 organic, it's in the lower half of our range, but it does reflect healthy underlying performance in both personal care and consumer tissue, personal care being up, as I mentioned, about 5% organic in the fourth quarter. And then we believe toward the second half an improvement in K-C Professional. 
The drag from consumer tissue, the way we're looking at that business, and we're tracking -- we think there's a pretty good correlation with mobility data. We do expect the current environment in developed markets to look similar to what it is right now through the first half and then for people to gradually begin returning to work in the second half. And so that's what we factored in. We know there will be a cycle and -- in our plans right now that certainly a part of it will be -- there will be -- we'll be lapping some stock up activity that occurred toward the end of the first quarter of last year and throughout the second quarter of last year. We know we'll be cycling that, but we do still expect at-home consumption to be somewhat more elevated than -- certainly than 2019, down from 2020, but still certainly a little more elevated. 
And then we feel like we have strong momentum in our personal care business globally. And as you go across markets, we saw robust growth and share growth against most of our personal care businesses across markets."

We do think that we're going to have to cycle some of that extreme stock-up behavior, but we do think consumption levels at home will remain elevated at least through the first half and then tailored -- feathered down in the back half of the year.

But you are looking at significant commodity cost increases, as you outlined for 2021. So maybe just talk a little more conceptually about your approach to pricing. Are you a little more hesitant to be aggressive in terms of pushing it given you're coming off a couple of years of gross margin expansion? Is there maybe more pricing later in the year? Just sort of how you think about pricing across your portfolio in light of what does look like it will be pretty significant commodity pressure. 
And then secondly, we did see some slowdown in the scanner day in the U.S. in December and January. Is that more temporary factors, whether it be supply constraints or consumer deloading? Is that expected to be more of a temporary phenomenon? Or how are you thinking about trends over the next couple of months given what we've seen in the recent U.S. scanner data?"

Maybe, Dara, I'll start with the last part first, which is I think, yes, we did see a run-up in December from consumption, particularly on tissue. It has softened a little bit. And so we saw that throughout last year. And so it's moving around",379,"Yes. Okay. Maybe, Dara, I'll start with the last part first, which is I think, yes, we did see a run-up in December from consumption, particularly on tissue. It has softened a little bit. And so we saw that throughout last year. And so it's moving around quite a bit from month-to-month and actually week-to-week if you look at the details. So that's something we expect. But we do think that the fundamental dynamic is there are more people at home at this time than there were last year, that will continue through a big chunk of 2021. And then at some point, when hopefully, when the populations end markets get vaccinated and people will be returning to work, and we'll see a decline in some at-home tissue consumption at that point. But for the -- for our purposes, I think we've got that in the call, and we've gone through a thorough forecast of that. 
With regard to the pricing, again, we do expect some significant cost inflation in the year. It's in our plans, and it's going to affect both the consumer tissue side and the personal care side. We're going to take appropriate actions. And certainly, that's going to -- if we're going to pull all the levers, and I've mentioned already, certainly around cost management. But in addition to that, it's one of the reasons why we're very pleased that we've got a robust revenue growth management capability up and running globally across our regions. And the levers we are working. I mentioned Olivia will be selective account changes, some selective price -- list price increases and then a lot of work around trade efficiency and managing promotions. 
On the promotion front, I would say the pricing environment, we expect that to remain constructive for the dynamics I just mentioned with Olivia, which is I think demand will continue to be a little bit elevated with supply under pressure in developed markets, especially in North America. And so we feel good about the progress we've made on our high road strategy and really not interested long term on kind of renting share through a promotion activity. And so we're going to work hard to continue to drive a strong base -- a robust base business."

I'll start with the hedging questions. We broadly don't use hedging. We do take advantage of our contract negotiations to try to put some parameters around the highs and lows that we will experience on certain commodities, but no formal hedging. 
In terms of the 2021 outlook, as a reminder, commodity costs in general were at low levels in 2020, particularly in the first half of the year. And costs for many inputs, excluding pulp, started to move higher sequentially over the last couple of months and exited the year already meaningfully above 2020's full year average. So many of those are expected to move higher again in the early part of 2021. If you look back 3 months ago, we were expecting some inflation in 2021, and the forward outlook has moved higher just in the last 60 days. The top 2 inflation drivers for this year are expected to be pulp and polymer-based materials. Together, those 2 input costs represent more than half of the inflation outlook. 
So if I tick through a few things. Virgin pulp, we're expecting inflation, and that follows 1.5 years of very low pricing. So in virgin pulp, we're looking for it to be up high single digits on average. Polymer resins, we're expecting to be up significantly, 30% or maybe even higher in North America. Nonwovens and superabsorbent will follow that. But to a lesser degree, those dynamics are largely supply-driven at this point. Recycled fiber, we're expecting to be up mid-teens. Distribution costs, we're expecting to remain inflationary, and that's mostly due to industry supply constraints. In other materials such as third-party purchased, safety gloves and PPE and KCP are facing significant increases if you look at what's happening in those markets. So that's the assumption for 2021."

I'm going to ask on pricing maybe a little bit differently, not to beat the dead horse here. But just on the heels of what Maria just communicated and the fact that the commodity increase is like roughly a 300 basis point unfavorable impact, understanding you're coming off of a strong gross margin year. Also understanding you said at this point, you're not planning on broad-based list price increases. What do you think that either you or retailers want to see? I know sometimes there's -- retailers want to see certain permanence, if you will, to price increases. They don't want to whip prices around. Frankly, [indiscernible] as the brand owner. But given the fact that you're looking at a 300 basis point headwind, close to it, and then you sort of tumble through the numbers for what you guys outlined for 4 savings in restructuring, and there's not a big offset, not a tremendous offset outside of those 2 favorable numbers, at least for kind of doing the math right in terms of what you're getting around revenue growth management, et cetera. So it kind of begs the question, why not with respect to pricing behind the strong brand portfolio? So hopefully, I ask that a little bit differently. Just would be great to get your response, and then I'll pass it on."

And so for us, pulling up our lever across both the commercial side and our cost side, whether that's supply chain costs or being a little bit more aggressive on taking the right pricing actions, for us, is going to be important for this year.

So first, I just want to kind of validate if that's a fair way to think about it. And if it is, I guess I'm a little surprised at its simplicity. And so I'm guessing that there are some moving parts around those variables. So if you could maybe call out some of those moving parts and think about how you're thinking about them and why they sort of cancel each other out. It looks like you get a little bit of net leverage on sort of constant dollar-based marketing spend, but I'm just struggling to find out some of the nuance around the OI guide."

And then in addition to that, as Mike mentioned, we've got the benefits from Softex and currencies will be or expected to be a benefit on the top line. 
In addition to the benefits from sales, we are expecting good cost savings in this year. And going the other way, we've got commodity inflation, which we talked about. And we're also continuing to invest in the business and experience kind of general noncommodity inflation. And it is pretty straightforward as you've done the math, that kind of gets you to our guide on operating profit. And then below that, we would expect a lower share count. Nonoperating expense will be lower. Equity income will be about similar, maybe up slightly, and that will be offset by a slightly higher effective tax rate. And that's how you pick up the additional point on the top end of the EPS growth. 
So I think in terms of some of the some of the nuances on advertising spend, we've given you the numbers for 2020. We would expect that to be roughly similar on a dollar basis in 2021, and we think that's appropriate for the environment that we're in, and it follows 2 years of meaningful increases in our advertising investment. We would expect to continue to invest in capability building and technology on the between-the-lines side of the house.

We -- I did say in my remarks that advertising will be -- I think will -- 2021 levels will be similar to 2020 levels. I think we feel like that is sufficient for the growth that's in our plans for this year. But in the near term, we want that to get more efficient, especially given what -- everything that everybody's asked about with regard to commodities. So we're expecting productivity in terms of how we spend our advertising and how we make that more efficient and how we spend our trade and how we make that more efficient as well as throughout all the supply chain. So that's one part. We feel like it's efficient for our growth plans for this year. 
That said, I will tell you that we do have additional plans, and we are going to invest in other capability areas this year as well, right? And certainly, as we continue to drive our digital marketing programs, that's an area that we've continued to invest in terms of capability. We'll be investing more in our cost management capability. We brought in a new supply chain leader from the outside who see some good opportunities for us, and we'll be investing to take the organization and bring the tools. And so we can systematically drive better planning and better capability across the organization across markets and deliver -- we see productivity as a key enabler to our long-term strategy and to fuel the investment that we need.

That improvement is really driven by better execution and the investments that we just talked about in innovation, advertising and our commercial capabilities. So the improvement is really broad-based. 
And if I just think about D&E, I think growth in the fourth quarter was across every region. So we saw double-digit increases in China, Argentina, India. India, which is an important long-term growth market for us, Africa, which I may have mentioned for the first time on the call here. And then we had high single-digit growth in Eastern Europe and Brazil. So we feel good about the performance of our markets. 
I think the one area on -- in terms of 2021, we're going to continue to expect uncertainty due to COVID, particularly in D&E markets. And the reason I say that, that uncertainty is likely to be higher this year than it was last year because infections are climbing and at a higher rate than they were last year. And so we are going to see new waves. We're expecting additional waves to hit -- to occur in Latin America soon, and I think we're actually starting to see that now. And so that's going to have an ongoing effect that is just hard to quantify. 
Our experience last year was an economy would maybe go on restriction, and the mobility will decline for a period and then bounce back. And then we saw that in Brazil. So for example, I think in the third quarter, the economy was locked down for quite a bit of time. And then in the fourth quarter, we had a high single-digit organic growth increase in Brazil, share growth in Brazil and a very strong fourth quarter performance. And so our experience will tell us we're going to expect and see some bumps along the way in D&E, but we are planning for overall growth."

Specific to last year, though, starting with the -- I think it was the third week -- second or third week of March, we started to see extreme elevated levels of consumption with consumers stocking up. And that's when you recall the shelves were empty. I think the third week of March last year, the scanner data, I would say, the category was up 212%. So that's one lap. I think we will not see that as much this year, and that's certainly a piece that we're going to have to cycle.

Overall, I would say in North America tissue, our shares -- I would say our shares are kind of even with year ago and -- or even down a little bit in our bath tissue, primarily driven by supply constraints. And so the demand is there. We're shipping everything we can make and trying to fill up both consumer and customer demand there. But we're actually down a little bit on share. But I think we -- the category had unprecedented 20% growth over the year last year in North America. So we really kind of moved mountains to serve the demand. 
I think overall, our shares were very strong for the year. As I mentioned in the remarks, we were up or even in about [ 60% ] of our markets globally or key cohorts globally. And I think we saw progression through the year and really strengthening in the second half of the year. And that's really factored into our thinking, and it is why we believe, particularly in our personal care business globally, which has been less affected by COVID. And if anything, I think the categories have been more -- faced more headwind due to COVID than tailwinds globally. But for the year, personal care was up 5%. We did see acceleration in the back half. And very comprehensive growth across markets. 
So if I -- I'll just tell you, Andrea, the share growth was very broad-based. We saw very strong performance in China in both fem care and diapers. Brazil in the fourth quarter, Argentina where we took on share leadership in diapers during the year. Peru, which I mentioned was a challenging market for us in 2019, has really improved, and we were up by multiple share points in the back half of the year. Eastern Europe, Russia continues to see strong robust share growth. And as I mentioned, kind of the important emerging markets for us like Africa and India, we're also seeing good robust share growth as well."

I guess my question is, why do you think that is? Is this like a COVID benefit, parents at home changing more frequently than the caregiver usually would? Is it a stock-up dynamic?

I think it was down 1 versus it was down 2 to the prior year in 2019 in that range. And so I think the category, at least lagging a year, I would say, has behaved similarly in the sense of volume, I think, for the categories has been from quarter-to-quarter down 1 or 2-ish, right, in that range. So consistent with the birth rate. The category dollar value has grown because of premiumization, and I think that is our core strategy for big developed markets. We still think there's a lot of opportunity for us to elevate our categories. Our customers believe that. And I think we're seeing that in the performance, particularly with Huggies in North America. For the quarter, I think we were up over 3 share points in the diaper category. And if you try to kind of put your finger on exactly what that is, it's -- there's nothing -- there's no one silver bullet. There's a lot of things going on. And we're excited about the innovation we've brought to the category. We have more comprehensive innovation we're bringing this year. I think we're touching our focus on premium this year, and I think we're touching 75% of our portfolio with really good innovation. And so we're really excited about that. But I don't know that we'll define the laws of gravity for the category and the birth rate. It's been consistent. Things you hear, Jason, around [ 85 ] or Lauren mentioned 8% category declines.

In D&E, I think a little tough to call right now.

So that's, for me, the strategic point. 
I do think when categories get overpromoted, it tends to drive some commoditization. And over time, I think it lowers the growth potential of that category. So for me, I would like our organization to be very disciplined about how we reintroduce promotions into the marketplace. 
Certainly, I think we have great partnerships with our customers and recognize the importance for it to build their business, and we're going to be great partners with them. But I do think how we think about promotions, I think you're asking the right questions. And so for us to be -- continue to be very disciplined about how we think about it and how we manage it will be important going forward. 
And the other part of it is it's a big spend for us, and it's not -- in any given year, the money is not perfectly spent. And so we can always get better. That's why we've invested in capability and broaden a lot of tools in our revenue management capability to give us the analytics to help us spend that money more wisely going forward."

Let me start with the headlines for the full year results. We delivered strong top and bottom line growth and exceeded our previous outlook. We significantly increased our brand and capability investments and improved our market shares. We generated excellent cost savings and cash flow, and we returned significant cash to shareholders.
Now let's cover the details of our results, starting with sales. Full year net sales were $19.1 billion. That's up 4% year-on-year and included a 2-point drag from currency rates. Organic sales grew 6% with healthy underlying performance and increased demand related to COVID-19. Volumes were up 4%, and net selling prices and product mix, each, increased 1%. Mike is going to provide some more color on our top line and market share performance in just a few minutes.
Moving on to profitability. Full year adjusted gross margin was 37.1%, up 210 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted gross profit increased 10%. We generated $575 million of cost savings from our FORCE and restructuring programs that was well above our initial target and slightly better than we expected in October. For 2021, we're targeting $400 million to $460 million in total cost savings. 
Commodities were favorable by $175 million in 2020, although they turned inflationary in the fourth quarter. We're planning for commodity inflation of $450 million to $600 million in 2021. Costs are projected to increase broadly in most areas, including pulp and recycled fiber, resin, superabsorbent and distribution expenses. Other manufacturing costs were higher in 2020, including costs related to COVID-19. Foreign currencies were also a headwind, reducing operating profit at a high single-digit rate. 
Moving further down the P&L. Between-the-line spending was up 110 basis points as a percent of sales. That was driven by advertising, which was up 90 basis points. SG&A spending also increased and included higher incentive compensation, along with capability-building investments. Adjusted operating margin was 18.7%, up 90 basis points; and adjusted operating profit grew 9%. In terms of company profitability for 2021, the midpoint of our planning assumptions implies a 70 basis point decline in adjusted operating margin. And while there are a number of moving pieces, it's likely that adjusted gross margin will be down somewhat more than that. 
Turning back to 2020 results. Full year adjusted earnings per share were $7.74, up 12%. Our October guidance was for earnings of $7.50 to $7.65. In addition to the strong growth in adjusted operating profit, the bottom line benefited from higher equity income, a lower share count and a slight decline in adjusted effective tax rate. 
Now let's turn to cash flow and capital efficiency. Cash provided by operations was an all-time record $3.7 billion, up $1 billion year-on-year, reflecting outstanding working capital performance and strong earnings. Cash flow is expected to be down year-on-year in 2021 driven by higher cash taxes and working capital. Nonetheless, cash flow should remain strong and well above 2019's level. Capital spending was $1.2 billion in 2020, in line with plan and the prior year. We plan to spend between $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion in 2021, including activity for our restructuring program and a pickup in growth projects. Based on an initial outlook at longer-term opportunities, we believe spending will be elevated again in 2022.
On capital allocation, dividends and share repurchases totaled $2.15 billion. That's the 10th consecutive year we've returned at least $2 billion to shareholders. We expect to return a similar level of cash to shareholders in 2021. And as mentioned in the earnings release, our Board has already approved our 49th consecutive annual dividend increase and authorized a new $5 billion share repurchase program. 
Let me finish with a short update on our restructuring program. We continue to make significant progress as we head into the last year of this program. We're about 85% to 90% through the total pretax charges, which we've increased somewhat to reflect delays as a result of COVID-19 and costs for additional savings opportunities. So far, we've generated $420 million of savings and expect to achieve between $540 million and $560 million of savings by the end of 2021. Our original savings estimate was $500 million to $550 million. Finally, at this point, cash payments are about 75% to 80% complete.
Overall, it was an excellent year financially while we invested more in the business for the long term and navigated the COVID-19 environment. 
I'll now turn the call over to Mike."

Hey, let me begin by saying that I am very proud of our K-C team and our accomplishments in 2020. We work tirelessly to protect the health and safety of each other by setting and maintaining strict safety protocols, all of which are in place today. We kept our global supply chain running and safely serve the needs of our consumers and customers, and in many cases, delivering record output. At the same time, we delivered healthy top line growth across our portfolio, gain market share, invested and strengthened long-term brand fundamentals and delivered strong financial results.
Looking more closely at our business segments, we saw excellent performance in personal care with 5% organic sales growth and strong share performance. In North America, organic sales rose 6% driven by broad-based growth in baby and child care. Our market shares were up nicely on both Huggies Diapers and GoodNites Youth Pants. 
In D&E markets, personal care organic sales were also up 6% despite volatile market conditions. More specifically, personal care organic sales were up double digits in China, India and South Africa, up high single digits in Eastern Europe and up low single digits in Latin America. We also improved our share positions in many D&E markets. 
Looking at our other segments, organic sales were up 13% in consumer tissue and down 7% in K-C Professional. As expected, both businesses experienced the effect of COVID-19 and the shift to more consumers working from home. We're pleased with how our K-C team managed through that volatility. To meet elevated demand in consumer tissue, we significantly reduced our SKU count and leveraged our global supply network to increase production, including support from KCP. We continue to focus on category-expanding and brand-building programs while improving our market execution. Those actions helped us gain market share for Kleenex facial tissue in North America and Europe. 
In KCP, where the washroom category continues to be a significant part of our business, we made good progress pivoting the growth opportunities in other parts of the business, including in wipers and safety products. Sales of those products were up double digits in North America.
Importantly, we grew or maintained market share in approximately 60% of the 80 key cohorts that we track. I'm pleased to see our brands winning in the marketplace. 
Overall, our results were strong, and I'm encouraged by the way we executed in 2020. 
Next, I'll turn to our outlook for 2021. We expect a more challenging environment, especially compared to last year. More specifically, we expect some of the net benefit from COVID dynamics, including higher consumer demand, to reverse. In addition, commodity costs are rising globally, and we're also reflecting our latest view on economic conditions and birth rate trends. Despite these factors, we're confident in our ability to deliver top line growth and expect to strengthen our market positions and improve our company for long-term value creation.
Our plans call for total sales growth of 4% to 6% in 2021, and that includes 2 points from the Softex acquisition and a 1- to 2-point benefit from currencies. We expect to grow organic sales of 1% to 2%. We plan to leverage and scale our brand-building capabilities and investments that we've made over the past 2 years. We have a healthy innovation pipeline, including near-term launches for Huggies in North America, China, Eastern Europe and Latin America. And we've also upgraded products for our global Kotex brand in several markets. We expect to benefit from selective pricing actions and other revenue management programs, but we're not currently planning for broad-based list price increases. And we'll continue to make capability and technology investments to drive long-term success. 
On advertising, spending should be similar to 2020 levels, and this reflects the increases we've made over the last 2 years and confidence in the strong ROIs from digital. We believe this level of investment is sufficient to support our growth plans in the current environment.
On the bottom line, we're targeting adjusted earnings per share of $7.75 to $8. That's evened up 3% year-on-year. We're focused on delivering our annual plan while managing the quarter-to-quarter volatility that could be higher than normal in this environment. 
Finally, because of the different COVID dynamics in 2020 and 2021, we think it is relevant to consider our performance over both years. So on that basis, using the midpoint of our 2021 outlook, we're projecting to grow organic sales approximately 4% and to increase adjusted earnings per share 7%, on average, over that 2-year period. Those growth rates are slightly above our medium-term objectives.
In conclusion, we're on track with K-C Strategy 2022, and we're managing effectively through a very challenging environment. We're improving our top line and strengthening our brands, our market positions and our company for the long term. We continue to be optimistic about our opportunities to deliver balanced and sustainable growth and create shareholder value.
That concludes our prepared remarks, and so now we'll be happy to take your questions."

The drag from consumer tissue, the way we're looking at that business and we're tracking, we think there's a pretty good correlation with mobility data. We do expect the current environment in developed markets to look similar to what it is right now through the first half and then for people to gradually begin returning to work in the second half, and so that's what we factored in. We know there will be a cycle. And in our plans right now, that's certainly -- a part of it will be -- there will be -- we'll be lapping some big stock-up activity that occurred toward the end of the first quarter of last year and throughout the second quarter of last year. We know we'll be cycling that, but we do still expect at-home consumption to be somewhat more elevated than -- certainly than 2019, down from 2020, but still certainly a little more elevated. 
And then we feel like we have strong momentum in our personal care business globally. And as you go across markets, we saw robust growth and share growth against most of our personal care businesses across markets."

There was 2 components of that. One is just people being at home more and therefore driving elevated consumption. And then the other part was, as you read about in the papers, the high stock-up levels and people carrying a lot more inventory at home. We do think that we're going to have to cycle some of that extreme stock-up behavior, but we do think consumption levels at home will remain elevated at least through the first half and then tailored -- feathered down in the back half of the year.

Given the unusual year that we had this year in consumer tissue and the way that demand and supply have played out, customer-specific plans and events have changed more dynamically than they have in previous years, and that made it even harder to forecast.

And then certainly, with revenue growth management, how we manage our trade funding and how we get more efficient in our trade funding, we will be making some moves there. So I think there's no absolute rules in terms of what you're cycling in terms of the commodity and everything else, but our goal is to drive margin expansion. It's core to our K-C 2022 strategy, and we're confident in our ability to deliver over the long term. I think given kind of the heavy puts and takes driven by the current environment, it's reasonable to expect some choppiness from quarter-to-quarter, whereas in the case of this year, even year-to-year.

Your commentary was helpful, but you are looking at significant commodity cost increases, as you outlined for 2021. So maybe just talk a little more conceptually about your approach to pricing. Are you a little more hesitant to be aggressive in terms of pushing it given you're coming off a couple of years of gross margin expansion? Is there maybe more pricing later in the year? Just sort of how you think about pricing across your portfolio in light of what does look like it will be pretty significant commodity pressure.
And then secondly, we did see some slowdown in the scanner data in the U.S. in December and January. Is that more temporary factors, whether it be supply constraints or consumer deloading? Is that expected to be more of a temporary phenomenon? Or how are you thinking about trends over the next couple of months given what we've seen in the recent U.S. scanner data?"

Maybe, Dara, I'll start with the last part first, which is I think, yes, we did see a run-up in December from consumption, particularly on tissue. It has softened a little bit, and so we saw that throughout last year. And so it's moving around quite a bit from month-to-month and actually week-to-week, if you look at the details. So that's something we expect. But we do think that the fundamental dynamic is there are more people at home at this time than there were last year. That will continue through a big chunk of 2021. And then at some point, when hopefully, when the populations and markets get vaccinated and people will be returning to work, then we'll see a decline in some at-home tissue consumption at that point. But for the -- for our purposes, I think we've got that in the call, and we've gone through a thorough forecast of that.
With regard to the pricing, again, we do expect some significant cost inflation in the year. It's in our plans, and it's going to affect both the consumer tissue side and the personal care side. We're going to take appropriate actions. And certainly, that's going to -- if we're going to pull all the levers, and I've mentioned already, certainly around cost management. But in addition to that, it's one of the reasons why we're very pleased that we've got a robust revenue growth management capability up and running globally across our regions. And the levers we are working I mentioned Olivia will be selective count changes, some selective price -- list price increases and then a lot of work around trade efficiency and managing promotions.
On the promotion front, I would say the pricing environment, we expect that to remain constructive for the dynamics I just mentioned with Olivia, which is I think demand will continue to be a little bit elevated with supply under pressure in developed markets, especially in North America. And so we feel good about the progress we've made on our high road strategy and really not interested, long term, on kind of renting share through a promotion activity. And so we're going to work hard to continue to drive a strong base -- a robust base business."

I'll start with the hedging questions. We broadly don't use hedging. We do take advantage of our contract negotiations to try to put some parameters around the highs and lows that we will experience on certain commodities, but no formal hedging. 
In terms of the 2021 outlook, as a reminder, commodity costs, in general, were at low levels in 2020, particularly in the first half of the year. And costs for many inputs, excluding pulp, started to move higher sequentially over the last couple of months and exited the year already meaningfully above 2020's full year average. So many of those are expected to move higher again in the early part of 2021. If you look back 3 months ago, we were expecting some inflation in 2021, and the forward outlook has moved higher just in the last 60 days. The top 2 inflation drivers for this year are expected to be pulp and polymer-based materials. Together, those 2 input costs represent more than half of the inflation outlook. 
So if I tick through a few things, virgin pulp, we're expecting inflation, and that follows 1.5 years of very low pricing. So in virgin pulp, we're looking for it to be up high single digits, on average. Polymer resins, we're expecting to be up significantly, 30% or maybe even higher in North America. Nonwovens and superabsorbent will follow that but to a lesser degree. Those dynamics are largely supply driven at this point. Recycled fiber, we're expecting to be up mid-teens. Distribution costs, we're expecting to remain inflationary, and that's mostly due to industry supply constraints. In other materials, such as third-party purchased safety gloves and PPE and KCP are facing significant increases if you look at what's happening in those markets. So that's the assumption for 2021."

I'm going to ask on pricing maybe a little bit differently, not to beat the dead horse here.

I know sometimes there's -- retailers want to see certain permanence, if you will, to price increases. They don't want to whip prices around, frankly, nor to you as the brand owner. 
But given the fact that you're looking at 300 basis point headwind, close to it, and then you sort of tumble through the numbers for what you guys outlined for savings in restructuring, and there's not a big offset, not a tremendous offset outside of those 2 favorable numbers, at least for kind of doing the math right in terms of what you're getting around revenue growth management, et cetera. So it kind of begs the question, why not with respect to pricing behind the strong brand portfolio? So hopefully, I asked that a little bit differently.

I will say that the pricing calls are -- have come in more recently, and so they've changed over the last several months. And so we are working through that. And -- but certainly, we recognize the goal is that we've got to drive margin expansion, and we need to recover some of the input cost increases. And so for us, pulling out our lever across both the commercial side and our cost side, whether that's supply chain costs or being a little bit more aggressive on taking the right pricing actions, for us, is going to be important for this year. And so we are going to make those moves as we kind of work through the plan."

So if I take the midpoint of your sales guidance and apply it to 2020's operating income base, grow it, say, 5%, subtract out the midpoint of your inflation outlook, add back expected savings, also around about the midpoint, I essentially tie out to your 2% OI growth guide. So first, just want to kind of validate if that's a fair way to think about it. And if it is, I guess I'm a little surprised at its simplicity, and so I'm guessing that there are some moving parts around those variables. So if you could maybe call out some of those moving parts and think about how you're thinking about them and why they sort of cancel each other out. It looks like you get a little bit of net leverage on sort of constant dollar-based marketing spend, but I'm just struggling to find out some of the nuance around the OI guide."

If I look at our 2021 outlook, we're expecting a solid benefit from top line growth. On the organic side of that, we're expecting positive volume mix and price. And then in addition to that, as Mike mentioned, we've got the benefits from Softex, and currencies will be or expected to be a benefit on the top line. 
In addition to the benefits from sales, we are expecting good cost savings in this year. And going the other way, we've got commodity inflation, which we talked about, and we're also continuing to invest in the business and experience kind of general non-commodity inflation. And it is pretty straightforward. As you've done the math, that kind of gets you to our guide on operating profit. And then below that, we would expect a lower share count. Nonoperating expense will be lower. Equity income will be about similar, maybe up slightly, and that will be offset by a slightly higher effective tax rate. And that's how you pick up the additional point on the top end of the EPS growth.
So I think in terms of some of the nuances on advertising spend, we've given you the numbers for 2020. We would expect that to be roughly similar on a dollar basis in 2021, and we think that's appropriate for the environment that we're in. And it follows 2 years of meaningful increases in our advertising investment. We would expect to continue to invest in capability building and technology on the between-the-line side of the house. And I think those are -- I already went through the commodity assumptions, and we've talked about our pricing assumption as it relates to that."

There's definitely a couple of things. One, we feel great about the investments we've made. And we've put in, as you probably can do the math, a pretty significant investment over the last couple of years. And we feel like that's working really hard, and it's driving broad-based growth across most of our markets at this point. And so we feel great about that. 
We -- I did say in my remarks that advertising will be -- I think 2021 levels will be similar to 2020 levels. I think we feel like that is sufficient for the growth that's in our plans for this year. But in the near term, we want that to get more efficient, especially given what's -- everything that -- everybody's asked about with regard to commodities. So we're expecting productivity in terms of how we spend our advertising and how we make that more efficient and how we spend our trade and how we make that more efficient as well as throughout all the supply chain. So that's one part. We feel like it's efficient for our growth plans for this year. 
That said, I will tell you that we do have additional plans, and we are going to invest in other capability areas this year as well, right? And certainly, as we continue to drive our digital marketing programs, that's an area that we've continued to invest in terms of capability. We'll be investing more in our cost management capability. We brought in a new supply chain leader from the outside who see some good opportunities for us, and we'll be investing to take the organization and bring the tools. And so we can systematically drive better planning and better capability across the organization across markets and deliver -- we see productivity as a key enabler to our long-term strategy and to fuel the investment that we need.
So -- and then the last part I would say, Steve, is I do think that, over time, I would like the investment levels to be higher for the company, and we'll continue to do that as we continue to build our plans and gain confidence in our ability to do that."

Steve, I mean, overall, our business is fundamentally strengthening globally, but -- I would say especially in D&E, and we feel like we're building a better company. That improvement is really driven by better execution and the investments that we just talked about in innovation, advertising and our commercial capabilities. So the improvement is really broad-based.
And if I just think about D&E, I think growth in the fourth quarter was across every region. So we saw double-digit increases in China, Argentina, India. India, which is an important long-term growth market for us; Africa, which I may have mentioned for the first time on the call here; and then we had high single-digit growth in Eastern Europe and Brazil. So we feel good about the performance of our markets. 
I think the one area on -- in terms of 2021 that we're going to continue to expect uncertainty due to COVID, particularly in D&E markets. And the reason I say that, that uncertainty is likely to be higher this year than it was last year because infections are climbing and at a higher rate than they were last year. And so we are going to see new waves. We're expecting additional waves to hit -- to occur in Latin America soon, and I think we're actually starting to see that now. And so that's going to have an ongoing effect that is just hard to quantify.
Our experience last year was an economy would maybe go on restriction, and the mobility will decline for a period and then bounce back. And then we saw that in Brazil. So for example, I think in the third quarter, the economy was locked down for quite a bit of time. And then in the fourth quarter, we had a high single-digit organic growth increase in Brazil, share growth in Brazil and a very strong fourth quarter performance. And so our experience will tell us we're going to expect and see some bumps along the way in D&E, but we are planning for overall growth."

The incrementality question, we're still working through the math of trying to track that. The data is evolving because, at this point, it's still tough for us to separate out. We do track online-enabled. But when you get into things like grocery pickup, it can be a little bit difficult to parse.

With more people at home translates to more usage of bath tissue at home. Obviously, there's elevated consumption of towels as well because people are cleaning more often. So that's one overall effect.
Specific to last year, though, starting with the -- I think it was the third week -- second or third week of March, we started to see extreme elevated levels of consumption with consumers stocking up. And that's when you recall the shelves were empty. I think the third week of March last year, the scanner data, I would say, the category was up 212%. So that's one lap that I think we will not see that as much this year, and that's certainly a piece that we're going to have to cycle.

I think, overall, our shares were very strong for the year. As I mentioned in the remarks, we were up or even in about 60% of our markets globally or key cohorts globally. And I think we saw progression through the year and really strengthening in the second half of the year. And that's really factored into our thinking. And it is why we believe, particularly in our personal care business globally, which has been less affected by COVID. And if anything, I think the categories have been more -- faced more headwind due to COVID than tailwinds globally. But for the year, personal care was up 5%. We did see acceleration in the back half and very comprehensive growth across markets.
So if I -- I'll just tell you, Andrea, the share growth was very broad-based. We saw very strong performance in China in both fem care and diapers, Brazil in the fourth quarter, Argentina where we took on share leadership in diapers during the year; Peru, which I mentioned was a challenging market for us in 2019, has really improved, and we were up by multiple share points in the back half of the year; Eastern Europe, Russia continues to see strong robust share growth.

I think it was down 1% versus it was down 2% the prior year in 2019 in that range. And so I think the category, at least lagging a year, I would say, has behaved similarly. 
In the sense of volume, I think, for the categories has been from quarter-to-quarter down 1% or 2-ish, right, in that range, so consistent with the birth rate. The category dollar value has grown because of premiumization, and I think that is our core strategy for big, developed markets. We still think there's a lot of opportunity for us to elevate our categories. Our customers believe that. And I think we're seeing that in the performance, particularly with Huggies in North America.

That actually tracks with the population dynamics with fewer women of childbearing age there. Korea continues to -- I think we've seen improvement over the last couple of years but continues to be negative. And so I think in a handful of markets, we are seeing that. In D&E, I think a little tough to call right now. And one of the things is I think the COVID impact has been a little sporadic in those markets where we've seen declines when the markets go into lockdown. But then, as I mentioned earlier, with Brazil, a pretty good bounce back once the economy reopens."

And I guess I'm hearing comments about how to be more efficient on trade spending and maybe even how that's potentially sustainable. So I guess do these promotional levels stay lower over the course of 2021, especially if demand remains elevated? And I guess just like more simply put, can these lower promotional levels stick longer than, I think, what people have been anticipating, right? Because that would potentially have pretty important implications for competitors, the broader sector. And so maybe I'm reading too much into that. But if you could just talk about if you've learned something from this past year about how much you do need to spend and how sustainable that might be going forward, I'd appreciate any perspective there."

I mean, philosophically, I just -- I don't like -- I don't believe in overpromoting categories. And really, for me, the purpose of promotion, at least that I tend to sign up for, is it's the drive trial of your brand, right, whether you have important news or you're trying to get that brand to a population that hasn't experienced before. So that's, for me, the strategic point. I do think when categories get overpromoted, it tends to drive some commoditization. And over time, I think it lowers the growth potential of that category. So for me, I would like our organization to be very disciplined about how we reintroduce promotions into the marketplace.
Certainly, I think we have great partnerships with our customers and recognize the importance for it to build their business, and we're going to be great partners with them. But I do think how we think about promotions, I think you're asking the right questions. And so for us to be -- continue to be very disciplined about how we think about it and how we manage it will be important going forward. 
And the other part of it is it's a big spend for us, and it's not -- in any given year, the money is not perfectly spent, and so we can always get better. That's why we've invested in capability and broaden a lot of tools in our revenue management capability to give us the analytics to help us spend that money more wisely going forward."

One of the big reasons for our adjustment in the reduced outlook organically was what we are seeing as a faster destock in consumer tissue, particularly in bath tissue. And I think you can see that in the scanner results as well. I do think it is a faster destock, and that looks like it's related to maybe faster vaccination and faster pace of mobility that's changing. Interesting, we track mobility data. It looked like January, February, Dara, in the U.S., mobility was down about 30% in January and February, and it climbed to being down 15% by the time we got to March.

Let me just touch on the winter storm a little bit just to give you a little more texture and what our estimate would be conservatively on Q1 would have been worth about $0.15 a share and 2 points overall of organic, which would be about 5 points of growth, organic growth for North America.
Important to note, this will also -- and this goes back to the phasing, Dara, it's also going to constrain our Q2 volume in North America, particularly in personal care. And it's also going to affect our shares in the second quarter. So the back story is, and I think you may understand, but the February storm hit in the Southern U.S. and really significantly impacted our supply network. We shut down large personal care and consumer tissue facilities that we have based in Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas for up to 10 days. And so sales were impacted due to -- it did flow through to sales for us, Dara.
Typically, I would say, hey, a week or 2 down should not affect the business that much. But because of COVID last year, we were already running in a tight supply situation. And so that's why it has rolled through and affected our sales. It's also going to continue to impact our raw material supply. Polymer producers have been affected more than us, I would say. And so we're having some spot outages of some materials. And so again, overall, in North America, underlying brand performance has been very healthy, but we do expect, because of supply issues, our shares to soften a bit in the second quarter."

Let me take the last one first, and then I'll come back to between the lines. So one way to think about the run-up in inflation that we have for the year is that, within year, we'll cover about half of that with pricing. And then when you add in the additional cost savings both in terms of our increased outlook on the FORCE program as well as additional tightening of the belt around discretionary items, you would get to cover a good portion of the inflation. 
And then if you look at the reduction in our EPS outlook, you could look at it and say, after all of that, it comes down to the decline in volumes, which are affected by all the reasons that Mike just talked about. So within year, Paul, I think we're saying about half is recovered on pricing. And then over time, we would expect to fully recover the commodity increases, as we always do, through a combination of price increases and cost savings, if that's helpful."

And then on discretionary costs, we'll certainly look to tighten our belt and prioritize any spending that we have this year given the more challenging conditions. And in addition, we are continuing to push the FORCE cost savings. And as I just mentioned, we upped our savings outlook for the year there. And our teams are working hard to try to pull in productivity programs into this year as well as find new opportunities given the overall pressure they are."

I guess, like looking back to last year, there should be somewhat of a natural hedge. Mike, there was a comment in the prepared remarks about potentially seeing some early effects of social mobility picking up, which had an unfavorable impact on the consumer side of the business. I wanted to tie that in 2 ways. Number one, did you see that pickup in the month of March? Because it wasn't necessarily evident in the quarter. But again, March could be looking better relative to January and February.
And then two, was the demand elasticity in that business in line with your expectations? It looks like you took some pricing with an obvious effect on volumes, but the business did come in quite a bit lower than the street had modeled. So just hedging implications from some weakness on the consumer side and then comments on demand elasticity would be helpful."

Great questions, Kevin. I guess the short answer is, regarding pickup, not yet. And organic was down about 13%, with continued improvement in North America, but I would say that improvement was more on the wipers and safety business than on the core washroom business. The washroom business was down about 35%. So about where it's been. I did say mobility is improving. So again, just to refresh your memory, I think January, February was down about 30%. And then in March, it had improved to being down 15%. It isn't flowing through to our washroom business yet, and our business tends to be concentrated in travel and lodging, offices and high-traffic locations like sporting events. So we may see some of that start to pick up as we go forward, but I do think that has been lagging. And these sectors that we tend to play harder in tend to lag the overall mobility a little bit.
I want to point out wipers and safety were up strong double digits in the quarter. We feel great about the momentum of that business. And regarding your pricing, Kevin, there has been some significant pricing on the glove side in our safety business. That's driven a lot of the pricing. So I wouldn't say it's -- elasticity is probably coming in as we planned. It's just that there's been some unusual pricing, unusually high pricing on the safety side."

And what I would say are still fairly choppy waters in the categories, but we feel great about the share momentum of our business globally. And really, we can tie it back to the investments we're making in product quality, innovation and marketing and team execution, which is excellent. So we feel good about that.
There has been some discussion around that. I will say we will make some adjustments, but in a small manner. Overall, we want to maintain our investment levels. But for example, in North America, where we have supply constraints, it may not be the highest ROI decision in the short term to be driving, let's say, promotions in that business when you don't have supply. So we will make some tactical adjustments. But overall, I think your point on ROI is also important, which is it is going to vary. We don't have the latest data for ROIs on the quarter. But generally, our marketing ROIs, especially digital, has been very strong. And so it may not be the lever that we traditionally think of when cost conditions get a little tough because it's hard to see how cutting advertising, if it's working that effectively for us, actually helps the P&L."

Where we believe we've got strong ROI, it makes sense to continue to spend the dollars because we're getting the payback on those dollars. But we did have some pretty deep internal discussions around that. And while it varies by market and by product line, the decisions, what I'd say is, in our current outlook, we're expecting advertising spending to be relatively similar to 2020 levels on a dollar basis. And on a percentage of sales basis, that -- it will be in line with our original plan coming into the year. All of that said, the mix of it and where it is and on what it is, is different than we would have expected 3 months ago. But in total, that's kind of how we're thinking about it."

I guess -- because it sounds like there's going to be back-half-loaded savings, and I'm assuming you have good visibility there. But I just think -- what I'm hearing this morning, just a lot of investors are concerned about market share movements in the back half, elasticity in the back half and the actual efficacy of pricing rolling through, just given lost sales that you've highlighted in the first half and then differences in the way that you've announced price increases this year versus what we heard from P&G earlier in the week.

But when we look at the second half, we are expecting a stronger second half, and that is for a few reasons. The biggest reason being that our pricing actions and the benefits of that will be coming through the P&L in the second half. In terms of input cost inflation, that is ramping in the first quarter and the second quarter. We expect that it will peak and then moderate and, in some cases, come down a bit in the second half. Additionally, we've got our savings program ramping, as you can tell from the FORCE cost savings of $65 million in the first quarter and the outlook of $340 million to $380 million for the full year. So those will be ramping as is typical in a typical year.
And then we also have some elevated costs in the first half of the year, which will come down some in the second half of the year. So we have good visibility into it. The -- when I look at the factors driving that, the one area that has some -- what's the word I would use -- some dynamism around it would be pricing.

When I look at the second quarter, while we don't provide detailed quarterly guidance, we do expect the second quarter conditions will remain challenging, and that will show up in the numbers. And if you think through some of those factors, there'll be more cost inflation that's coming in ahead of most of our new selling price increases. So we'll have escalated costs before the pricing is really getting into the market. We'll be working through the tail end of the supply chain disruptions in North America that Mike already commented on. And then the category dynamics in consumer tissue and K-C Professional are more volatile than normal. And then as we said in the prepared remarks, we do expect that the between-the-lines spending will pick up from a relatively low level in the first quarter, and that includes more investment spending. And then in addition to all of that, it's worth noting that we had all-time record earnings in the second quarter of 2020 behind very strong volume growth in consumer tissue. And last year, we also had commodity tailwinds. And in the second quarter, we had very strong FORCE cost savings.

In tissue, I would say, promotional levels for us, at least our perception is and our planning is a little -- still lower than where it had been and primarily because we still have been in tight supply.

I think you called out some market share gains, which are encouraging. But first on China, we heard comments from one of your competitors that the market share -- the market has been more competitive as of late in diapers. What have you seen in your share dynamics there? That's the first part.
And then the second one is on the call-out for the price increases you've taken in Europe and LatAm. And obviously, you have some competitors that are local and reporting different currencies. So have you seen any results of -- I mean, I know you had amazing results in Brazil in the first quarter. But have you taken prices there already? And with the government incentives fading, how do you expect that to be in the balance of the year?
And sorry, the third part is what is embedded in the KCP guidance. Your comments about the washrooms coming in a little bit more -- obviously, it's travel-related, a bit more backloaded. What are you expecting for that business at the balance of the year?"

Overall, again, I think we've been competing, as I mentioned on kind of in this high road approach, which would be, again, build the brands through quality, innovation and marketing and local execution that's very, very good. And so that feels like to us has been working very effectively, China especially. We were up double digits in China across both fem care and diapers, so we feel great about their business. Organic was up over 20% in China in the quarter, and Huggies was up double digits, and that was driven by volume and what I would say is a premiumizing mix. And so our share is up, as I mentioned, almost 3 points. And we feel like we have the best product in the marketplace. And the teams are very good on both baby and in fem care around digital marketing agility. And so they're very good at building that digital relationship with the consumers. And so I think that's been a key component of driving our business. And so yes, I think that the market may be getting a little bit more competitive, but we still feel like the Chinese consumer is looking for high-quality products.

Can you just comment on maybe how much control you would have over that situation, say, if overall category promotions were to start to take off, right? So from a competitive standpoint, would you follow those promotions? Or do you have levers that you can deploy to keep market share if competitive activity reflecting higher promo were to take off? 
And then my question is just around -- there's been a lot of focus on 2021, I think appropriately so. There's also this broader narrative around unemployment rates impact on birth rates. Certainly, developed markets coming back a bit faster than emerging markets. But can you just talk about what you would expect from a category growth rate standpoint, say, over the next 6 to 12 months and maybe even a bit longer term as well?"
283857,706205681,2256372,"Kimberly-Clark Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 23, 2021",2021-04-23,"Earnings Calls","Kimberly-Clark Corporation","Executives","Yes. Okay. I'll try to address, Chris. On overall promotion, I would say our approach is to kind of grow the brands through investing in the quality of the products and in advertising. And then with digital, that's quite an effective tool for us. I mean,",314,"Yes. Okay. I'll try to address, Chris. On overall promotion, I would say our approach is to kind of grow the brands through investing in the quality of the products and in advertising. And then with digital, that's quite an effective tool for us. I mean, not only is digital tends to be higher ROIs than any of our other spends, including retail promotions, it's also -- you get faster feedback on its performance, right? So again, I think we have plenty of levers. We did shift to this approach a couple of years ago, and I think it's working very effectively for us. So if you ask kind of do we have the levers in our control, I would say yes. And what we feel good about is we have programs developed that are robust in that sense. And as I just rattled off a bunch of these shares, we feel like those are working very effectively.
That said, we want to be competitive on price or promotions. But I don't think promotions in a fixed consumption category are the right long-term way to grow the category. Because it's different than, let's say, an impulse category like cookies, where you can drive incremental consumption through promotion. Our categories, you generally don't drive incremental consumption. You can drive share, but I'd rather earn our share rather than rent our share for the short term. And it's a very expensive way to rent share, right?
So again, we do have the levers. And by the way, we're making significant investment in our revenue growth management capabilities. So we have the tools. And even if we were to invest more in promotion, I think we'd be very selective in terms of how we spent it, and we would want to make that efficient as well. I don't know if that addressed your question on that part."

I wonder if you can maybe divide your comments between developing markets where maybe birth rates come down, but you have more of a GDP per cap upside-type driver.

And we are seeing a little slowing in the birth rate overall, both in developed and developing markets. For instance, in the U.S., where the data typically lags, we were down about 1 point. The growth rate was down about 1 poin",353,"Yes. Great question, Chris. And we are seeing a little slowing in the birth rate overall, both in developed and developing markets. For instance, in the U.S., where the data typically lags, we were down about 1 point. The growth rate was down about 1 point in 2019. The latest data, although it's not officially published, I think, Paul, but would say roughly down 3% last year. And so that was a slowdown. And we're seeing some of that, too, where you may have read in China the birth rate has come down significantly as well. I think the balancing factor, there's a couple of different components. One is our core strategy is to elevate our categories by creating more value-added products and premiumizing our mix over time. And that's really taking hold. And as I mentioned, we're up almost 3 share points in China. That's all through a premium mix of products. And for instance, this year, we have the best product we feel like in what we call our Tier 6, which is our premium tier. We are launching a Tier 7 product that brings a lot of the features that we have in our current premium products and escalate them further. And we're launching Tier 7 at a 50% premium to Tier 6. And so I do think, in some markets like China, where the consumer certainly is willing to pay for what are better products, in the near term, we'll continue to drive our business that way.
That said, we also have many other developing markets like Indonesia and India that are continuing to grow and where the birth rates are not as impacted yet or still maintaining their birth rates. And also, we still have category penetration growth. So again, I think we feel good about our overall strategy. Do recognize that the environment, likely because of COVID, has affected birth rates to some extent. But we feel like our strategy is both in developed markets, which is to elevate our business and our categories and then continue to expand in D&E, are the right ones for us."

One of the big reasons for our adjustment in the reduced outlook organically was what we are seeing as a faster destock in consumer tissue, particularly in bath tissue. And I think you can see that in the scanner results as well. I do think it is a faster destock, and that looks like it's related to maybe faster vaccination and faster pace of mobility that's changing.
Interestingly, we track mobility data. It looked like January, February, Dara, in the U.S., mobility was down about 30% in January and February. And it climbed to being down 15% by the time we got to March. So again, I think it does -- a lot of it is the demand that tracks with kind of what we're seeing happening in the tissue."

Let me just touch on the winter storm a little bit just to give you a little more texture. And our estimate would be -- conservatively, on Q1, would've been worth about $0.15 a share and 2 points overall of organic, which was -- which would be about 5 points of growth -- organic growth for North America.
Important to note, this will also -- and this goes back to the phasing, Dara, it's also going to constrain our Q2 volume in North America, particularly in family -- in personal care. And it's also going to affect our shares in the second quarter.
So the back story is, and I think you may understand, but the February storm hit in the Southern U.S. and really significantly impacted our supply network. We -- it shut down large personal care and consumer tissue facilities that we have based in Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas for up to 10 days. And so sales were impacted due to -- it did flow through to sales for us, Dara.
Typically, I would say, hey, a week or 2 down should not affect the business that much. But because of COVID last year, we were already running in a tight supply situation. And so that's why it has rolled through and affected our sales. It's also going to continue to impact our raw material supply. Polymer producers have been affected more than us, I would say. And so we're having some spot outages of some materials.
And so again, overall, in North America, underlying brand performance has been very healthy, but we do expect, because of supply issues, our shares to soften a bit in the second quarter."

I guess, like looking back to last year, there should be somewhat of a natural hedge. Mike, there was a comment in the prepared remarks about potentially seeing some early effects of social mobility picking up, which had an unfavorable impact on the consumer side of business.
I wanted to tie that in 2 ways. Number one, did you see that pickup in the month of March? Because it wasn't necessarily evident in the quarter. But again, March could be looking better relative to January and February.
And then two, was the demand elasticity in that business in line with your expectations? It looks like you took some pricing with an obvious effect on volumes, but the business did come in quite a bit lower than the Street had modeled. So just hedging implications from some weakness on the consumer side and then comments on demand elasticity would be helpful."

Great questions, Kevin. I guess the short answer is, regarding pickup, not yet. And organic was down about 13%, with continued improvement in North America, but I would say that improvement was more on the wipers and safety business than on the core washroom business. The washroom business was down about 35%, so above where it's been.
I did say mobility is improving. So again, just to refresh your memory, I think January, February was down about 30%. And then in March, it had improved to being down 15%. It isn't flowing through to our washroom business yet, and our business tends to be concentrated in travel and lodging, offices and high-traffic locations like sporting events. So we may see some of that start to pick up as we go forward, but I do think that has been lagging. And these sectors that we tend to play harder in tend to lag the overall mobility a little bit.
I want to point out wipers and safety were up strong double digits in the quarter. We feel great about the momentum of that business. And regarding your pricing, Kevin, there has been some significant pricing on the glove side in our safety business that's driven a lot of the pricing. So I wouldn't say it's -- the elasticity is probably coming in as we planned. It's just that there's been some unusual pricing, unusually high pricing on the safety side."

And really, we can tie it back to the investments we're making in product quality, innovation and marketing and team execution, which is excellent. So we feel good about that.
There has been some discussion around that. I will say we will make some adjustments, but in a small manner. Overall, we want to maintain our investment levels. But for example, in North America, where we have supply constraints, it may not be the highest ROI decision in the short term to be driving, let's say, promotions in that business when you don't have supply. So we will make some tactical adjustments.
But overall, I think your point on ROI is also important, which is it is going to vary. We don't have the latest data for ROIs on the quarter. But generally, our marketing ROIs, especially digital, has been very strong. And so it may not be the lever that we traditionally think of when cost conditions get a little tough because it's hard to see how cutting advertising, if it's working that effectively for us, actually helps the P&L."

But we did have some pretty deep internal discussions around that.

And on a percentage of sales basis, that -- it will be in line with our original plan coming into the year.

In terms of input cost inflation that is ramping in the first quarter and the second quarter, we expect that it will peak and then moderate and, in some cases, come down a bit in the second half. Additionally, we've got our savings program ramping as you can tell from the FORCE cost savings of $65 million in the first quarter and the outlook of $340 million to $380 million for the full year. So those will be ramping as is typical in a typical year.
And then we also have some elevated costs in the first half of the year, which will come down some in the second half of the year. So we've good visibility into it.

So we'll have escalated costs before the pricing is really getting into the market. We'll be working through the tail end of the supply chain disruptions in North America that Mike already commented on, and then the category dynamics in consumer tissue and K-C Professional are more volatile than normal. And then as we said in the prepared remarks, we do expect that the between-the-lines spending will pick up from a relatively low level in the first quarter, and that includes more investment spending.
And then in addition to all of that, it's worth noting that we had all-time record earnings in the second quarter of 2020 behind very strong volume growth in consumer tissue.

It looks like promotions are coming back certainly faster than I expected. Is that indeed what you're seeing? And how much of a negating factor on your price will -- your price increase will have?"

So overall, Jason, that's why knowing that we had some different items in that statement, I would say, overall, we still view the North American market across personal care and tissue to be constructive.
I think promotional volume in personal care returned to what I recall, I think, our team calls normalized levels a few quarters ago. And so it's proceeded along that path. And I would say it's -- that's kind of where personal care is.
In tissue, I would say, promotional levels for us, at least our perception is and our planning is a little -- still lower than where it had been, and primarily because we still have been in tight supply. Obviously, given kind of where demand is going, that supply situation is getting reversed a little bit now. But again, we don't have significant plans in the first half to promote aggressively.
And frankly, as you've heard me say before, we remain committed to our journey on the high road, and we really believe we want to grow our brands by investing in products and innovation and advertising. And so overpromoting categories for us in a fixed consumption category does not feel like a healthy way for the business. So again, I would say, overall, the market appears to us constructive."

And then the second one is on the call out for the price increases you've taken in Europe and LatAm. And obviously, you have some competitors that are local and reporting different currencies. So have you seen any results of -- I mean, I know you had amazing results in Brazil in the first quarter. But have you taken prices there already? And with the government incentives fading, how do you expect that to be in the balance of the year?

We were up double digits in China across both fem care and diapers. So we feel great about their business. Organic was up over 20% in China in the quarter, and Huggies was up double digits, and that was driven by volume and what I would say is a premiumizing mix. And so our share is up, as I mentioned, almost 3 points. And we feel like we have the best product in the marketplace. And the teams are very good on both baby and in fem care around digital marketing agility.
And so they're very good at building that digital relationship with consumers. And so I think that's been a key component of driving our business.

So from a competitive standpoint, would you follow those promotions? Or do you have levers that you can deploy to keep market share if competitive activity reflected in higher promo were to take off?
And then my question is just around -- there's been a lot of focus on 2021, I think appropriately so. There's also this broader narrative around unemployment rates, impact on birth rates, certainly, developed markets coming back a bit faster than emerging markets. But can you just talk about what you would expect from a category growth rate standpoint, say, over the next 6 to 12 months and maybe even a bit longer term as well?"

On overall promotion, I would say our approach is to kind of grow the brands through investing in the quality of the products and in advertising. And then with digital, that's quite an effective tool for us. I mean not only is -- digital tends to be higher ROI than any of our other spends, including retail promotions, it's also -- you get faster feedback on its performance, right? So again, I think we have plenty of levers.
We did shift to this approach a couple of years ago, and I think it's working very effectively for us. So if you ask kind of do we have the levers in our control? I would say yes. And what we feel good about is we have programs developed that are robust in that sense. And as I just rattled off a bunch of these shares, we feel like those are working very effectively.
That said, we want to be competitive on price or promotions. But I don't think promotions in a fixed consumption category are the right long-term way to grow the category. Because it's different than, let's say, an impulse category like cookies, where you can drive incremental consumption through promotion. Our categories, you generally don't drive incremental consumption. You can drive share, but I'd rather earn our share rather than rent our share for the short term. And it's a very expensive way to rent share, right?
So again, we do have the levers. And by the way, we're making significant investment in our revenue growth management capabilities. So we have the tools. And even if we were to invest more in promotion, I think we'd be very selective in terms of how we spent it, and we would want to make that efficient as well. I don't know if that addressed your question on that part."

And we are seeing a little slowing in the birth rate overall, both in developed and developing markets. For instance, in the U.S., where the data typically lags, we were down about 1 point.

For instance, in the U.S., where the data typically lags, we were down about 1 point. The birth rate was down about 1 point in 2019. The latest data, although it's not officially published, I think, Paul, but it would say roughly down 3% last year. And so that was a slowdown. And we're seeing some of that, too, where you may have read in China the birth rate has come down significantly as well.
I think the balancing factor, there's a couple of different components. One is our core strategy is to elevate our categories by creating more value-added products and premiumizing our mix over time. And that's really taking hold. And as I mentioned, we're up almost 3 share points in China. That's all through a premium mix of products. And for instance, this year, we have the best product we feel like in what we call our Tier 6, which is our premium tier. We are launching a Tier 7 product that brings a lot of the features that we have in our current premium products and escalate them further. And we're launching Tier 7 at a 50% premium to Tier 6. And so I do think, in some markets like China, where the consumer certainly is willing to pay for what they -- what are better products, in the near term, we'll continue to drive our business that way.
That said, we also have many other developing markets like Indonesia and India that are continuing to grow and where the birth rates are not as impacted yet or still maintaining their birth rates. And also, we still have category penetration growth. So again, I think we feel good about our overall strategy. We recognize that the environment, likely because of COVID, has affected birth rates to some extent. But we feel like our strategy is both in developed markets, which is to elevate our business and our categories and then continue to expand in D&E are the right ones for us."

Good morning, everyone. Before we get into the Q&A, I'd like to offer some additional perspective on our performance.

Before we get into the Q&A, I'd like to offer some additional perspective on our performance. Clearly, our results did not turn out as we expected, and we knew it was a tough comp, given our strong growth and record profitability in the year-ago quarter. Now while we expected volatility this year, the external environment has proven to be even more volatile than our expectation at the beginning of the year and versus our April update. 
Since we spoke in April, commodity inflation has spiked higher and our supply chain has been challenged. These dynamics are impacting us and, more broadly, the industry. We're also navigating historic levels of demand volatility in consumer tissue. Last year, we worked really hard to support our consumers and our customers as demand increased at a record pace. While we expected the category to retract this year, that decline has meaningfully outpaced our expectations. This has been driven by reduced at-home consumption due to increased mobility and destocking of both consumer pantries and retailer inventory. 
Consumer tissue has historically been very stable and we expect demand to normalize over time. We remain confident in our brand fundamentals even as we acknowledge that the short-term tissue outlook has been difficult to call. We've taken decisive action to offset the impact of raw material inflation. We have announced pricing in key markets around the world. Our pricing actions are on track, and we expect to fully offset the effects of input cost inflation over time as we've done in previous cycles. 
We've also taken prudent steps to control and reduce discretionary spend across the business. We expect this to be reflected in our results as we continue to implement these actions. We view this level of input cost inflation and the COVID-driven demand volatility to be discrete issues. We will continue to take appropriate action to reduce the impact of volatility over time. 
At the same time, we remain confident and committed to our approach to building brands. Despite near-term challenges, we have plenty of bright spots in our business. Our strategy to invest in our brands is working. You can see this in our second quarter results broadly across personal care and especially in D&E markets. Excluding North American consumer tissue, our organic sales were up 4%. Personal care organic sales were up 6% globally, driven by a 4% volume increase. In D&E markets, personal care organic sales were up 8%, with very strong market share performance, including in China, Brazil, throughout Eastern Europe, India, Peru and South Africa. We've recently captured #1 diaper share positions in China and Brazil, which reflects the strength of our brand fundamentals with consumers. 
Importantly, we're starting to see green shoots in K-C Professional. The business grew year-over-year and sequentially as we saw strength in international markets and positive trends in washroom products. As more companies transition back to in-person environments, we expect KCP momentum to improve in the back half. 
We're encouraged by our underlying brand performance and have made significant progress in addressing the supply challenges we faced earlier this year in our North American personal care business. Looking forward to the second half, we are expecting better results across the business. We believe the major factors impacting this quarter do not reflect the fundamental health of our business. We remain committed to our strategy to deliver balanced and sustainable growth for the long term. We'll continue to execute K-C Strategy 2022 and we'll invest in our business for the future. This includes investments in innovation, commercial capabilities and technology. 
Importantly, I also want to emphasize that we are acutely aware of the impact that this pandemic continues to have on our employees, our consumers and our partners and the world. We will continue to prioritize the health and safety of our people and all that interact with Kimberly-Clark. Now with that, we'd like to address your questions."

And I think it'd be helpful for everyone to just hear a bit about your degree of confidence that like, this is it, right? The environment's been incredibly volatile. But as you look forward from here, to what degree have you built in flexibility for things to perhaps worsen? So I think that's sort of an important starting point. And along with that, within the inflation basket, what has been the biggest delta versus when you last communicated an outlook for the guidance to the Street back in April?"

Yes, a couple of things. I'll start with the outlook and I'll ask Maria to provide a little more color. But first of all, I'll just say overall, my view on the outlook is it reflects certainly, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks",514,"Got it. Thanks, Lauren. Yes, a couple of things. I'll start with the outlook and I'll ask Maria to provide a little more color. But first of all, I'll just say overall, my view on the outlook is it reflects certainly, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, significant changes in that external environment that we, here, view as being discrete issues and that really -- that we're managing and fully managing, I would say. 
The 2 issues that we're talking about are one, raw material inflation and then the consumer tissue demand changes, particularly in North America. And if you add it up, Lauren, year-on-year, if you add those 2, it's well over $3 of EPS on a year-over-year basis. So it's a pretty significant increase. Obviously, given that amount and given our outlook, we are covering a significant portion of that but we can't practically cover all of that this year, all right? 
And so what I would say is part 1, our pricing implementation is largely on track and we expect to fully offset inflation over time. Not all this year but over time. And then the North American consumer tissue volatility is COVID-driven, and I view that as more episodic in nature or temporary in nature, and I think the team is doing a very good job in navigating it. But certainly, Lauren, it's a little tougher managing shortfalls in the category versus some of the gains that we went up against last year. And so those are, I think, 2 that I would say are discrete issues. 
The big delta on the commodities perhaps that's less visible to all of you is the polymer resin side of the business, right? So you could see the -- you could track the eucalyptus prices which have kind of remained in the space that we've called. But what's really escalated is resin, which I think for the full year, our estimate it will be up almost 100% and certainly at historic highs for us. And that should abate at some point, but I think it's -- initially, we thought that was going to come down some in the back half but it looks like the highs are staying high longer. And so that does reflect some of the pricing that we've taken. 
So overall, I think those are really the 2 big issues. I do really want to point out, Lauren, that our brands are fundamentally very healthy, and we continue to see really robust growth around the world in both organic and in share. And even we're really, really pleased with our North American personal care recovery. Although we are a little light on share, I would say almost all of that is related to supply issues. We still under-shipped orders significantly in the quarter despite being positive on organic growth in the quarter. And so we feel good about where the business is and where our brand fundamentals are, and we're expecting a stronger Q3 in our personal care business. But maybe, Maria, do you want to add some color?"

I'll -- on your first question, Lauren, about the full year outlook, we've been wrong twice now, and so it's an incredibly dynamic environment that we're operating in. And the changes versus our expectations are clearly on the input cost side as well as how the consumer tissue category in North America has unfolded here. 
So when I think about the guidance range that we've provided, we have 6 months left to go in the year, and there's $0.25 still in the range, and I don't like to take guidance down ever. And since we've done it twice, you can rest assured that the guidance that we provided is both thoughtful and based on the trends that we see, allowing for some ranges, given how dynamic this current environment is. 
And then on the outlook for operating margin compared to 3 months ago, a couple of the things that I'd call out, higher commodity costs, lower volumes in consumer tissue. And along with these lower volumes, there's associated fixed cost absorption. The tissue business generally runs at very high utilization rates and has high fixed costs, and the actions that we've taken to offset that also go into our outlook, which include higher cost savings and reduced between-the-lines spending."

I mean, as we look into '22, simply the absence of those factors, if you just go back to a more normalized demand environment for tissue, right, those should be -- they should just go away next year.

But I would say, one, generally, we've taken really broad-based pricing action globally, almost -- I wouldn't say all markets but in nearly all key markets and pretty extensive. The price -- and the pricing ranges from mid-single digit to high single digit, in some cases, double digits, right? And so pretty extensive pricing. 
Obviously, we couldn't recover all of that, given timing because we announced in March, generally implemented in June or in beginning of the third quarter, so we'll get a half year run on the pricing and then a full year as we get into next year. That said, commodities have continued to move. But even as we announced our pricing, part 2 of pricing is we remain committed to leveraging our revenue growth management capability. And there's a lot of other levers that we can pull beyond list to continue to manage pricing in our environment and we're committed to doing that. So that's part 1. 
I do think kind of given where we are, and I think it's normal and reasonable to expect that, we're also going to leverage our cost savings program. I mean, we have a very strong program, as you're well aware, on force and we've kind of beefed that up over the course of the past year or so and we feel good about that. And so we'll continue to leverage that. 
So overall, again, I think the answer is yes on both. The bigger thing, Dara, is we do recognize the impact of raw material inflation over time. In our categories, they tend to be a little more volatile. And we're -- a fundamental underpinning of our strategy is margin improvement. And so because of that, we believe we really have to, on an ongoing basis, offset the effect of inflation over time."

And then I think from an execution perspective, our teams have done a phenomenal job executing rapidly around the world. I would say in terms of other brands, I would say generally, we've seen a lot of the other brands move in a similar direction. I wouldn't say identical but directionally in that same place.

In the balance of our markets, our businesses are performing very well and generally above-plan. And so I would say maybe the thing I'll land with you is despite our near-term challenges, we're really focused on improving our long-term growth profile. We're really confident that our balanced sustainable approach to building brands is working and that the brand fundamentals globally are very healthy and that we're improving our market positions. 
We were up in share in about -- by our tracking, about 2/3 of our market category combinations in the quarter and so we feel good about that. And the brands continue to respond well to strong investment. I mean, we had multi-share point gains in infant child care across China, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, in India, Indonesia, Eastern Europe, Argentina, Peru, pretty much double-digit growth in Brazil. So we feel good about the overall performance of the business. So because of that, we're really maintaining investment where that's working and where the businesses are on plan. 
We have dialed back in some markets. You can assume, for example, in North American bath tissue, given that the fluctuation in the category, we have chosen to pull back a little bit on the spending. And we're going to continue to do that. We're going to operate with discipline. I think we talked about it in prior quarters, but there is as much a mass component to our advertising program as there is a creative component, and we're pretty disciplined. It's kind of how we manage all of our consumer investments, whether that's trade or marketing. And so we're pretty disciplined on the ROI.

And I guess what I'm getting at is just what exactly you think is occurring in that business, and just maybe specifically, the types of things that you're seeing that give you confidence in this reacceleration in that business in the back half, which again to me seems to be kind of the important factor in making the full year outlook work."

And I'll try to unpack it and we can go back and forth on this a little bit. First, let me just say, I remain very confident in our North American tissue business. And we've got great brands, performed very well last year",640,"Okay. Yes, great question, Chris. And I'll try to unpack it and we can go back and forth on this a little bit. First, let me just say, I remain very confident in our North American tissue business. And we've got great brands, performed very well last year. I do think we have given back some share this year. What happened last year when the category spiked, and at this point last year, I think the category was up about 30% or so. Consumers were looking for tissue and our customers were looking for tissue. And so our organization really moved aggressively to try to serve our customers and consumers at a point where we felt like they needed us the most. And so we really pulled out all the stops. 
We probably did gain a little bit of share, particularly on a brand like Continental, where we had a little more availability than maybe some of the other brands in the marketplace. And so it looks like to us, while our share is down a bit this year, I do think it's kind of reverted maybe to the prior year levels to some degree. And we'll continue to go forward and earn our share growth over time on that business. But we feel like our brands are healthy, but we are navigating what I would say is like the most volatile part of the demand curve that we experienced last year. So the front half is where all the spikes in demand. 
And so there are really 2 effects there is the spike in consumer demand and then there was a corollary effect on retailer supply. And so maybe the 1 disconnect that you might not have visibility to the data are the category in the quarter in North America, and I'm talking back tissue specifically was down 12% in consumption, okay? And then our shipments were down about 27%. And so the difference between the 12% and the 27% is really, for us, we estimate as retailer inventory changes. 
And what happened last year on the inventory side was, I think exiting Q1 where there was the big spike, retailer inventories as a percent, if I index it to historical levels or 2019 levels, had dropped down to below 40% of what, I would say, the traditional turn inventory. And so retailers work really hard to get back in the supply. And so by the end of the year or toward the back half of the year, they were well north of 100% of overall levels. And so as we entered into this year, our estimate would be retailer inventories were probably in the 130%, 140% range. And so that's dialed back in the first and second quarter this year. And so it explains kind of a big chunk of the delta here on demand. 
Looking forward, again, I'll stand by it. I mean, I looked at this category for a long time and it's one of the biggest categories Obviously, if you think about back tissue in particular, it's a very stable category. And so the logic for me is in a post-COVID world, I think there will be more people at home on an ongoing basis than there were pre COVID. I don't think the office environment or the work environment is ever going back to 100% every day. And so logic would say consumption should be a little higher than the base level of '19. 
Now year-to-date, we're below '19 levels for the category, but we think I would say logic would say that, that should kind of normalize over time. And I won't estimate whether that's at what point, but over the long term, this category has proven to be very stable. And our brands have proven them very, very stable and very healthy."

If I look overall first half, second half, in the first half, our organic sales are down 5% and our operating profit is down 26%. If you take the midpoint of our ranges, you get to a second half that looks something like plus 3% on organic and plus 5% on operating profit growth. 
And so if you think about the -- our second half outlook and the key drivers there, we'll have easier comps. We will have a step-up and benefit from volume growth and price realization in the second half. The majority of the consumer tissue destock, we're assuming, occurred in the first half. We won't have the winter storm effects that we had in the first half. KCP washroom is expected to continue to see sequential improvements. The pricing actions are now fully in the market. 
We'll see some build on our cost savings as we typically do. It's usually second half weighted and our other manufacturing cost headwinds should be lower.

And so I think kind of given the category volatility and on a retailer-by-retailer basis included, I think it's going to continue to bounce around a little bit, right? 
And so because -- and the example I'll give you is we were building up inventories, but there was another spike kind of in the fall period and then the winter period as well. And so I do think consumers largely understand that there is plenty of tissue availability. But that said, I've seen a lot of new things over the last 18 months. And so we won't be surprised if behaviors continue to shift around a little bit. So that's on the tissue side. 
And the other part of it is, certainly, there was a consumer -- we think consumer pantry destocking as well. I will tell you, the team in North America has done a phenomenal job conducting research to try to estimate that. I will say it's probably as accurate as trying to estimate share from panel data, right? And so you're asking consumers how much they're carrying. And so -- but we do believe consumers are taking a lot of their stock out as they have more confidence that tissue is available but that remains to be proven out. So that's on the tissue. 
And then on the birth rate. Yes, our estimate for this year, first of all, it's probably down about mid-single -- low to mid-single digit. And that's probably a little worse than the last -- the prior 2 years. I think the prior couple of years were down about 1% to 2% depending on the year. And then given COVID, I think it feels like some families have decided to defer family formation and so kind of in that range.

If -- I guess I'm still trying to ascertain whether you see a change in consumer takeaway expectations on the balance of the year. Because what I read in the prepared remarks is that the consumer pantry and retailer inventory rebalancing occurred faster than you previously assumed as it relates to 2Q. And you just kind of reaffirmed that, but I didn't really hear anything about a net reduction in consumer takeaway. So I guess, were you not assuming any rebalancing in the course of '21 before? It just happened in '21, where you thought it would happen later downstream? 
Or is there -- because I guess I can understand the pull forward in the rebalancing for the first half versus more spread out and not hurt 2Q, but there's still a net negative impact on the full year that I can't pinpoint. So can you just help me there?"

I'll say let me anchor it versus our original plan, our plan expectations for tissue at the beginning of the year. We walked in the year and just think back to December, Steve, where the vaccines were really not rolled out, and so our going-in was that the category would be lower than 2020 overall, but in some ways, probably a mid-single-digit decline, right? Because we thought at that point in time, consumers -- people would still be at home generally, right? 
Now coming out of that, and as we entered our April update, it's clear that the vaccines rolled out much faster than anybody anticipated and mobility, the data that we track, show that we're returning to maybe 80% or 85% of historical levels. And so that was faster than we had anticipated. And so our expectations for the category, I'd say, were down a little bit further. 
I think coming out of the second quarter, I would say our category expectations, which were up about 22% in BAC last year, probably, we would say, are going to be down at least in the mid-teens or so, mid- to high teens. And so overall, I think our expectations for the category are going to be worse than they were at the beginning of the year. That said, at that level, I would say that's still -- I still believe it should be above a base year of 2019, right, if you take the 2 years together. 
That remains to be seen. It feels like a kind of a sticking my neck out there call on that just because of what we experienced in the front half. But again, I'm working from logic that says there are likely to be more people at home than there were in 2019. And if people are home more often, then the consumption of at-home issue should be higher but that remains to be proven out."

I'm cautiously optimistic about where that category is, and I do see some green shoots. I mean, a couple of things kind of going on. Organic was up 2%, right, which is a sequential improvement versus where we -- we've been for these past several quarters. That was predicated on really strong growth internationally, which had a really soft comp from a year ago. 
But importantly, improvement in -- sequential improvement in the North American washroom business, which is a big business for us and really, really important. I wouldn't say it's taken off yet but we are seeing the impact of more people returning to work, whether it's in the office environment or a factory environment. And so I think that's -- those are all positives there. 
There are some offsets because we did grow significantly in our wipers and PPE or safety business last year due to additional COVID demand. That's probably cycling down a little bit this year and that's a bit of an offset. So we feel good about the KCP business. I think the team, even throughout last year, was working hard. I think somebody mentioned on the call last year around [indiscernible] conversions, and we've got better offerings in our washroom business, great products, great dispenser products. And so we are winning conversions. But I think I said on prior calls, we haven't seen the -- we won't see the share until the products flow through the dispensers.

I think certainly, there's a lot of markets that were less impacted by COVID, and I would say a lot of that is in Asia. Although I caution when I say that because it's starting to pop up again now more significant, particularly in market big markets for us like Indonesia. So I think there is some aspect of resiliency. 
But the other aspect is and maybe underlying is the strategy that we're on, which is to elevate the category and expand our markets. And I think the teams are really concentrated, particularly in infant and child care with the Huggies brand. Really great product offerings. I mean, I think the big thing that's happened over the last, I would say, 2 years is, globally, our teams on diapers have really aligned around kind of a set of consumer benefits that we're going to win on and really aligned on kind of the product technology platforms at our global platforms that we're launching. 
For reference, we're up 4 share points in Australia, New Zealand in diapers. We're already obviously the market leaders there. But that diaper has specific lineage that's linked to our China diaper. I wouldn't say they're identical but they're highly related, right? And so that's kind of the work that we've been on. We've taken share leadership positions in Argentina and Brazil. And again, the diaper there is related to the diaper that we're making in North America. They're not twins but they're related, right? 
And so I think again, the teams are really focused on, I would say, a -- made a shift from product features to consumer benefits that we're focused on delivering. And I think that's really shown in the shares. And again, I'd say in China, we were up about 3 share points in the quarter as we were last quarter. I mentioned 4 share points in Australia and New Zealand, 4 in Korea, 4 share points in Peru. So we're seeing pretty broad-based share gains. 
But we feel like they're earned. We're certainly not promoting our way to those share gains because we don't really believe in renting share. I think it's basically great products, great digital execution and then really hard sales execution and great partnership with customers."

And I believe it was because you had under-accrued or over-accrued -- excuse me, over-accrued for trade spend throughout the course of the year and had the true-up. So we're lapping a period where you had over-accrued for trade spend, suggesting that, well, I know list prices take time to get in, but I think I was expecting -- many of us were expecting you to at least get some pricing benefit from lower trade. 
Yet on a 2-year stack basis in North America, prices eroded. In developed markets outside of North America, prices are deflationary. In developing and emerging markets, your prices are deflationary, and you just achieved the worst price/cost deficit that I can find on record. So it begs the question of what's happening? What's really impeding your pricing power right now, particularly in an environment where as you're saying, you expect demand to be above base case 2019? Why aren't we seeing more responsiveness of sort of net price benefits flowing through the P&L?"

So part 1 is we have announced pricing in consumer tissue in many markets in most of our tissue markets around the world, including in North America. I wouldn't say we've taken it across every product line. And so Scott 1000 is kind of a key product that we have. And so that's 1 area. 
Certainly, we did benefit, as you mentioned, from accrual differences at the end of last year. And the other thing that we benefited throughout last year was given the amount of demand in the marketplace, we reduced our promotional spending overall, right? And so we kind of earned maybe the same or higher volume levels without having to spend the trade. So that was a benefit last year that we are cycling this year, and so we are putting some investment back in trade. 
For reference, I would say, the category promotional intensity in a market like North America, still below historical levels but moving its way back to what I would say are more normalized levels, and so we recognize the need to do that. The thing that I will tell you is I think your point is on, which is we've got to get better price realization. I will say we don't necessarily view the additional spending of trade to be a negative profit driver in the sense of, we've invested in a lot of tools and revenue management, and we expect our teams to be able to use those tools to drive volume and growth profitably. And so we're going to hold ourselves accountable to that. 
But with that, again, we recognize the need to get additional price realization, and there's many ways for us to do that in addition to the list pricing that we've taken. And there's also ways for us to do that through revenue management, through trade efficiency, price pack and other things that we'll continue to look at.

Great question, Andrea. Maybe the short answer for me is I don't know yet. I think for reference, we took about a high single-digit price increase across our personal care businesses and then some selective price increases, for example, on Scott tissue in North America. And I would say those went into effect at the end of June. And so it's a little early for us to gauge that. 
If I go off the history though, I will say the last list price increase we took on these businesses actually in personal care was not list, it was more count, okay? But that said, I would say the consumer elasticity at that point back in 2018 was probably, in my mind, a little lower than what we modeled in terms of elasticity. So what that implies, I think there's a couple of different factors. If I would say, more price sensitive factors would be that I think consumers are facing broader inflation in this environment across all categories, right, beyond consumer packaged goods. So that may be 1 factor, right, that makes it a little more challenging. 
The other factor that I know talking to people in other industries is there have been reductions in other spending, consumer spending, which create a little more wallet for some of the more consumables, and so that's an offset. So for me, the answer is at this point, a little theoretical ambiguous. And so it remains to be seen but we'll know as we work through this quarter."

And then we unwound that, almost all of that in Q2 of last year. And so I think the consumer -- the personal care North America behavior has perhaps been a little bit normalized.

And maybe I'll go around the world because it varies so much because of a couple of things, one -- probably the biggest 1 being COVID. I would say we were really positively encouraged by our performance across Latin America. I thought it was terrific performance in a really, really challenging COVID environment. I'm sure you're kind of reading all about it. But I mean, in a market like Brazil, our personal care organic was up over 20% behind volume and price, and we did take pretty significant pricing actions there. 
Overall, we maintained our share there. We're already in the leadership position. And I think what's happening in Latin America broadly and why we're winning is the team is doing an excellent job adding value by premiumizing the category but also pivoting, in some ways, back and forth, even within the same year between value and premium. So the big thing is we have very strong leadership positions throughout Latin America. For example, in Argentina, we're the leaders in value tier and we're the leaders in premium tier, and we're the #1 brand overall. 
And so the team, depending on kind of what's happening in the local environment, kind of makes the pivot as to what products they're going to maybe drive and emphasize a little harder. And certainly, I think in Latin America, maybe this year more than maybe even 2 years ago, value is very important. Consumers are stretching out their consumption. But we flow through a lot of our great product innovation to our value tier as well. And I think that's working. So that's kind of 1 set of things. 
I would say China is different. Lauren, we're up 3 share points in the quarter. We're proud, at least for now, we're in the #1 share position, which we feel great about and we feel really great about our products. And so I think the consumer continues to really respond to product superiority and innovation. I will say the category conditions are pressurized because I don't know how much you're seeing but the birth rates are coming down fairly significantly. And so we recognize that's going to be an issue for us to work through. But in the near term, our team feels great about their ability to grow the business, to grow share and work with the big e-commerce partners. 
And then in some of the other markets, Eastern Europe, I mean, I think we are multiple share points up in almost every market across Eastern Europe, somewhere in the 1 to 7 points of share in the quarter. And again, I think great offering. They're all related. The China diaper, the U.S. diaper, the Brazil, they're kind of all related to each other and very good. And I think the teams are recognizing how to drive those. So I think it varies. 
The 1 watch-out area that we're very kind of paying close attention to because of COVID is ASEAN, Indonesia, Vietnam, India as well. Again, those environments right now are really pressured with the pandemic, and so we're really keeping a close eye on that. So I don't know if I answered what you were looking for, if there's something else."

I think you said China growth for you on personal care was up maybe mid-single digits, but you just said you captured 300 basis points of share in the quarter.

And I think you mentioned birth rates down and [indiscernible] we know, the birth rate is down, that has a prolonged drag on infant population.

Our diaper business was up double digits. But that said, I think your question still holds. Yes, there are expected to be some birth rate challenges in China, so it will slow down as a market. I still believe, and I think our team believes, there's still significant opportunity to premiumize our categories and we're still a low double-digit share. And so there's still plenty of share opportunity. That said, I do think there will be a slowdown on the diaper side of the business. 
Our fem care business has been growing strong double digits. In the quarter, it was down a bit because we were cycling a promotion, a big promotion that we've decided to get out of this year. And so -- but we feel great about our fem care business. That's grown strong double digits for, I think, 3 or 4 years in a row now. And so we expect continued growth in China, although I think on the diaper side, the category will be challenged somewhat. It also kind of points out our emphasis on diversifying our growth across developing and emerging markets. So one of the things I'm excited about, Jason, is I think we grew significantly in India. I don't know if I could -- I think -- well, strong double digits in the quarter. 
And I would say, Indonesia, I'm really glad we made the acquisition of Softex. It's a great business. I think the business is up in the teens. Even though they are cycling or working through some pretty good COVID challenges, pretty significant COVID challenges but it's a great business and a great team. And again, with Indonesia -- in India, I think the growth in those markets is going to be very significant for us over the next several years."

Good morning, everyone. Before we get into the Q&A, I'd like to offer some additional perspective on our performance.

Before we get into the Q&A, I'd like to offer some additional perspective on our performance. Clearly, our results did not turn out as we expected, and we knew it was a tough comp, given our strong growth and record profitability in the year-ago quarter. Now while we expected volatility this year, the external environment has proven to be even more volatile than our expectation at the beginning of the year and versus our April update.
Since we spoke in April, commodity inflation has spiked higher and our supply chain has been challenged. These dynamics are impacting us and, more broadly, the industry. We're also navigating historic levels of demand volatility in consumer tissue. Last year, we worked really hard to support our consumers and our customers as demand increased at a record pace. While we expected the category to retract this year, that decline has meaningfully outpaced our expectations. This has been driven by reduced at-home consumption due to increased mobility and destocking of both consumer pantries and retailer inventory.
Consumer tissue has historically been very stable and we expect demand to normalize over time. We remain confident in our brand fundamentals even as we acknowledge that the short-term tissue outlook has been difficult to call. We've taken decisive action to offset the impact of raw material inflation. We have announced pricing in key markets around the world. Our pricing actions are on track, and we expect to fully offset the effects of input cost inflation over time as we've done in previous cycles.
We've also taken prudent steps to control and reduce discretionary spend across the business. We expect this to be reflected in our results as we continue to implement these actions. We view this level of input cost inflation and the COVID-driven demand volatility to be discrete issues. We will continue to take appropriate action to reduce the impact of volatility over time.
At the same time, we remain confident and committed to our approach to building brands. Despite near-term challenges, we have plenty of bright spots in our business. Our strategy to invest in our brand is working. You can see this in our second quarter results broadly across personal care and especially in D&E markets. Excluding North American consumer tissue, our organic sales were up 4%. Personal care organic sales were up 6% globally, driven by a 4% volume increase. In D&E markets, personal care organic sales were up 8%, with very strong market share performance, including in China, Brazil, throughout Eastern Europe, India, Peru and South Africa. We've recently captured #1 diaper share positions in China and Brazil, which reflects the strength of our brand fundamentals with consumers.
Importantly, we're starting to see green shoots in K-C Professional. The business grew year-over-year and sequentially as we saw strength in international markets and positive trends in washroom products. As more companies transition back to in-person environments, we expect KCP momentum to improve in the back half.
We're encouraged by our underlying brand performance and have made significant progress in addressing the supply challenges we faced earlier this year in our North American personal care business. Looking forward to the second half, we are expecting better results across the business. We believe the major factors impacting this quarter do not reflect the fundamental health of our business. We remain committed to our strategy to deliver balanced and sustainable growth for the long term. We'll continue to execute K-C Strategy 2022, and we'll invest in our business for the future. This includes investments in innovation, commercial capabilities and technology.
Importantly, I also want to emphasize that we are acutely aware of the impact that this pandemic continues to have on our employees, our consumers and our partners and the world. We will continue to prioritize the health and safety of our people and all that interact with Kimberly-Clark.
Now with that, we'd like to address your questions."

And I think it'd be helpful for everyone to just hear a bit about your degree of confidence that like, this is it, right? The environment's been incredibly volatile. But as you look forward from here, to what degree have you built in flexibility for things to perhaps worsen? So I think that's sort of an important starting point. And along with that, within the inflation basket, what has been the biggest delta versus when you last communicated an outlook for the guidance to the Street back in April?"
283857,706206261,2350531,"Kimberly-Clark Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2021",2021-07-23,"Earnings Calls","Kimberly-Clark Corporation","Executives","Got it. Thanks, Lauren. Yes, a couple of things. I'll start with the outlook and I'll ask Maria to provide a little more color. But first of all, I'll just say, overall, my view on the outlook is it reflects certainly, as I mentioned in my prepared remark",514,"Got it. Thanks, Lauren. Yes, a couple of things. I'll start with the outlook and I'll ask Maria to provide a little more color. But first of all, I'll just say, overall, my view on the outlook is it reflects certainly, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, significant changes in that external environment that we, here, view as being discrete issues and that really -- that we're managing and fully managing, I would say.
The 2 issues that we're talking about are, one, raw material inflation and then the consumer tissue demand changes, particularly in North America. And if you add it up, Lauren, year-on-year, if you add those 2, it's well over $3 of EPS on a year-over-year basis. So it's a pretty significant increase. Obviously, given that amount and given our outlook, we are covering a significant portion of that, but we can't practically cover all of that this year, all right?
And so what I would say is Part 1, our pricing implementation is largely on track and we expect to fully offset inflation over time, not all this year but over time. And then the North American consumer tissue volatility is COVID-driven, and I view that as more episodic in nature or temporary in nature, and I think the team is doing a very good job navigating it. But certainly, Lauren, it's a little tougher managing shortfalls in the category versus some of the gains that we went up against last year. And so those are, I think, 2 that I would say are discrete issues.
The big delta on the commodities, perhaps that's less visible to all of you, is the polymer resin side of the business, right? So you could see the -- you could track the eucalyptus prices which have kind of remained in the space that we've called. But what's really escalated is resin, which I think for the full year, our estimate, it will be up almost 100% at -- certainly at historic highs for us. And that should abate at some point, but I think it's -- initially, we thought that was going to come down some in the back half, but it looks like the highs are staying high longer. And so that does reflect some of the pricing that we've taken.
So overall, I think those are really the 2 big issues. I do really want to point out, Lauren, that our brands are fundamentally very healthy, and we continue to see really robust growth around the world in both organic and in share. And even we're really, really pleased with our North American personal care recovery, although we are a little light on share, I would say almost all of that is related to supply issues.
We still undershipped orders significantly in the quarter despite being positive on organic growth in the quarter. And so we feel good about where the business is and where our brand fundamentals are, and we're expecting a stronger Q3 in our personal care business. But maybe, Maria, do you want to add some color?"
283857,706206261,2350531,"Kimberly-Clark Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 23, 2021",2021-07-23,"Earnings Calls","Kimberly-Clark Corporation","Executives","Yes, sure. I'll -- on your first question, Lauren, about the full year outlook, we've been wrong twice now. And so it's an incredibly dynamic environment that we're operating in and the changes versus our expectations are clearly on the input cost side as",211,"Yes, sure. I'll -- on your first question, Lauren, about the full year outlook, we've been wrong twice now. And so it's an incredibly dynamic environment that we're operating in and the changes versus our expectations are clearly on the input cost side as well as how the consumer tissue category in North America has unfolded here.
So when I think about the guidance range that we've provided, we have 6 months left to go in the year, and there's $0.25 still in the range, and I don't like to take guidance down ever. And since we've done it twice, you can rest assured that the guidance that we provided is both thoughtful and based on the trends that we see, allowing for some ranges, given how dynamic this current environment is.
And then on the outlook for operating margin compared to 3 months ago, a couple of the things that I'd call out: higher commodity costs, lower volumes in consumer tissue. And along with these lower volumes, there's associated fixed cost absorption. The tissue business generally runs at very high utilization rates and has high fixed costs, and the actions that we've taken to offset that also go into our outlook, which include higher cost savings and reduced between-the-lines spending."

I mean is there anything I'm missing as I think about that kind of impact to profitability from operating leverage and higher manufacturing costs looking into next year and as we start to compare against these periods?"

Is that with just pricing alone, to be clear, or does that include other areas like cost savings?

Or might it take a longer period of time to realize the pricing necessary and sort of a couple of rounds of price increases? How do you think about that? And I'm particularly focused on how you think about pricing, just given the magnitude of that inflation is much worse than it typically is when you take pricing."

I would say yes and yes. I'm not trying to be flip. But I would say, one, generally, we've taken really broad-based pricing action globally, almost -- I wouldn't say all markets, but in nearly all key markets and pretty extensive. The price -- and the pricing ranges from mid-single digit to high single digit, in some cases, double digits, right? And so pretty extensive pricing.
Obviously, we couldn't recover all of that, given timing because we announced in March, generally implemented in June or in beginning of the third quarter, so we'll get a half year run on the pricing and then a full year as we get into next year. That said, commodities have continued to move. But even as we announced our pricing to our -- Part 2 of pricing is we remain committed to leveraging our revenue growth management capability. And there's a lot of other levers that we can pull beyond list to continue to manage pricing in our environment and we're committed to doing that. So that's Part 1.
I do think kind of given where we are, and I think it's normal and reasonable to expect that, we're also going to leverage our cost savings program. I mean we have a very strong program, as you're well aware, on force and we've kind of beefed that up over the course of the past year or so and we feel good about that. And so we'll continue to leverage that.
So overall, again, I think the answer is yes on both. The bigger thing, Dara, is we do recognize the impact of raw material inflation over time. In our categories, they tend to be a little more volatile. And we're -- a fundamental underpinning of our strategy is margin improvement. And so because of that, we believe we really have to, on an ongoing basis, offset the effect of inflation over time."

And certainly, they understand what's happening in the cost environment and so we're working through that.
And then I think from an execution perspective, our teams have done a phenomenal job executing rapidly around the world. I would say in terms of other brands, I would say, generally, we've seen a lot of the other brands move in a similar direction. I wouldn't say identical, but directionally in that same place.

In the balance of our markets, our businesses are performing very well and generally above plan. And so I would say maybe the thing I'll land with you is despite our near-term challenges, we're really focused on improving our long-term growth profile. We're really confident that our balanced sustainable approach to building brands is working and that the brand fundamentals globally are very healthy and that we're improving our market positions.
We were up in share in about -- by our tracking, about 2/3 of our market category combinations in the quarter and so we feel good about that. And the brands continue to respond well to strong investment. I mean we had multi-share point gains in infant child care across China, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, in India, Indonesia, Eastern Europe, Argentina, Peru, pretty much double-digit growth in Brazil. So we feel good about the overall performance of the business. So because of that, we're really maintaining investment where that's working and where the businesses are on plan.
We have dialed back in some markets. You can assume, for example, in North American bath tissue, given that the fluctuation in the category, we have chosen to pull back a little bit on the spending. And we're going to continue to do that. We're going to operate with discipline. I think we talked about it in the prior quarters, but there is as much a mass component to our advertising program as there is a creative component, and we're pretty disciplined. It's kind of how we manage all of our consumer investments, whether that's trade or marketing. And so we're pretty disciplined on the ROI. And so our teams are reacting as you would probably hope that they would.

And I guess, I'm trying to understand maybe just a little bit of the confidence around the normalization, which you had noted in your prepared remarks.
It seems to me that market share has really peaked during COVID, maybe some capacity benefits and that you just -- you've seen some reversion in market share back to crossover levels. And so if you kind of run it flat to 2, 3 years ago, it's sort of unchanged. And I guess what I'm getting at is just what exactly you think is occurring in that business and just maybe specifically, the types of things that you're seeing that give you confidence in this reacceleration in that business in the back half, which again to me seems to be kind of the important factor in making the full year outlook work."

And I'll try to unpack it and we can go back and forth on this a little bit. First, let me just say, I remain very confident in our North American tissue business. And we've got great brands performed very well last year.",639,"Okay. Yes, great question, Chris. And I'll try to unpack it and we can go back and forth on this a little bit. First, let me just say, I remain very confident in our North American tissue business. And we've got great brands performed very well last year. I do think we have given back some share this year. What happened last year when the category spiked, and at this point last year, I think the category was up about 30% or so. Consumers were looking for tissue and our customers were looking for tissue. And so our organization really moved aggressively to try to serve our customers and consumers at a point where we felt like they needed us the most. And so we really pulled out all the stops.
We probably did gain a little bit of share, particularly on a brand like Continental, where we had a little more availability than maybe some of the other brands in the marketplace. And so it looks like to us, while our share is down a bit this year, I do think it's kind of reverted maybe to the prior year levels to some degree. And we'll continue to go forward and earn our share growth over time on that business. But we feel like our brands are healthy, but we are navigating what I would say is like the most volatile part of the demand curve that we experienced last year. So the front half is where all the spikes in demand.
And so there were really 2 effects: there was the spike in consumer demand and then there was a corollary effect on retailer supply. And so maybe the 1 disconnect that you might not have visibility to the data are the category in the quarter in North America, and I'm talking back tissue specifically, was down 12% in consumption, okay? And then our shipments were down about 27%. And so the difference between the 12% and the 27% is really, for us, we estimate as retailer inventory changes.
And what happened last year on the inventory side was, I think exiting Q1 where there was the big spike, retailer inventories as a percent, if I index it to historical levels or 2019 levels, had dropped down to below 40% of what, I would say, the traditional turn inventory. And so retailers worked really hard to get back in the supply. And so by the end of the year or toward the back half of the year, they were well north of 100% of overall levels. And so as we entered into this year, our estimate would be retailer inventories were probably in the 130%, 140% range. And so that's dialed back in the first and second quarter this year. And so it explains kind of a big chunk of the delta here on demand.
Looking forward, again, I'll stand by it. I mean, I looked at this category for a long time and it's one of the biggest categories. Obviously, if you think about back tissue in particular, it's a very stable category. And so the logic for me is in a post-COVID world, I think there will be more people at home on an ongoing basis than there were pre-COVID. I don't think the office environment or the work environment is ever going back to 100% every day. And so logic would say consumption should be a little higher than the base level of '19.
Now year-to-date, we're below '19 levels for the category, but we think -- I would say logic would say that, that should kind of normalize over time. And I won't estimate whether that's at what point. But over the long term, this category has proven to be very stable. And our brands have proven very, very stable and very healthy."

If I look overall first half, second half, in the first half, our organic sales are down 5% and our operating profit is down 26%. If you take the midpoint of our ranges, you get to a second half that looks something like plus 3% on organic and plus 5% on operating profit growth.
And so if you think about the -- our second half outlook and the key drivers there, we'll have easier comps. We will have a step-up and benefit from volume growth and price realization in the second half. The majority of the consumer tissue destock, we're assuming, occurred in the first half. We won't have the winter storm effects that we had in the first half. KCP washroom is expected to continue to see sequential improvements. The pricing actions are now fully in the market.
We'll see some build on our cost savings as we typically do. It's usually second half weighted and our other manufacturing cost headwinds should be lower. And then offsetting that what will be the higher commodity cost headwinds. If you take the $45 million year-to-date in our guidance, it implies year to go is $765 million at the midpoint. So -- that's -- those are the drivers for the second half and certainly, the dynamics in consumer tissue are a key part of that."

The caveat I'll say on, Chris, was we're not exactly sure and I'm not sure the retailer is exactly sure how they want to handle it at this point, right? And so I think kind of given the category volatility and on a retailer-by-retailer basis included, I think it's going to continue to bounce around a little bit, right?
And so because -- and the example I'll give you is we were building up the inventories, but there was another spike kind of in the fall period and then the winter period as well. And so I do think consumers largely understand that there is plenty of tissue availability. But that said, I've seen a lot of new things over the last 18 months. And so we won't be surprised if behaviors continue to shift around a little bit. So that's on the tissue side.
And the other part of it is, certainly, there was a consumer -- we think consumer pantry destocking as well. I will tell you, the team in North America has done a phenomenal job conducting research to try to estimate that. I will say it's probably as accurate as trying to estimate share from panel data, right? And so you're asking consumers how much they're carrying. And so -- but we do believe consumers are taking a lot of their stock out as they have more confidence that tissue is available, but that remains to be proven out. So that's on the tissue.
And then on the birth rate. Yes, our estimate for this year, first of all, it's probably down about mid-single -- low to mid-single digit. And that's probably a little worse than the last -- the prior 2 years. I think the prior couple of years were down about 1% to 2% depending on the year. And then given COVID, I think it feels like some families have decided to defer family formation and so kind of in that range.
I will say we feel really good about the recovery of our infant child care business and the fact that we're really recovering from a supply perspective. Our brand propositions, we feel very strongly about. And so we feel like in the third quarter, we should be back to being on track in our infant child care business. So..."

If -- I guess, I'm still trying to ascertain whether you see a change in consumer takeaway expectations on the balance of the year. Because what I read in the prepared remarks is that the consumer pantry and retailer inventory rebalancing occurred faster than you previously assumed as it relates to 2Q. And you just kind of reaffirmed that, but I didn't really hear anything about a net reduction in consumer takeaway. So I guess, were you not assuming any rebalancing in the course of '21 before? It just happened in '21, where you thought it would happen later downstream?
Or is there -- because I guess, I can understand the pull forward in the rebalancing for the first half versus more spread out and not hurt 2Q, but there's still a net negative impact on the full year that I can't pinpoint. So can you just help me there?"

I'll say let me anchor it versus our original plan, our plan expectations for tissue at the beginning of the year. We walked in the year and just think back to December, Steve, where the vaccines were really not rolled out. And so our going-in was that the category would be lower than 2020 overall, but in some ways, probably a mid-single-digit decline, right? Because we thought at that point in time, consumers -- people would still be at home generally, right?
Now coming out of that, and as we entered our April update, it's clear that the vaccines rolled out much faster than anybody anticipated and mobility, the data that we track, show that we're returning to maybe 80% or 85% of historical levels. And so that was faster than we had anticipated. And so our expectations for the category, I'd say, were down a little bit further.
I think coming out of the second quarter, I would say our category expectations, which were up about 22% in bath last year, probably, we would say, are going to be down at least in the mid-teens or so -- mid- to high teens. And so overall, I think our expectations for the category are going to be worse than they were at the beginning of the year. That said, at that level, I would say that's still -- I still believe it should be above a base year of 2019, right, if you take the 2 years together.
That remains to be seen. It feels like a kind of sticking my neck out there call on that just because of what we experienced in the front half. But again, I'm working from logic that says there are likely to be more people at home than there were in 2019. And if people are home more often, then the consumption of at-home bath issue should be higher but that remains to be proven out."

I'm cautiously optimistic about where that category is, and I do see some green shoots. I mean a couple of things kind of going on. Organic was up 2%, right, which is a sequential improvement versus where we were -- we've been for these past several quarters. That was predicated on really strong growth internationally, which had a really soft comp from a year ago.
But importantly, improvement in -- sequential improvement in the North American washroom business, which is a big business for us and really, really important. I wouldn't say it's taken off yet, but we are seeing the impact of more people returning to work, whether it's in the office environment or a factory environment. And so I think that's -- those are all positives there.
There are some offsets because we did grow significantly in our wipers and PPE or safety business last year due to additional COVID demand. That's probably cycling down a little bit this year and that's a bit of an offset. So we feel good about the KCP business. I think the team, even throughout last year, was working hard. I think somebody mentioned on the call last year around Jenn Air Dryer conversions, and we've got better offerings in our washroom business, great tal product's, great dispenser products. And so we are winning conversions. But I think I said on prior calls, we haven't seen the -- we won't see the share until the products flow through the dispensers.

I think certainly, there's a lot of markets that were less impacted by COVID, and I would say a lot of that is in Asia. Although I caution when I say that because it's starting to pop up again now more significantly, particularly in market -- big markets for us like Indonesia. So I think there is some aspect of resiliency.
But the other aspect is and maybe underlying is the strategy that we're on, which is to elevate the category and expand our markets. And I think the teams have really concentrated, particularly in infant and child care with the Huggies brand. Really great product offerings. I mean, I think the big thing that's happened over the last, I would say, 2 years is, globally, our teams on diapers have really aligned around kind of a set of consumer benefits that we're going to win on and really aligned on kind of the product technology platforms that are global platforms that they're launching.
For reference, we're up 4 share points in Australia, New Zealand in diapers. We're already, obviously, the market leaders there. But that diaper has specific lineage that's linked to our China diaper. I wouldn't say they're identical, but they're highly related, right? And so that's kind of the work that we've been on. We've taken share leadership positions in Argentina and Brazil. And again, the diaper there is related to the diaper that we're making in North America. They're not twins, but they're related, right?
And so I think, again, the teams are really focused on, I would say -- made a shift from product features to consumer benefits that we're focused on delivering. And I think that's really shown in the shares. And again, I'd say in China, we were up about 3 share points in the quarter as we were last quarter. I've mentioned 4 share points in Australia and New Zealand, 4 in Korea, 4 share points in Peru. So we're seeing pretty broad-based share gains.
But we feel like they're earned. We're certainly not promoting our way to those share gains because we don't really believe in renting share. I think it's basically great products, great digital execution and then really hard sales execution and great partnership with customers."

I'm just bridging from the question on consumer tissue to the total company because consumer tissue is certainly part of the story in the second half when we look at the total company outlook. So to clarify, I was talking about total company in my remarks about first half, second half.
And the phasing of the quarters, I'm going to stay away from quarterly guidance. Here, I think the things to consider are the year-over-year comps. I did make some commentary around phasing on the commodity headwinds. And beyond that, I think I'm going to stay away from the quarters."

I guess just I really want to focus in on tissue and pricing. You guys had phenomenal price growth in the fourth quarter '20 in North American tissue.

You guys had phenomenal price growth in the fourth quarter '20 in North American tissue. And I believe it was because you had under-accrued or over-accrued -- excuse me, over-accrued for trade spend throughout the course of the year and had the true-up. So we're lapping a period where you had over-accrued for trade spend, suggesting that, well, I know list prices take time to get in, but I think I was expecting -- many of us were expecting you to at least get some pricing benefit from lower trade.
Yet on a 2-year stack basis in North America, prices eroded. In developed markets outside of North America, prices are deflationary. In developing and emerging markets, your prices are deflationary and you just achieved the worst price/cost deficit that I can find on record.
So it begs the question of what's happening? What's really impeding your pricing power right now, particularly in an environment where as you're saying, you'd expect demand to be above base case 2019? Why aren't we seeing more responsiveness of sort of net price benefits flowing through the P&L?"

So Part 1 is we have announced pricing in consumer tissue in many markets, in most of our tissue markets around the world, including in North America. I wouldn't say we've taken it across every product line. And so Scott 1000 is kind of a key product that we have. And so that's one area.
Certainly, we did benefit, as you mentioned, from accrual differences at the end of last year. And the other thing that we benefited throughout last year was given the amount of demand in the marketplace, we reduced our promotional spending overall, right? And so we kind of earned maybe the same or higher volume levels without having to spend the trade. So that was a benefit last year that we are cycling this year, and so we are putting some investment back in trade.
For reference, I would say, the category promotional intensity in a market like North America, still below historical levels but moving its way back to what I would say are more normalized levels, and so we recognize the need to do that. The thing that I will tell you is I think your point is on, which is we've got to get better price realization. I will say we don't necessarily view the additional spending of trade to be a negative profit driver in the sense of, we've invested in a lot of tools and revenue management, and we expect our teams to be able to use those tools to drive volume and growth profitably. And so we're going to hold ourselves accountable to that. 
But with that, again, we recognize the need to get additional price realization, and there's many ways for us to do that in addition to the list pricing that we've taken. And there's also ways for us to do that through revenue management, through trade efficiency, price pack and other things that we'll continue to look at.

But specific to the U.S., the dollar share that we're looking not only in tissue, in track channels, as you explained well through Chris' question before, but also in diapers, are you seeing that the same decline across all channels?
And is that an indication that consumers are probably down-trading now, that they see private label, for example, Scott 100 (sic) [ Scott 1000 ] is the one that competes more neck to neck with private label? So are you seeing any issue there or perhaps you're going to tweak a little bit of your price increase now that you know what you know about tissue, and then perhaps do more GM where you barbell a little bit of these price increases? So any update on -- embedded in your guidance, if you were changing some of your pricing or any second rounds in North America that we may not be aware or you embedded in there?

Great question, Andrea. Maybe the short answer for me is I don't know yet. I think for reference, we took about a high single-digit price increase across our personal care businesses and then some selective price increases, for example, on Scott tissue in North America. And I would say those went into effect at the end of June. And so it's a little early for us to gauge that.
If I go off the history though, I will say the last list price increase we took on these businesses actually in personal care was not listed, it was more count, okay? But that said, I would say the consumer elasticity at that point back in 2018 was probably, in my mind, a little lower than what we modeled in terms of elasticity. So what that implies, I think there's a couple of different factors. If I would say, more price sensitive factors would be that I think consumers are facing broader inflation in this environment across all categories, right, beyond consumer packaged goods. So that may be one factor, right, that makes it a little more challenging.
The other factor that I know talking to people in other industries is there have been reductions in other spending, consumer spending, which create a little more wallet for some of the more consumables, and so that's an offset. So for me, the answer is at this point, a little theoretical ambiguous. And so it remains to be seen, but we'll know as we work through this quarter."

And so very, very different behavior.
And then we unwound that, almost all of that in Q2 of last year. And so I think the consumer -- the personal care North America behavior has perhaps been a little bit normalized. And again, I think the same thing holds from what I was talking about tissue, which is our pricing has been kind of in the market for about 3 weeks now. It's a little bit earlier for us to get a read. But again, I think we feel cautiously optimistic about it."

And maybe I'll go around the horn because it varies so much because of a couple of things, one -- probably the biggest one being COVID. I would say we were really positively encouraged by our performance across Latin America. I thought it was terrific performance in a really, really challenging COVID environment. I'm sure you're kind of reading all about it. But I mean, in a market like Brazil, our personal care organic was up over 20% behind volume and price, and we did take pretty significant pricing actions there.
Overall, we maintain our share there. We're already in the leadership position. And I think what's happening in Latin America broadly and why we're winning is the team is doing an excellent job adding value by premiumizing the category but also pivoting, in some ways, back and forth, even within the same year between value and premium. So the big thing is we have very strong leadership positions throughout Latin America. For example, in Argentina, we're the leaders in value tier and we're the leaders in premium tier, and we're the #1 brand overall.
And so the team, depending on kind of what's happening in the local environment, kind of makes the pivot as to what products they're going to maybe drive and emphasize a little harder. And certainly, I think in Latin America, maybe this year more than maybe even 2 years ago, value is very important. Consumers are stretching out their consumption. But we flow through a lot of our great product innovation to our value tier as well. And I think that's working. So that's kind of one set of things.
I would say China is different. Lauren, we're up 3 share points in the quarter. We're proud, at least for now, we're in the #1 share position, which we feel great about and we feel really great about our products. And so I think the consumer continues to really respond to product superiority and innovation. I will say the category conditions are pressurized because I don't know how much you're seeing, but the birth rates are coming down fairly significantly. And so we recognize that's going to be an issue for us to work through. But in the near term, our team feels great about their ability to grow the business, to grow share and work with the big e-commerce partners.
And then in some of the other markets, Eastern Europe, I mean, I think we are multiple share points up in almost every market across Eastern Europe, somewhere in the 1 to 7 points of share in the quarter. And again, I think great offering. They're all related. The China diaper, the U.S. diaper, the Brazil, they're kind of all related to each other and very good. And I think the teams are recognizing how to drive those. So I think it varies.
The one watch-out area that we're very kind of paying close attention to because of COVID is ASEAN, Indonesia, Vietnam, India as well. Again, those environments right now are really pressured with the pandemic. And so we're really keeping a close eye on that. So I don't know if I answered what you were looking for, if there's something else."

Our diaper business was up double digits. But that said, I think your question still holds. Yes, there are expected to be some birth rate challenges in China, so it will slow down as a market. I still believe, and I think our team believes, there's still significant opportunity to premiumize our categories and we're still a low double-digit share. And so there's still plenty of share opportunity. That said, I do think there will be a slowdown on the diaper side of the business.
Our femcare business has been growing strong double digits. In the quarter, it was down a bit because we were cycling a promotion, a big promotion that we've decided to get out of this year. And so -- but we feel great about our femcare business. That's grown strong double digits for, I think, 3 or 4 years in a row now. And so we expect continued growth in China, although I think on the diaper side, the category will be challenged somewhat.
It also kind of points out our emphasis on diversifying our growth across developing and emerging markets. So one of the things I'm excited about, Jason, is I think we grew significantly in India. I don't know if I could -- I think 50% -- well, strong double digits in the quarter.
And I would say, Indonesia, I'm really glad we made the acquisition of Softex. It's a great business. I think the business is up in the teens. Even though they are cycling or working through some pretty good COVID challenges -- pretty significant COVID challenges, but it's a great business and a great team.

Good morning, everyone. Before we get to your questions, I'd like to offer some perspective on our third quarter and further actions we're taking in response to this dynamic and challenging macro environment. Organic sales were",679,"Okay. Thank you, Taryn. Good morning, everyone. 
Before we get to your questions, I'd like to offer some perspective on our third quarter and further actions we're taking in response to this dynamic and challenging macro environment. 
Organic sales were strong, up 4% in the quarter and included the impact of pricing actions implemented in the second and third quarters. In North America, personal care organic sales were up 11%, driven by mid-single-digit increases in both net selling price and volume. In D&E markets, Personal Care organic sales were up 7%. Organic sales increased double-digits in Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Eastern Europe and South Africa. Our top line performance was strong despite the resurgence of COVID, which impacted growth in ASEAN, Latin America and K-C Professional. 
Our market positions remain strong and are improving, reflecting strong innovation and excellent commercial execution in nearly all key markets. Our share positions in North America remained solid with good sequential gains in personal care. Our share performance in D&E markets remains robust, where we continued to strengthen our diaper leadership positions in key markets, including China and Brazil. 
We also continued the focus on cost, with our teams delivering solid savings of $150 million in the quarter. In addition, we reduced between-the-lines spending. 
Now clearly, our margins and earnings were disappointing as higher inflation and supply chain disruptions increased our costs well beyond the expectation we established just last quarter. 
I'd like to highlight the effects of 3 areas of volatility that are most impacting our business. 
First, as we noted in July, and on the basis of external forecast, we had expected commodity prices to ease in the second half of 2021. Instead, prices for resident pulp increased further in the third quarter and are now expected to stabilize at a meaningfully higher level than our prior estimate. Second, a tight U.S. labor market and disruption in domestic and international transportation markets are having an elevated impact on our supply chain as we work to get our products to the shelf and meet consumer demand. Third, energy costs are up dramatically in Europe, where natural gas prices have risen as high as 6x year ago levels. Energy prices in North America are also up sharply, although not to the same extent. 
As a result, our margins are down, but were down with declines only partially mitigated by the actions we've taken to date. We're not pleased with our results. And we're taking further action to mitigate the impact of higher input and labor costs. These steps include further pricing actions, additional initiatives to ensure we achieve our cost savings goals and tightening discretionary spending. At the same time, we remain committed to investing in our brands and commercial capabilities. 
While we expect to see some benefit from these actions in 2021, we have further reduced our outlook for the year. This reflects our third quarter performance and our expectations for the fourth quarter. 
And while we're not ready to call our outlook for 2022, I will offer perspective on key variables that will affect our plan next year. 
First, we continue to build top line momentum. In addition, our pricing actions, brand investment and commercial program should provide further benefit in 2022. Second, some discrete headwinds we face this year will be behind us. This includes the U.S. winter storm and presumably consumer tissue destocking. Third, some headwinds we face this year may become more persistent. We're now expecting further inflation on several key commodities. We're also expecting continued tightness in the labor and transportation markets, which will continue to impact our global supply chain all the way to our customers. In addition, the going-forward impact of COVID on both on demand and supply remains very unpredictable. 
We will continue to move decisively and navigate changing market conditions. We'll also continue to invest in our brands and capabilities to maintain brand momentum. Our strategy is working. And we remain confident in our future and are confident in our ability to create long-term shareholder value. 
Now we'd like to address your questions."

I mean, and I believe margin improvement is a fundamental pillar of what we need to do for the company. And so we expect to fully offset inflation with both pricing and cost reductions, so a combination, although we expect to fully offset that over time. 
So we announced some further actions in Q3. The year-to-date, our actions are fairly broad-reaching, every region, every business generally. I wouldn't -- actually, not every single business, but generally across most markets. And so in Q3, we've announced broader actions in North America, professional and consumer, Latin America and other markets selectively. So I would say pretty far reaching. 
I will tell you that our earlier pricing actions are generally on track. As you saw kind of in the release, we had 3 points of price factor in organic in the quarter. We have seen some other brands move, particularly in North America. I haven't seen significant movement in private label yet, although I'll note that, that typically occurs a little bit later and we've had a little share of softness. But in general, I think our volumes are holding up well."

But we want to maintain that investment in the brands, especially where it's working. 
That said, we have made some adjustments in some categories where it felt like it was perhaps a little less effective in the current environment. And so to that extent, we've done that. We have trimmed our between the line spend a little bit, but that -- I would tell you that's been more on the G&A front than on the A&CP front in the quarter.

Obviously, there's still -- there's a big gap leaving this year. But I'm wondering on sort of more a go-forward basis, is it more in the middle of next year when you think you have enough pricing to offset year-over-year commodity increases? Could it be earlier than that? How do you sort of think through that conceptually, understanding there will be some gap leaving this year? But when on a year-over-year basis, do we sort of get to an ability maybe to offset some of these cost pressures from your vantage point?"

I mean that's why we've been saying we'll offset or get our margins back in line and improving over time with both pricing and cost reduction.

And so we announced pricing that was effective -- or we announced it at the end of the first quarter, and it was effective in our second quarter of this year. Certainly, commodities have moved significantly since then. And so we've made additional actions, and that's going to take us time to implement fully. So that's one component. 
The other component I will tell you that looking forward is -- and I think we indicated this about 2022 is the global supply chain is under pressure and we do expect cost to remain elevated for a period. Not all costs. Certainly, I think there's some fundamentals in the eucalyptus market that would say, hey, there's more capacity coming along so that should come back a little bit. But the polymer-based products seem like they're going to remain elevated for a little while. We mentioned U.S. labor costs and pressures on transportation globally. I think that's going to remain elevated for a while because I don't see a fundamental catalyst to change that in the near term. And so that's why we're making some of our moves."

I mean, certainly, I think you can clearly see on fiber and resin-based the commodity challenges. And so I think that's kind of well established and visible for you all. 
I think maybe would maybe is a little less clear as kind of how it's rolling through. And what I mentioned labor markets and the transportation market, it ripples through. And my take would be, it looks like COVID appears to have increased the demands for goods over the past year or so and as shifting has bended a little bit from services to goods. And so with that, the other effect of COVID is -- and you've read all the articles about the great resignation, whether that's the case or whether it's more that there are a lot more options for hourly work, it has really tightened the hourly labor supply. And so because of that pressure on both sides, increased demands means much more demand for containers or trucking. Less labor means fewer drivers to drive the trucks. And because of that, as you noted in our third -- even in our third quarter, while our service levels are improving significantly, we were not able to get all our orders out the door on the time line that we wanted. And because of that, that rolls through in multiple ways. One is we pay higher rates for employees, higher wages. We're [ playing ] higher rates for transportation. It's rolling through. In some cases, our employee tenure is -- has shortened dramatically, and so it's changing how we staff because we have to staff more people to get the product out the door. We've got production outages, missed deliveries. And that ripples through with fines and everything else with customers. And so there's just the many ways that I think both this pressure on the labor side and the transportation markets kind of ripples through the costs. And that's kind of why you're seeing a little softness in our force delivery. Most of that was because of the elevated costs. 
I don't know. Maria, do you have more to add?"

So it's across the board, primarily in North America. Although in the U.K., there's also distribution challenges. That's another market where it impacted our sales in the quarter, and that also has to do with labor related to Brexit.

And I think it's really based on differentiated innovation and excellent local commercial program, really the driver. And I think our brands are about as healthy as I've seen as for as long as I've been here. Obviously, not all of them are working the way that we would like them work. But in general, our brands are performing quite well. 
The birth rate issue you mentioned in diapers is real, although there's a couple of different dimensions of that, which is, one, certainly a big decline in birth rate in China. 5 years ago, there were about 17 million or 18 million births. And this year, it looks like they'll be about 10-ish right, somewhere in that range. And that said, it's still going to be a big market, right, and still the largest type of market in the world for a long time. So that's one thing. That's one that's on the downside. The U.S., on the contract, because there was a little bit of a decline in births last year that accelerated because of the COVID, actually slightly up this year. And actually, we're seeing through the first couple of quarters, and the projection is moving toward modest growth in the second half is -- so that's a bit of positive news. 
But the overall, I think the reason why you're seeing strong performance on personal care more what I talked about previously, which is strong innovation pipeline and strong, strong local programming on the commercial side. And what the teams will say, it's not any one thing. It's the combination of a plan, meaning great innovation, backed with great marketing, a great sales plan and local execution all working together. And I think the numbers you may have seen, but personal care is accelerating globally. It was up 9% in the quarter, with a strong recovery in North America, that was up 11%. And then we're continuing to see that strong performance across D&E in most markets. 
Making good progress in K-C Professional as well. That was up 12%, with North America being up 16%, and a healthy balance of both price and volume. And then consumer tissue, although still down in the quarter, it was down 6% and down 9% in North America. I'd say that was stabilizing. Our consumption in North America was better than our organic. And that's because we are cycling a big year ago customer or consumer inventory build that happened in the third quarter, a little bit happened in the fourth quarter last year as well. So we're cycling that. But I'd say -- I would say the good news on consumer tissue, globally, it feels like it's stabilizing. 
We have given up a little share in North America. We probably picked up a little share last year on bath tissue because we had a little more availability. Our teams were scrambling to put out as much output as it could as we felt like there was a lot of consumer need for our products last year. And so we did that. And we probably gave back a little share. But again, I think overall, we feel like consumer tissue certainly stabilizing versus what we saw in the first and second quarters."

We were down mid-single-digit share points, I think, in diapers at that point. And so the team has really done a nice job recovering. 
I think in diapers, we were up 340 basis points sequentially in the quarter. And just about even, maybe a little bit less than even on share overall in the quarter. So we feel good about the recovery. I think we're making good progress in adult care. Tissue, as I mentioned, on the bath tissue side, we're a little soft because we had maybe a little elevated share that I was hoping to hold on to, but we haven't held on to it, but that was more due to availability. Kleenex is up pretty good, pretty substantially, and we feel good about that, although the category is down. And then on towels, yes, we're down about a little over 1 point.

At this point, I'd say it's returned to historical levels, both in personal care, which happened about the third quarter of last year, and then in Consumer Tissue this quarter or the third quarter of this year. 
Yes, philosophically, what -- I do think retailers do believe brand switching occurs with brands. And so promotions continue to be important in our categories. There is potentially some share shifting. Frankly, my emphasis would be on the what I call the high road approach of growing brands, which is growing brands through great innovation and marketing. And using trade and promotion as a fundamental element of that to support what we're doing from a marketing perspective. But I don't really value share from promotion alone. And so in general, we're going to be focusing on being efficient with how we spend our promotions and being disciplined about it, especially, Kevin, as you might imagine, in this environment, where certainly pricing and price realization is important given what's happening with the cost front."

And in the third quarter, we not only stepped those down, but we also had basically an accrual adjustment true-up from the first half. So there was a sizable benefit on incentive comp reflected in the third quarter. And I will call out that we expect in the fourth quarter that the between the lines will step back up. And that's 2 things. We won't have the incentive comp true-up accrual. And seasonally, our SG&A runs higher in the fourth quarter than in the rest of the year."

But we'll have a lot more to say on that in January when we have 3 months more of visibility and 3 months more of additional actions that we'll take as a management team. we're working through our 2022 planning cycle now, and so we're pulling that together.

And clearly, I think that's showing up in the numbers in terms of the organic growth and the overall health of the brand that we -- as I talked about earlier on this call. So we feel good about that. 
I would say at this point, we will look to continue to build that. We're probably operating kind of in the 5 plus or minus range -- 5% range of sales. It's still a little lower than our primary competitors. I would like that to be higher over time, although we probably never will match some of our competitors at the same level they will. But I still think we can productively invest more and make that a win-win for the brand while growing our margins at the same time. 
The unique thing about advertising in this environment were kind of as digital has unfolded is that the returns are much better than they historically have been. And so we continue to improve our efficiencies. We're getting better at that. And so for us, we're going to continue to look for ways to grow the business, and that's going to include through advertising investment.

We're definitely not running out of runway on FORCE. And we continue to see opportunities in the supply chain. And some of the digital supply chain investments that I referenced earlier in the call will help us unlock those opportunities. The FORCE cost savings for this year is really affected by the supply chain challenges that we've been facing, which are a headwind for our cost savings. And it's related to production and distribution inefficiencies caused by demand volatility and also the logistics issues that we've been talking about. The way that the FORCE cost savings program works is of the negotiated material prices piece of it, which I'll come back and talk about in a minute, and then we have core productivity in our supply chain operations as well as product revisions to achieve design-to-value savings. 
So in the quarter, we had very good savings associated with the negotiated material prices. We also had benefits from productivity improvements and product changes, but not as much as we were hoping. And you have to net positive in terms of total delivered cost for it to count as FORCE cost savings. So as you have headwinds coming in, they offset the gross FORCE cost savings that we would report. And that's really what we're seeing now. The headwinds that are flowing through manufacturing are dampening the net results of FORCE, but there's strong gross savings there. 
The other issue that we've got on FORCE is our supply chain folks are very focused on managing through this near-term environment to get product produced and to get it to customers so we can get in the hands of consumers. And that leaves less time for our employees to be working on productivity initiatives within the supply chain. So it's really those 2 things that are lowering the FORCE cost savings number for this year. But we have a healthy amount of room to go in terms of driving supply chain productivity as we move forward."

So it will be reset at higher levels. So when I look forward, I wouldn't expect as much benefit as we had this year, because if you think about where we were coming into 2020 versus where commodities went, we got a sizable benefit in FORCE there this year.

And so at this point, I think our elasticity modeling is pretty good, fairly accurate. I would say, given our categories, Nik, that the elasticity tends to be a little less when realized than what predicted, just because if you look at this back tissue, the consumption doesn't change that much. Maybe the value tier you purchased at may shift a little bit. An so there's that dynamic. But we are sensitive to it -- that, and it's also what's core in our strategy, is developing a great value proposition to our consumer. And so we're always cognizant of that. 
And I think one of the things that we've done in many markets around the world is offer a great proposition on both the value side and also the premium side. And while our strategy generally is to elevate our categories and expand our categories, I do think pricing in our categories, with the premiumization of our categories, a little less than some of the others that I've worked in, in the past. So I still think there's room to grow. 
However, we want to be able to shift, and that's what we've done in a market like Latin America. And one of the reasons why we've grown share this year is because we've been able to pivot between our premium tier and our value tier. For reference, 2 years ago, we were making a student body left to go premium. And we shifted a significant portion of our mix in Brazil from value to premium. And over the past 18 months, we've been shifting it back the other way because that's what the consumer needs. And so we're really cognizant of that. We're aware of the elasticities. Thus far, I would say, our volumes have held up, although I think what's really happening is we're seeing the intended elasticity, but we do have brand growth initiatives that are offsetting some of that elasticity impact."

And so I think that's probably why there's probably discrepancy in our view of our market share performance, which we see as a little stronger than maybe what you might see. And so overall, we feel very good about that and the category growth, actually in both channels. And I think our brands are performing well. 
The issue that we've had on share, a couple of different areas. In North America, it's primarily been an issue around supply. And so even though we've made substantial improvement in our fulfillment throughout the course of the year, we're still not meeting all orders out there. And so our share is still a little light from that dimension. 
And then in a couple of other markets, again, I think it is, as you point out, maybe some relative price indices that have expanded a little bit in the short term. We've moved on pricing in most markets. And while we've generally seen moves from branded competition, we haven't seen that in all markets. And so there's still a little softness we're experiencing in Western Europe and in some markets in Latin America."

Good morning, everyone. Before we get to your questions, I'd like to offer some perspective on our third quarter and further actions we're taking in response to this dynamic and challenging macro environment. Organic sales were s",680,"Okay. Thank you, Taryn. Good morning, everyone. Before we get to your questions, I'd like to offer some perspective on our third quarter and further actions we're taking in response to this dynamic and challenging macro environment. 
Organic sales were strong, up 4% in the quarter and included the impact of pricing actions implemented in the second and third quarters. In North America, Personal Care organic sales were up 11% driven by mid-single-digit increases in both net selling price and volume. In D&E markets, Personal Care organic sales were up 7%. Organic sales increased double digits in Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Eastern Europe and South Africa. Our top line performance was strong despite the resurgence of COVID which impacted growth in ASEAN, Latin America and K-C Professional. Our market positions remain strong and are improving, reflecting strong innovation and excellent commercial execution in nearly all key markets. Our share positions in North America remained solid with good sequential gains in Personal Care. Our share performance in D&E markets remains robust, where we continued to strengthen our diaper leadership positions in key markets, including China and Brazil. 
We also continued the focus on cost with our teams delivering solid savings of $150 million in the quarter. In addition, we reduced between-the-lines spending. 
Now clearly, our margins and earnings were disappointing as higher inflation and supply chain disruptions increased our costs well beyond the expectation we established just last quarter. I'd like to highlight the effects of 3 areas of volatility that are most impacting our business. 
First, as we noted in July, and on the basis of external forecast, we had expected commodity prices to ease in the second half of 2021. Instead, prices for resin and pulp increased further in the third quarter and are now expected to stabilize at a meaningfully higher level than our prior estimate. 
Second, a tight U.S. labor market and disruption in domestic and international transportation markets are having an elevated impact on our supply chain as we work to get our products to the shelf and meet consumer demand. 
Third, energy costs are up dramatically in Europe, where natural gas prices have risen as high as 6x year ago levels. Energy prices in North America are also up sharply, although not to the same extent. 
As a result, our margins are down but were down with declines only partially mitigated by the actions we've taken to date. We're not pleased with our results, and we're taking further action to mitigate the impact of higher input and labor costs. These steps include further pricing actions, additional initiatives to ensure we achieve our cost savings goals and tightening discretionary spending. At the same time, we remain committed to investing in our brands and commercial capabilities. 
While we expect to see some benefit from these actions in 2021, we have further reduced our outlook for the year. This reflects our third quarter performance and our expectations for the fourth quarter. And while we're not ready to call our outlook for 2022, I will offer perspective on key variables that will affect our plan next year. 
First, we continue to build top line momentum. In addition, our pricing actions, brand investment and commercial program should provide further benefit in 2022. Second, some discrete headwinds we faced this year will be behind us. This includes the U.S. winter storm and presumably consumer tissue destocking. Third, some headwinds we faced this year may become more persistent. We're now expecting further inflation on several key commodities. We're also expecting continued tightness in the labor and transportation markets which will continue to impact our global supply chain all the way to our customers. In addition, the going-forward impact of COVID on both demand and supply remains very unpredictable. 
We will continue to move decisively and navigate changing market conditions. We'll also continue to invest in our brands and capabilities to maintain brand momentum. Our strategy is working, and we remain confident in our future and are confident in our ability to create long-term shareholder value.
Now we'd like to address your questions."

Improving margins is a core aspect of K-C 2022 for us, and so we've taken further actions to offset inflation. I mean -- and I believe margin improvement is a fundamental pillar of what we need to do for the company. And so we expect to fully offset inflation with both pricing and cost reductions, so a combination, although we expect to fully offset that over time. So we announced some further actions in Q3. The year-to-date, our actions are fairly broad-reaching, every region, every business generally. I wouldn't -- actually, not every single business, but generally across most markets. And so in Q3, we've announced broader actions in North America, professional and consumer, Latin America and other markets selectively. So I would say pretty far reaching. 
I will tell you, Dara, our earlier pricing actions are generally on track. As you saw kind of in the release, we had 3 points of price factor in organic in the quarter. We have seen some other brands move, particularly in North America. Haven't seen significant movement in private label yet, although I'll note that, that typically occurs a little bit later. and we've had a little share of softness. But in general, I think our volumes are holding up well."

So we're going to obviously work hard to make sure our margins improve, but we want to maintain that investment in the brands, especially where it's working. 
That said, we have made some adjustments in some categories where it felt like it was perhaps a little less effective in the current environment. And so to that extent, we've done that. We have trimmed our between-the-lines spend a little bit, but that -- I would tell you that's been more on the G&A front than on the A&CP front in the quarter. So I don't know, Maria, if there's something you want to add."

And when I look at the year, our expectation is that, on a dollar basis, we'll be up nicely from where we were in 2019."

And then last question, just as we look out, obviously, there's a lot of volatility from a commodity cost standpoint, and things have been moving in the wrong direction, and you're taking a lot of pricing to help offset that. Is there a certain point you can look out to where you think the year-over-year pricing, at least based on the plans that are in place today, as well as spot commodities where we are today, were you able to fully offset it on a year-over-year basis? Obviously, there's still -- there's a big gap leaving this year. But I'm wondering on sort of more go-forward basis, is it more in the middle of next year when you think you have enough pricing to offset year-over-year commodity increases? Could it be earlier than that? How do you sort of think through that conceptually, understanding there will be some gap leaving this year? But when, on a year-over-year basis, do we sort of get to an ability maybe to offset some of these cost pressures from your vantage point?"

I mean that's why we've been saying we'll offset or get our margins back in line and improving over time with both pricing and cost reduction. I think the middle of next year is probably a good kind of perspective for us. Because obviously, what happened this year was we saw the change in the commodity line, obviously, coming out of the first quarter, and so we announced pricing that was effective -- or we announced it at the end of the first quarter, and it was effective in our second quarter of this year. Certainly, commodities have moved significantly since then. And so we've made additional actions, and that's going to take us time to implement fully. So that's one component. 
The other component I will tell you that, looking forward, is -- and I think we indicated this about 2022 is the global supply chain is under pressure, and we do expect cost to remain elevated for a period, not all costs. Certainly, I think there's some fundamentals in the eucalyptus market that would say, hey, there's more capacity coming along so that should come back a little bit. But the polymer-based products seem like they're going to remain elevated for a little while. We mentioned U.S. labor costs and pressures on transportation globally. I think that's going to remain elevated for a while because I don't see a fundamental catalyst to change that in the near term. And so that's why we're making some of our moves."

I mean, certainly, I think you can clearly see on fiber and resin-based the commodity challenges, and so I think that's kind of well established and visible for you all. 
I think maybe -- would maybe -- is a little less clear as kind of how it's rolling through. And what I mentioned labor markets and the transportation market, it ripples through. And my take would be, it looks like COVID appears to have increased the demands for goods over the past year or so and -- as shifting has bended a little bit from services to goods. 
And so with that, the other effect of COVID is, and you've read all the articles about the great resignation, whether that's the case or whether it's more that there are a lot more options for hourly work, it has really tightened the hourly labor supply. And so because of that pressure on both sides, increased demands means much more demand for containers or trucking. Less labor means fewer drivers to drive the trucks. And because of that, as you noted in our third -- even in our third quarter, while our service levels are improving significantly, we were not able to get all our orders out the door on the time line that we wanted. 
And because of that, that rolls through in multiple ways. One is we pay higher rates for employees, higher wages. We're paying higher rates for transportation. It's rolling through. In some cases, our employee tenure is -- has shortened dramatically, and so it's changing how we staff because we have to staff more people to get the product out the door. We've got production outages, missed deliveries, and that ripples through with fines and everything else with customers. And so there's just the many ways that I think both this pressure on the labor side and the transportation markets kind of ripples through the costs. And that's kind of why you're seeing a little softness in our force delivery. Most of that was because of the elevated costs. 
I don't know, Maria, do you have more to add?"

We need to hire. In a normal time, if we have 30 people, given the inefficiencies with the labor and turnover, we might need to have 40 people just to get the same amount of product out the door as an example. So it's across the board, primarily in North America. 
Although in the U.K., there's also distribution challenges. That's another market where it impacted our sales in the quarter, and that also has to do with labor related to Brexit. So it's -- I've never seen a supply chain environment like this, and it's affecting us across the P&L."

On the personal care side, can you just maybe expand a bit on the strength that we're seeing in the business? There's been a lot of commentary around challenged birth rates, and yet the business continues to see strong growth. I think North America might have seen mid-teen-digit volumes this quarter. Are forecasts just wrong for the birth rates this year? Are certain income classes doing better? Did stimulus offset the impact of the job losses? Just any perspective you might be able to provide around why that business seems to be doing better.
And then I'll just add on the second kind of category question here. I mean I appreciate that the tissue business, the consumer tissue business is seeing difficult comps and continued destocking, but there has been some margin losses. I wonder if you could just expand upon that as well. So there's one on the personal care side and then on the tissue side as well, please."

So overall, yes, Chris, our brand fundamentals are strong and really improving, and I think it's really based on differentiated innovation and excellent local commercial program, really the driver.

So overall, yes, Chris, our brand fundamentals are strong and really improving, and I think it's really based on differentiated innovation and excellent local commercial program, really the driver. And I think our brands are about as healthy as I've seen for as long as I've been here. Obviously, not all of them are working the way that we would like them to work. But in general, our brands are performing quite well. 
The birth rate issue you mentioned in diapers is real, although there's a couple of different dimensions to that, which is, one, certainly a big decline in birth rate in China. 5 years ago, there were about 17 million or 18 million births. And this year, it looks like they'll be about 10-ish right, somewhere in that range. And that said, it's still going to be a big market, right, and still the largest type of market in the world for a long time. So that's one thing. That's one that's on the downside. The U.S., on the contrast, because there was a little bit of a decline in births last year that accelerated because of COVID, actually slightly up this year. And actually, we're seeing through the first couple of quarters, and the projection is moving toward modest growth in the second half is -- so that's a bit of positive news. 
But the overall, I think the reason why you're seeing the strong performance on personal care is more what I talked about previously, which is strong innovation pipeline and strong, strong local programming on the commercial side. And what the teams will say, it's not any one thing. It's the combination of a plan, meaning great innovation backed with great marketing, a great sales plan and local execution all working together. And I think the numbers you may have seen, but personal care is accelerating globally. It was up 9% in the quarter with a strong recovery in North America that was up 11%, and then we're continuing to see that strong performance across D&E in most markets. 
Making good progress in K-C Professional as well. That was up 12%, with North America being up 16%, and a healthy balance of both price and volume. And then consumer tissue, although still down in the quarter, it was down 6% and down 9% in North America, I'd say that was stabilizing. Our consumption in North America was better than our organic, and that's because we are cycling a big year ago customer or consumer inventory build that happened in the third quarter, a little bit happened in the fourth quarter last year as well. So we're cycling that. But I'd say -- I would say the good news on consumer tissue, globally, it feels like it's stabilizing. 
We have given up a little share in North America. We probably picked up a little share last year on bath tissue because we had a little more availability. Our teams were scrambling to put out as much output as we could as we felt like there was a lot of consumer need for our products last year, and so we did that, and we probably gave back a little share. But again, I think, overall, we feel like consumer tissue certainly stabilizing versus what we saw in the first and second quarters."

And so if you remember, Kevin, we had really a tight supply situation and toward the end of the first quarter, and that flowed through the whole second quarter. We were down mid-single-digit share points, I think, in diapers at that point. And so the team has really done a nice job recovering.
I think in diapers, we were up 340 basis points sequentially in the quarter and just a little -- just about even, maybe a little bit less than even on share overall in the quarter. So we feel good about the recovery. I think we're making good progress in adult care. 
Tissue, as I mentioned, on the bath tissue side, we're a little soft because we had maybe a little elevated share that I was hoping to hold on to, but we haven't held on to it. But that was more due to availability. Kleenex is up pretty good, pretty substantially, and we feel good about that, although the category is down. And then on towels, yes, we're down about a little over 1 point. The issue there is we -- given supply conditions, we have shifted some of our supply production from towels to bath, and that's caused part of that. 
So overall, I would say that the brands are moving in the right direction, not all. But we feel like we have the right plans in place, and we're going to continue to make progress."

At this point, I'd say it's returned to historical levels, both in personal care, which happened about the third quarter of last year, and then in consumer tissue this quarter or the third quarter of this year. 
Yes. Philosophically, what -- I do think retailers do believe brand switching occurs with brands, and so promotions continue to be important in our categories. There is potentially some share shifting. Frankly, my emphasis would be on the what I call the high road approach of growing brands, which is growing brands through great innovation and marketing, and using trade and promotion as a fundamental element of that to support what we're doing from a marketing perspective. But I don't really value share from promotion alone. And so in general, we're going to be focusing on being efficient with how we spend our promotions and being disciplined about it, especially, Kevin, as you might imagine, in this environment, where certainly pricing and price realization is important given what's happening with the cost front."

I would say at this point, we will look to continue to build that. We're probably operating kind of in the 5, plus or minus, range -- 5% range of sales. It's still a little lower than our primary competitors. I would like that to be higher over time, although we probably never will match some of our competitors at the same level they will. But I still think we can productively invest more and make that a win-win for the brand while growing our margins at the same time.
The unique thing about advertising in this environment were kind of as digital has unfolded is that the returns are much better than they historically have been, and so we continue to improve our efficiencies. We're getting better at that. And so for us, we're going to continue to look for ways to grow the business, and that's going to include through advertising investment.

We're definitely not running out of runway on FORCE, and we continue to see opportunities in the supply chain. And some of the digital supply chain investments that I referenced earlier in the call will help us unlock those opportunities. The FORCE cost savings for this year is really affected by the supply chain challenges that we've been facing which are a headwind for our cost savings, and it's related to production and distribution inefficiencies caused by demand volatility and also the logistics issues that we've been talking about. 
The way that the FORCE cost savings program works is of the negotiated material prices piece of it, which I'll come back and talk about in a minute, and then we have core productivity in our supply chain operations as well as product revisions to achieve design-to-value savings. So in the quarter, we had very good savings associated with the negotiated material prices. We also had benefits from productivity improvements and product changes but not as much as we were hoping. And you have to net positive in terms of total delivered cost for it to count as FORCE cost savings. 
So as you have headwinds coming in, they offset the gross FORCE cost savings that we would report, and that's really what we're seeing now. The headwinds that are flowing through manufacturing are dampening the net results of FORCE, but there's strong gross savings there.
The other issue that we've got on FORCE is our supply chain folks are very focused on managing through this near-term environment to get product produced and to get it to customers who can get in the hands of consumers, and that leaves less time for our employees to be working on productivity initiatives within the supply chain. So it's really those 2 things that are lowering the FORCE cost savings number for this year, but we have a healthy amount of room to go in terms of driving supply chain productivity as we move forward."

But as stimulus kind of fades, all that cash these consumers are sitting on starts to dwindle as we get into 2022. How are you guys thinking about potential pricing and price elasticity? Just -- I feel like more is going to need to happen because we all, I think, get the joke here that costs are going to continue to rise. And so I just wanted to get an understanding. Do you have any strategies in place to kind of minimize the amount of price shock that some of these consumers might feel as we get into 2022?"

And so, at this point, I think our elasticity modeling is pretty good, fairly accurate. I would say, given our categories, Nik, that the elasticity tends to be a little less when realized than was predicted, just because if you look at this -- bath tissue, the consumption doesn't change that much. Maybe the value tier you've purchased at may shift a little bit, and so there's that dynamic. But we are sensitive to it -- that, and it's also what's core in our strategy is developing a great value proposition to our consumer, and so we're always cognizant of that. 
And I think one of the things that we've done in many markets around the world is offer a great proposition on both the value side and also the premium side. And while our strategy, generally, is to elevate our categories and expand our categories, I do think pricing in our categories with the premiumization of our categories a little less than some of the others that I've worked in, in the past, so I still think there's room to grow.
However, we want to be able to shift, and that's what we've done in a market like Latin America. And one of the reasons why we've grown share this year is because we've been able to pivot between our premium tier and our value tier. For reference, 2 years ago, we were making a student body left to go premium, and we shifted a significant portion of our mix in Brazil from value to premium. And over the past 18 months, we've been shifting it back the other way because that's what the consumer needs. And so we're really cognizant of that. We're aware of the elasticities. 
Thus far, I would say, our volumes have held up. Although I think what's really happening is we're seeing the intended elasticity, but we do have brand growth initiatives that are offsetting some of that elasticity impact."

So pivoting back to just the core business then. Good momentum on Personal Care. I mean you're getting the price. Your market shares are holding up.

And then a second one, on the category growth between tracked and untracked channels. Do you see bricks growing faster than e-commerce because of the tough comparisons in the quarter? And do you see the share issues that you alluded to in North America mostly due to the fact that your competitors took longer to take pricing? Or is that more of an availability issue?"

But the most acute issues and meaningful cost increases versus what we had been expecting is in North America and -- in that the labor market in the U.S., I just don't see a near-term catalyst. So I think the headwinds and the increased distribution costs will certainly be with us into 2022, and we'll have to see all of this plays out. It's not just affecting us, of course. It's affecting companies quite broadly, and we're all dealing with these challenges.

The issue that we've had on share, a couple of different areas. In North America, it's primarily been an issue around supply. And so even though we've made substantial improvement in our fulfillment throughout the course of the year, we're still not meeting all orders out there. And so our share is still a little light from that dimension.
And then in a couple of other markets, again, I think it is, as you point out, maybe some relative price indices that have expanded a little bit in the short term. We've moved on pricing in most markets. And while we've generally seen moves from branded competition, we haven't seen that in all markets.

Organic sales were stro",679,"Okay. Thank you, Taryn. Good morning, everyone. Before we get to your questions, I'd like to offer some perspective on our third quarter and further actions we're taking in response to this dynamic and challenging macroenvironment. Organic sales were strong, up 4% in the quarter and included the impact of pricing actions implemented in the second and third quarters. In North America, personal care organic sales were up 11%, driven by mid-single-digit increases in both net selling price and volume. In D&E markets, personal care organic sales were up 7%, organic sales increased double digits in Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Eastern Europe and South Africa.
Our top line performance was strong despite the resurgence of COVID, which impacted growth in ASEAN, Latin America and K-C Professional. Our market positions remain strong and are improving, reflecting strong innovation and excellent commercial execution in nearly all key markets. Our share positions in North America remains solid with good sequential gains in personal care. Our share performance in D&E markets remains robust, where we continue to strengthen our diaper leadership positions in key markets, including China and Brazil.
We also continue to focus on cost, with our teams delivering solid savings of $150 million in the quarter. In addition, we reduced between-the-lines spending. Now clearly, our margins and earnings were disappointing as higher inflation and supply chain disruptions increased our costs well beyond the expectation we established just last quarter.
I'd like to highlight the effect of 3 areas of volatility that are most impacting our business. First, as we noted in July and on the basis of external forecast, we had expected commodity prices to ease in the second half of 2021. Instead, prices for resin and pulp increased further in the third quarter and are now expected to stabilize at a meaningfully higher level than our prior estimate.
Second, a tight U.S. labor market and disruption in domestic and international transportation markets are having an elevated impact on our supply chain as we work to get our products to the shelf and meet consumer demand.
Third, energy costs are up dramatically in Europe, where natural gas prices have risen as high as 6x year ago levels. Energy prices in North America are also up sharply, although not to the same extent. As a result, our margins are down -- were down with declines only partially mitigated by the actions we've taken to date.
We're not pleased with our results, and we're taking further action to mitigate the impact of higher input and labor costs. These steps include further pricing actions, additional initiatives to ensure we achieve our cost savings goals and tightening discretionary spending.
At the same time, we remain committed to investing in our brands and commercial capabilities. While we expect to see some benefit from these actions in 2021, we have further reduced our outlook for the year. This reflects our third quarter performance and our expectations for the fourth quarter.
And while we're not ready to call our outlook for 2022, I will offer perspective on key variables that will affect our plan next year. First, we continue to build top line momentum. In addition, our pricing actions, brand investment and commercial program should provide further benefit in 2022. Second, some discrete headwinds we face this year will be behind us. This includes the U.S. winter storm and presumably consumer tissue destocking. Third, some headwinds we face this year may become more persistent. We're now expecting further inflation on several key commodities. We're also expecting continued tightness in the labor and transportation markets, which will continue to impact our global supply chain all the way to our customers.
In addition, the going-forward impact of COVID on both demand and supply remains very unpredictable. We will continue to move decisively and navigate changing market conditions. We'll also continue to invest in our brands and capabilities to maintain brand momentum. Our strategy is working, and we remain confident in our future and are confident in our ability to create long-term shareholder value.
Now we'd like to address your questions."

I mean, and I believe margin improvement is a fundamental pillar of what we need to do for the company. 
And so we expect to fully offset inflation with both pricing and cost reductions, so a combination, while we expect to fully offset that over time. So we announced some further actions in Q3. The year-to-date, our actions are fairly broad reaching every region, every business, generally. I wouldn't -- actually, not every single business, but generally across most markets. And so in Q3, we've announced broader actions in North America, professional and consumer Latin America and other markets selectively. So I would say, pretty far reaching. 
I will tell you Dara, our earlier pricing actions are generally on track, as you saw kind of in the release, we had 3 points of price factor in organic in the quarter. We have seen some other brands move, particularly in North America. I haven't seen significant movement in private label yet. Although I'll note that, that typically occurs a little bit later.

That said, we have made some adjustments in some categories where it felt like it was perhaps a little less effective in the current environment. And so, to that extent, we've done that.

And then last question, just -- as we look out, obviously, there's a lot of volatility from a commodity cost standpoint, and things have been moving in their own direction and you're taking a lot of pricing to help offset that. Is there a certain point you can look out to where you think the year-over-year pricing, at least based on the plans that are in place today as well as spot commodities where we are today, where you're able to fully offset it on a year-over-year basis? 
Obviously, there's still -- there's a big gap leaving this year, but I'm wondering on sort of more a go-forward basis, is it more in the middle of next year when you think you have enough pricing to offset year-over-year commodity increases? Could it be earlier than that? How do you sort of think through that conceptually? Understanding there will be some gap leaving this year, but when on a year-over-year basis, do we sort of get to an ability maybe to offset some of these cost pressures from your vantage point?"

I mean that's why we've been saying we'll offset or get our margins back in line and improving over time with both pricing and cost reduction. I think the middle of next year is probably a good kind of perspective for us. Because obviously, what happened this year was we saw the change in the commodity line, obviously, coming out of the first quarter. 
And so we announced pricing that was effective -- or we announced it at the end of the first quarter, and it was effective in our second quarter of this year. Certainly, commodities have moved significantly since then. And so we've made additional actions, and that's going to take us time to implement fully. So that's one component. 
The other component I will tell you that looking forward is -- and I think we indicated this about 2022, is the global supply chain is under pressure, and we do expect cost to remain elevated for a period. Not all costs. Certainly, I think there are some fundamentals in the eucalyptus market that would say, hey, there's more capacity coming along, so that should come back a little bit. But the polymer-based products, seem like they're going to remain elevated for a little while. We mentioned U.S. labor costs and pressures on transportation globally. I think that's going to remain elevated for a while, because I don't see a fundamental catalyst to change that in the near term. And so that's why we're making some of our moves."

I think maybe -- would maybe is a little less clear as kind of how it's rolling through. And what I mentioned, labor markets and the transportation markets, it ripples through. And my take would be, it looks like COVID appears to have increased the demand for goods over the past year or so. And as shifting expanded a little bit from services to goods.
And so with that, the other effect of COVID is -- and you've read all the articles about the great resignation, whether that's the case or whether it's more that there are a lot more options for hourly work, it has really tightened the hourly labor supply. And so because of that pressure on both sides, increased demands means much more demand for containers or trucking, less labor means fewer drivers to drive the trucks. And because of that, as you noted in our third -- even in our third quarter, while our service levels are improving significantly, we were not able to get all our orders out the door on the time line that we wanted. 
And because of that, that rolls through in multiple ways. One is we pay higher rates for employees, higher wages. We're paying higher rates for transportation. It's rolling through, in some cases, our employee tenure has shortened dramatically. And so changing how we staff, because we have to staff more people to get the product out the door. We've got production outages, missed deliveries and that ripples through with fines and everything else with customers. 
And so there's just the many ways that I think both this pressure on the labor side and the transportation markets kind of ripples through the cost. And that's kind of why you're seeing a little softness in our FORCE delivery. Most of that was because of the elevated costs. I don't know, Maria, do you have more to add?"

We need to hire in a normal time, if we have 30 people, given the inefficiencies with the labor and turnover, we might need to have 40 people just to get the same amount of product out the door as an example. 
So it's across the board, primarily in North America. Although in the U.K., there's also distribution challenges, that's another market where it impacted our sales in the quarter, and that also has to do with labor related to Brexit.

And I think it's really based on differentiated innovation and excellent local commercial program, really the driver. And I think our brands are about as healthy as I've seen as far as long as I've been here. Obviously, not all of them are working the way that we would like them work, but in general, our brands are performing quite well. 
The birth rate issue you mentioned in diapers is real. Although there's a couple of different dimensions of that, which is, one, certainly a big decline in birth rate in China. 5 years ago, there were about 17 million or 18 million births and this year, it looks like there'll be about 10-ish million, right, somewhere in that range. And that said, it's still going to be a big market, right, and still the largest diaper market in the world for a long time. So that's one thing. 
That's one on the downside. The U.S., on the contract because there was a little bit of decline in births last year that accelerated with COVID, actually slightly up this year. And actually, we're seeing through the first couple of quarters and the projection is moving toward modest growth in the second half, is -- so that's a bit of positive news. 
But the overall, I [indiscernible] reason why you're seeing strong performance on personal care is more what I talked about previously, which is strong innovation pipeline and strong, strong local programming on the commercial side. And what the teams will say, it's not any one thing. It's the combination of a plan, meaning great innovation backed with great marketing, with a great sales plan and local execution all working together.
And I think the numbers you may have seen, but personal care is accelerating globally. It was up 9% in the quarter with a strong recovery in North America that was up 11%. And then we're continuing to see that strong performance across D&E in most markets. Making good progress in K-C Professional as well. That was up 12%, with North America being up 16% and a healthy balance of both price and volume. And then consumer tissue, although still down in the quarter, it was down 6% and down 9% in North America, I'd say that was stabilizing.
Our consumption in North America was better than our organic, and that's because we are cycling a big year ago customer or consumer inventory build that happened in the third quarter, a little bit happened in the fourth quarter last year as well. So we're cycling that. But I'd say the good news on consumer tissue globally, it feels like it's stabilizing.
We have given up a little share in North America. We probably picked up a little share last year on bath tissue because we had a little more availability. Our teams were scrambling to put out as much output as it could as we felt like there was a lot of consumer need for our products last year. And so we did that, and we probably gave back a little share. But again, I think overall, we feel like consumer tissue certainly stabilizing versus what we saw in the first and second quarters."

And so if you remember, Kevin, we had really tight supply situation towards the end of the first quarter, and that flowed through the whole second quarter. We were down mid-single-digit share points, I think, in diapers at that point. And so the team has really done a nice job recovering. I think in diapers, we were up 340 basis points sequentially in the quarter. And just a look -- just about even, or maybe a little bit less than even on share overall. in the quarter. So we feel good about the recovery. I think we're making good progress in adult care. 
Tissue, as I mentioned, on the bath tissue side, we're a little soft because we had maybe a little elevated share that I was hoping to hold on to but we haven't held on to it, but that was more due to availability. Kleenex is up pretty good, pretty substantially, and we feel good about that, although the category is down. 
And then on towels, we're down about a little over 1 point.

At this point, I'd say it's returned to historical levels, both in personal care, which happened about the third quarter of last year and then in consumer tissue this quarter or the third quarter of this year.
Philosophically, I do think retailers do believe brand switching occurs with brands. And so promotions continue to be important in our categories there is potentially some share shifting, frankly, my emphasis would be on what I call the high road approach to growing brand, which is growing brands through great innovation and marketing and using trade and promotion as a fundamental element of that to support what we're doing from a marketing perspective. But I don't really value share from promotion alone. And so in general, we're going to be focusing on being efficient with how we spend our promotions and being disciplined about it.

Like following up on Dara's question, the halfway through the year or maybe a little bit longer is when you expect margin expansion. Is that year-over-year? Or when you expect margins to return to more normal historical levels? And is that gross margin or operating margin? My thought would be expansion in gross margin, but just wanted to confirm.
And then this is a bit more conceptual, but I just want to understand how you think about adding back advertising next year, particularly as hopefully supply constraints get better and gross margin improves. Like how do you balance recovery of operating margins back to the high teens versus reinvesting back in the business to set yourself up for growth in years to come, particularly given the lower spend you'll be cycling this year?"

And as I said, we'll have to see really how commodities play out and how pricing plays out. And I would characterize it as we'll look to recover margins over time. We are very focused on margin recovery. 
And exactly when that's going to happen, I'm not prepared to say. But we'll have a lot more to say on that in January, when we have 3 months more of visibility and 3 months more of additional actions that will take as a management team. We're working through our 2022 planning cycle now, and so we're pulling that together. And given the volatility and the lack of visibility that we've had, it's too early to call the year, but we'll give you our best view in January.
And Mike, I think you can probably comment on advertising and how you see that unfolding."

Peter, we've actually increased our advertising investment significantly over the last few years, and we feel good about that. And clearly, I think that's shown up in the numbers in terms of the organic growth and the overall health of the brand that we -- as I talked about earlier on this call. So we feel good about that.
I would say at this point, we will look to continue to build that. We're probably operating kind of in the 5% plus or minus 5% range of sales. It's still a little lower than our primary competitors. I would like that to be higher over time. although we probably never will match some of our competitors at the same level, they will. But I still think we can productively invest more and make that a win-win for the brand while growing our margins at the same time.
The unique thing about advertising in this environment where kind of as digital has unfolded is that the returns are much better than they historically have been. And so we continue to improve our efficiencies. We're getting better at that. And so for us, we're going to continue to look for ways to grow the business, and that's going to include through advertising investment. At the same time, Maria and I will also work to deliver a balanced plan that will deliver, as we just mentioned, margin improvement over time, while delivering improved organic growth."

And so on the P&L, you don't see the full net effect of the actions that we're taking there because we are continuing to invest. We -- the commodity inflation ran up on us quickly, it was far in excess of what we expected in the third quarter. But we are continuing to make investments in the company for the long term, and we're very committed to doing that and focused on the long-term health of the company and the brand."

And we continue to see opportunities in the supply chain and some of the digital supply chain investments that I referenced earlier in the call will help us unlock those opportunities. 
The FORCE cost savings for this year is really affected by the supply chain challenges that we've been facing, which are a headwind for our cost savings. And it's related to production and distribution inefficiencies caused by demand volatility and also the logistics issues that we've been talking about. The way that the FORCE cost savings program works is of the negotiated material prices, piece of it, which I'll come back and talk about in a minute, and then we have core productivity in our supply chain operations as well as product revisions to achieve design to value savings. 
So in the quarter, we had very good savings associated with the negotiated material prices. We also had benefits from productivity improvements and product changes, but not as much as we were hoping. And you have to net positive in terms of total delivered cost for it to count as for cost savings. So as you have headwinds coming in, they offset the gross FORCE cost savings that we would report. And that's really what we're seeing now. The headwinds that are flowing through manufacturing are dampening the net results of FORCE, but there's strong gross savings there.
The other issue that we've got on FORCE is our supply chain folks are very focused on managing through this near-term environment to get product produced and to get it to customers so we can get in the hands of consumers. And that leaves less time for our employees to be working on productivity initiatives within the supply chain. So it's really those 2 things that are lowering the FORCE cost savings number for this year. But we have a healthy amount of room to go in terms of driving supply chain productivity as we move forward."

And I should go back to the other part of your question, right, there's really 2 pieces of those for cost savings. The negotiated material prices our savings are much higher this year given the contract structures versus the rapid inflation on the commodity side. Those contracts get reset on a regular basis. So it will be reset at higher levels. So when I look forward, I wouldn't expect as much benefit as we had this year because if you think about where we were coming into 2020 versus where commodities went, we got a sizable benefit in FORCE there this year. So that's that piece of it. But on the core productivity, I would expect us to have more savings on that part of it as we move forward."

Just I feel like more is going to need to happen because we all, I think, get the joke here that costs are going to continue to rise.

And so at this point, I think our elasticity modeling is pretty good, fairly accurate. I would say given our categories, Nick, that the elasticity tends to be a little less when realized than what predicted, just because if you look at these bath tissue, the consumption doesn't change that much. Maybe the value tier you purchased at may shift a little bit.
And so there's that dynamic, but we are sensitive to that. And it's also what's core in our strategy is developing a great value proposition to our consumer. And so we're always cognizant of that. And I think one of the things that we've done in many markets around the world is offer a great proposition on both the value side and also the premium side. And while our strategy generally is to elevate our categories and expand our categories, I do think pricing in our categories, with the premiumization of our categories, a little less than some of the others that I've worked in, in the past. 
So I still think there's room to grow. However, we want to be able to shift, and that's what we've done in a market like Latin America. And one of the reasons why we've grown share this year is because we've been able to pivot between our premium tier and our value tier. For reference, 2 years ago, we were making a student body left to go premium. And we shifted a significant portion of our mix in Brazil from value to premium. And over the past 18 months, we've been shifting it back the other way because that's what the consumer needs.
And so we're really cognizant of that, we're aware of the elasticities. Thus far, I would say our volumes have held up, although I think what's really happening is we're seeing the intended elasticity, but we do have brand growth initiatives that are offsetting some elasticity impact."

And so our share is still a little light from that dimension.

Good morning, everyone. Before we get to your questions, I'd like to offer some perspective on our third quarter and further actions we're taking in response to this dynamic and challenging macroenvironment. Organic sales were stro",679,"Okay. Thank you, Taryn. Good morning, everyone. Before we get to your questions, I'd like to offer some perspective on our third quarter and further actions we're taking in response to this dynamic and challenging macroenvironment. Organic sales were strong, up 4% in the quarter and included the impact of pricing actions implemented in the second and third quarters. In North America, personal care organic sales were up 11%, driven by mid-single-digit increases in both net selling price and volume. In D&E markets, personal care organic sales were up 7%, organic sales increased double digits in Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Eastern Europe and South Africa. 
Our top line performance was strong despite the resurgence of COVID, which impacted growth in ASEAN, Latin America and K-C Professional. Our market positions remain strong and are improving, reflecting strong innovation and excellent commercial execution in nearly all key markets. Our share positions in North America remains solid with good sequential gains in personal care. Our share performance in D&E markets remains robust, where we continue to strengthen our diaper leadership positions in key markets, including China and Brazil. 
We also continue to focus on cost, with our teams delivering solid savings of $150 million in the quarter. In addition, we reduced between-the-lines spending. Now clearly, our margins and earnings were disappointing as higher inflation and supply chain disruptions increased our costs well beyond the expectation we established just last quarter. 
I'd like to highlight the effect of 3 areas of volatility that are most impacting our business. First, as we noted in July and on the basis of external forecast, we had expected commodity prices to ease in the second half of 2021. Instead, prices for resin and pulp increased further in the third quarter and are now expected to stabilize at a meaningfully higher level than our prior estimate. 
Second, a tight U.S. labor market and disruption in domestic and international transportation markets are having an elevated impact on our supply chain as we work to get our products to the shelf and meet consumer demand. 
Third, energy costs are up dramatically in Europe, where natural gas prices have risen as high as 6x year ago levels. Energy prices in North America are also up sharply, although not to the same extent. As a result, our margins are down -- were down with declines only partially mitigated by the actions we've taken to date. 
We're not pleased with our results, and we're taking further action to mitigate the impact of higher input and labor costs. These steps include further pricing actions, additional initiatives to ensure we achieve our cost savings goals and tightening discretionary spending. At the same time, we remain committed to investing in our brands and commercial capabilities. While we expect to see some benefit from these actions in 2021, we have further reduced our outlook for the year. This reflects our third quarter performance and our expectations for the fourth quarter. 
And while we're not ready to call our outlook for 2022, I will offer perspective on key variables that will affect our plan next year. First, we continue to build top line momentum. In addition, our pricing actions brand investment and commercial program should provide further benefit in 2022. Second, some discrete headwinds we face this year will be behind us. This includes the U.S. winter storm and presumably consumer tissue destocking. Third, some headwinds we face this year may become more persistent. We're now expecting further inflation on several key commodities. We're also expecting continued tightness in the labor and transportation markets, which will continue to impact our global supply chain all the way to our customers. 
In addition, the going-forward impact of COVID on both demand and supply remains very unpredictable. We will continue to move decisively and navigate changing market conditions. We'll also continue to invest in our brands and capabilities to maintain brand momentum. Our strategy is working, and we remain confident in our future and are confident in our ability to create long-term shareholder value. 
Now we'd like to address your questions."

I mean, and I believe margin improvement is a fundamental pillar of what we need to do for the company.  
And so we expect to fully offset inflation with both pricing and cost reductions, so a combination, while we expect to fully offset that over time. So we announced some further actions in Q3. The year-to-date, our actions are fairly broad reaching every region, every business, generally. I wouldn't -- actually, not every single business, but generally across most markets. 
And so in Q3, we've announced broader actions in North America, professional and consumer Latin America and other markets selectively. So I would say, pretty far reaching.  
I will tell you Dara, our earlier pricing actions are generally on track, as you saw kind of in the release, we had 3 points of price factor in organic in the quarter. We have seen some other brands move, particularly in North America. I haven't seen significant movement in private label yet. Although I'll note that, that typically occurs a little bit later. And we've had a little share of softness. But in general, I think our volumes are holding up well."

So we're going to obviously work hard to make sure our margins improve, but we want to maintain that investment in the brands, especially where it's working. 
That said, we have made some adjustments in some categories where it felt like it was perhaps a little less effective in the current environment. And so, to that extent, we've done that. We have trended between the line spend a little bit, but that -- I would tell you that's been more on the on the G&A front than on the A&CP front in the quarter.

And we've been prioritizing those as we look at the current situation.
And so we've trimmed the advertising investment a bit, but that's on the back of significant step-ups over the last 2 years. And when I look at the year, our expectation is that on a dollar basis, we'll be up nicely from where we were in 2019."

And then last question, just -- as we look out, obviously, there's a lot of volatility from a commodity cost standpoint, and things have been moving in their own direction and you're taking a lot of pricing to help offset that. Is there a certain point you can look out to where you think the year-over-year pricing, at least based on the plans that are in place today as well as spot commodities where we are today, where you're able to fully offset it on a year-over-year basis? 
Obviously, there's still -- there's a big gap leaving this year, but I'm wondering on sort of more a go-forward basis, is it more in the middle of next year when you think you have enough pricing to offset year-over-year commodity increases? Could it be earlier than that? How do you sort of think through that conceptually? Understanding there will be some gap leaving this year, but when on a year-over-year basis, do we sort of get to an ability maybe to offset some of these cost pressures from your vantage point?"

I mean that's why we've been saying we'll offset or get our margins back in line and improving over time with both pricing and cost reduction. I think the middle of next year is probably a good kind of perspective for us. Because obviously, what happened this year was we saw the change in the commodity line, obviously, coming out of the first quarter. 
And so we announced pricing that was effective -- or we announced it at the end of the first quarter, and it was effective in our second quarter of this year. Certainly, commodities have moved significantly since then. And so we've made additional actions, and that's going to take us time to implement fully. So that's one component. 
The other component I will tell you that looking forward is -- and I think we indicated this about 2022, is the global supply chain is under pressure, and we do expect cost to remain elevated for a period. Not all costs. Certainly, I think there are some fundamentals in the eucalyptus market that would say, hey, there's more capacity coming along, so that should come back a little bit. But the polymer-based products, seem like they're going to remain elevated for a little while. We mentioned U.S. labor costs and pressures on transportation globally. I think that's going to remain elevated for a while, because I don't see a fundamental catalyst to change that in the near term. And so that's why we're making some of our moves."

I mean, certainly, I think you can clearly see on fiber and resin base, the commodity challenges. And so I think that's kind of well established and visible for you all. 
I think maybe -- would maybe is a little less clear as kind of how it's rolling through. And what I mentioned, labor markets and the transportation markets, it ripples through. And my take would be, it looks like COVID appears to have increased the demand for goods over the past year or so and as shifting expanded a little bit from services to goods.
And so with that, the other effect of COVID is -- and you've read all the articles about the great resignation, whether that's the case or whether it's more that there are a lot more options for hourly work, it has really tightened the hourly labor supply. And so because of that pressure on both sides, increased demands means much more demand for containers or trucking, less labor means fewer drivers to drive the trucks. And because of that, as you noted in our third -- even in our third quarter, while our service levels are improving significantly, we were not able to get all our orders out the door on the time line that we wanted. 
And because of that, that rolls through in multiple ways. One is we pay higher rates for employees, higher wages. We're paying higher rates for transportation. It's rolling through, in some cases, our employee tenure has shortened dramatically. And so it's changing how we staff, because we have to staff more people to get the product out the door. We've got production outages, missed deliveries and that ripples through with fines and everything else with customers. 
And so there's just the many ways that I think both this pressure on the labor side and the transportation markets kind of ripples through the cost. And that's kind of why you're seeing a little softness in our FORCE delivery. Most of that was because of the elevated costs. I don't know, Maria, do you have more to add?"

We need to hire in a normal time, if we have 30 people, given the inefficiencies with the labor and turnover, we might need to have 40 people just to get the same amount of product out the door as an example. 
So it's across the board, primarily in North America. Although in the U.K., there's also distribution challenges, that's another market where it impacted our sales in the quarter, and that also has to do with labor related to Brexit. So it's -- I've never seen a supply chain environment like this, and it's affecting us across the P&L."

Our forecast is wrong for the birth rate this year or certain income class is doing better. Did stimulus offset the impact of the job losses? Just any perspective you might be able to provide around why that business seems to be doing better. 
And then I'll just add on the second kind of category question here. I mean I appreciate that the tissue business, the consumer tissue business is seeing difficult comps and continued destocking, but there has been some margin losses. I wonder if you could just expand upon that as well? So there's one on the personal care side and then on the tissue side as well, please."

So overall, Chris, our brand fundamentals are strong and really improving. And I think it's really based on differentiated innovation and excellent local commercial program, really the driver. And I think our brands are about as healthy as I've seen",546,"Yes. So overall, Chris, our brand fundamentals are strong and really improving. And I think it's really based on differentiated innovation and excellent local commercial program, really the driver. And I think our brands are about as healthy as I've seen as far as long as I've been here. Obviously, not all of them are working the way that we would like them work, but in general, our brands are performing quite well. 
The birth rate issue you mentioned in diapers is real. Although there's a couple of different dimensions of that, which is, one, certainly a big decline in birth rate in China. 5 years ago, there were about 17 million or 18 million births and this year, it looks like there'll be about 10-ish million, right, somewhere in that range. And that said, it's still going to be a big market, right, and still the largest diaper market in the world for a long time. So that's one thing. 
That's one on the downside. The U.S., on the contrast because there was a little bit of decline in births last year that accelerated with COVID, actually slightly up this year. And actually, we're seeing through the first couple of quarters and the projection is moving toward modest growth in the second half, is -- so that's a bit of positive news. 
But the overall, the reason why you're seeing strong performance on personal care is more what I talked about previously, which is strong innovation pipeline and strong, strong local programming on the commercial side. And what the teams will say, it's not any one thing. It's the combination of a plan, meaning great innovation backed with great marketing, with a great sales plan and local execution all working together.
And I think the numbers you may have seen, but personal care is accelerating globally. It was up 9% in the quarter with a strong recovery in North America that was up 11%. And then we're continuing to see that strong performance across D&E in most markets. Making good progress in K-C Professional as well. That was up 12%, with North America being up 16% and a healthy balance of both price and volume. And then consumer tissue, although still down in the quarter, it was down 6% and down 9% in North America, I'd say that was stabilizing.
Our consumption in North America was better than our organic, and that's because we are cycling a big year ago customer or consumer inventory build that happened in the third quarter, a little bit happened in the fourth quarter last year as well. So we're cycling that. But I'd say the good news on consumer tissue globally, it feels like it's stabilizing.
We have given up a little share in North America. We probably picked up a little share last year on bath tissue because we had a little more availability. Our teams were scrambling to put out as much output as it could as we felt like there was a lot of consumer need for our products last year. And so we did that, and we probably gave back a little share. But again, I think overall, we feel like consumer tissue certainly stabilizing versus what we saw in the first and second quarters."

And so if you remember, Kevin, we had really tight supply situation towards the end of the first quarter, and that flowed through the whole second quarter. We were down mid-single-digit share points, I think, in diapers at that point. And so the team has really done a nice job recovering. I think in diapers, we were up 340 basis points sequentially in the quarter. And just a look -- just about even, or maybe a little bit less than even on share overall in the quarter. So we feel good about the recovery. I think we're making good progress in adult care. 
Tissue, as I mentioned, on the bath tissue side, we're a little soft because we had maybe a little elevated share that I was hoping to hold on to but we haven't held on to it, but that was more due to availability. Kleenex is up pretty good, pretty substantially, and we feel good about that, although the category is down. 
And then on towels, we're down about a little over 1 point. The issue there is given supply conditions, we have shifted some of our supply of production from towels to bath, and that's caused part of that. So overall, I would say that the brands are moving in the right direction, not all, but we feel like we have the right plans in place, and we're going to continue to make progress."

At this point, I'd say it's returned to historical levels, both in personal care, which happened about the third quarter of last year and then in consumer tissue this quarter or the third quarter of this year.
Philosophically, I do think retailers do believe brand switching occurs with brands. And so promotions continue to be important in our categories there is potentially some share shifting, frankly, my emphasis would be on what I call the high road approach to growing brand, which is growing brands through great innovation and marketing and using trade and promotion as a fundamental element of that to support what we're doing from a marketing perspective. But I don't really value share from promotion alone. And so in general, we're going to be focusing on being efficient with how we spend our promotions and being disciplined about it.

I would say at this point, we will look to continue to build that. We're probably operating kind of in the 5% plus or minus 5% range of sales. It's still a little lower than our primary competitors. I would like that to be higher over time. although we probably never will match some of our competitors at the same level, they will. But I still think we can productively invest more and make that a win-win for the brand while growing our margins at the same time.
The unique thing about advertising in this environment where kind of as digital has unfolded is that the returns are much better than they historically have been. And so we continue to improve our efficiencies. We're getting better at that. And so for us, we're going to continue to look for ways to grow the business, and that's going to include through advertising investment.

And we continue to see opportunities in the supply chain and some of the digital supply chain investments that I referenced earlier in the call will help us unlock those opportunities. 
The FORCE cost savings for this year is really affected by the supply chain challenges that we've been facing, which are a headwind for our cost savings. And it's related to production and distribution inefficiencies caused by demand volatility and also the logistics issues that we've been talking about. The way that the FORCE cost savings program works is of the negotiated material prices, piece of it, which I'll come back and talk about in a minute, and then we have core productivity in our supply chain operations as well as product revisions to achieve design to value savings. 
So in the quarter, we had very good savings associated with the negotiated material prices. We also had benefits from productivity improvements and product changes, but not as much as we were hoping. And you have to net positive in terms of total delivered cost for it to count as for cost savings. So as you have headwinds coming in, they offset the gross FORCE cost savings that we would report. And that's really what we're seeing now. The headwinds that are flowing through manufacturing are dampening the net results of FORCE, but there's strong gross savings there.
The other issue that we've got on FORCE is our supply chain folks are very focused on managing through this near-term environment to get product produced and to get it to customers so we can get in the hands of consumers. And that leaves less time for our employees to be working on productivity initiatives within the supply chain. So it's really those 2 things that are lowering the FORCE cost savings number for this year. But we have a healthy amount of room to go in terms of driving supply chain productivity as we move forward."

And so at this point, I think our elasticity modeling is pretty good, fairly accurate. I would say given our categories, Nick, that the elasticity tends to be a little less when realized than what predicted, just because if you look at these bath tissue, the consumption doesn't change that much. Maybe the value tier you purchased at may shift a little bit.
And so there's that dynamic, but we are sensitive to that. And it's also what's core in our strategy is developing a great value proposition to our consumer. And so we're always cognizant of that. And I think one of the things that we've done in many markets around the world is offer a great proposition on both the value side and also the premium side. And while our strategy generally is to elevate our categories and expand our categories, I do think pricing in our categories, with the premiumization of our categories, a little less than some of the others that I've worked in, in the past. 
So I still think there's room to grow. However, we want to be able to shift, and that's what we've done in a market like Latin America. And one of the reasons why we've grown share this year is because we've been able to pivot between our premium tier and our value tier. For reference, 2 years ago, we were making a student body left to go premium. And we shifted a significant portion of our mix in Brazil from value to premium. And over the past 18 months, we've been shifting it back the other way because that's what the consumer needs.
And so we're really cognizant of that, we're aware of the elasticities. Thus far, I would say our volumes have held up, although I think what's really happening is we're seeing the intended elasticity, but we do have brand growth initiatives that are offsetting some elasticity impact."

Not -- I don't think he asked when do you expect margins recovering. I think most of the answers have been around margin recovery. But -- so can you clarify, you're not expecting price to be caught up with costs until the back half of next year or not even? Like even that's too optimistic, it's somewhere beyond the midpoint of next year, when price actually catches up with cost, ceteris paribus."

So pivoting back to just the core business then, good momentum on personal care. I mean, you're getting the price, your market shares are holding up, the business has turned back to a degree of profit growth, all pretty encouraging, but the tissue business looks very different, especially on the margin degradation side and the lack of price momentum. Can you elaborate on what's holding you back on price? What actions have you taken? What is in market now and why are we not seeing more momentum on price so far?"

Again, I think what you're seeing in Personal Care, we did move very early on when we had our commodity forecast update in the first quarter, and so we did move on that. At the time, I think the tissue side or the fiber side was less clear. And so I would say we probably moved a little slower on the tissue side. We have announced some broad pricing actions in multiple markets since then. And so that's why I said earlier, Jason, that I would expect our tissue price realization to continue to improve as the year progresses."

And then a second one on the category growth between tracked and nontracked channels. Do you just see bricks growing faster than e-commerce because of the tough comparisons in the quarter? And do you see the share issues that you alluded to in North America, mostly due to the fact that your competitors took longer to take pricing? Or is that more of an availability issue?"

I think the labor issues in the U.S. are very real, and that's where we are feeling the brunt of the challenges on the supply chain side. More globally, I mentioned the U.K. market but also with global shipping, those issues are also quite challenging in a number of our markets.
But the most acute issues and meaningful cost increases versus what we had been expecting is in North America and that the labor market in the U.S., I just don't see a near-term catalyst. So I think the headwinds and the increased distribution costs will certainly be with us into 2022 and we'll have to see all of this plays out. It's not just affecting us, of course, it's affecting companies quite broadly and we're all dealing with these challenges.
And then, Mike, on category and share, I'll turn that one over to you."

And so overall, we feel very good about that and the category growth, actually in both channels. And I think our brands are performing well. 
The issue that we've had on share, a couple of different areas. In North America, it's primarily been an issue around supply. And so even though we've made substantial improvement and our fulfillment throughout the course of the year, we're still not meeting all orders out there. And so our share is still a little light from that dimension. And then in a couple of other markets, again, I think it is, as you point out, maybe some relative price indices that have expanded a little bit in the short term.
We've moved on pricing in most markets. And while we've generally seen moves from branded competition. We haven't seen that in all markets. And so there's still a little softness we're experiencing in Western Europe and in some markets in Latin America."
