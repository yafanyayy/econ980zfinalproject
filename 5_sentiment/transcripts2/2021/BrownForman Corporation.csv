I would like to thank each of you for joining us today for Brown-Forman's Third Quarter Fiscal 2021 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Lawson Whiting, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jane Morreau, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. 
This morning's conference call contains forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Numerous risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or projected in these statements. Many of the factors that will determine future results are beyond the company's ability to control or predict. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, and the company undertakes no obligation to update any of these statements, whether due to new information, future events or otherwise. 
This morning, we issued a press release containing our results for the third quarter of fiscal 2021, in addition to posting presentation materials that Lawson and Jane will walk through momentarily. Both the release and the presentation can be found on our website under the section titled Investors, Events and Presentations. In the press release, we have listed a number of risk factors that you should consider in conjunction with our forward-looking statements. Other significant risk factors are described in our Form 10-K and Form 10-Q reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures are consistent to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the reasons management believes they provide useful information to investors regarding the company's financial conditions and result of operations are contained in the press release and investor presentation. 
Before we transition directly to our third quarter fiscal 2021 results, we have 2 very special guests with us today. As you may recall, on January 27 of this year, we announced a change in our Board of Directors Chair. Here to speak about this upcoming transition is George Garvin Brown IV, current Brown-Forman Board Chair; and Campbell Brown, Brown-Forman Board member and incoming Board Chair, both great, great grandsons of the company's founder. 
Garvin, I would now like to turn the call over to you."
256839,704557649,2229342,"Brown-Forman Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Mar 03, 2021",2021-03-03,"Earnings Calls","Brown-Forman Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Leanne, and good morning. I'm delighted to join you today in the almost 14 years that I've chaired our Board, this is just the second time speaking on one of these quarterly calls. The first time was when the Board and Paul Varga announced Paul",694,"Thank you, Leanne, and good morning. I'm delighted to join you today in the almost 14 years that I've chaired our Board, this is just the second time speaking on one of these quarterly calls. The first time was when the Board and Paul Varga announced Paul's succession plan in 2018 when we welcomed Lawson Whiting in as our next CEO. Like then, I'm here today to discuss succession planning to elaborate on the exciting news that the Board nigh announced on January 27, my intention to retire from the Board this July and the Board's intention to elect Campbell Brown as our next Chair of the Board of Directors, a fellow member of the fifth generation of the Brown family and a 27-year veteran of Brown-Forman Corporation. 
Knowing that succession planning is among the most critical work any Board can perform, I thought it would be appropriate to discuss the news as we did for Lawson. The Board's succession planning work is led principally by our Governance and Nominating Committee, chaired by our Lead Independent Director, John D. Cook, Director Emeritus of McKinsey & Company. The Board and I have been working on what we call continuous long-term succession planning since I joined Paul on the Board in 2006 and became Chair in 2007 almost 14 years ago. In the case of my own role, I always felt that having Lawson Whiting firmly in place as our CEO, combined with our lead independent director in his role, would be a good time to move on Chair succession planning as those 2 individuals lend so much stability to our governance system. 
In parallel to this Board work, the company and the Brown family have been building out a system of Brown family shareholder engagement and governance for more than a dozen years, building upon the work that the generation before us started in the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s. Some of you may have heard me describe these efforts at the investor conferences that we've held over the years in New York. From the Board's point of view, the governance work that the Brown family has done has allowed the Board to interact with and know personally the company's long-term shareholders. As a result, the Board has been able to understand the capacity, capabilities and interests of family members with regards to potential roles in our governance system. This interaction has been critical to enabling the Board to make thorough and informed decisions on long-term succession plans such as this one. 
The press release we issued points to Campbell's experience at Brown-Forman. His early years helping the globalization of our business in emerging markets, his breadth of experience running regions and brands in our home market, including relationships built with the U.S. distributor network and his leadership of the renaissance of our founding brand, Old Forester. The press release was more silent, however, on Campbell's experience building our family governance system. Since making his home in Louisville, Kentucky, in 2001, Campbell has been a founding member and/or leader in all of our family governance initiatives. Coupled with leadership roles that he has taken on at Louisville in our community, the Board believes that this combination of experiences with the company, family and in the community, make Campbell uncommonly well prepared, ready to take on this role. The Board also believes that having this sort of leader ready to partner with our CEO, Lawson Whiting, and the Board on its long-term agenda is, in fact, another example of how being a family-controlled company is a competitive advantage for Brown-Forman in the marketplace. 
And so in Campbell, I have no doubt that you'll find a Brown family leader, who will continue to build upon and strengthen the scaffolding of relationships between the company, the public and our long-term family shareholders and industry partners that have made and will continue to make Brown-Forman a high-performing independent world-class brand building company headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, worthy of your consideration as a prospective long-term investment. I do look forward to making some remarks at the annual stockholders' meeting this summer. But for now, I'll hand it over to Campbell."

I first worked at Brown-Forman in the summer of 1987, 33 years ago. I was 19 and I was working in our mail room. Since then, I've had the pleasure and honor to work alongside colleagues at the company in a number of roles and regions based at different times in India, the Philippines, Turkey, Maryland and of course, here in Louisville, Kentucky. As Garvin mentioned, in addition to the various operational roles I've been a part of over my 27 years here, I've also enjoyed working with members of my family and other leaders within BF on our evolving governance initiatives, really since they were more formally kicked off for my fifth generation in the year 2000. 
And so as you could well imagine, I couldn't be more honored to take on this new responsibility for the company as we prepare to welcome our 151st year of operation. As you would have heard us say before, we believe that beverage alcohol brands and in particular, aged spirit whiskey brands performed well in the hands of multigenerational stewards. My own time leading the renaissance of our founding brand, Old Forester, I've seen firsthand the success that we can realize when we pull all of the value drivers of our industry together, in the right way with the right people, at the right time. 
I can assure you that I view the responsibilities that our Board has with the company, the community and our shareholders in much the same way. We understand our responsibilities to you, our public partners in the same way we do our brands, namely, long-term sustainable growth achieved responsibly over generational time lines. I look forward to meeting you in due time when we can all get together and convene again, I certainly plan to attend future investor conferences. But for now, I'll hand it over to Lawson to walk us through the Q3 results."

I hope that Garvin and Campbell's remarks are a reminder of our long-term perspective in how we approach our business. I really do want to thank Garvin for being an invaluable partner to me for 20-plus years.

So Garvin, thank you for everything you've done to set this company up for success. And Campbell, I look forward to partnering with you in order to deliver many more years of continued growth. 
So with that, I'll talk now a little bit more about our third quarter results. During this past quarter, we closed out Brown-Forman's 150th anniversary year and said goodbye to 2020. And while calendar 2021 has not ended the pandemic and has certainly not reopened all the bars and restaurants and nor has it enabled people to travel freely again, we have found ways to leverage our strengths and to find a way to deliver solid results in this challenging environment. So as I turn to our third quarter and year-to-date fiscal '21 results, I want to share my thoughts on why I believe we're operating from a position of strength. 
As you can imagine, many of the favorable trends that I talked about in our calls earlier this fiscal year remain relevant. First, spirits performance continues to be very strong and to take share from both wine and beer. This category also offers attractive growth, healthy margins and high returns on capital, and we remain confident that we're in the right categories. American whiskey and tequila continue to grow and take share, and these 2 categories, which also include our RTD business, represent the majority of our sales and profits and are driving our performance. We also remain confident that we're focused in the right priced segments, super premium brands continue to experience strong growth relative to the lower priced segments, and we believe that super premium price point will continue to grow very nicely even in the post-pandemic period. 
Another area of strength has really been our RTD business, benefiting from the convenience trend, the RTD category has been exploding in many parts of the world. We continue to see strong growth from our Jack Daniel's spirit based RTDs in markets like Australia and Germany, and while in its first year, we're pleased with the performance of our spirit based RTDs in the U.S. Our tequila based RTD, New Mix, which crossed 8 million cases in Mexico this year, continues to deliver good results. But the strongest performance has come from our Jack Daniel's Country Cocktails here in the U.S., which has more than doubled in size over the past year. We introduced Jack Daniel's Country Cocktails over 25 years ago and the brand has brought many new consumers into the Jack Daniel's family. 
And so with that ready-to-drink category booming, we felt the time was right to capitalize on this opportunity. So as we announced back in December, we'll be partnering with Pabst Brewing Company for the supply, sales and distribution of Jack Daniel's Country Cocktails within the U.S. and domestic military. This partnership provides tremendous growth potential for the brand with greater access to can production and variety pack capabilities, which are driving the industry. Furthermore, with Pabst distribution network, Jack Daniel's Country Cocktails will gain much more efficient access to new distribution channels. And with Pabst focused on Jack Daniel's Country Cocktails, our core domestic distributor partners can place even more focus on our premium and super premium spirits portfolio. Jane will talk more about our brand and geography performance in greater detail here in a minute, but I did want to share a little bit on the performance of the Jack Daniel's Family of Brands. 
Year-to-date, the Jack Daniel's family brand's underlying performance has remained strong. We are benefiting from the convenience trend that I just mentioned, but also from increased interest and mixability. While mixability has been a powerful part of our story for a long time, obviously, with Jack and Coke, our Jack Daniel's Flavors portfolio is now providing consumers with ease in making flavorful yet simple cocktails. Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey crossed 2 million cases in the third quarter, with more than half its volume outside of the United States, and we're encouraged by the initial performance of Tennessee Apple as we continue its global rollout. 
With respect to JD TW, which is the core black label, this has been a tough year, but we believe any disruptions really are circumstantial and temporary. One data point that I found interesting was, at least according to IWSR, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey is the second largest on-premise brand in the entire spirits world by volume. This business has obviously fallen off quite sharply in this environment, but we do see light at the end of the tunnel, and we are all looking forward to the reopening of the bars and restaurants around the world. 
Last point, and then I'll hand it over to Jane. I'm cautiously optimistic that the U.K. and EU tariffs on American whiskey will be resolved. But it goes without saying that BF has been hurt and unduly impacted by this trade war with Europe. A couple of points that I think you may find interesting. The latest Eurostat data shows that about 25% of the entirety of the U.K. and EU tariffs leveled against the U.S. have been borne by the American whiskey category. And so based on IWSR, we know we're about 2/3 of the American whiskey category exports to the U.K. and EU. So do the math, we estimate that we alone, so Brown-Forman, Louisville, Kentucky based company has borne roughly 15% of the entire tariff build that's been leveled against the U.S. It's just a terrible situation, and it's imperative that we get it resolved. And get it resolved as soon as possible. 
So in summary, while uncertainty and volatility remain, I'm confident that our well positioned portfolio, the resilience of our people and the agility of the company will enable us to continue moving forward from a position of strength. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jane, who will walk us through our third quarter and year-to-date financial results."
256839,704557649,2229342,"Brown-Forman Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Mar 03, 2021",2021-03-03,"Earnings Calls","Brown-Forman Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Lawson, and good morning, everyone. As Lawson said, we have experienced plenty of challenges this year. But because of our people and our brands, we delivered solid results for the first 9 months of fiscal 2021, with both underlying net sales a",1463,"Thank you, Lawson, and good morning, everyone. As Lawson said, we have experienced plenty of challenges this year. But because of our people and our brands, we delivered solid results for the first 9 months of fiscal 2021, with both underlying net sales and operating income up relative to the same period last year. 
As expected, in the third quarter, we experienced a slowdown in our top line growth, reflecting the lapping of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple launch in the U.S. and the renewed lockdowns and restrictions, particularly across Europe related to COVID-19. Also, as planned, our high operating expense leverage in the first half began to reverse in the third quarter, reflecting a notable increase in our A&P investments behind our brands. 
With that as a backdrop, let's begin by reviewing our year-to-date performance. Starting with our top line. Compared to the first 9 months last year, our reported net sales were flat, reflecting a decrease in distributor inventory levels, primarily in the United States that were built in response to the supply chain uncertainty during the early days of the pandemic. Adjusting for this factor, our underlying net sales grew 2%. As we look broadly across our geographic clusters, we experienced underlying net sales growth in each. Developed markets continue to grow, while emerging markets return to growth. However, underlying net sales in the travel retail channel remained down significantly. 
Starting with our U.S. business, which represents approximately half of our net sales, underlying net sales grew high single digits despite cycling last year's launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple, which slowed growth approximately 2 points. This strong growth was driven largely by several of our premium whiskey brands, notably the Woodford Reserve Family of Brands, Old Forester and Gentleman Jack, as well as Jack Daniel's Country Cocktails or Tequilas and Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey. We continue to experience very strong growth in the off-premise, which is more than offsetting the on-premise volumetric weakness. Additionally, while still a small percentage of our off-premise sales, our portfolio's explosive growth in the e-commerce channel has continued to expand at triple-digit rates. 
E-commerce for beverage alcohol was a fast-growing trend pre-COVID and has significantly accelerated during covet. We believe consumers have become comfortable purchasing products through this channel, which will enable continued strong channel growth in a post-COVID environment. We believe we are well positioned for the shift to e-premise and are continuing to increase our investments and advance our efforts in this channel. As Lawson mentioned, we believe our portfolio remains well positioned in growing categories and is meeting the consumers' need for at-home consumption convenience, ease of mixability and great-tasting cocktails. And as evidenced by the performance of our super premium portfolio, premiumization remains a trend as consumers continue to treat themselves to everyday luxuries, such as Woodford Reserve Double Oak and the Old Forester Craft Series. 
Our developed international markets experienced a slowdown in net sales trends in Q3, reflecting the restrictions and lockdowns in Europe during the important holiday selling season. Despite these challenges as well as declines throughout the fiscal year in countries that are heavily weighted toward tourism and the on-premise like Czechia and Spain, our developed international markets collectively delivered strong underlying net sales growth, up high single digits year-to-date. The key drivers of this growth have been the strong performance of RTDs, particularly in Australia and Germany and the launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple. 
Based on off-premise takeaway data in the major markets of Australia, the U.K., Germany and France, each are growing double digits and gaining value share relative to TDS. Collectively, our emerging markets underlying net sales returned to growth, growing modestly in the year-to-date period, but the story is mixed. The growth was driven by our New Mix RTD business in Mexico as well as gains in Brazil, Poland and China. We continue to experience a decline in a number of other emerging markets, including parts of Southeast Asia, India and several countries in Latin America. Excluding our New Mix business, Mexico is experiencing considerable decline reflecting evidence of consumer trade down. 
Finally, our travel retail business remained under pressure. Despite registering slight improvement in the third quarter, driven by our military channel, our travel retail business has shown little improvement to date, with underlying net sales declining significantly. 
Turning to our largest brand. Underlying net sales for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey remained down high single digits, consistent with the results through our first half. The brand's performance continues to be impacted by the shift from the on-premise to the off-premise consumption, including considering its overall concentration in the on-premise, the essential halting of travel retail and the trading down experienced in many emerging markets. Importantly, based on the brand's key consumer metrics, we believe Jack Daniel remains healthy and is gaining share in the majority of its top 10 markets. 
Now turning to our gross margin, which declined 280 basis points to date and resulted in our underlying gross profit declining 1%. Higher input costs related to agave and wood as well as a reduction in fixed cost absorption due to lower Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey volumes represented nearly 3/4 of our gross margin decline. Channel and portfolio shifts basically drove the remainder of the gross margin drop. 
Moving to brand expense. As discussed last quarter, we began to increase our investments, most notably, behind our new Jack Daniel's Make It Count global campaign that launched in October. These investments continued throughout the third quarter. And while A&P is still down year-to-date, our investments grew double digits for the quarter. Our underlying SG&A investment will remain down year-to-date, reflecting the continuation of tight management of discretionary spending, including travel, and hiring. In the aggregate, we grew underlying operating income 3% year-to-date and reported even stronger. This, combined with a reduction in our effective tax rate, help power the 12% diluted EPS growth to $1.63 per share through the first 9 months of the fiscal year. 
And finally, to our fiscal 2021 outlook. As we look ahead, we continue to believe we are operating from a position of strength. Despite the high level of uncertainty that exists, particularly around the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine and the eventual easing of restrictions and the government financial stimulus policies in a number of countries and the potential effect on the global economy and consumer spending. As a result of this uncertainty and low visibility of the timing of recovery in various markets and channels, we are not providing quantitative guidance for fiscal 2021. However, we are optimistic as we look to our fourth quarter, where we begin to cycle the initial impact of COVID-19 and are seeing improving levels of consumer confidence in many markets around the world. Beyond this fiscal year, we expect the challenging operating environment to continue to improve, particularly as the on-premise and countries heavily reliant on tourism began to recover. 
From a qualitative perspective, while we expect continued volatility in our developed markets, we remain confident in the resilience and strong growth that these markets have collectively exhibited to remain for the full year. We do not expect certain developed markets like Spain and Czechia, many of our emerging markets, the travel retail channel, are our used barrel sales to recover this fiscal year. Our gross margin will remain down for the year, driven by higher input costs and mix shifts. Looking beyond this year into the next couple of years, we are expecting margins to improve nicely, driven by a number of productivity related initiatives underway and the benefit of lower agave costs. 
Regarding operating investments, advertising and SG&A, we expect to continue to invest behind our brands, resulting in a significant acceleration, most notably in advertising in the fourth quarter as we invest behind areas where the business is showing strong momentum, coupled with cycling against last year's significant decline in spend during the early weeks of COVID-19. Our full year effective tax rate outlook is unchanged at 17% to 19%. Our balance sheet remains strong and our continued capacity to generate strong operating cash flows is sound. Consistent with our long-held capital allocation philosophy, we continue to invest behind our business fully pay increasing dividends and look for opportunities to acquire great brands such as part-time rangers RTDS. 
In summary, while the past year has been like no other, presenting many challenges, we believe our results today are strong and reflective of our ability to leverage our strength in this environment. We are optimistic as we look ahead beyond this fiscal year, where we expect our medium-term growth rates to accelerate toward our long-term expirations. 
With that, this concludes our prepared remarks.  Lawson and I will now take your questions. Operator, you may open the line."

And so looking ahead, something Campbell is very involved in, in the community, I think he referenced that a little bit.

Again, just a reminder, when we were on our second quarter call, we said, and I want to reiterate it, that where we were in our second quarter, the margins, which were [ at 59% ], we said that's the bottom.

From here on, it's going up from there. And I think you saw some improvement in our third quarter. We were down 150 basis points from last year, so you did see some improvement. 
As it relates to your specificity of the question, yes, we do have a number of initiatives underway, as I alluded to, that will improve our margins over the next few years. But as it relates to agave alone, we've been pretty consistent on this response as we look at the CRT plantings back in '15 and '16, we can see the acceleration in plantings that occurred that will then become available in the back half of next year, maybe a little bit earlier next year being our fiscal 2022. So later this calendar year, I think it may actually happen a little earlier because we've seen some stability in the agave prices. 
But more importantly, one thing we've not talked about before as it relates to agave, and while we're confident that we'll start seeing benefits in our F '22 beyond the market price, is that a few years ago, we changed our strategy of how much we were going to cultivate ourselves, how much we were going to own, how much we were going to be exposed to on the market. And so we have, starting next year, a higher mix of our business that we'll be cultivating from the agave plants coming through our own business, which is much less than what you could buy in the market. And so we'll start seeing that benefit next year. We believe we'll continue to see benefits from the exposure both to the external market and to our own internal mix of our products next year, following a year and a little bit more the following year after that.

So they're actually, in this period, growing faster and obviously, the developing markets and travel retail growing slower. I guess my question is, we're kind of thinking about getting back to Brown-Forman's medium-term and long-term growth rate, are the developed international and U.S. markets, would you expect them to accelerate off of this? So has there been some structural change with regard to like the growth of ready to drink, market share gains? Could those markets specifically grow faster than they had pre-COVID? Or are we really looking at those kind of reverting, back maybe to the mean and getting the kind of the growth back and emerging in travel retail? Just trying to understand kind of the moving parts within that. And again, not necessarily thinking about it for '21, but just over the medium term, just how we should think about those pieces?"

Developed international, maybe 1 point or 2 higher than that. And then our emerging markets, which, like everyone has said, been more volatile, but had been several points above that in the prior few years. Come fiscal '21, as we said, the U.S. business has picked up. The market is interesting. We did a bit of a study on which markets -- you can see which markets are growing really nicely this year. And you've had your Australia and Germany and even in the U.S. and some of these really big markets that have done really, really well, influenced somewhat by what Jane said in her earlier comments, the stimulus -- the markets that had fiscal stimulus from their governments have done remarkably well. And it's been a big benefit to that and those that didn't. So Southeast Asia and the India and Africa. And generally, a lot of the emerging markets didn't, and they fell off quite a bit. 
Now looking into the future a little bit, does the algorithm change a little bit? I think our portfolio is well positioned, and I think it's important that, say, the Woodfords of the world and Herraduras of the word, brands like that, that are in very hot categories, have just simply gotten bigger. And so that will have a more impactful impact on our results going forward. So that helps a little bit, I do think. And then the RTD business has been on fire now. It's not going to stay at the rates that it is right now. Country cocktails has doubled. So that's going to slow down a little bit. But I think it will be picked up by the emerging markets, which we expect, I mean, the comps in the next couple -- at least in the next year, are going to be easy. So we expect some better growth out of there. So I do think there'll be a bit of a reversion to the mean. But longer term, I think we've got our portfolio well positioned to do maybe 1 point or 2 better than we've done historically. We'll see."

I mean, I think you would -- as you probably expect to be kind of a typical Brown-Forman thing.

But let me step back for a second, explain our tequila business relative to some of our competitors. The first big thing, especially if you're looking at our earnings release, and you're looking at the revenue number in the exhibit, and it's pretty underwhelming. A lot of that is because we have a very big business in Mexico itself. The competitive brands that you're looking at for the most part, do not. They don't even exist in Mexico. So we have been dragged down -- I mean, our global number has been dragged down by the Mexican market, where, as I say, we're large, not only in the tequilas, but even Jack Daniel's has a pretty substantial business down there, and it's been very weak. It's one of the emerging markets that has struggled. 
So -- but our U.S. business, turning to that for a second, I mean Herradura is our ultra-premium brand that competes with the large competitors who had admittedly fantastic results and what we have seen, too. Two things on that. Herradura, one, has a very heavy on-premise presence. Somewhere 40-plus-percent of its business is in the on-premise, and that has been tough, which would also be a drag on the overall number. But our Nielsen numbers, I just saw recently, the ones that came out, I think, over the last few days, we're growing at plus 64% in Nielsen. So that's -- while that would lag some of the bigger competitors, not by a lot. So I feel really good about Herradura and its positioning. It's got a long runway to go. It's still not -- I mean, it doesn't even have distribution in large chunks of the United States. And so we will continue to invest behind that, and we will continue to push pretty hard. I think that is one of the brands that we really see as sort of one of the gems of the future."

Our Mexico business is a fairly sizable business. And unfortunately, this year is tough. We've seen a lot of trading down in that market, particularly on the Herradura brand, the ultra brand that was moving so fast and growing so rapidly before now and shifted so much that if you were to split our numbers a part that you saw on the table, the Mexico business is down 30-ish percent on a strip net sales basis. If you look at our U.S. business, it's up almost 20% on a strip net sales basis. So that's why you're also seeing, as Lawson said, the underwhelming numbers. And it's gotten such that now our U.S. business is going to -- is suppressing the [indiscernible] of the Mexico business, which will bode well for the future as you get this type of growth and we see these growth coming on. 
Herradura itself, as Lawson gave you throughout the numbers from the latest Nielsen, relative to the price point that Herradura plays in, it is gaining share. That price point category is going around 40%, so it is. Where you see the real acceleration in the tequila growth is above that price point, more the ultra price point. And so we're going to be playing some things there, too. We've got a wonderful brand that we've launched recently from Herradura called Herradura Legends, very ultra-ultra-premium but we think it's got lots of legs. And people are, again, indulging in these everyday luxuries. And Ultra is a product that we introduced in Mexico a few years ago, really introduced it in the U.S. and again, these are higher price points. That's where you see the real accelerated growth. And we've got a new campaign that we're launching in April. And we're really excited about that from energy BBDO. So there are some things that we're looking at as we go ahead to continue to accelerate it. But both of our brands are doing well in the U.S. in the price points they play in."

But just the -- we knew this year was going to be a crazy looking year on phasing. And just to remind you, it actually started last year in the fourth quarter, in the last 6 weeks of the fiscal year. So when COVID hit in the middle of March through all of April, when we cut a shutdown -- on-premise were shut down and then sponsorships, all those things went away. We knew early on, we saw our first quarter was an unusual quarter. We really didn't start spending until the second quarter, and that was purposeful, not only because of the consumer and its readiness to hear what we were saying, but also because we had a new agency partner, Energy BBDO, in which we launched our Make It Count campaign toward the end of October. 
So what you're seeing in the third quarter, we had -- we've been talking about all year long. So some of this is situation on a circumstantial relative to what was going on in COVID, some of it is because we planned it this way. But as you look to the balance of the year, I think I said this in our remarks, we look to the fourth quarter, we're going to continue to see an acceleration in the rate of growth. So our year-over-year rate of growth, because of the decline last year, plus just the way we spent this year, is going to be up even more on a percentage basis than it was in the third quarter. 
If you're thinking ahead to how you would -- how you should expect us to spend, it's going to be choppy next year because you're going to get the flip of that, but let's just talk big picture.

And I'll back up for a second, go back like 2 or 3 years, probably 2 years ago. Well before COVID even came around, we were making changes to our resource allocation models to significantly upweight media and just general consumer touch spends and downplay some of the events places that were lower touch, even on-premise, things like that. And so that had begun that mix of spend change had begun before COVID hit. Then it hits everyone, including Brown-Forman, what the entire industry, drops their on-premise spend, drops their event spending, drops lots of that kind of stuff and starts going back at media again. So in a way, it has accelerated our path to get there. But in another way, which I hadn't processed, if I'm honest, until a few months ago because we were looking at share of voice and share of different ways of spending, and basically, everybody is doing that. And so the media spend has increased significantly in our industry, but it's still the right thing to do. And I think longer term, we like the rebalance of how we're spending the money.

You'll start to probably start seeing some mix differences coming through on our balance sheet. Hopefully, as the year come on, where you'll start to see that cost offsetting some of the volumetric trends, which if you look at our balance sheet over the last several years, you'll have seen barrel of whiskey go up quite a bit, but that's been a combination of this cost, this wood cost that's coming through our P&L now that we've been talking about last year and this year.

It's always been a consumer recruitment vehicle, and that's the way we thought about it, I would say, even for a couple of decades as we built that brand and sort of the can in the hand and all that. It has now grown into much more than that and to be certainly a profit driver. The country cocktails partnership, we call it that with Pabst now, we do expect to continue to keep that growth rate going for lots of reasons, the most obvious one being they have touch points in many channels, including convenience that we just weren't getting with the spirit wholesalers for the most part. And so the number of distribution points will go up substantially. And so we think we can keep that run going. 
But the RTD business is much more -- much, much larger outside of the U.S. than it is inside the U.S., it's like 3.5x the size in the international markets than it is in the U.S. And that, that's a lot of Germany.

Australia has been the largest RTD market in the world -- well, one of the largest in the world for quite some time, and that business is really strong. So yes, I think that's here to stay. I do think it's been boosted by COVID. I mean -- but the macro trends of convenience and flavor fit very well into the RTD business. And so this is something that's here to stay, and we'll just have to -- it's hard to see what the growth rates are going to be when you get beyond COVID, but we certainly expect them to still be strong. 
And you asked a question about margin? Yes."

I mean the margin for us this year has been very immaterial, I would say, [ a couple tens of a point ] as it relates to the RTD business. Some of that was outsized in the first quarter because of our New Mix business, which benefited from the beer shutdowns. And I think we said this on the first quarter call and second quarter call too as well that we are fine with that right now, [ 1/10 or 2 ], particularly in this environment, we want to be where the consumer is. 
We also noted it's something we've talked about many, many times in the past and fretted over, but if you actually put this on a drink equivalent basis, it's actually more -- better margin than our full strength. And so there's different ways to look at it. But right now, it's all about meeting the consumer needs, the convenience, providing them with great-tasting cost goes, I think the opportunity exists going forward, but I don't see it as a big margin drag. It hasn't been year-to-date really either."

Now with respect to RTDs, the reference a little bit to seltzer there. The RTD category, for as long as we've been in it, has been heavily reliant on innovation. Australia would be the best example of that. And every year, they come up with something new and different pack sizes and prove some flavors and mix of all the rest of it. And so we've been doing that for quite a long time, and that will continue. So the RTD space in terms of do we have the know-how, do we have the supply chain, do we have the abilities to sort of forecast where the consumer is going in that space, I would rate us high on that. 
As far as you referenced Fire and Apple and Honey, that pace is not changing. I mean, we've been -- we've done 3 in 10 years and really just obviously started Apple a year ago or a little more. So that pace will not change. So I would not expect us to do another big Jack Daniel's Flavor in the near future, at least. We want to be very measured on that. They're big campaigns, they're big launches. They take a couple of years to execute. And so I don't expect that -- I would not expect that the pace on that will be any different than it's been."

This morning's conference call contains forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Numerous risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or projected in these statements. Many of the factors that will determine future results are beyond the company's ability to control or predict. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, and the company undertakes no obligation to update any of these statements, whether due to new information, future events or otherwise.  
This morning, we issued a press release containing our results for the third quarter of fiscal 2021, in addition to posting presentation materials that Lawson and Jane will walk through momentarily. Both the release and the presentation can be found on our website under the section titled Investors, Events and Presentations. In the press release, we have listed a number of risk factors that you should consider in conjunction with our forward-looking statements. Other significant risk factors are described in our Form 10-K and Form 10-Q reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  
During this call, we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. These measures, a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and the reasons management believes they provide useful information to investors regarding the company's financial conditions and result of operations are contained in the press release and investor presentation.  
Before we transition directly to our third quarter fiscal 2021 results, we have 2 very special guests with us today. As you may recall, on January 27 of this year, we announced a change in our Board of Directors Chair. Here to speak about this upcoming transition is George Garvin Brown IV, current Brown-Forman Board Chair; and Campbell Brown, Brown-Forman Board member and incoming Board Chair, both great, great grandsons of the company's founder.  
Garvin, I would now like to turn the call over to you."

I'm delighted to join you today. In the almost 14 years that I've chaired our Board, this is just the second time speaking on one of these quarterly calls. The first time was when the Board and Paul Varga announced Pau",695,"Thank you, Leanne, and good morning. I'm delighted to join you today. In the almost 14 years that I've chaired our Board, this is just the second time speaking on one of these quarterly calls. The first time was when the Board and Paul Varga announced Paul's succession plan in 2018 when we welcomed Lawson Whiting in as our next CEO. Like then, I'm here today to discuss succession planning to elaborate on the exciting news that the Board and I announced on January 27, my intention to retire from the Board this July and the Board's intention to elect Campbell Brown as our next Chair of the Board of Directors, a fellow member of the fifth generation of the Brown family and a 27-year veteran of Brown-Forman Corporation.  
Knowing that succession planning is among the most critical work any Board can perform, I thought it would be appropriate to discuss the news as we did for Lawson. The Board's succession planning work is led principally by our Governance and Nominating Committee, chaired by our Lead Independent Director, John D. Cook, Director Emeritus of McKinsey & Company. The Board and I have been working on what we call continuous long-term succession planning since I joined Paul on the Board in 2006 and became Chair in 2007, almost 14 years ago. In the case of my own role, I always felt that having Lawson Whiting firmly in place as our CEO combined with our lead independent director in his role would be a good time to move on Chair succession planning as those 2 individuals lend so much stability to our governance system.  
In parallel to this Board work, the company and the Brown family have been building out a system of Brown family shareholder engagement and governance for more than a dozen years, building upon the work that the generation before us started in the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s. Some of you may have heard me describe these efforts at the investor conferences that we've held over the years in New York. From the Board's point of view, the governance work that the Brown family has done has allowed the Board to interact with and know personally the company's long-term shareholders. As a result, the Board has been able to understand the capacity, capabilities and interests of family members with regards to potential roles in our governance system. This interaction has been critical to enabling the Board to make thorough and informed decisions on long-term succession plans such as this one.
The press release we issued points to Campbell's experience at Brown-Forman. His early years helping the globalization of our business in emerging markets, his breadth of experience running regions and brands in our home market, including relationships built with the U.S. distributor network and his leadership of the renaissance of our founding brand, Old Forester. The press release was more silent, however, on Campbell's experience building our family governance system. Since making his home in Louisville, Kentucky in 2001, Campbell has been a founding member and/or leader in all of our family governance initiatives. Coupled with leadership roles that he has taken on at Louisville in our community, the Board believes that this combination of experiences with the company, family and in the community make Campbell uncommonly well prepared, ready to take on this role. The Board also believes that having this sort of leader ready to partner with our CEO, Lawson Whiting, and the Board on its long-term agenda is, in fact, another example of how being a family-controlled company is a competitive advantage for Brown-Forman in the marketplace.  
And so in Campbell, I have no doubt that you'll find a Brown family leader, who will continue to build upon and strengthen the scaffolding of relationships between the company, the public and our long-term family shareholders and industry partners that have made and will continue to make Brown-Forman a high-performing, independent, world-class brand building company headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky, worthy of your consideration as a prospective long-term investment. I do look forward to making some remarks at the annual stockholders' meeting this summer. But for now, I'll hand it over to Campbell."

I first worked at Brown-Forman in the summer of 1987, 33 years ago. I was 19 and I was working in our mail room. Since then, I've had the pleasure and honor to work alongside colleagues at the company in a number of roles and regions based at different times in India, the Philippines, Turkey, Maryland and of course, here in Louisville, Kentucky. As Garvin mentioned, in addition to the various operational roles I've been a part of over my 27 years here, I've also enjoyed working with members of my family and other leaders within BF on our evolving governance initiatives, really since they were more formally kicked off for my fifth generation in the year 2000.  
And so as you could well imagine, I couldn't be more honored to take on this new responsibility for the company as we prepare to welcome our 151st year of operation. As you would have heard us say before, we believe that beverage alcohol brands and, in particular, aged spirit whiskey brands performed well in the hands of multigenerational stewards. My own time leading the renaissance of our founding brand, Old Forester, I've seen firsthand the success that we can realize when we pull all of the value drivers of our industry together in the right way, with the right people, at the right time. 
I can assure you that I view the responsibilities that our Board has with the company, the community and our shareholders in much the same way. We understand our responsibilities to you, our public partners, in the same way we do our brands, namely, long-term sustainable growth achieved responsibly over generational time lines. I look forward to meeting you in due time, when we can all get together and convene again. I certainly plan to attend future investor conferences. But for now, I'll hand it over to Lawson to walk us through the Q3 results."

I hope that Garvin and Campbell's remarks are a reminder of our long-term perspective in how we approach our business.

So Garvin, thank you for everything you've done to set this company up for success. And Campbell, I look forward to partnering with you in order to deliver many more years of continued growth.  
So with that, I'll talk now a little bit more about our third quarter results. During this past quarter, we closed out Brown-Forman's 150th anniversary year and said goodbye to 2020. And while calendar 2021 has not ended the pandemic and has certainly not reopened all the bars and restaurants and nor has it enabled people to travel freely again, we have found ways to leverage our strengths and to find a way to deliver solid results in this challenging environment. So as I turn to our third quarter and year-to-date fiscal '21 results, I want to share my thoughts on why I believe we're operating from a position of strength.  
As you can imagine, many of the favorable trends that I talked about in our calls earlier this fiscal year remain relevant. First, spirits performance continues to be very strong and to take share from both wine and beer. This category also offers attractive growth, healthy margins and high returns on capital, and we remain confident that we're in the right categories. American whiskey and tequila continue to grow and take share in these 2 categories, which also include our RTD business, represent the majority of our sales and profits and are driving our performance. We also remain confident that we're focused in the right priced segments, super-premium brands continue to experience strong growth relative to the lower priced segments, and we believe that super-premium price point will continue to grow very nicely even in the post-pandemic period.  
Another area of strength has really been our RTD business. Benefiting from the convenience trend, the RTD category has been exploding in many parts of the world. We continue to see strong growth from our Jack Daniel's spirit based RTDs in markets like Australia and Germany, and while in its first year, we're pleased with the performance of our spirit based RTDs in the U.S. Our tequila based RTD, New Mix, which crossed 8 million cases in Mexico this year, continues to deliver good results. But the strongest performance has come from our Jack Daniel's Country Cocktails here in the U.S., which has more than doubled in size over the past year. We introduced Jack Daniel's Country Cocktails over 25 years ago and the brand has brought many new consumers into the Jack Daniel's family. 
And so with that ready-to-drink category booming, we felt the time was right to capitalize on this opportunity. So as we announced back in December, we'll be partnering with Pabst Brewing Company for the supply, sales and distribution of Jack Daniel's Country Cocktails within the U.S. and domestic military. This partnership provides tremendous growth potential for the brand with greater access to can production and variety pack capabilities, which are driving the industry. Furthermore, with Pabst distribution network, Jack Daniel's Country Cocktails will gain much more efficient access to new distribution channels. And with Pabst focused on Jack Daniel's Country Cocktails, our core domestic distributor partners can place even more focus on our premium and super-premium spirits portfolio. Jane will talk more about our brand and geography performance in greater detail here in a minute, but I did want to share a little bit on the performance of the Jack Daniel's family of brands.  
Year-to-date, the Jack Daniel's family brand's underlying performance has remained strong. We are benefiting from the convenience trend that I just mentioned, but also from increased interest and mixability. While mixability has been a powerful part of our story for a long time, obviously, with Jack and Coke, our Jack Daniel's flavors portfolio is now providing consumers with ease in making flavorful yet simple cocktails. Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey crossed 2 million cases in the third quarter, with more than half its volume outside of the United States, and we're encouraged by the initial performance of Tennessee Apple as we continue its global rollout.  
With respect to JD TW, which is the core black label, this has been a tough year, but we believe any disruptions really are circumstantial and temporary. One data point that I found interesting was, at least according to IWSR, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey is the second largest on-premise brand in the entire spirits world by volume. This business has obviously fallen off quite sharply in this environment, but we do see light at the end of the tunnel, and we are all looking forward to the reopening of the bars and restaurants around the world.  
Last point, and then I'll hand it over to Jane. I'm cautiously optimistic that the U.K. and EU tariffs on American whiskey will be resolved. But it goes without saying that BF has been hurt and unduly impacted by this trade war with Europe. A couple of points that I think you may find interesting. The latest Eurostat data shows that about 25% of the entirety of the U.K. and EU tariffs leveled against the U.S. have been borne by the American whiskey category. And so based on IWSR, we know we're about 2/3 of the American whiskey category exports to the U.K. and EU. So do the math. We estimate that we alone, so Brown-Forman, Louisville, Kentucky based company has borne roughly 15% of the entire tariff build that's been leveled against the U.S. It's just a terrible situation, and it's imperative that we get it resolved. And get it resolved as soon as possible. 
So in summary, while uncertainty and volatility remain, I'm confident that our well-positioned portfolio, the resilience of our people and the agility of the company will enable us to continue moving forward from a position of strength. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jane, who will walk us through our third quarter and year-to-date financial results."

As Lawson said, we have experienced plenty of challenges this year. But because of our people and our brands, we delivered solid results for the first 9 months of fiscal 2021, with both underlying net sales a",1463,"Thank you, Lawson, and good morning, everyone. As Lawson said, we have experienced plenty of challenges this year. But because of our people and our brands, we delivered solid results for the first 9 months of fiscal 2021, with both underlying net sales and operating income up relative to the same period last year.  
As expected, in the third quarter, we experienced a slowdown in our top line growth, reflecting the lapping of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple launch in the U.S. and the renewed lockdowns and restrictions, particularly across Europe related to COVID-19. Also, as planned, our high operating expense leverage in the first half began to reverse in the third quarter, reflecting a notable increase in our A&P investments behind our brands.
With that as a backdrop, let's begin by reviewing our year-to-date performance. Starting with our top line. Compared to the first 9 months last year, our reported net sales were flat, reflecting a decrease in distributor inventory levels, primarily in the United States that were built in response to the supply chain uncertainty during the early days of the pandemic. Adjusting for this factor, our underlying net sales grew 2%. As we look broadly across our geographic clusters, we experienced underlying net sales growth in each. Developed markets continue to grow, while emerging markets return to growth. However, underlying net sales in the Travel Retail channel remained down significantly.  
Starting with our U.S. business, which represents approximately half of our net sales, underlying net sales grew high single digits despite cycling last year's launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple, which slowed growth approximately 2 points. This strong growth was driven largely by several of our premium whiskey brands, notably the Woodford Reserve family of brands, Old Forester and Gentleman Jack, as well as Jack Daniel's Country Cocktails or Tequilas and Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey. We continue to experience very strong growth in the off-premise, which is more than offsetting the on-premise volumetric weakness. Additionally, while still a small percentage of our off-premise sales, our portfolio's explosive growth in the e-commerce channel has continued to expand at triple-digit rates.  
E-commerce for beverage alcohol was a fast-growing trend pre-COVID and has significantly accelerated during COVID. We believe consumers have become comfortable purchasing products through this channel, which will enable continued strong channel growth in a post-COVID environment. We believe we are well positioned for the shift to e-premise and are continuing to increase our investments and advance our efforts in this channel. 
As Lawson mentioned, we believe our portfolio remains well positioned in growing categories and is meeting the consumers' need for at-home consumption convenience, ease of mixability and great-tasting cocktails. And as evidenced by the performance of our super-premium portfolio, premiumization remains a trend as consumers continue to treat themselves to everyday luxuries, such as Woodford Reserve Double Oaked and the Old Forester Craft series. 
Our developed international markets experienced a slowdown in net sales trends in Q3, reflecting the restrictions and lockdowns in Europe during the important holiday selling season. Despite these challenges as well as declines throughout the fiscal year in countries that are heavily weighted toward tourism and the on-premise like Czechia and Spain, our developed international markets collectively delivered strong underlying net sales growth, up high single digits year-to-date. The key drivers of this growth have been the strong performance of RTDs, particularly in Australia and Germany and the launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple.  
Based on off-premise takeaway data in the major markets of Australia, the U.K., Germany and France, each are growing double digits and gaining value share relative to TDS. Collectively, our emerging markets underlying net sales returned to growth, growing modestly in the year-to-date period, but the story is mixed. The growth was driven by our new Mix RTD business in Mexico as well as gains in Brazil, Poland and China. We continue to experience a decline in a number of other emerging markets, including parts of Southeast Asia, India and several countries in Latin America. Excluding our New Mix business, Mexico is experiencing considerable decline reflecting evidence of consumer trade down.  
Finally, our Travel Retail business remained under pressure. Despite registering slight improvement in the third quarter, driven by our military channel, our Travel Retail business has shown little improvement to date, with underlying net sales declining significantly. 
Turning to our largest brand. Underlying net sales for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey remained down high single digits, consistent with the results through our first half. The brand's performance continues to be impacted by the shift from the on-premise to the off-premise consumption, including considering its overall concentration in the on-premise, the essential halting of travel retail and the trading down experienced in many emerging markets. Importantly, based on the brand's key consumer metrics, we believe Jack Daniel remains healthy and is gaining share in the majority of its top 10 markets.  
Now turning to our gross margin, which declined 280 basis points to date and resulted in our underlying gross profit declining 1%. Higher input costs related to agave and wood as well as a reduction in fixed cost absorption due to lower Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey volumes represented nearly 3/4 of our gross margin decline. Channel and portfolio shifts basically drove the remainder of the gross margin drop.  
Moving to brand expense. As discussed last quarter, we began to increase our investments, most notably, behind our new Jack Daniel's Make It Count global campaign that launched in October. These investments continued throughout the third quarter. And while A&P is still down year-to-date, our investments grew double digits for the quarter. Our underlying SG&A investment will remain down year-to-date, reflecting the continuation of tight management of discretionary spending, including travel and hiring. In the aggregate, we grew underlying operating income 3% year-to-date and reported even stronger. This, combined with a reduction in our effective tax rate, help power the 12% diluted EPS growth to $1.63 per share through the first 9 months of the fiscal year.  
And finally, to our fiscal 2021 outlook. As we look ahead, we continue to believe we are operating from a position of strength. Despite the high level of uncertainty that exists, particularly around the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine and the eventual easing of restrictions and the government financial stimulus policies in a number of countries and the potential effect on the global economy and consumer spending. As a result of this uncertainty and low visibility of the timing of recovery in various markets and channels, we are not providing quantitative guidance for fiscal 2021. 
However, we are optimistic as we look to our fourth quarter, where we begin to cycle the initial impact of COVID-19 and are seeing improving levels of consumer confidence in many markets around the world. Beyond this fiscal year, we expect the challenging operating environment to continue to improve, particularly as the on-premise and countries heavily reliant on tourism began to recover.  
From a qualitative perspective, while we expect continued volatility in our developed markets, we remain confident in the resilience and strong growth that these markets have collectively exhibited to remain for the full year. We do not expect certain developed markets like Spain and Czechia, many of our emerging markets, the Travel Retail channel, are our used barrel sales to recover this fiscal year. Our gross margin will remain down for the year, driven by higher input cost and mix shift. Looking beyond this year into the next couple of years, we are expecting margins to improve nicely, driven by a number of productivity related initiatives underway and the benefit of lower agave costs.  
Regarding operating investments, advertising and SG&A, we expect to continue to invest behind our brands, resulting in a significant acceleration, most notably in advertising in the fourth quarter as we invest behind areas where the business is showing strong momentum, coupled with cycling against last year's significant decline in spend during the early weeks of COVID-19. Our full year effective tax rate outlook is unchanged at 17% to 19%. Our balance sheet remains strong, and our continued capacity to generate strong operating cash flows is sound. Consistent with our long-held capital allocation philosophy, we continue to invest behind our business fully, pay increasing dividends and look for opportunities to acquire great brands such as Part Time Rangers RTDs.  
In summary, while the past year has been like no other, presenting many challenges, we believe our results today are strong and reflective of our ability to leverage our strength in this environment. We are optimistic as we look ahead beyond this fiscal year, where we expect our medium-term growth rates to accelerate toward our long-term aspirations.  
With that, this concludes our prepared remarks. Lawson and I will now take your questions. Operator, you may open the line."

Again, just a reminder, when we were on our second quarter call, we said, and I want to reiterate it, that where we were in our second quarter, the margins which were at 59%, we said that's the bottom.

From here on, it's going up from there. And I think you saw some improvement in our third quarter, we were down 150 basis points from last year, so you did see some improvement. 
As it relates to your specificity of the question, yes, we do have a number of initiatives underway, as I alluded to, that will improve our margins over the next few years. But as it relates to agave alone, we've been pretty consistent on this response as we look at the CRT plantings back in '15 and '16, we can see the acceleration in plantings that occurred that will then become available in the back half of next year. Maybe a little bit earlier next year, being our fiscal 2022. So later this calendar year. I think it may actually happen a little earlier because we've seen some stability in the agave prices. 
But more importantly, one thing we've not talked about before as it relates to agave, and while we're confident that we'll start seeing benefits in our F '22 beyond the market price, is that a few years ago, we changed our strategy of how much we were going to cultivate ourselves, how much we were going to own, how much we were going to be exposed to on the market. And so we have, starting next year, a higher mix of our business that we'll be cultivating from the agave plants coming through our own business, which is much less than what you could buy in the market. And so we'll start seeing that benefit next year. We believe we'll continue to see benefits from the exposure both to the external market and to our own internal mix of our products next year, following a year and a little bit more the following year after that. I hope that answers your question."

How should we think about -- the U.S. and developed international year-to-date are both grown a couple of hundred basis points faster than what the run rate was for the last few years. So they're actually, in this period, growing faster and obviously, the developing markets and Travel Retail growing slower. 
I guess my question is, we're kind of thinking about getting back to Brown-Forman's medium-term and long-term growth rate, are the developed international and U.S. markets, would you expect them to accelerate off of this? So has there been some structural change with regard to like the growth of ready-to-drink, market share gains? Could those markets specifically grow faster than they had pre-COVID? Or are we really looking at those kind of reverting, back maybe to the mean and getting the kind of the growth back in emerging and Travel Retail? Just trying to understand kind of the moving parts within that. And again, not necessarily thinking about it for '21, but just over the medium term, just how we should think about those pieces?"

If you back up pre-COVID times, the U.S. business was growing sort of around TDS, and we -- that's been a goal for us for a long time, and that's sort of in that 4%, 5% range. Developed international, maybe 1 point or 2 higher than that. And then our emerging markets, which, like everyone has said, been more volatile, but had been several points above that in the prior few years. 
Come fiscal '21, as we said, with the U.S. business has picked up. The market is we -- essentially, we did a bit of a study on which markets -- you can see which markets are growing really nicely this year. And you've had your Australias and Germanys and even the U.S. and some of these really big markets that have done really, really well, influenced somewhat by what Jane said in her earlier comments. The stimulus -- the markets that had fiscal stimulus from their governments have done remarkably well, and it's been a big benefit to that. And those that didn't, so Southeast Asia and the Indias and Africas. And generally, a lot of the emerging markets didn't, and they fell off quite a bit. 
Now looking into the future a little bit, does the algorithm change a little bit? I think our portfolio is well positioned, and I think it's important that, say, the Woodfords of the world and Herraduras of the word, brands like that, that are in very hot categories, have just simply gotten bigger. And so that will have a more impactful impact on our results going forward. So that helps a little bit, I do think. 
And then the RTD business has been on fire now. It's not going to stay at the rates that it is right now. Country Cocktails has doubled. So that's going to slow down a little bit. But I think it will be picked up by the emerging markets, which we expect, I mean, the comps in the next couple -- at least in the next year, are going to be easy. So we expect some better growth out of there. So I do think there'll be a bit of a reversion to the mean. But longer term, I think we've got our portfolio well positioned to do maybe 1 point or 2 better than we've done historically. We'll see."

But it does feel like there's a little bit of break in the ice between the 2 sides. And we are working as hard as we can to try to affect that and to make them go away. 
Now in terms of what happens when they actually go away, we really have not made that decision yet. And we'll see. I mean I think you would -- as you probably expect to be kind of a typical Brown-Forman thing, we will be reinvesting a pretty nice chunk of that back into the business.

But let me step back for a second, explain our tequila business relative to some of our competitors. The first big thing, especially if you're looking at our earnings release, and you're looking at the revenue number in the exhibit, and it's pretty underwhelming. A lot of that is because we have a very big business in Mexico itself. The competitive brands that you're looking at for the most part, do not. They don't even exist in Mexico. So we have been dragged down. I mean our global number has been dragged down by the Mexican market, where, as I say, we're large, not only in the tequilas, but even Jack Daniel's has a pretty substantial business down there, and it's been very weak. It's one of the emerging markets that has struggled. 
So -- but our U.S. business, turning to that for a second. I mean Herradura is our ultra-premium brand that competes with the large competitors who had admittedly fantastic results and what we have seen, too. Two things on that. Herradura, one, has a very heavy on-premise presence. Somewhere 40-plus-percent of its business is in the on-premise, and that has been tough, which would also be a drag on the overall number. But our Nielsen numbers, I just saw recently, the ones that came out, I think, over the last few days, we're growing at plus 64% in Nielsen. So that's -- while that would lag some of the bigger competitors, not by a lot. So I feel really good about Herradura and its positioning. It's got a long runway to go. It's still not -- I mean it doesn't even have distribution in large chunks of the United States. And so we will continue to invest behind that, and we will continue to push pretty hard. I think that is one of the brands that we really see as sort of one of the gems of the future."

Our Mexico business is a fairly sizable business. And unfortunately, this year is tough. We've seen a lot of trading down in that market, particularly on the Herradura brand, the ultra brand that was moving so fast and growing so rapidly before now. And then shifted so much that if you were to split our numbers a part that you saw on the table, the Mexico business is down 30-ish percent on a strip net sales basis. If you look at our U.S. business, it's up almost 20% on a strip net sales basis. So that's why you're also seeing, as Lawson said, the underwhelming numbers. And it's gotten such that now our U.S. business is going to -- is surpassing the size of the Mexico business, which will bode well for the future as you get this type of growth and we see these growth coming on.
Herradura itself, as Lawson gave you throughout the numbers from the latest Nielsen, relative to the price point that Herradura plays in, it is gaining share. That price point category is going around 40-ish percent, so it is. Where you see the real acceleration in the tequila growth is above that price point, more the ultra price point. And so we're going to be playing some things there, too. We've got a wonderful brand that we've launched recently from Herradura, it's called Herradura Legend, it's very ultra, ultra-premium. But we think it's got lots of legs. And people are, again, indulging in these everyday luxuries. And Ultra is a product that we introduced in Mexico a few years ago, fairly introduced it in the U.S. And again, these are higher price points. That's where you see the real accelerated growth. And we've got a new campaign that we're launching in April. And we're really excited about that from Energy BBDO.

I guess I'm trying to get a sense of your confidence level that you're spending the right levels in terms of ad spend to drive top line and possibly accelerate it."

But just the -- we knew this year was going to be a crazy-looking year on phasing. And just to remind you, it actually started last year in the fourth quarter, in the last 6 weeks of the fiscal year. So when COVID hit in the middle of March through all of April, when we cut -- shutdown -- on-premise were shut down and then sponsorships, all those things went away. We knew early on, we saw our first quarter was an unusual quarter. We really didn't start spending until the second quarter, and that was purposeful, not only because of the consumer and its readiness to hear what we were saying, but also because we had a new agency partner, Energy BBDO, in which we launched our Make It Count campaign toward the end of October. 
So what you're seeing in the third quarter, we had -- we've been talking about all year long. So some of this is situational and circumstantial relative to what was going on in COVID, some of it is because we planned it this way. But as you look to the balance of the year, I think I said this in our remarks, we look to the fourth quarter, we're going to continue to see an acceleration in the rate of growth. So our year-over-year rate of growth, because of the decline last year, plus just the way we spent this year, is going to be up even more on a percentage basis than it was in the third quarter. 
If you're thinking ahead to how you would -- how you should expect us to spend, it's going to be choppy next year because you're going to get the flip of that, but let's just talk big picture. If I'm thinking about that, our aspirations have been -- always come in every year like that, but to grow somewhere in line with our rate of growth. I don't know if you have..."

And I'll back up for a second, go back like 2 or 3 years, probably 2 years ago. Well before COVID even came around, we were making changes to our resource allocation models to significantly up weight media and just general consumer touch spends and downplay some of the events, places that were lower touch, even on-premise, things like that. And so that had begun -- that mix of spend change had begun before COVID hit. Then it hits everyone, including Brown-Forman. The entire industry drops their on-premise spend, drops their event spending, drops lots of that kind of stuff and starts going back at media again. 
So in a way, it has accelerated our path to get there. But in another way, which I hadn't processed, if I'm honest, until a few months ago because we were looking at share of voice and share of different ways of spending, and basically, everybody is doing that. And so the media spend has increased significantly in our industry, but it's still the right thing to do. And I think longer term, we like the rebalance of how we're spending the money. And I think that will -- we're going to hold on to that for the -- at least the medium to longer-term future."

So more strategic sourcing and getting synergies there. So there's some low-hanging fruit in that area. We're always looking at and as part of our global production's mindset, but we're always looking at how to improve our operations. And so there's a handful of initiatives there. I didn't quantify those. We haven't quantified it, but I can tell you that we -- again, just supporting where we said that, that 59%, half 59% in our second quarter was the bottom. You're going to expect to see nice improvements over the coming, say, 2 to 3 years. I would set aside tariffs and that would just add to this benefit.

That will not make its way through our P&L. I think I've talked about this previously because of our long aging process that we had. So think about our Jack Daniel's products, our Old Forester product, Woodford Reserve, 3 -- 4, 5 years, depending on what it is down the road before you actually see those lower costs coming through. 
You'll start to probably start seeing some mix differences coming through on our balance sheet. Hopefully, as the year come on, where you'll start to see that cost offsetting some of the volumetric trends, which if you look at our balance sheet over the last several years, you'll have seen barrel whiskey go up quite a bit, but that's been a combination of this cost, this wood cost, that's coming through our P&L now that we've been talking about last year and this year.

The business has exploded in the United States over the last year and in a number of other countries, too. It's always been a consumer recruitment vehicle, and that's the way we thought about it, I would say, even for a couple of decades as we built that brand and sort of the can in the hand and all that. It has now grown into much more than that and to be certainly a profit driver. The Country Cocktails partnership, we call it that, with Pabst now, we do expect to continue to keep that growth rate going for lots of reasons. The most obvious one being they have touch points in many channels, including convenience that we just weren't getting with the spirit wholesalers for the most part. And so the number of distribution points will go up substantially. And so we think we can keep that run going.
But the RTD business is much more -- much, much larger outside of the U.S. than it is inside the U.S., it's like 3.5x the size in the international markets than it is in the U.S. And that, that's a lot of Germany. For instance, Germany business is well over 1 million cases now and very, very profitable and doing very, very well. Australia has been the largest RTD market in the world -- well, one of the largest in the world for quite some time, and that business is really strong. So yes, I think that's here to stay. I do think it's been boosted by COVID. I mean -- but the macro trends of convenience and flavor fit very well into the RTD business. And so this is something that's here to stay, and we'll just have to -- it's hard to see what the growth rates are going to be when you get beyond COVID, but we certainly expect them to still be strong.

I mean the margin for us this year has been very immaterial, I would say, a couple tenths of a point as it relates to the RTD business. Some of that was outsized in the first quarter because of our New Mix business, which benefited from the beer shutdowns. And I think we said this on the first quarter call and second quarter call too as well that we are fine with that right now, a tenth or 2, particularly in this environment, we want to be where the consumer is.
We also noted, it's something we've talked about many, many times in the past and fretted over, but if you actually put this on a drink equivalent basis, it's actually more -- a better margin than our full strength. And so there's different ways to look at it. So right now, it's all about meeting the consumer needs, the convenience, providing them with great-tasting cocktail. I think the opportunity exists going forward, but I don't see it as a big margin drag. It hasn't been year-to-date really either."

And that business has been relatively weak. As I mentioned, those are the markets that don't have the big fiscal stimulus, and they have been more challenging.

Australia would be the best example of that. And every year, they come up with something new, and different pack sizes, and proofs, flavors and mix, all the rest of it. And so we've been doing that for quite a long time, and that will continue. So the RTD space in terms of do we have the know-how, do we have the supply chain, do we have the abilities to sort of forecast where the consumer is going in that space, I would rate us high on that. 
As far as you referenced Fire and Apple and Honey, that pace is not changing. I mean we've been -- we've done 3 in 10 years and really just obviously started Apple a year ago or a little more. So that pace will not change. So I would not expect us to do another big Jack Daniel's flavor in the near future, at least. We want to be very measured on that. They're big campaigns, they're big launches. They take a couple of years to execute. And so I don't expect that -- I would not expect that the pace on that will be any different than it's been."

This morning's conference call contains forward-looking statements based on our current expectations. Numerous risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or projected in these statements. Many of the factors that will determine future results are beyond the company's ability to control or predict. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, and the company undertakes no obligation to update any of these statements, whether due to new information, future events or otherwise. 
This morning, we issued a press release containing our results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021, in addition to posting presentation materials that Lawson and Jane will walk through momentarily. Both the release and the presentation can be found on our website under the section titled Investors, Events & Presentations. 
In the press release, we have listed a number of the risk factors you should consider in conjunction with our forward-looking statements. Other significant risk factors are described in our Form 10-K and Form 10-Q reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. During this call, we will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures.

I'm pleased to be here today to share a few remarks regarding our results this year. It's a bit hard to believe, but given that our fiscal year-end is April 30, we're at the stage in our COVID-19 journey where our results include a full year of living and working and building brands amid a global pandemic. This year showed us that we have an agile organization, a resilient business and a caring team that is emerging stronger and better from challenging times. 
Our long-term values, our strategic priorities and our core purpose of enriching life have been our guide and they have served us well. I'm proud of how our team responded in this environment to deliver the level of results that we're able to share with you today. In fact, if you were to look solely at the financial reports we released today, you may or may not fully appreciate the magnitude of what we accomplished. 
In a year unlike any other, we delivered top line growth of plus 6%, which is consistent with our long-term performance. Yet this year was anything but consistent and conditions were anything but normal. The pandemic created unprecedented market conditions and perhaps surprisingly, in many of our largest markets, really strong performance. At the same time, these results would not have been possible without the resilience, creativity, agility and determination of our employees around the world. So before moving on, I do want to thank each and every one of our employees for their continued focus over these past 12 months and for all they have done and continue to do to rise to the challenge, reimagine the future, take care of each other and move the business forward. I'm immensely proud of what we were able to accomplish and I hope you are too. 
So in fiscal '21, we focused on the core elements of our strategy to deliver results. We were strengthened by the quality of our brand portfolio, our geographic diversification and the strength of our balance sheet. I'll share a few examples. First, we continued our ongoing efforts to reshape our portfolio by focusing on premium products and driving innovation in key categories such as American whiskey, tequilas and RTDs. Last fiscal, this included the sale of Canadian Mist, Early Times and Collingwood. It also included the acquisition of Part Time Rangers, a regional RTD brand in New Zealand and Australia. 
We also placed strong focus on our existing RTD brands, including Jack Daniel's RTDs and New Mix. Together, they surpassed 20 million cases. And we continue to place energy and emphasis on our Jack Daniel's flavors, which has resulted in really strong growth, with Jack Daniel's Apple alone surpassing 500,000 cases in adjusted second year, and Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey eclipsed the 2 million case mark and really has become a solid growth driver for the company. 
Geographically, we established our own distribution organizations in the U.K. and Thailand, allowing us increased control over our brand-building efforts in these markets. And we've also initiated plans to create own distribution organizations in Russia, in Belgium and Taiwan. 
From an organizational and people perspective, at the beginning of the year, we really redeployed portions of our workforce in response to the shifts in our business due to the pandemic. We're investing in teams in Europe that are going to focus on emerging brands. This is really an effort to accelerate our growth rate in brands such as Gentleman Jack, Woodford Reserve, our Single Malt Scotches and Slane Irish Whiskey. 
And recently, we announced the launch of our Integrated Marketing Communications organization or something we call IMC. And by investing in IMC, we believe we can improve how we connect with consumers, grow our e-commerce capabilities, fully optimize our brand assets and leverage our data more effectively. We're confident IMC will be a growth driver for our organization in the years to come as the physical and digital worlds continue to merge. Finally, we continue to invest beyond our business in both capital and brand expense to continue growing our leading brands for the long term. 
Integrated within our strategic priorities are our environmental, social and governance or ESG commitments, including our focus on responsible consumption and marketing, diversity and inclusion, the communities in which our employees live and work and environmental sustainability. We believe our long-term success is tied intrinsically with our ability to lead in each of these areas. So as such, over the past year, we made considerable progress against all aspects of ESG. From an environmental standpoint, we established ambitious new sustainability commitments with a focus on climate action, water stewardship, the circular economy and our supply chain. 
Given the important role business has to play and the importance of these issues to our business, we had to draw a line in the sand, so we now have compelling, meaningful, quantitative goals that we will hold ourselves accountable. And very importantly, from a social perspective, we committed to be better and do better by building a more diverse, inclusive and equitable company and community. Internally, this includes 10 new actions from the executive leadership team to drive increased accountability and improved representation and development of people of color. For the first time ever, we tied 10% of the executive leadership team's fiscal '21 short-term cash incentive compensation to our D&I goals. 
And we continue to make progress against the initiatives set forth in our 10-year D&I strategy, Many Spirits, One Brown-Forman. Our 10 employee resource groups and their many leaders, members and allies are critical to our work. I'm reminded of this once again as we are in the midst of Pride Month here, embracing LGBTQ+ diversity and raising our own awareness around equality and the allyship. 
Finally, from a governance perspective, I recognize that we're a bit unique, given that we are family-controlled. However, we believe strongly that our governance system gives us a distinct competitive advantage by allowing us to consider longer-term time horizons and make decisions that will benefit our brands, our shareholders and our organization for generations to come. 
As you know, in January, we announced that our Board Chair, George Garvin Brown IV will retire in July and hand over leadership of our Board of Directors to Campbell Brown, the tenth Brown family member and second fifth-generation family member to serve in this role. I want to take this opportunity to once again thank Garvin whose leadership has been steadfast not only during the last year but through his 14 years as Board Chair. It's been a pleasure working alongside you. 
And as I begin to wrap up, I would be remiss if I didn't address tariffs, which continued to have a huge impact on our performance this past year and in fact, over the last 3 years. As you know, the U.S. and EU announced an agreement in mid-May to suspend the planned doubling of tariffs to 50% on American whiskey on June 1. We, of course, were pleased with that development and continue to be encouraged about the possibility of the full removal of tariffs on American whiskey. But in the meantime, American whiskey still faces an unlevel playing field and remains subject to 25% retaliatory tariffs. We hope that the U.S., the U.K. and the EU governments can work quickly to address the trade issues affecting American whiskey and potentially threatening other spirits categories too, and please remove all spirits tariffs before the EU tariff escalation pause expires at the end of November. 
Our organization has adjusted to an evolving world. We understand how to manage change and volatility and thrive. Today's results are evidence of our collective and continued success and our ability to care for each other, our communities, our environment and our business. 
Finally, before I turn things over to Jane, I wanted to take this opportunity to recognize her in her 30-year career at Brown-Forman. Jane has been a valued partner of mine since we first had cubicles near each other back in 1997. In fact, we've worked together throughout most of our time at Brown-Forman as we each steadily progressed into new and expanded roles. I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that Jane has had one of the most successful careers of any executive at Brown-Forman. 
Most recently, she spearheaded innovative capital investment strategies, resource allocation models and business transformation efforts that have been instrumental to achieving our ambitions. She's also been instrumental in advancing our D&I initiatives and conversations, particularly over the last year. She is a true ally. I appreciate the impact she's had not only on the business results and our culture but on the many people at Brown-Forman that she has mentored and developed over the years. Jane, on behalf of our entire organization, I want to simply say thank you. With that, I'll turn the call over, and Jane will walk us through our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021 results."

And I know you and your leadership at Brown-Forman and the team globally will take this company to new levels in t",1968,"Thank you, Lawson, for the kind words. It's truly been an honor and privilege to be able to be a part of this company for the past 30 years. And I know you and your leadership at Brown-Forman and the team globally will take this company to new levels in the years to come. 
Good morning, everyone. As Lawson said, when we look at fiscal 2021, we are very pleased with our strong top line growth, consistent with our long-term trends despite the many challenges presented by the global pandemic. We believe these results reflect the agility and resilience of our people and the strength of our brands, allowing us to deliver mid-single-digit underlying top line growth for the year and an increase over our fiscal 2019, our last full year of performance without COVID-19. 
As expected, we experienced an acceleration in our top line growth in our fourth quarter as we cycled the initial impact of COVID-19 and benefited from improving levels of consumer confidence in many markets around the world as vaccinations increased and lockdowns and restrictions were eased. Also, as we previously communicated, we continue to invest behind our brands as evidenced by the significant increase in A&P in our fourth quarter, reflecting increased support in areas where our business showed strong momentum and the cycling against last year's meaningful decline in spending during the early months of the pandemic. 
With that as a recap, let's review our full year fiscal 2021 results. Starting with our top line. Compared to fiscal 2020, our reported net sales were up 3%, reflecting our strong mid-single-digit underlying top line growth and the benefit of a weaker U.S. dollar. These gains were partially offset by a decrease in distributor inventory levels in the U.S. that were higher at the end of fiscal 2020, reflecting a build in response to the uncertainty surrounding the early days of the pandemic. We believe the distributor inventory levels are below their pre-COVID levels due to various supply chain challenges. 
We experienced broad-based underlying net sales growth across the IMF geographic clusters of the U.S., developed international and emerging markets, which was partially offset by declines in our travel retail channel and a reduction in our used barrel sales. Our U.S. business, which represents half our net sales, grew underlying net sales 10%, the highest rate of growth we've registered in the U.S. in over 2 decades. Our premium bourbon and tequila brand, along with JD RTDs fueled this strong growth. Higher consumer demand, increased premiumization mix and the RTD revolution more than offset unfavorable channel and size mix shift effects. 
Speaking of the channel size mix effects, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey was negatively affected by the restrictions and closures in the on-premise due to its greater presence in this channel than overall TDS. While it is still early in fiscal 2022, we continue to experience solid growth in the off-premise compared to the same period 2 years ago, even as the on-premise continues to reopen. In fiscal '21, our U.S. e-premise share was slightly above 2%. While still small, our brands in this channel collectively grew at triple-digit rates, outpacing TDS by 10 points. The pandemic step change, alcohol sales via e-commerce and it appears that the change in consumer behavior is sticking. 
Our developed international markets collectively delivered strong underlying net sales growth, up double digits for the fiscal year. This growth was driven by higher volumes of Jack Daniel's RTDs in Australia and Germany, broad-based volumetric growth from Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey as well as the launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple, which in year 1 is already the size of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey was in year 4 in Europe. These positive factors were partially offset by declines for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, notably in Spain, the U.K. and Czechia, reflecting lower volumes due in part to the channel mix from the on-premise to the off-premise as well as a reduction in tourism. 
Collectively, our emerging markets reversed its underlying net sales declines from earlier in the fiscal year, delivering mid-single-digit growth for the full year, reflecting volumetric gains for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey in Brazil and Poland, higher volumes of new mix in Mexico, the launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple, as well as the growth of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey, both most notably in Brazil. These positive factors were partially offset by a decrease of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey in a number of other emerging markets, reflecting declines in tourism and consumers trading down, lower volumes of our full strength tequilas in Mexico and broad-based declines of Finlandia, notably in Russia and Poland. Finally, as expected, our travel retail business remained down for the year, reflecting lower volumes across the portfolio, driven by the drop in airline travel and the shutdown of the cruise business. 
Now I thought I would share a few brand highlights with you for the year. The preference for convenience and at-home consumption drove exceptional growth in our RTD portfolio and our flavor whiskey brands. Globally, Jack Daniel's RTD exceeded 12 million cases and New Mix crossed 8 million cases. Remarkably for the year, we sold approximately 5 million increment cases of RTDs. Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey approximated 2.1 million cases, and our flavor whiskey portfolio grew to 3.3 million cases, an incremental 500,000-plus cases were added for the year. 
Our portfolio strategy continues to serve us well as the premiumization trend that has been going on for over 2 decades accelerated in fiscal 2021, most notably in developed markets, resulting in double-digit underlying net sales growth for Woodford Reserve, Old Forester, Herradura, Gentleman Jack, GlenDronach and BenRiach. Of our portfolio, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey was most impacted by the pandemic, given that its size and overall exposure to the on-premise and the travel retail channel as the brand experienced a decline in underlying net sales for the year. 
Now turning to our gross margin, which declined 270 basis points and resulted in our underlying gross profit growing 3%. Higher input costs, primarily due to increased costs for agave and wood, as well as lower fixed cost absorption for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, drove approximately 3/4 of the gross margin decrease. Negative channel and portfolio mix shifts accounted for the rest of the change. 
Moving to A&P investment. As mentioned in my opening remarks and discussed in our last quarter call, we significantly increased our spend throughout the second half of the year, most notably behind our Jack Daniel's Make It Count campaign globally, the Woodford Reserve Spectacle of the Senses campaign and the Make It Gold campaign for Herradura. And finally, the Derby was held this year on May 1 so we made investments leading up to the race. We invested strategically behind our business to drive our sales and to build on the momentum we experienced as the year progressed, which resulted in our fiscal 2021 underlying A&P increasing 2%. 
Our underlying SG&A investment was flat as higher compensation-related costs were offset by tight management of discretionary spend, including hiring and travel freezes as a result of the COVID-19 environment. In total, we grew underlying operating income 4% for the year and report it was even stronger due to the gain on the sale of Canadian Mist and Early Times earlier in the year. This, combined with a reduction in our effective tax rate, resulted in 9% diluted EPS growth to $1.88 per share, including the $0.20 gain from the sale. 
And finally, to our fiscal 2022 outlook. We are optimistic as we look ahead, and we expect the operating environment to continue to improve, particularly as the on-premise and countries we're heavily reliant on tourism further recover and as some degree of business and personal travel resume through the global travel retail channel. From a qualitative perspective, of course, the pace of recovery is unknown at this time and will vary from country to country depending on the state of the pandemic, vaccinations and reopening. 
As a result of these factors, coupled with unusual compares to last year, we expect the seasonality of our results to be volatile during the year, particularly operating income. We remain confident in the collective strength of our developed markets and should benefit from the reopening of the on-premise channel and increase in tourism, which particularly impacted Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey this past year in some of our smaller emerging brands. 
Additionally, our portfolio remains well positioned to capitalize on the continuing spirits premiumization trend. In aggregate, we expect strong growth in our emerging markets as well as travel retail as we cycle the effect of easy comparisons and begin to stabilize and recover. Further, we do not expect our noncore business, mainly used barrels, to have a material impact on our results. We expect some improvement in our gross margin for the full year, driven by positive channel mix as the on-premise and tourism recover, benefits from a number of productivity-related initiatives currently underway begin to be realized and the easing of historically high agave costs start to reverse. 
From a quantitative perspective, we expect both our underlying net sales and operating income to grow in the mid-single digits. Similarly, we anticipate our operating investments, advertising and SG&A to be in line in this range as we continue to invest behind our brands to support our top line growth as well as begin to work toward activating various strategic initiatives, including 3 new RTCs, the expansion of our emerging brand teams internationally to select markets and an increase in our digital marketing and e-commerce capabilities. 
We expect our effective tax rate in fiscal 2022 to be higher than the 16.5% registered this past year, largely reflecting the absence of discrete items. We estimate the rate to more closely approximate our fiscal 2021 rate from operations of about 21% to 22%. 
In summary, while fiscal 2021 was filled with rapidly changing market dynamics and twists and turns at every corner, we delivered strong top line growth, consistent with our long-term aspirations. Our business model remains excellent with nearly a 34% operating margin and an approximately 20% ROIC, both industry-leading metrics. We thoughtfully and judiciously prioritized, managed and allocated capital throughout the pandemic, emerging with an even stronger balance sheet. 
We remain committed to our long-held capital allocation philosophy to first invest fully behind our business, which we expect CapEx spending to be in the $130 million to $150 million range in fiscal 2022; second, to pay increasing dividends; and third, to look for acquisitions opportunistically that will create long-term value. And finally, as always, we will look for opportunities to return cash to shareholders in a judicious and tax-efficient manner, including our own assessment of known and proposed changes in tax law. The timing, amount and form will depend on our assessment of the environment. This recipe has resulted in terrific returns to our shareholders over the past decade of 17%, and we believe our strategic priorities will help deliver superior returns over the next decade. 
Now before we open call up for Q&A, please join me in congratulating Leanne Cunningham, currently the SVP, Shareholder Relations Officer, Global Commercial Finance and Financial Planning and Analysis, who will be promoted to the position of Chief Financial Officer on July 2, 2021. Many of you are likely familiar with Leanne as she has served as our Shareholder Relations Officer for nearly the past 2 years. She is a 25-year veteran at Brown-Forman, with extensive experience across the company's production and financial operations that make her uniquely qualified to lead our global finance organization. As Sue indicated, she is with us today and will be available for Q&A. 
So with that, this concludes our prepared remarks. We will now take your questions. Operator, you may open up the line."

So I just -- maybe you could spend some time, Lawson, as well, just kind of talk about some of the building blocks here and the strength that you're seeing. 
I also think it's noteworthy. You're the second U.S. alcohol company that we've heard from this week that's noted surprisingly strong strength in the off-premise even as the on-premise recovers, which is noteworthy. So any comments you hear on overall consumption and consumer behavior and channel dynamics, and just kind of tie that in with what you're expecting for the year, I think, would be helpful."

I mean, yes, I think we have been a little bit surprised at the strength of the off-premise as the on-premise has sort of begun to recover. To talk about the on-premise for a second, I mean, the data that we've been seeing, and we generally use OpenTable, I know a lot of you have done the same. It has improved significantly in the last few months where it was down hugely last summer, improved a little bit in the fall and then took a nosedive down around Christmas time and was down in that 50% range for much of the winter, has improved to only down mid-single digits now. So you have seen a pretty rapid recovery as the restaurants have begun to open up. 
And I know everyone anecdotally talks about it, the restaurants these days feel very crowded and very busy. And so a lot of people wanting to go back out. The off-premise though does remain very elevated. I think if we looked at the NABCA data, which would include some of the on-premise volume, I mean, the trends have moved from what would have been mid-single digit for, I'll say, the 10 years before the pandemic hit is now very high single-digit, even low double-digit growth rates. And so obviously, the off-premise has held up pretty well. And I think the good news, at least for us, is the categories that are leading that tend to be 2 of the strongest categories out there, tequila and American whiskey, and that is essentially the vast majority of our portfolio. So Jane, is there anything to add on that?"

I think our portfolio, as we've been saying all year long, is well positioned to take advantage of the trends. Convenience, we benefited tremendously from our RTD business. RTD business has been very solid in the U.S. And of course, you know we just entered a new partnership with which we believe will take our RTD business to an even higher level. 
When we think about the mix ability, our flavored whiskey did very well, particularly Honey in the U.S. business -- in the U.S. market because of the ease of mixing great-tasting cocktails. As tequilas Lawson just referenced, that category has been on fire. We've got 2 of the best tequilas, we believe, in the industry and have benefited because of that. 
And then something else we've been talking about all year long is everyday luxury. And that is playing great to the strength of our brands: Woodford Reserve, which has continued this phenomenal growth; In Old Forester, there's -- what is it -- a theory -- [indiscernible which is doing terrific. And then even we've introduced some higher-end expressions in the tequila category, which is where the growth is coming from.

And when you break it out and you pull it apart, yes, a piece of it is because of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey and the fact that the on-premise were shut down and Jack Daniel's in the U.S. alone is 1 of the top 3 on-premise brands. And so it was impacted significantly and it impacted our margins, of course. 
So when we look ahead to F '22, as I said in my script and you just referenced, we are expecting some improvement. I will call pause for a moment and the improvements we're expecting is because we do expect some of these last couple of years of hurt from agave to begin to reverse, only began next year. We can talk more about that later if people want to know what we're seeing in that. But we also have had a number of productivity initiatives from our global production organization that will start to begin realized next year. And we've got several years before they're all fully realized because of, again, just a reminder of our aged whiskey products and how things go on to the balance sheet. 
And then mix will benefit some but it's not the hugest piece, as I said, this year, I said from this past year and how much it hurt. What I will want to pause and point out for a moment is something that we have included in our forecast and that's a pretty significant increase in commodity costs. Inflationary commodity cost is around double digits is what we currently have forecasted in there. Otherwise, we would have expected a better improving margin next year or this year. And we're going to keep an eye on that, by the way, as I know all consumer products companies are. But right now, we feel where we sit that we can improve -- expect margins to begin to improve in F '22. And as we look beyond that, we expect improving trends thereafter. As a reminder, tariffs are still in our numbers. They're still dragging down our numbers and hope -- we've got optimistic that, that will go away at some point down the road."

I mean, there is -- there has been quite a swing between categories. And thankfully, we -- as I said earlier, we are in the right one. As far as the wine, beer and wine, I mean, beer has obviously got a lot more event business to it. And that -- they lost all of that and that helped exaggerate the numbers. But I think in general, the pandemic -- we've said this a few times too. Any trend that was happening pre-pandemic just accelerated. And so the spirits versus wine and beer would be one of those. Premiumization would be another 1 and convenience as the other core 1. So all 3 of those trends have been working in our favor.

I mean, I do know so many bars and restaurants had to reduce their inventories over the last year. And so it became an advantage for established big brands to turn faster, and it made it challenging for newer brands, particularly some of the craft brands that just don't have the ability to continue to push as hard as the major brands do. 
So there's been this window of opportunity, I think, from companies like Brown-Forman to be able to command a bigger piece of the back bar. And we're going to go make sure that we get more than our fair share of that opportunity as things evolve over the next few months. 
In the international side, I mean, yes, it is brand new. It's not even really formed yet. It will be over the next few months. But Europe, obviously, is several months behind in terms of openings of bars and restaurants and didn't make a lot of sense to put a lot of effort on that until the restaurants began to open again. But as I think you all realize, our business outside of the United States, in most markets really is a Jack Daniel's company. And we have a big effort to continue to expand our portfolio in those markets led by like a Woodford Reserve would be a great example. But our single-malt scotches are very important to us. Fords Gin, even Slane Irish Whiskey, those are much smaller brands but brands that we see a bright future for, and that's the purpose of putting these dedicated people in place in these markets that have been so Jack Daniel's-oriented. It's very difficult to build a Slane Irish Whiskey next to Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey. I mean, it's just salespeople's incentives need to be aligned behind the right initiatives. And so that's the reason we're doing it. We feel pretty good that it'll -- we'll be in the right place at the right time and hopefully make that into a significant piece of business."

Now when I talk about that, let me break it down a littl",393,"Yes. Thank you for asking. And I think what I'm going to talk about here is I'll first talk about is impacting us supply chain-wise, disruptions that we're seeing from the materials to the customer. Now when I talk about that, let me break it down a little bit. As you alluded to, we talked about our results being impacted somewhat by the supply constraints in the U.S. where our distributor inventories and our retail inventories are down versus pre COVID. 
And so what's happening there is really we're not unique to this in terms of the back end of what's going on here, which is what you've heard probably from other CPG companies or read that there's lots of transportation and logistics challenges out there that are ramping back up as the economy improves, people start to build back and restock inventory. So we see delays in rail service, container availability and ocean time-to-ship things across the ocean, trucking capacity in the U.S. as example. And then labor shortage that we hear in bars and restaurants, it's also in the warehousing industry. 
So with that being said, we know that it's -- our inventory levels are down at the end of this past year, as I said, in the U.S. They are also down outside -- in parts of Europe as well. And so we hope and we're working with our teams the best we can. Again, we're at the mercy of the supply chain somewhat in this as things work out. 
But when I think about the material aspect of things, because I also said we've had some disruptions on the material side, think about how we make barrels, we've had some disruptions in steel that we use to make the hoops around the barrels. But the key ingredient that we've had some disruptions on is our glass supply. And that is certainly something that is really important to us and something that we are working closely with our supplier now, work out the quality, get behind that and get that resolved. 
So as I gave our guidance today, the top line mid-single-digit underlying and same for mid-single-digit bottom line growth, we think at this point, we had these disruptions estimated and covered. But if things get worse, we'll have to update that guidance as we go on in the year."

I'm pleased to be here today to share a few remarks regarding our results this year. It's a bit hard to believe, but given that our fiscal year-end is April 30, we're at the stage in our COVID-19 journey where our results include a full year of living and working and building brands amid a global pandemic. This year showed us that we have an agile organization, a resilient business and a caring team that is emerging stronger and better from challenging times.
Our long-term values, our strategic priorities and our core purpose of enriching life have been our guide and they have served us well. I'm proud of how our team responded in this environment to deliver the level of results that we're able to share with you today. In fact, if you were to look solely at the financial reports we released today, you may or may not fully appreciate the magnitude of what we accomplished.
In a year unlike any other, we delivered top line growth of plus 6%, which is consistent with our long-term performance. Yet this year was anything but consistent and conditions were anything but normal. The pandemic created unprecedented market conditions and perhaps surprisingly, in many of our largest markets, really strong performance. At the same time, these results would not have been possible without the resilience, creativity, agility and determination of our employees around the world.
So before moving on, I do want to thank each and every one of our employees for their continued focus over these past 12 months and for all they have done and continue to do to rise to the challenge, reimagine the future, take care of each other and move the business forward. I'm immensely proud of what we were able to accomplish, and I hope you are too.
So in fiscal '21, we focused on the core elements of our strategy to deliver results. We were strengthened by the quality of our brand portfolio, our geographic diversification and the strength of our balance sheet. I'll share a few examples. First, we continued our ongoing efforts to reshape our portfolio by focusing on premium products and driving innovation in key categories such as American whiskey, tequilas and RTDs. Last fiscal, this included the sale of Canadian Mist, Early Times and Collingwood. It also included the acquisition of Part Time Rangers, a regional RTD brand in New Zealand and Australia.
We also placed strong focus on our existing RTD brands, including Jack Daniel's RTDs and New Mix. Together, they surpassed 20 million cases. And we continue to place energy and emphasis on our Jack Daniel's flavors, which has resulted in really strong growth, with Jack Daniel's Apple alone surpassing 500,000 cases in adjusted second year, and Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey eclipsed the 2 million case mark and really has become a solid growth driver for the company.
Geographically, we established our own distribution organizations in the U.K. and Thailand, allowing us increased control over our brand-building efforts in these markets. And we've also initiated plans to create own distribution organizations in Russia, in Belgium and Taiwan.
From an organizational and people perspective, at the beginning of the year, we really redeployed portions of our workforce in response to the shifts in our business due to the pandemic. We're investing in teams in Europe that are going to focus on emerging brands. This is really an effort to accelerate our growth rate in brands such as Gentleman Jack, Woodford Reserve, our Single Malt Scotches and Slane Irish Whiskey.
And recently, we announced the launch of our integrated marketing communications organization or something we call IMC. And by investing in IMC, we believe we can improve how we connect with consumers, grow our e-commerce capabilities, fully optimize our brand assets and leverage our data more effectively. We're confident IMC will be a growth driver for our organization in the years to come as the physical and digital worlds continue to merge.
Finally, we continue to invest beyond our business in both capital and brand expense to continue growing our leading brands for the long term. Integrated within our strategic priorities are our environmental, social and governance or ESG commitments, including our focus on responsible consumption and marketing, diversity and inclusion, the communities in which our employees live and work and environmental sustainability. We believe our long-term success is tied intrinsically with our ability to lead in each of these areas. So as such, over the past year, we made considerable progress against all aspects of ESG.
From an environmental standpoint, we established ambitious new sustainability commitments with a focus on climate action, water stewardship, the circular economy and our supply chain. Given the important role business has to play and the importance of these issues to our business, we had to draw a line in the sand, so we now have compelling, meaningful, quantitative goals that we will hold ourselves accountable.
And very importantly, from a social perspective, we committed to be better and do better by building a more diverse, inclusive and equitable company and community. Internally, this includes 10 new actions from the executive leadership team to drive increased accountability and improved representation and development of people of color. For the first time ever, we tied 10% of the executive leadership team's fiscal '21 short-term cash incentive compensation to our D&I goals. And we continue to make progress against the initiatives set forth in our 10-year D&I strategy, Many Spirits, One Brown-Forman. Our 10 employee resource groups and their many leaders, members and allies are critical to our work. I'm reminded of this once again as we are in the midst of Pride Month here, embracing LGBTQ+ diversity and raising our own awareness around equality and the allyship.
Finally, from a governance perspective, I recognize that we're a bit unique, given that we are family-controlled. However, we believe strongly that our governance system gives us a distinct competitive advantage by allowing us to consider longer-term time horizons and make decisions that will benefit our brands, our shareholders and our organization for generations to come.
As you know, in January, we announced that our Board Chair, George Garvin Brown IV will retire in July and hand over leadership of our Board of Directors to Campbell Brown, the 10th Brown family member and second fifth-generation family member to serve in this role. I want to take this opportunity to once again thank Garvin, whose leadership has been steadfast not only during the last year but through his 14 years as Board Chair. It's been a pleasure working alongside you.
And as I begin to wrap up, I would be remiss if I didn't address tariffs, which continued to have a huge impact on our performance this past year and in fact, over the last 3 years. As you know, the U.S. and EU announced an agreement in mid-May to suspend the planned doubling of tariffs to 50% on American whiskey on June 1. We, of course, were pleased with that development and continue to be encouraged about the possibility of the full removal of tariffs on American whiskey.
But in the meantime, American whiskey still faces an unlevel playing field and remains subject to 25% retaliatory tariffs. We hope that the U.S., the U.K. and the EU governments can work quickly to address the trade issues affecting American whiskey and potentially threatening other spirits categories too, and please remove all spirits tariffs before the EU tariff escalation pause expires at the end of November.
Our organization has adjusted to an evolving world. We understand how to manage change and volatility and thrive. Today's results are evidence of our collective and continued success and our ability to care for each other, our communities, our environment and our business.
Finally, before I turn things over to Jane, I wanted to take this opportunity to recognize her in her 30-year career at Brown-Forman. Jane has been a valued partner of mine since we first had cubicles near each other back in 1997. In fact, we've worked together throughout most of our time at Brown-Forman as we each steadily progressed into new and expanded roles. I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that Jane has had one of the most successful careers of any executive at Brown-Forman.
Most recently, she spearheaded innovative capital investment strategies, resource allocation models and business transformation efforts that have been instrumental to achieving our ambitions. She's also been instrumental in advancing our D&I initiatives and conversations, particularly over the last year. She is a true ally. I appreciate the impact she's had not only on the business results and our culture but on the many people at Brown-Forman that she has mentored and developed over the years. Jane, on behalf of our entire organization, I want to simply say thank you.
With that, I'll turn the call over, and Jane will walk us through our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2021 results."

It's truly been an honor and privilege to be able to be a part of this company for the past 30 years. And I know you and your leadership at Brown-Forman and the team globally will take this company to new levels in the years to come.
Good morning, everyone. As Lawson said, when we look at fiscal 2021, we are very pleased with our strong top line growth, consistent with our long-term trends despite the many challenges presented by the global pandemic. We believe these results reflect the agility and resilience of our people and the strength of our brands, allowing us to deliver mid-single-digit underlying top line growth for the year and an increase over our fiscal 2019, our last full year of performance without COVID-19.
As expected, we experienced an acceleration in our top line growth in our fourth quarter as we cycled the initial impact of COVID-19 and benefited from improving levels of consumer confidence in many markets around the world as vaccinations increased and lockdowns and restrictions were eased. Also, as we previously communicated, we continue to invest behind our brands as evidenced by the significant increase in A&P in our fourth quarter, reflecting increased support in areas where our business showed strong momentum and the cycling against last year's meaningful decline in spending during the early months of the pandemic.
With that as a recap, let's review our full year fiscal 2021 results. Starting with our top line. Compared to fiscal 2020, our reported net sales were up 3%, reflecting our strong mid-single-digit underlying top line growth and the benefit of a weaker U.S. dollar. These gains were partially offset by a decrease in distributor inventory levels in the U.S. that were higher at the end of fiscal 2020, reflecting a build in response to the uncertainty surrounding the early days of the pandemic. We believe the distributor inventory levels are below their pre-COVID levels due to various supply chain challenges.
We experienced broad-based underlying net sales growth across the IMF geographic clusters of the U.S., developed international and emerging markets, which was partially offset by declines in our Travel Retail channel and a reduction in our used barrel sales. Our U.S. business, which represents half our net sales, grew underlying net sales 10%, the highest rate of growth we've registered in the U.S. in over 2 decades. Our premium bourbon and tequila brand, along with JD RTDs fueled this strong growth. Higher consumer demand, increased premiumization mix and the RTD revolution more than offset unfavorable channel and size mix shift effects.
Speaking of the channel size mix effects, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey was negatively affected by the restrictions and closures in the on-premise due to its greater presence in this channel than overall TDS. While it is still early in fiscal 2022, we continue to experience solid growth in the off-premise compared to the same period 2 years ago, even as the on-premise continues to reopen. In fiscal '21, our U.S. e-premise share was slightly above 2%. While still small, our brands in this channel collectively grew at triple-digit rates, outpacing TDS by 10 points. The pandemic step change, alcohol sales via e-commerce and it appears that the change in consumer behavior is sticking.
Our developed international markets collectively delivered strong underlying net sales growth, up double digits for the fiscal year. This growth was driven by higher volumes of Jack Daniel's RTDs in Australia and Germany, broad-based volumetric growth from Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey as well as the launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple, which in year 1 is already the size of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey was in year 4 in Europe. These positive factors were partially offset by declines for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, notably in Spain, the U.K. and Czechia, reflecting lower volumes due in part to the channel mix from the on-premise to the off-premise as well as a reduction in tourism.
Collectively, our emerging markets reversed its underlying net sales declines from earlier in the fiscal year, delivering mid-single-digit growth for the full year, reflecting volumetric gains for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey in Brazil and Poland, higher volumes of New Mix in Mexico, the launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple as well as the growth of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey, both most notably in Brazil. These positive factors were partially offset by a decrease of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey in a number of other emerging markets, reflecting declines in tourism and consumers trading down, lower volumes of our full strength tequilas in Mexico and broad-based declines of Finlandia, notably in Russia and Poland.
Finally, as expected, our Travel Retail business remained down for the year, reflecting lower volumes across the portfolio, driven by the drop in airline travel and the shutdown of the cruise business.
Now I thought I would share a few brand highlights with you for the year. The preference for convenience and at-home consumption drove exceptional growth in our RTD portfolio and our flavored whiskey brands. Globally, Jack Daniel's RTD exceeded 12 million cases and New Mix crossed 8 million cases. Remarkably for the year, we sold approximately 5 million increment cases of RTDs. Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey approximated 2.1 million cases, and our flavored whiskey portfolio grew to 3.3 million cases, an incremental 500,000-plus cases were added for the year.
Our portfolio strategy continues to serve us well as the premiumization trend that has been going on for over 2 decades accelerated in fiscal 2021, most notably in developed markets, resulting in double-digit underlying net sales growth for Woodford Reserve, Old Forester, Herradura, Gentleman Jack, GlenDronach and BenRiach. Of our portfolio, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey was most impacted by the pandemic, given that its size and overall exposure to the on-premise and the Travel Retail channel as the brand experienced a decline in underlying net sales for the year.
Now turning to our gross margin, which declined 270 basis points and resulted in our underlying gross profit growing 3%. Higher input costs, primarily due to increased costs for agave and wood, as well as lower fixed cost absorption for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, drove approximately 3/4 of the gross margin decrease. Negative channel and portfolio mix shifts accounted for the rest of the change.
Moving to A&P investment. As mentioned in my opening remarks and discussed in our last quarter call, we significantly increased our spend throughout the second half of the year, most notably behind our Jack Daniel's Make It Count campaign globally, the Woodford Reserve Spectacle of the Senses campaign and the Make It Gold campaign for Herradura. And finally, the derby was held this year on May 1 so we made investments leading up to the race. We invested strategically behind our business to drive our sales and to build on the momentum we experienced as the year progressed, which resulted in our fiscal 2021 underlying A&P increasing 2%.
Our underlying SG&A investment was flat as higher compensation-related costs were offset by tight management of discretionary spend, including hiring and travel freezes as a result of the COVID-19 environment. In total, we grew underlying operating income 4% for the year and report it was even stronger due to the gain on the sale of Canadian Mist and Early Times earlier in the year. This, combined with a reduction in our effective tax rate, resulted in 9% diluted EPS growth to $1.88 per share, including the $0.20 gain from the sale.
And finally, to our fiscal 2022 outlook. We are optimistic as we look ahead, and we expect the operating environment to continue to improve, particularly as the on-premise and countries we're heavily reliant on tourism further recover and as some degree of business and personal travel resume through the global Travel Retail channel. From a qualitative perspective, of course, the pace of recovery is unknown at this time and will vary from country to country depending on the state of the pandemic, vaccinations and reopening.
As a result of these factors, coupled with unusual compares to last year, we expect the seasonality of our results to be volatile during the year, particularly operating income. We remain confident in the collective strength of our developed markets and should benefit from the reopening of the on-premise channel and increase in tourism, which particularly impacted Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey this past year in some of our smaller emerging brands.
Additionally, our portfolio remains well positioned to capitalize on the continuing spirits premiumization trend. In aggregate, we expect strong growth in our emerging markets as well as travel retail as we cycle the effect of easy comparisons and begin to stabilize and recover. Further, we do not expect our noncore business, mainly used barrels, to have a material impact on our results. We expect some improvement in our gross margin for the full year, driven by positive channel mix as the on-premise and tourism recover, benefits from a number of productivity-related initiatives currently underway begin to be realized and the easing of historically high agave costs start to reverse.
From a quantitative perspective, we expect both our underlying net sales and operating income to grow in the mid-single digits. Similarly, we anticipate our operating investments, advertising and SG&A to be in line in this range as we continue to invest behind our brands to support our top line growth as well as begin to work toward activating various strategic initiatives, including 3 new RTCs, the expansion of our emerging brand teams internationally to select markets and an increase in our digital marketing and e-commerce capabilities.
We expect our effective tax rate in fiscal 2022 to be higher than the 16.5% registered this past year, largely reflecting the absence of discrete items. We estimate the rate to more closely approximate our fiscal 2021 rate from operations of about 21% to 22%.
In summary, while fiscal 2021 was filled with rapidly changing market dynamics and twists and turns at every corner, we delivered strong top line growth, consistent with our long-term aspiration. Our business model remains excellent with nearly a 34% operating margin and an approximately 20% ROIC, both industry-leading metrics. We thoughtfully and judiciously prioritized, managed and allocated capital throughout the pandemic, emerging with an even stronger balance sheet.
We remain committed to our long-held capital allocation philosophy to first invest fully behind our business, which we expect CapEx spending to be in the $130 million to $150 million range in fiscal 2022; second, to pay increasing dividends; and third, to look for acquisitions opportunistically that will create long-term value.
And finally, as always, we will look for opportunities to return cash to shareholders in a judicious and tax-efficient manner, including our own assessment of known and proposed changes in tax law. The timing, amount and form will depend on our assessment of the environment. This recipe has resulted in terrific returns to our shareholders over the past decade of 17%, and we believe our strategic priorities will help deliver superior returns over the next decade.
Now before we open the call up for Q&A, please join me in congratulating Leanne Cunningham, currently the SVP, Shareholder Relations Officer, Global Commercial Finance and Financial Planning and Analysis, who will be promoted to the position of Chief Financial Officer on July 2, 2021. Many of you are likely familiar with Leanne as she has served as our Shareholder Relations Officer for nearly the past 2 years. She is a 25-year veteran at Brown-Forman, with extensive experience across the company's production and financial operations that make her uniquely qualified to lead our global finance organization.

I'd like to start with the strength of the U.S. business, Jane, as you rightly mentioned, understanding the year-over-year comparison, the 2-year stack or the 2-year average was exceptionally strong. So I just -- maybe you could spend some time, Lawson, as well, just kind of talk about some of the building blocks here and the strength that you're seeing.
I also think it's noteworthy. You're the second U.S. alcohol company that we've heard from this week that's noted surprisingly strong strength in the off-premise even as the on-premise recovers, which is noteworthy. So any comments you hear on overall consumption and consumer behavior and channel dynamics, and just kind of tie that in with what you're expecting for the year, I think, would be helpful."

I mean, yes, I think we have been a little bit surprised at the strength of the off-premise as the on-premise has sort of begun to recover. To talk about the on-premise for a second, I mean, the data that we've been seeing, and we generally use OpenTable, I know a lot of you have done the same. It has improved significantly in the last few months where it was down hugely last summer, improved a little bit in the fall and then took a nosedive down around Christmas time and was down in that 50% range for much of the winter, has improved to only down mid-single digits now.
So you have seen a pretty rapid recovery as the restaurants have begun to open up. And I know everyone anecdotally talks about it, the restaurants these days feel very crowded and very busy. And so a lot of people wanting to go back out.
The off-premise though does remain very elevated. I think if we looked at the NABCA data, which would include some of the off -- on-premise volume, I mean, the trends have moved from what would have been mid-single digit for, I'll say, the 10 years before the pandemic hit is now very high single-digit, even low double-digit growth rates. And so obviously, the off-premise has held up pretty well. And I think the good news, at least for us, is the categories that are leading that tend to be 2 of the strongest categories out there, tequila and American whiskey, and that is essentially the vast majority of our portfolio. So Jane, anything to add on to that?"

I think our portfolio, as we've been saying all year long, is well positioned to take advantage of the trends. Convenience, we benefited tremendously from our RTD business. RTD business has been very solid in the U.S. And of course, you know we just entered a new partnership with Pabst, which we believe will take our RTD business to an even higher level.
When we think about the mixability, our flavored whiskey did very well, particularly honey in the U.S. business -- in the U.S. market because of the ease of mixing great-tasting cocktails. As tequilas, Lawson just referenced, that category has been on fire. We've got 2 of the best tequilas, we believe, in the industry and have benefited because of that.
And then something else we've been talking about all year long is everyday luxury. And that is playing great to the strength of our brands: Woodford Reserve, which has continued this phenomenal growth; in Old Forester, there's -- what is it, a series, Whiskey Row series, yes, which is doing terrific. And then even we've introduced some higher-end expressions in the tequila category, which is where the growth is coming from. So I think we're benefiting from a lot of those type of trends, Kevin, to be honest with you. Yes."

So yes, just to step back, as you said, we did have a pretty big drag on our margins this year and it was driven in large part because of input cost. That was the biggest piece, that was 3/4 of it, so I think wood and agave and I'll get to it as we look forward. So really, mix only had a small impact. It was only 1/4 of it, so [ 0.6 ] or so. And when you break it out and you pull it apart, yes, a piece of it is because of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey and the fact that the on-premise were shut down and Jack Daniel's in the U.S. alone is 1 of the top 3 on-premise brands. And so it was impacted significantly and it impacted our margins, of course.
So when we look ahead to F '22, as I said in my script and you just referenced, we are expecting some improvement. I will call -- pause for a moment and the improvements we're expecting is because we do expect some of these last couple of years of hurt from agave to begin to reverse, only began next year. We can talk more about that later if people want to know what we're seeing in that. But we also have had a number of productivity initiatives from our global production organization that will start to begin realized next year. And we've got several years before they're all fully realized because of, again, just a reminder of our aged whiskey products and how things go on to the balance sheet.
And then mix will benefit some but it's not the hugest piece, as I said, this year, I said from this past year and how much it hurt. What I will want to pause and point out for a moment is something that we have included in our forecast and that's a pretty significant increase in commodity costs. Inflationary commodity cost is around double digits is what we currently have forecasted in there. Otherwise, we would have expected a better improving margin next year or this year. And we're going to keep an eye on that, by the way, as I know all consumer products companies are.
But right now, we feel where we sit that we can improve -- expect margins to begin to improve in F '22. And as we look beyond that, we expect improving trends thereafter. As a reminder, tariffs are still in our numbers. They're still dragging down our numbers and hope -- we've got optimistic that, that will go away at some point down the road."

So it gives us some optimism that those levels are going to stay. I don't know if it will stay at a double-digit growth rate, but clearly, everything that is off-premise-focused these days, particularly in American whiskey and tequila, too. I mean, there is -- there has been quite a swing between categories. And thankfully, we -- as I said earlier, we are in the right one.
As far as the wine -- beer and wine, I mean, beer has obviously got a lot more event business to it. And that -- they lost all of that and that helped exaggerate the numbers. But I think in general, the pandemic -- we've said this a few times too. Any trend that was happening prepandemic just accelerated. And so the spirits versus wine and beer would be one of those. Premiumization would be another one and convenience as the other core one. So all 3 of those trends have been working in our favor.

I mean I do know so many bars and restaurants had to reduce their inventories over the last year. And so it became an advantage for established big brands to turn faster, and it made it challenging for newer brands, particularly some of the craft brands that just don't have the ability to continue to push as hard as the major brands do. So there's been this window of opportunity, I think, from companies like Brown-Forman to be able to command a bigger piece of the back bar. And we're going to go make sure that we get more than our fair share of that opportunity as things evolve over the next few months.
In the international side, I mean, yes, it is brand new. It's not even really formed yet. It will be over the next few months. But Europe, obviously, is several months behind in terms of openings of bars and restaurants and didn't make a lot of sense to put a lot of effort on that until the restaurants began to open again. But as I think you all realize, our business outside of the United States, in most markets really is a Jack Daniel's company. And we have a big effort to continue to expand our portfolio in those markets led by like a Woodford Reserve would be a great example.
But our Single Malt Scotches are very important to us. Fords Gin, even Slane Irish Whiskey, those are much smaller brands but brands that we see a bright future for, and that's the purpose of putting these dedicated people in place in these markets that have been so Jack Daniel's-oriented. It's very difficult to build a Slane Irish Whiskey next to Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey. I mean it's just salespeople's incentives need to be aligned behind the right initiatives. And so that's the reason we're doing it. We feel pretty good that it'll -- we'll be in the right place at the right time and hopefully make that into a significant piece of business."

And I know there's a few brands out there that are grabbing a lot of headlines. We seem to be flying a little bit below the radar but know that the growth has been really good.
And the ultra-premium side of tequila is just -- I mean, it is growing so fast. And we've got some -- we've got really a brand called Herradura Legend would be our primary entry in that space. And we've got some other upper-end line extensions that are not huge but certainly taste really good and have a great place with bartenders and can really grow the Herradura name. It's a brand that's one of the authentic Mexican tequilas that's been around for a long, long time, and we play off that heritage and that authenticity in all those SKUs. And that is the way we're going to build these brands.
Other brands are using the celebrities so much in the tequila category. We haven't done that much in this company. We're certainly watching it. It's been fascinating to see how some brands have absolutely taken off with some of the celebrity endorsements. But we're playing this a little bit for the long haul and building brands that we think will be around literally for generations. And so we feel pretty good about it."

And I think what I'm going to talk about here is I'll first talk about, it's impacting us supply chain-wise, disruptions that we're seeing from the materials to the customer. Now when I talk about that, let me break it down a little bit. As you alluded to, we talked about our results being impacted somewhat by the supply constraints in the U.S. where our distributor inventories and our retail inventories are down versus pre-COVID.
And so what's happening there is really we're not unique to this in terms of the back end of what's going on here, which is what you've heard probably from other CPG companies or read that there's lots of transportation and logistics challenges out there that are ramping back up as the economy improves, people start to build back and restock inventory. So we see delays in rail service, container availability and ocean -- time-to-ship things across the ocean, trucking capacity in the U.S. as example. And then labor shortage that we hear in bars and restaurants, it's also in the warehousing industry.
So with that being said, we know that it's -- our inventory levels are down at the end of this past year, as I said, in the U.S. They are also down outside -- in parts of Europe as well. And so we hope and we're working with our teams the best we can. Again, we're at the mercy of the supply chain somewhat in this as things work out.
But when I think about the material aspect of things, because I also said we've had some disruptions on the material side, think about how we make barrels, we've had some disruptions in steel that we use to make the hoops around the barrels. But the key ingredient that we've had some disruptions on is our glass supply. And that is certainly something that is really important to us and something that we are working closely with our supplier now, work out the quality, get behind that and get that resolved.
So as I gave our guidance today, the top line mid-single-digit underlying and same for mid-single-digit bottom line growth, we think at this point, we had these disruptions estimated and covered. But if things get worse, we'll have to update that guidance as we go on in the year."

I'm pleased to share our first quarter results with you as we delivered another quarter of solid growth. As we've seen for many months now, the pandemic has created ups and downs and twists and turns that",1339,"Well, thank you, Sue, and good morning, everyone. I'm pleased to share our first quarter results with you as we delivered another quarter of solid growth. As we've seen for many months now, the pandemic has created ups and downs and twists and turns that have produced a lot of volatility, a lot of uncertainty and even changes in our seasonality. As we indicated on our last conference call, in this quarter, we benefited from the reopening of the on-premise channel, the return of tourism and the lapping of softer comparisons during the early months of the pandemic. 
And once again, I do want to extend my appreciation to the 4,700 Brown-Forman employees that delivered the results that we will review with you today. They're actively engaged in building an environment where we can bring our best selves to work, which enables us to maximize our collective and individual potential and increase our productivity, our creativity and our innovation. So above all, I would like to say thank you to the people of Brown-Forman. The last 18 months have been an exercise in endurance and you have demonstrated nothing but excellence. You are our greatest asset. 
So now let's turn our attention to the headlines of our first quarter. Most notably, our continued momentum on the top line growth with very broad geographical growth, the overall health of our brand portfolio with many brands contributing to solid organic growth. We really don't have a tail anymore that would be a drag on our growth rate. And unfortunately, we continue to see pressure on our gross margin. 
I'll start with the top line, where our overall underlying performance was a plus 18%. When factoring in the 3% underlying top line growth we achieved in Q1 of fiscal '21, our 2-year average growth rate, which we calculated by adding the growth in the first quarter of 2021 with the growth rate this quarter and then divided by 2, but it was nearly 11%. The gains this quarter were driven by Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey returning to growth with underlying net sales of plus 21% or 6% on a 2-year average basis. As we shared with you last fiscal year, JDTW was negatively affected by the restrictions and closures in the on-premise due to its huge presence in this channel when compared to other spirits brands. So last fiscal year was a tough year for JDTW, but as we shared with you, we believe that the disruptions were circumstantial and temporary. The first quarter performance in fiscal '22 reaffirmed that belief as the sales growth was strong. 
Also earlier this week, we were excited. We announced the launch of a Jack Daniel's 10-year-old Tennessee Whiskey, the distillery's first age stated whiskey in more than 100 years. It's already getting some really rave reviews. But I mentioned it just because it is one example of our continued focus on brand innovation and a celebration both of our world-class whiskey-making expertise and the brand's really storied history. The rest of the Jack Daniel's family also delivered solid results, led by double-digit underlying net sales increase from the Jack Daniel's Flavors and Jack Daniels RTDs continue to grow on top of extremely high comparisons. And on a 2-year average basis, we've delivered 20% and increase in underlying net sales growth as consumers continue to look for convenient ways to enjoy mixed cocktails and spirits-based beverages at home. 
In addition to Jack, the rest of our brand portfolio remains well positioned to continue to benefit from the growth in the American whiskey and tequila categories as well as the premiumization trend. Our premium bourbons grew underlying net sales 36% in the first quarter, led by Woodford Reserve and Old Forester. And our tequila portfolio produced 23% underlying net sales growth, with our full strength tequila growing underlying net sales by nearly 50%, which more than offset a decline in new mix as the brand lapped the exceptional growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, driven by the temporary interruption in Mexico's beer supply chain. 
Given the strength of our brands, we're able to focus on value growth and revenue growth management initiatives. As a part of these initiatives, we recently increased prices in the U.S. on Woodford Reserve, Old Forester, el Jimador, Herradura and Chambord and we informed our distributor partners that we are increasing the price of Jack Daniel's over the next few months. 
We also delivered broad-based growth across geographies. The U.S. delivered another strong quarter with 16% underlying net sales growth. Our developed international markets also grew underlying net sales in the double digits and the reopening of on-premise channel as well as a rebound in tourism more substantial contributors to growth. In aggregate, we also experienced strong growth in our emerging international markets as well as travel retail as we cycle the effect of easy comparisons and more markets return to growth and recover from the pandemic. 
We continue to focus on delivering strong top line growth and have a solid start to our fiscal year. Our underlying gross profit increased 17% for the quarter, just slightly behind our top line growth rate. Having said that, we've been facing some challenging cost headwinds for several years now and then you combine those headwinds with the impact of tariffs, and it has resulted in a gross margin contraction. In the first quarter, gross margin was down 70 basis points year-over-year, but we believe the rate of decline is slowing. As the on-premise reopens and premiumization trends continue, we're seeing a reversal of the mix headwinds we experienced last year related to channel, size and portfolio. 
But this positive price/mix was more than offset by the continued cost pressures largely related to agave. Over the past couple of years, we have projected agave cost would begin to decline late in calendar 2021 or early calendar '22. While the price of agave has stabilized below its peak, demand for tequila has increased, given the continued growth in the U.S. and a faster-than-expected rebound in Mexico. So the relief in agave costs will be lower than expected this year. 
Also, as noted in our June call, we're still experiencing many challenges in our supply chain. This is particularly true for key packaging materials, most notably glass, and transportation constraints such as shipping container availability. Leanne will talk more about this in just a few minutes. 
Before I move on from gross margins, I'll share that we remain cautiously optimistic that the U.S. can reach a resolution on the underlying trade disputes with the U.K. and EU by the end of the year, which would result in the removal of tariffs on American whiskey. While we've been hopeful for some time about this, we believe there continues to be a reason for this optimism. The EU and the U.S. have publicly stated their commitment to this time line. And moreover, the U.K. is conducting a review of its retaliatory tariffs, which we hope will highlight that American whiskey bears a disproportionate share of this overall tariff burden. 
In summary, we had a strong start to the year and remain optimistic for continued improvement in the operating environment, yet we also acknowledge the potential for volatility due to the impacts of the evolving pandemic as well as the related impacts of the global supply chain imbalances. In the last 18 months, our resilience and agility has been tested time and time again. And through it all, we have persevered because our priorities have remained the same, keeping our people and our business healthy. This will remain our focus and guide as we navigate future uncertainty. 
We continue to believe we will emerge stronger and better. History has already told us that Brown-Forman is resilient in the face of adversity. Our people respond brilliantly under pressure, and our values will guide us to the right decisions. 
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Leanne who will provide more detail on our first quarter fiscal '22 results."

Compared to fiscal 2021, our reported",1385,"Thank you, Lawson, and good morning, everyone. As Lawson reviewed our headlines for the quarter, I will provide additional details on our business results and our outlook for fiscal 2022. 
Starting with our top line. Compared to fiscal 2021, our reported net sales were up 20% for the quarter. Additionally, we had strong double-digit underlying top line growth, reflecting an increase in distributor inventory levels in the United States, partially offset by the sale of Early Times, Canadian Mist and Collingwood brands during the first quarter of fiscal 2021. 
The increase in distributor inventory is due to the lapping of the reduction related to the buildup in the early stages of the pandemic, which was in our first quarter of fiscal 2021, as well as a build ahead of price increases Lawson mentioned. Although even with the increase in the quarter, we believe distributor inventory levels are still below their pre-pandemic levels due to the various supply chain challenges. 
From an underlying net sales growth perspective, we experienced broad-based growth across all of our geographic clusters of the United States, developed international markets and emerging markets as well as our travel retail channel. The U.S. business, which represents half of our underlying net sales, remained strong, growing underlying net sales 16%. Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey was the single largest contributor to growth, followed by our premium bourbon and tequila brands. 
The reopening of the on-premise, which continues to approach pre-pandemic levels as well as the Kentucky Derby's return to its same spot on the first Saturday in May, fueled volume gains. In addition, net sales benefited from continued portfolio premiumization mix and favorable channel and size mix. 
In the off-premise channel, we continue to experience solid growth compared to the same period 2 years ago, even as the on-premise continue to reopen. The on-premise recovery accelerated during the quarter as vaccination rates increased and restrictions were eased or removed. If you look at OpenTable trends through mid-August, they are only slightly below their pre-pandemic levels. 
In the e-premise channel, our market share, which is slightly above 2%, has grown 4x since the start of the pandemic. Even as the on-premise reopens and consumers begin to return to in-store shopping, e-premise remains an important channel to consumers. On a global basis, as this channel continues to develop, we are supporting its growth with the creation of the recently announced integrated marketing communications group and we are excited about the talent joining Brown-Forman as a part of this team. 
Developed international markets collectively delivered strong underlying net sales growth, up double digits for the quarter with broad-based growth across the markets. The Jack Daniel's Family of Brands experienced strong growth, driven by the reopening of the on-premise as well as a rebound of tourism in markets such as Spain and Czechia, which supported Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey double-digit volume growth. 
Jack Daniel's RTDs continued to grow with higher volumes in Germany, where we continue to be a category leader. Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey grew volume high single digits, led by gains in Korea and Czechia and collectively, the Super Premium brands, Gentleman Jack and Jack Daniel's Single Barrel, grew volume double digits. The newest member of the Jack Daniel's family, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple, continues its international rollout launching in the Netherlands, Lithuania, Hungary, Slovakia and Italy and is off to a strong start in those markets. Collectively, our emerging markets continue to rebound with very strong double-digit underlying net sales growth, driven by strong underlying growth from Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, particularly in Turkey, Brazil and Chile. 
Jack Daniel's Flavors more than doubled in both Chile and Brazil as we benefit from the launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple, while Herradura grew triple digits in Mexico as Q1 volumes surpassed pre-pandemic levels. Finally, as expected, our Travel Retail business experienced a strong rebound, though volumes remain below their pre-pandemic levels as international airline travel and the cruise business have yet to fully recover. 
Lawson shared the details on our gross margin, so I will now turn to our operating expenses. Similar to the fourth quarter of last fiscal year and as expected, we significantly increased our A&P spend, which grew over 40% on both a reported and underlying basis. We continue to support the momentum behind our iconic brands by investing in world-class advertising to drive our sales. 
In the first quarter, we did lap the impacts of the early stages of the pandemic, where on-premise activations were canceled, consumer events such as the Kentucky Derby, summer festivals and sponsorships were rescheduled or canceled, and in the month of July last year, we paused on certain social media platforms. 
From an absolute dollar perspective, our level of investment in Q1 more closely reflects the normal seasonalization of our spend. Our underlying SG&A investment increased double digits, driven by the timing of compensation-related expenses, non-income tax items and the cycling of lower discretionary spend during the same period last year due to the impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
In total, we grew underlying operating income 15% for the first quarter. On a reported basis, operating income declined 25% due to the sale of Early Times, Canadian Mist and Collingwood brands last year. This, combined with an increase in our effective tax rate, resulted in a 41% diluted EPS decrease of $0.40 per share. 
And finally, to our fiscal 2022 outlook. Even with the volatility and resurgence of COVID-19, we remain confident in our top line growth momentum. We believe our portfolio is well positioned to capitalize on the reopening of the on-premise channel, the recovery of countries heavily reliant on tourism, some degree of business and personal travel resuming and the growing premiumization trends. In aggregate, we expect strong growth in our emerging markets as well as Travel Retail, which will cycle the effect of easy comparisons as they begin to stabilize and recover. Further, we do not expect the noncore business mainly used barrel sales to have a material impact on our business this fiscal year. 
Turning to gross margins. Currently, we are managing through the impact of global supply chain disruptions, including glass supply and challenging cost headwinds. Similar to others, we are experiencing greater-than-expected logistics cost, higher input costs on items such as grain and aluminum, agave costs that are below their peak and stable, though easing at a slower pace than previously forecasted due to higher demand within the category. 
In addition, with the rebound and recovery of our markets and channels, coupled with strong consumer demand for our brands, we are currently managing through glass supply constraints. We have deployed a number of risk mitigation strategies and are working actively with our suppliers and distributor partners to optimize our supply chain to meet the consumer demand. 
While we expect these disruptions to persist throughout the fiscal year, we believe that the impact will become less significant in the second half of the year. As a result of these factors, we now expect our gross margin to be flat or slightly down for the fiscal year versus the slight improvement we originally anticipated. 
We expect our operating investments, advertising and SG&A to be in the mid-single-digit range as we continue to invest behind our brands to support top line growth and progress various strategic initiatives, including 3 new RTCs, the expansion of our emerging brands team in select international markets focused on growing our super-premium portfolio, and increasing our digital marketing and e-commerce capabilities. 
Similar to last fiscal year, we do expect the seasonality of our results to be volatile during the year, particularly in operating income. Despite these challenges and excluding any potential impact from changes in tariffs, we continue to expect both our underlying net sales and underlying operating income to grow in the mid-single-digit range. Lastly, we expect our fiscal 2022 effective tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 23%. 
In summary, and as Lawson stated, we have had a strong start to fiscal 2022. While uncertainty and volatility will likely continue to be a significant part of our business environment this year, our brands are strong, our top line has momentum, and we remain well positioned with a strong balance sheet and cash flows.

You're correct in that it is glass related largely for us. And again, similar to others in the operating environment that we're in, like many other CPG companies, we are seeing challenges across packaging material all the way through logistics services. 
As you can see on Slide 4, as an example, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, rebounded strongly from a negative 10% in Q1 of '21 to a plus 21% in this current quarter. We did support that growth by drawing down some of our finished goods inventory. And with the glass suppliers, we are working closely with them to increase our capacity that's available to us and working closely with our distributor partners. We continue to deploy several of our risk mitigation teams against these strategies and closely partnering with everyone in the supply chain. 
We do believe that our current guidance reflects these challenges and volatility. We believe that as we navigate through the challenges and headwinds that we will have a better understanding of this impact as we get through our next quarter. And we did state that as we believe these challenges will persist through the fiscal year, but we believe they will ease in the back half of the year. Lawson?"

We're a little more cautious on Q2, to be honest. We are -- we have drawn down inventory levels across both distributors depending on the country and different wholesalers and all the way down through retail. And so there's only so much maneuvering you can do on that. And so we're at a higher risk. It hasn't happened yet, but that is one of the reasons we're a little more cautious on the guidance for the full year, is we're just not sure how much glass we're going to be able to acquire over the next -- really, in the next few months that seem to be at risk as we've worked very hard with our glass supplier over the last, really over the summer to ensure that we're getting all the glass that we can get from them.

What I think is almost more interesting and it's just we've tried to peel back the numbers and cut through the noise and understand what's happening in the off-premise, because the numbers are still very, very strong in the U.S. And so you're not seeing a pullback in the off-premise, you're not really seeing an acceleration either, but they're already off of very elevated numbers anyway. 
But if you take -- my preferred way to look at that really is take-- just take a Nielsen data as an example and take the full year, the 52-week results and do a 2-year stack on that, the numbers are still really -- I mean, they're still in the low double digits, and the 13 weeks is better than the 52 weeks. So there is enough evidence out there that I think gives us some confidence that overall consumer takeaway remains strong and remains elevated above where it was pre-pandemic."

You referenced 2013 because that was an era when American whiskey really took off and the supply was short of it. And we were -- we, as the sort of market leaders, were able to get a lot of pricing through. 
But you're right, we have been pretty -- it's been pretty flattish over the last few years, particularly as a lot of our competitors got more aggressive. And we found ourselves in a challenging spot. So fast forward to this year or really the last few months, not only -- I mean, there are costs that are flowing through, you have seen those, and that's one reason to be a little more aggressive with price. But the competitive set now this time, unlike a few years ago, is starting to go up, too. And so we got more aggressive both in American whiskey and tequila and a couple of other brands too, because we could and we want to be pricing leaders. We've been saying that for a while, and it's been challenging, but it feels good that finally, we're getting some of this to flow through."

And do you see perhaps the second leg of the distribute space RTD sourcing growth from the hard seltzers? 
And likewise, do you see some of these beer hard seltzer brands? How do you see them moving into spirits and some of the spirits brands and even nonalcoholic into RTDs? Do you see these lines blurring between brands and segments? Or do you think this is sustainable? Is that something that Brown-Forman could be looking to do more of going forward?"

So I mean, I'll start, Leanne, you can certainly add in. Look, RTDs have been a huge business for Brown-Forman for a long time. And so many folks are focusing on the U.S. market and seltzers.

And so many folks are focusing on the U.S. market and seltzers. I get it, where the vast majority of our RTs are outside of the United States. It's a very big business for us, something in the range of -- it's about 18 million cases or so outside of the United States compared to only  [ 3-ish million ] inside. So very different. 
Now country cocktails, I mean, as much as you've seen a slowdown in the Seltzer world, we have not seen a material slowdown in country cocktails. But some of that, we know, is a benefit from switching from our own internal network in the past. They're new, they only assume sales of the brand at the beginning of this fiscal. So it's finding all these new distribution points, and the brand is still flying. And so we've done very well with that and feel pretty good about it. 
As far as seltzer is taking share or impacting the spirits business, I mean, we've been trying to look at that for a while, and I'll give the same answer I've given before. It's pretty far -- the seltzer occasion and the whiskey drinker for the large part, are pretty -- it's not the same occasion in many, many ways. And it's not even really the same consumer in many ways. And so we just don't think we've seen much in the way of an impact or lost share to the seltzers. And if you really just look at the numbers, I mean, American whiskey is doing as well as it ever has in total as a category. 
So I just don't -- and I'm saying that over the last few years, I just don't see that the seltzers have really taken much share at that. I mean, it feels like the seltzers are coming at vodka and tonic maybe or gin and tonic, and maybe putting a little dent in that business. But for us, that's a -- it would be a very small part of our overall portfolio."

And those months of May and June were so volatile in the last couple of years. And so over the short term, it's tough to dissect and you've got to use a little bit of art to make the comparison. 
But if I step back and just talk about the U.S., I mean, this is some of what I already said, we're basically -- we've been saying for a long time, the algorithm for our business has been grow the U.S. business about a TDS, a couple of points higher in our developed international and then particularly in the good years, we get well into double-digit growth in our emerging markets. 
That sort of overall medium-term to longer-term growth algorithm, I think is still very relevant. If the one that I have the most data on is obviously going to be the U.S., and we're right at TDS for the most part, depends on which time period you pick in all that. But I mean literally, plus or minus 1 point from TDS. And I -- as I said on one of the previous questions, the total takeaway numbers in the U.S. market remain elevated. And I'm not sure if it's going to hold throughout the entirety of the fiscal year or -- I mean, we're all sort of expecting it to slow down, but it's not happening yet. 
And I do think that has a lot to do with for us. I mean, look, Jack Daniel's Black Label has always had a challenge to grow at a rate of TDS just given its absolute size. But we have the rest of our portfolio, which has gotten much more meaningful in the last few years is well into double-digit growth mode and many of the brands are significantly higher growth rates than that. And I'll cite something that we said last quarter, which I still find to be an interesting statistic because it just would not have been true only a couple of years ago. So this is fiscal year and I'm backing up 1 quarter, but Jack Daniel's globally, sales were down 4%, and the company did a plus 6% for the full year. That is dramatic growth in the rest of portfolio for Brown-Forman and that continues to be our results even now. 
And so yes, we're feeling good and we feel like we've got a lot more growth drivers now than we would have had just a handful of years ago. And we've gotten rid of the tail and the other part of it is. As you know, we've had 4 or 5 brands that we sold in the last 5 years that were all in decline, and that certainly makes it easier to grow a little faster, too."

It's not coming out of distributors' pocket. It's coming out of the consumer, who is willing to pay a little bit more to get the product delivered. But I think if you're trying to analyze the economics of the U.S. e-commerce business, it's kind of neutral, I think, for the suppliers for the most part. 
Now if you start to get into the conversation around direct shipping say, from Woodford to another state, that gets -- that's a little different. That is a very, very tiny business. That doesn't work well within the 3-tier system very well. And it's so small right now that I don't even know if I could give you a good answer on the question. But if you move into Europe, say or certainly Asia, where we have set up e-commerce platforms. In that case, you're taking a retailer out of the mix. And so somebody is going to get a piece of that margin, and we would get a piece of it and then whoever our fulfillment partner is we get a piece of that. But I think that's largely more profitable per case than regular business. And then China would really be the same thing as Europe in terms of it's a much bigger business over there.

We're going to spend a fair amount of time talking about Woodford and its long-term potential. So I don't want to steal all the thunder from that.

And so we've taken those lessons and we've put it into some of the bigger markets of Europe and another in Australia. And I expect we will expand that idea over the next few years to really get some focus on it. A big lesson learned is it's Woodford and these brands would be equivalent to a [indiscernible] in the United States or something where it's small, relative, particularly the Jack Daniel's portfolio. And so incremental focus on that brand and you get paid back very quickly. And so it's one of the bigger strategic platforms that we have, I think, for the next few years is not only Woodford, but really going to push on Gentleman Jack as an example. We're going to push on our single malts, really the super premium and ultra-premium brands that get a little bit of focus and get a better growth rate.

I mean, yes, we've been saying this for a couple of years, and I'm honest, we have -- if I'm honest, we've not delivered to the extent I would like to see. But having your own -- controlling your own route to market gives you the ability to grow your portfolio outside of just Jack Daniel's. If we had not made those moves in the last decade, we would be strategically disadvantaged because nobody wants to build brand-new brands as a distributor. It's just too hard and it doesn't -- they don't make enough money at it. And so that was -- has always been one of the underlying strategies for doing that. 
Now having said that, tequila opportunity outside of the U.S., we had been -- it's primarily been an el Jimador play to date. A lot of consumers outside of the U.S. really just think of tequila as a Margarita input. That is changing, I think, over time. But we have a decent el Jimador business in a lot of -- South America, believe it or not. Australia and the U.K., I would say, would be our principal markets where we've developed that. 
What I want to see is Herradura begin to get seated in those markets, teach consumers that there are other ways to drink it other than the margarita and Herradura is a great one to go ahead and do that. And I do think the authenticity that the Herradura brand has relative to many of the other big tequila brands that are sold in the U.S. is an advantage for us. Some of the celebrity-driven brands, I don't want to say I don't have a chance outside of the U.S., but I mean it's more of a U.S. phenomenon for those actors and actresses. 
So I think we do have a right to win with Herradura outside of the United States, and there will be a much bigger, but there's definitely going to be increased emphasis on trying to develop that brand outside of the U.S."

And just use Germany as an example, because it was driven, it was the very first one. I guess Australia was first. But Germany was one -- second or third market in the world, where we put that in place a decade ago and man, we have grown so much in that market over the past 10 years. It's just been fantastic.

I'm pleased to share our first quarter results with you as we delivered another quarter of solid growth. As we've seen for many months now, the pandemic has created ups and downs and twists and turns that have produced a lot of volatility, a lot of uncertainty and even changes in our seasonality. As we indicated on our last conference call, in this quarter, we benefited from the reopening of the on-premise channel, the return of tourism and the lapping of softer comparisons during the early months of the pandemic.  
And once again, I do want to extend my appreciation to the 4,700 Brown-Forman employees that delivered the results that we will review with you today. They're actively engaged in building an environment where we can bring our best selves to work, which enables us to maximize our collective and individual potential and increase our productivity, our creativity and our innovation. So above all, I would like to say thank you to the people of Brown-Forman. The last 18 months have been an exercise in endurance and you have demonstrated nothing but excellence. You are our greatest asset.  
So now let's turn our attention to the headlines of our first quarter. Most notably, our continued momentum on the top line growth with very broad geographical growth, the overall health of our brand portfolio with many brands contributing to solid organic growth. We really don't have a tail anymore that would be a drag on our growth rate. And unfortunately, we continue to see pressure on our gross margin.  
I'll start with the top line, where our overall underlying performance was a plus 18%. When factoring in the 3% underlying top line growth we achieved in Q1 of fiscal '21, our 2-year average growth rate, which we calculated by adding the growth in the first quarter of 2021 with the growth rate this quarter and then divided by 2, it was nearly 11%. The gains this quarter were driven by Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey returning to growth with underlying net sales of plus 21% or 6% on a 2-year average basis. As we shared with you last fiscal year, JDTW was negatively affected by the restrictions and closures in the on-premise due to its huge presence in this channel when compared to other spirits brands. So last fiscal year was a tough year for JDTW, but as we shared with you, we believe that the disruptions were circumstantial and temporary. The first quarter performance in fiscal '22 reaffirmed that belief as the sales growth was strong.  
Also earlier this week, we were excited. We announced the launch of a Jack Daniel's 10-year-old Tennessee Whiskey, the distillery's first age stated whiskey in more than 100 years. It's already getting some really rave reviews. But I mentioned it just because it is one example of our continued focus on brand innovation and a celebration both of our world-class whiskey-making expertise and the brand's really storied history. The rest of the Jack Daniel's family also delivered solid results, led by double-digit underlying net sales increase from the Jack Daniel's flavors and Jack Daniel's RTDs continue to grow on top of extremely high comparisons. And on a 2-year average basis, we've delivered 20% in increase in underlying net sales growth as consumers continue to look for convenient ways to enjoy mixed cocktails and spirits-based beverages at home.  
In addition to Jack, the rest of our brand portfolio remains well positioned to continue to benefit from the growth in the American whiskey and tequila categories as well as the premiumization trend. Our premium bourbons grew underlying net sales 36% in the first quarter, led by Woodford Reserve and Old Forester. And our tequila portfolio produced 23% underlying net sales growth, with our full-strength tequila growing underlying net sales by nearly 50%, which more than offset a decline in new mix as the brand lapped the exceptional growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, driven by the temporary interruption in Mexico's beer supply chain.  
Given the strength of our brands, we're able to focus on value growth and revenue growth management initiatives. As a part of these initiatives, we recently increased prices in the U.S. on Woodford Reserve, Old Forester, el Jimador, Herradura and Chambord and we informed our distributor partners that we are increasing the price of Jack Daniel's over the next few months. We also delivered broad-based growth across geographies. The U.S. delivered another strong quarter with 16% underlying net sales growth. Our developed international markets also grew underlying net sales in the double digits and the reopening in the on-premise channel as well as a rebound in tourism were substantial contributors to growth. In aggregate, we also experienced strong growth in our emerging international markets as well as travel retail as we cycle the effect of easy comparisons and more markets return to growth and recover from the pandemic.  
We continue to focus on delivering strong top line growth and have a solid start to our fiscal year. Our underlying gross profit increased 17% for the quarter, just slightly behind our top line growth rate. Having said that, we've been facing some challenging cost headwinds for several years now and then you combine those headwinds with the impact of tariffs, and it has resulted in a gross margin contraction. In the first quarter, gross margin was down 70 basis points year-over-year, but we believe the rate of decline is slowing. 
As the on-premise reopens and premiumization trends continue, we're seeing a reversal of the mix headwinds we experienced last year related to channel, size and portfolio. But this positive price/mix was more than offset by the continued cost pressures largely related to agave. Over the past couple of years, we have projected agave cost would begin to decline late in calendar 2021 or early calendar '22. While the price of agave has stabilized below its peak, demand for tequila has increased, given the continued growth in the U.S. and a faster-than-expected rebound in Mexico. So the relief in agave costs will be lower than expected this year.  
Also, as noted in our June call, we're still experiencing many challenges in our supply chain. This is particularly true for key packaging materials, most notably glass, and transportation constraints such as shipping container availability. Leanne will talk more about this in just a few minutes.  
Before I move on from gross margins, I'll share that we remain cautiously optimistic that the U.S. can reach a resolution on the underlying trade disputes with the U.K. and EU by the end of the year, which would result in the removal of tariffs on American whiskey. While we've been hopeful for some time about this, we believe there continues to be a reason for this optimism. The EU and the U.S. have publicly stated their commitment to this time line. And moreover, the U.K. is conducting a review of its retaliatory tariffs, which we hope will highlight that American whiskey bears a disproportionate share of this overall tariff burden.  
In summary, we had a strong start to the year and remain optimistic for continued improvement in the operating environment, yet we also acknowledge the potential for volatility due to the impacts of the evolving pandemic as well as the related impacts of the global supply chain imbalances. In the last 18 months, our resilience and agility has been tested time and time again. And through it all, we have persevered because our priorities have remained the same, keeping our people and our business healthy. This will remain our focus and guide as we navigate future uncertainty.  
We continue to believe we will emerge stronger and better. History has already told us that Brown-Forman is resilient in the face of adversity. Our people respond brilliantly under pressure, and our values will guide us to the right decisions.  
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Leanne who will provide more detail on our first quarter fiscal '22 results."

As Lawson reviewed our headlines for the quarter, I will provide additional details on our business results and our outlook for fiscal 2022.  Starting with our top line. Compared to fiscal 2021, our reporte",1384,"Thank you, Lawson, and good morning, everyone. As Lawson reviewed our headlines for the quarter, I will provide additional details on our business results and our outlook for fiscal 2022.  
Starting with our top line. Compared to fiscal 2021, our reported net sales were up 20% for the quarter. Additionally, we had strong double-digit underlying top line growth, reflecting an increase in distributor inventory levels in the United States, partially offset by the sale of Early Times, Canadian Mist and Collingwood brands during the first quarter of fiscal 2021. The increase in distributor inventory is due to the lapping of the reduction related to the buildup in the early stages of the pandemic, which was in our first quarter of fiscal 2021, as well as a build ahead of price increases Lawson mentioned.  
Although even with the increase in the quarter, we believe distributor inventory levels are still below their pre-pandemic levels due to the various supply chain challenges. From an underlying net sales growth perspective, we experienced broad-based growth across all of our geographic clusters of the United States, developed international markets and emerging markets as well as our travel retail channel. The U.S. business, which represents half of our underlying net sales, remained strong, growing underlying net sales 16%. Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey was the single largest contributor to growth, followed by our premium bourbon and tequila brands. The reopening of the on-premise, which continues to approach pre-pandemic levels, as well as the Kentucky Derby's return to its same spot on the first Saturday in May fueled volume gains. In addition, net sales benefited from continued portfolio premiumization mix and favorable channel and size mix.  
In the off-premise channel, we continue to experience solid growth compared to the same period 2 years ago, even as the on-premise continue to reopen. The on-premise recovery accelerated during the quarter as vaccination rates increased and restrictions were eased or removed. If you look at OpenTable trends through mid-August, they are only slightly below their pre-pandemic levels.  
In the e-premise channel, our market share, which is slightly above 2%, has grown 4x since the start of the pandemic. Even as the on-premise reopens and consumers begin to return to in-store shopping, e-premise remains an important channel to consumers. On a global basis, as this channel continues to develop, we are supporting its growth with the creation of the recently announced integrated marketing communications group and we are excited about the talent joining Brown-Forman as a part of this team.  
Developed international markets collectively delivered strong underlying net sales growth, up double digits for the quarter with broad-based growth across the markets. The Jack Daniel's Family of Brands experienced strong growth, driven by the reopening of the on-premise as well as a rebound of tourism in markets such as Spain and Czechia, which supported Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey double-digit volume growth.  
Jack Daniel's RTDs continued to grow with higher volumes in Germany, where we continue to be a category leader. Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey grew volume high single digits, led by gains in Korea and Czechia and collectively, the super-premium brands, Gentleman Jack and Jack Daniel's Single Barrel, grew volume double digits. The newest member of the Jack Daniel's family, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple, continues its international rollout launching in the Netherlands, Lithuania, Hungary, Slovakia and Italy and is off to a strong start in those markets. Collectively, our emerging markets continue to rebound with very strong double-digit underlying net sales growth, driven by strong underlying growth from Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, particularly in Turkey, Brazil and Chile.  
Jack Daniel's flavors more than doubled in both Chile and Brazil as we benefit from the launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple, while Herradura grew triple digits in Mexico as Q1 volumes surpassed pre-pandemic levels. Finally, as expected, our Travel Retail business experienced a strong rebound, though volumes remain below their pre-pandemic levels as international airline travel and the cruise business have yet to fully recover.  
Lawson shared the details on our gross margin, so I will now turn to our operating expenses. Similar to the fourth quarter of last fiscal year and as expected, we significantly increased our A&P spend, which grew over 40% on both a reported and underlying basis. We continue to support the momentum behind our iconic brands by investing in world-class advertising to drive our sales.  
In the first quarter, we did lap the impacts of the early stages of the pandemic, where on-premise activations were canceled, consumer events such as the Kentucky Derby, summer festivals and sponsorships were rescheduled or canceled, and in the month of July last year, we paused on certain social media platforms.  
From an absolute dollar perspective, our level of investment in Q1 more closely reflects the normal seasonalization of our spend. Our underlying SG&A investment increased double digits, driven by the timing of compensation-related expenses, non-income tax items and the cycling of lower discretionary spend during the same period last year due to the impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic.  
In total, we grew underlying operating income 15% for the first quarter. On a reported basis, operating income declined 25% due to the sale of Early Times, Canadian Mist and Collingwood brands last year. This, combined with an increase in our effective tax rate, resulted in a 41% diluted EPS decrease of $0.40 per share.  
And finally, to our fiscal 2022 outlook. Even with the volatility and resurgence of COVID-19, we remain confident in our top line growth momentum. We believe our portfolio is well positioned to capitalize on the reopening of the on-premise channel, the recovery of countries heavily reliant on tourism, some degree of business and personal travel resuming and the growing premiumization trends. In aggregate, we expect strong growth in our emerging markets as well as Travel Retail, which will cycle the effect of easy comparisons as they begin to stabilize and recover. Further, we do not expect the noncore business, mainly used barrel sales, to have a material impact on our business this fiscal year.  
Turning to gross margins. Currently, we are managing through the impact of global supply chain disruptions, including glass supply and challenging cost headwinds. Similar to others, we are experiencing greater-than-expected logistics cost, higher input costs on items such as grain and aluminum, agave costs that are below their peak and stable, though easing at a slower pace than previously forecasted due to higher demand within the category. In addition, with the rebound and recovery of our markets and channels, coupled with strong consumer demand for our brands, we are currently managing through glass supply constraints. We have deployed a number of risk mitigation strategies and are working actively with our suppliers and distributor partners to optimize our supply chain to meet the consumer demand.  
While we expect these disruptions to persist throughout the fiscal year, we believe that the impact will become less significant in the second half of the year. As a result of these factors, we now expect our gross margin to be flat or slightly down for the fiscal year versus the slight improvement we originally anticipated.  
We expect our operating investments, advertising and SG&A to be in the mid-single-digit range as we continue to invest behind our brands to support top line growth and progress various strategic initiatives, including 3 new RTCs, the expansion of our emerging brands team in select international markets focused on growing our super-premium portfolio, and increasing our digital marketing and e-commerce capabilities.  
Similar to last fiscal year, we do expect the seasonality of our results to be volatile during the year, particularly in operating income. Despite these challenges and excluding any potential impact from changes in tariffs, we continue to expect both our underlying net sales and underlying operating income to grow in the mid-single-digit range. Lastly, we expect our fiscal 2022 effective tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 23%.  
In summary, and as Lawson stated, we have had a strong start to fiscal 2022.

You're correct in that it is glass related largely for us. And again, similar to others in the operating environment that we're in, like many other CPG companies, we are seeing challenges across packaging material all the way through logistics services.  
As you can see on Slide 4, as an example, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey rebounded strongly from a negative 10% in Q1 of '21 to a plus 21% in this current quarter.  We did support that growth by drawing down some of our finished goods inventory. And with the glass suppliers, we are working closely with them to increase our capacity that's available to us and working closely with our distributor partners. We continue to deploy several of our risk mitigation teams against these strategies and closely partnering with everyone in the supply chain. 
We do believe that our current guidance reflects these challenges and volatility. We believe that as we navigate through the challenges and headwinds that we will have a better understanding of this impact as we get through our next quarter. And we did state that as we believe these challenges will persist through the fiscal year, but we believe they will ease in the back half of the year. Lawson?"

It hasn't happened yet, but that is one of the reasons we're a little more cautious on the guidance for the full year, is we're just not sure how much glass we're going to be able to acquire over the next -- really, it's the next few months that seem to be at risk as we've worked very hard with our glass supplier over the last, really over the summer to ensure that we're getting all the glass that we can get from them.

What I think is almost more interesting and it's just -- we've tried to peel back the numbers and cut through the noise and understand what's happening in the off-premise because the numbers are still very, very strong in the U.S. And so you're not seeing a pullback in the off-premise. You're not really seeing an acceleration either, but they're already off of very elevated numbers anyway. 
But if you take -- my preferred way to look at that really is take -- just take the Nielsen data as an example and take the full year, the 52-week results, and do a 2-year stack on that. The numbers are still really -- I mean, they're still in the low double digits, and the 13-week is better than the 52-week.

The financial crisis hit in 2008 and '09-ish and that pricing went away and it really never came back. You referenced 2013 because that was an era when American whiskey really took off and the supply was short of it. And we were -- we, as the sort of market leaders, were able to get a lot of pricing through. 
But you're right, we have been pretty -- it's been pretty flattish over the last few years, particularly as a lot of our competitors got more aggressive. And we found ourselves in a challenging spot. So fast forward to this year or really the last few months, not only -- I mean, there are costs that are flowing through, you have seen those, and that's one reason to be a little more aggressive with price. But the competitive set now in this time, unlike a few years ago, is starting to go up, too. And so we got more aggressive both in American whiskey and tequila and a couple of other brands too because we could, and we want to be pricing leaders. We've been saying that for a while, and it's been challenging, but it feels good that finally, we're getting some of this to flow through."

So I was wondering if you can comment about the recent slowdown perhaps, obviously, you're not in hard seltzers per se. But does it give you any pause on devoting some of these resources to the segment? And do you see perhaps the second leg of the distillate space RTD sourcing growth from the hard seltzers? 
And likewise, do you see -- some of these beer and hard seltzer brands, how do you see them moving into spirits and some of the spirits brands and even nonalcoholic into RTDs? Do you see these lines blurring between brands and segments? Or do you think this is sustainable? Is that something that Brown-Forman could be looking to do more of going forward?"

Look, RTDs have been a huge business for Brown-Forman for a long time. And so many folks are focusing on the U.S. market and seltzers, I get it, where the vast majority of our RTs are outside of the United States. It's a very big business for us, something in the range of -- it's about 18 million cases or so outside of the United States compared to only 3 million-ish inside. So very different. 
Now Country Cocktails, I mean, as much as you've seen a slowdown in the seltzer world, we have not seen a material slowdown in Country Cocktails. But some of that, we know, is a benefit from switching from our own internal network in the past. They're new, they only assumed sales of the brand at the beginning of this fiscal. So it's finding all these new distribution points, and the brand is still flying. And so we've done very well with that and feel pretty good about it. 
As far as seltzers taking share or impacting the spirits business, I mean, we've been trying to look at that for a while, and I'll give the same answer I've given before. It's pretty far -- the seltzer occasion and the whiskey drinker for the large part, are pretty -- it's not the same occasion in many, many ways. And it's not even really the same consumer in many ways. And so we just don't think we've seen much in the way of an impact or lost share to the seltzers. And if you really just look at the numbers, I mean, American whiskey is doing as well as it ever has in total as a category. 
So I just don't -- and I'm saying that over the last few years, I just don't see that the seltzers have really taken much share at that. I mean, it feels like the seltzers are coming at vodka and tonic maybe or gin and tonic, and maybe putting a little dent in that business. But for us, that's a -- it would be a very small part of our overall portfolio."

And those months of May and June were so volatile in the last couple of years. And so over the short term, it's tough to dissect and you've got to use a little bit of art to make the comparisons. 
But if I step back and just talk about the U.S., I mean, this is some of what I already said. We're basically -- we've been saying for a long time, the algorithm for our business has been grow the U.S. business about at TDS, a couple of points higher in our developed international and then particularly in the good years, we get well into double-digit growth in our emerging markets. 
That sort of overall medium-term to longer-term growth algorithm, I think, is still very relevant. If -- the one that I have the most data on is obviously going to be the U.S., and we're right at TDS for the most part, depends on which time period you pick and all that. But I mean literally, plus or minus 1 point from TDS. And I -- as I said on one of the previous questions, the total takeaway numbers in the U.S. market remain elevated. And I'm not sure if it's going to hold throughout the entirety of the fiscal year or -- I mean, we're all sort of expecting it to slow down, but it's not happening yet. 
And I do think that has a lot to do with for us -- I mean, look, Jack Daniel's Black Label has always had a challenge to grow at a rate of TDS just given its absolute size. But we have the rest of our portfolio, which has gotten much more meaningful in the last few years, is it well into double-digit growth mode and many of the brands are at significantly higher growth rates than that. And I'll cite something that we said last quarter, which I still find to be an interesting statistic because it just would not have been true only a couple of years ago. So this is fiscal year and I'm backing up 1 quarter, but Jack Daniel's globally, sales were down 4%, and the company did a plus 6% for the full year. That is dramatic growth in the rest of portfolio for Brown-Forman and that continues to be our results even now. 
And so yes, we're feeling good and we feel like we've got a lot more growth drivers now than we would have had just a handful of years ago. And we've gotten rid of the tail. That was the other part of it is. As you know, we've had 4 or 5 brands that we sold in the last 5 years that were all in decline, and that certainly makes it easier to grow a little faster, too."

It's not coming out of distributors' pocket. It's coming out of the consumer, who is willing to pay a little bit more to get the product delivered. But I think if you're trying to analyze the economics of the U.S. e-commerce business, it's kind of neutral, I think, for the suppliers for the most part. 
Now if you start to get into the conversation around direct shipping say, from Woodford to another state, that gets -- that's a little different. That is a very, very tiny business. That doesn't work well within the 3-tier system very well. And it's so small right now that I don't even know if I could give you a good answer on the question. But if you move into Europe, say, or certainly Asia, where we have set up e-commerce platforms, in that case, you're taking a retailer out of the mix. And so somebody is going to get a piece of that margin, and we would get a piece of it and then whoever our fulfillment partner is would get a piece of that. But I think that's largely more profitable per case than regular business. And then China would really be the same thing as Europe in terms of it's a much bigger business over there. 
But you are cutting out tiers in the supply chain. So just like it does frame us on nonalcohol products, say, or for a lot of suppliers that use Amazon, it's different because you're cutting out the retail."

We're going to spend a fair amount of time talking about Woodford and its long-term potential. So I don't want to steal all the thunder from that.

And so we've taken those lessons and we've put it into some of the bigger markets of Europe and another in Australia. And I expect we will expand that idea over the next few years to really get some focus on it. A big lesson learned is it's -- Woodford and these brands would be equivalent to a GlenDronach in the United States or something where it's small relative particularly to the Jack Daniel's portfolio. And so incremental focus on that brand and you get paid back very quickly. And so it's one of the bigger strategic platforms that we have, I think, for the next few years is not only Woodford, but really going to push on Gentleman Jack as an example. We're going to push on our single malts, really the super-premium and ultra-premium brands that get a little bit of focus and get a better growth rate. And so yes, you're going to hear a lot more about Woodford and its international growth plans, not only tomorrow, but in upcoming quarters, too."

But having your own -- controlling your own route to market gives you the ability to grow your portfolio outside of just Jack Daniel's. If we had not made those moves in the last decade, we would be strategically disadvantaged because nobody wants to build brand-new brands as a distributor. It's just too hard and it doesn't -- they don't make enough money at it. And so that was -- has always been one of the underlying strategies for doing that. 
Now having said that, tequila opportunity outside of the U.S., we had been -- it's primarily been an el Jimador play to date. A lot of consumers outside of the U.S. really just think of tequila as a margarita input. That is changing, I think, over time. But we have a decent el Jimador business in a lot of -- South America, believe it or not. Australia and the U.K., I would say, would be our principal markets where we've developed that. 
What I want to see is Herradura begin to get a seat in those markets, teach consumers that there are other ways to drink it other than the margarita, and Herradura is a great one to go ahead and do that. And I do think the authenticity that the Herradura brand has relative to many of the other big tequila brands that are sold in the U.S. is an advantage for us. Some of the celebrity-driven brands, I don't want to say they don't have a chance outside of the U.S., but I mean it's more of a U.S. phenomenon for those actors and actresses. 
So I think we do have a right to win with Herradura outside of the United States, and there will be a -- I would say much bigger, but there's definitely going to be increased emphasis on trying to develop that brand outside of the U.S."

I'm pleased to share our second quarter and first half of fiscal '22 results with you today. But before I do, we'll open up with a toast, a toast to the fact that after 3.5 years, the U.S. and EU reached an agreement on trade in steel and aluminum and the EU will be removing tariffs on American whiskey on January 1, 2022. 
The tariffs have been in place longer than I've been in this role. And as such, it's been 1 of the most discussed topics of my tenure as CEO, having been a part of our conversations in the past 12 quarterly earnings calls as well as the last 3 annual stockholder meetings. It's been an exhausting and expensive chapter in the company's 151-year history, as we've been so proportional to tee by the tariffs compared to our competitors. We've remained strong and resilient as an organization, and I believe we are very well positioned to deliver solid growth in the short and the medium and in the long term. That said though, you can be certain that we look forward to the return of a level playing field for American whiskey in the EU and hope a similar outcome can very soon be achieved between the U.S. and the U.K. 
So with that, let's turn our attention to the other headlines of our first half. First, our top line growth remains strong, driven by the reopening of the on-premise channel, the return of tourism and the cycling of the lower comparisons during the first half of last year, most notably in the emerging markets and travel retail. Second, we really do have pretty significant optimism about the health of the spirits industry and our business in particular. We continue to see strong consumer demand across our portfolio of brands, and we're benefiting from consumers increased preference for spirits and the sustained growth for both the American whiskey and tequila categories. 
Our portfolio, which consists largely of premium and super premium brands is also benefiting from the continued premiumization trends across our industry. Our other major headline is that we continue to face challenges from the supply chain, largely related to glass supply, which has really impacted our finished goods inventories, along with the inventories of both the distributor and retailer levels. This is a contributing factor to the difference in our reported and underlying results. While we're working to mitigate this impact, the supply chain challenges along with higher input costs, mainly related to gave continue to pressure our gross margin. Leanne is going to talk more about this in just a few minutes. 
I'll start with the top line, where our overall underlying net sales increased 12% in the first half even as supply chain disruptions had an adverse effect on the year-to-date results. This was led by a double-digit underlying net sales increase for the Jack Daniel's family of brands. Within the Jack family, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey fueled the growth with underlying net sales of plus 15%. The first half of this fiscal year is benefiting from relatively easy comparisons as the prior year included a time period where the on-premise channel was largely closed around the world. 
On a 2-year CAGR, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey grew underlying net sales 3%, which is similar to the low single-digit growth the brand delivered pre-pandemic. The consumer trends of flavor and convenience continue to drive the growth of the Jack Daniel's flavors and Jack Daniel's RTDs. Higher volumes of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey just celebrated its year in the market as well as the continued international launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple contributed to high single-digit growth in underlying net sales for the Jack Daniel's flavors.  Jack Daniel's RTDs grew underlying net sales mid-single digits in the first half of the fiscal year. Notably, this growth comes against difficult comparisons. On a 2-year CAGR the Jack Daniel's our TDs delivered 19% underlying net sales growth. 
So overall, we believe consumer demand for RTDs remains very strong on a global basis, which we reserve continued to benefit from premiumization trends, which were only amplified by the pandemic and the growth in the American whiskey category. The brand again delivered double-digit underlying net sales growth despite supply chain challenges. We believe the underlying consumer momentum for Woodford Reserve remains incredibly strong. 
Our full strength of tequilas Herradura and el Jimador continue to benefit from the strength of the tequila category and grew underlying net sales in the first half by 46% and 19%, respectively. This increase more than offset a decline in new mix, which, as a reminder, experienced exceptional growth in the first quarter of fiscal '21, driven by the temporary interruption in Mexico's beer supply chain. 
In addition, our emerging brands portfolio in the U.S. continued its momentum, growing strong double digits even as it was cycling the strong double-digit comparison in the first half of last year. Old Forester, Chambord our single malt scotch portfolio and Forge Gen led this growth. We also strengthened our investment behind our emerging brands teams in several markets in Europe this past year. 
Based on our experience in the U.S., we know that super premium brands benefit from a high level of focus and we're seeing the benefit in Europe already as the Woodford Reserve family of brands, the single malt scotches as well as our tequilas and Chambord have responded with very strong growth. I do think our portfolio of super premium brands, supported by a dedicated emerging brands team offers the company a really big opportunity for growth internationally, and we plan to be more aggressive in our expansion plans in the future. 
The key themes in the first half of this fiscal year are really about our focused efforts on driving top line momentum but while absorbing the cost of the tariffs and significant increases in input costs, especially a gave in wood, and through it all, we continue to invest in the long-term health of our brands. But thankfully, I do believe many of the headwinds we have faced are beginning to become tailwinds. The emphasis on long-term growth and performance is built into Brown-Forman's DNA. 
We're fortunate to have a shareholder base that understands the importance of making decisions today that will deliver value for the next generation. This long-term perspective is replicated time and time again in all that we do, and is foundational to our business strategy as well as our integrated environmental, social and governance commitments. 
We recently updated our global sustainability goals, which serve as a road map for advancing our sustainability efforts, reducing the company's environmental footprint and increasing our positive impact on the community and the environment. The goals were highlighted in our most recent annual report, but given the importance of the work, I wanted to call special attention to them today. The new sustainability goals center around really 4 pillars: climate action, specifically to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; water stewardship; circular economy; and our supply chain. We recognize the increased importance for organizations like Brown-Forman to play a leading role in the environmental stewardship and look forward to sharing our progagainst these goals in the years to come. 
In a moment, I'll hand the call over to Leanne who will provide more details on our first half of fiscal '22 results as well as our recent capital allocation actions. But before I do, on behalf of the Brown-Forman Board of Directors and executive leadership team, I want to say thank you to the 4,700 Brown-Forman employees around the globe who give me a multitude of reasons to be thankful as we mark the end of another calendar year. As a company, we've lived our values of integrity, respect, trust, teamwork and excellence each and every time we've had headwinds and challenges come our way. 
The last few years have not been easy, but it has been a beautiful thing to watch how our teams have responded and produced solid business results. By living these values to people have enabled our business to a antenna and I believe that because of our people, Brown-Forman will get better year after year and continue to thrive for generations to come. 
Leanne, I'll now hand the call over to you."

As Lawson reviewed our headlines for the first half to provide additional details on our business results and our outlook for fiscal 2022. Starting with the top line. Reported net sales were up 9% in the first half of the fiscal year compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. This growth was driven by favorable price/mix, higher volumes and the positive effect of foreign exchange partly offset by an estimated net decrease in distributor inventories and the effect of the sale of Early Times, Canadian Mist and Collingwood brands during the first half of fiscal 2021. 
The decrease in distributor inventory is primarily due to the supply chain disruptions Lawson mentioned and that I'll address in more detail momentarily. From an underlying net sales growth perspective, we experienced broad-based growth across all of our geographic clusters of the U.S., developed international markets and emerging markets as well as our travel retail channel. 
Starting with the U.S. business, which represents approximately half of our underlying net sales. For the first half of fiscal 2022, underlying net sales grew 6% due to higher volumes as well as positive size and channel mix. Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey was the largest contributor to growth, fueled by higher volumes and a favorable channel mix shift with the reopening of the on-premise channel. Recent trends observed by mobility and open table reflect a stabilization in the on-premise channel just below their prepandemic levels. 
Consumer premiumization trends continue to propel our premium bourbons led by Woodford Reserve and Old Forester, both with their strong double-digit underlying growth rates, along with strong consumer demand for our tequila brands resulted in higher volumes of Herradura and el Jimador. This growth was partially offset by lower volumes in the off-premise channel due to strong prior year comparisons. 
Supply chain disruptions, particularly for the Jack Daniel's flavors and Woodford Reserve also had an adverse effect on our first half results and reduced inventory levels. These disruptions impacted our finished goods inventories along with inventories at our distributors and retailers. In the e-premise channel, our market share remained slightly above 2% and well above prepandemic levels, even as the on-premise channel reopens and consumers began to return to in-store shopping. 
Developed international markets collectively delivered strong underlying net sales growth, up double digits in the first half, with broad-based growth across the markets despite supply chain challenges. This growth was largely driven by the reopening of the on-premise as well as a rebound of tourism in some markets. 
The Jack Daniel's family of brands experienced strong growth driven by Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, high single-digit volume growth led by markets such as Germany and the U.K., where the brand is gaining share. The brand also grew in Spain as tourism returns and Korea where whiskey consumption shifted to international brands. Jack Daniel's ready-to-drinks experienced strong volume growth in Germany, where we continue to be a category leader and the U.K. These gains were partially offset by lower volumes in Australia due to strong prior year comparisons. Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey grew volume double digits, fueled by gains in France, Czechia and Korea, and collectively, the Jack Daniel's super-premium brands, Gentleman Jack and Jack Daniel's Single Barrel grew volume low single digits as they were significantly impacted by supply chain challenges. 
In addition to the Jack Daniel's family, collectively, our super premium brands delivered very strong double-digit underlying net sales growth. As Lawson mentioned, we continue to invest in these brands through our emerging brands group in Europe. Collectively, our emerging markets continue to rebound against easier comparisons with strong double-digit underlying sales growth driven by the growth of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, in Turkey, Brazil and Chile, the continued launch of Jack Daniel's Apple, most notably in Brazil and Chile, and collectively, our full strength tequila brands grew double digits in Mexico as the down trading trend shifted back towards premiumization, which more than offset the strong prior year comparisons of New Mix RTDs. 
While new mix is down year-over-year, the brand is performing above its prepandemic levels. And from an innovation perspective, we continue to abate in the RTD category and recently launched Jimador Seltzer in Mexico in October. 
Finally, our Travel Retail business continued to experience a strong rebound as we cycled against significant declines during the early days of the pandemic. Volumes continue to remain below their prepandemic levels as international airline travel and the cruise business have not fully recovered. 
Moving on to gross profit and gross margin. In the first half of the fiscal year, reported gross profit increased 9% with underlying growth of 12%, in line with our underlying top line growth. and gross margin was down 10 basis points year-over-year. This represents an improvement in gross margin in the second quarter compared to the same period last year. Consistent with last quarter, we continue to navigate the impacts of global supply chain disruptions and input cost headwinds. 
As we shared last quarter, our supply chain disruptions have largely been driven by glass supply constraints. While glass supply constraints have eased in the second quarter, they resulted in a decrease in our finished goods inventory along with the inventories at both the distributor and retailer. These challenges have had a negative impact on our price mix in the first half of this fiscal year due to unfavorable product mix on our higher-margin brands include Jack Daniel's family of brands as well as Woodford Reserve. And similar to many other CPG companies, we have also experienced higher-than-expected logistics cost. 
The input cost headwinds related to agave and commodity prices, largely grain and aluminum also continued throughout the first half of the year. Consistent with our last call, greater demand of our tequila brands, driven by the continued growth in the U.S. and a faster-than-expected rebound in Mexico has required a greater supply of agave. As a reminder, agave costs are below their peak, though easing at a slower pace than expected due to the higher demand within the category. 
Turning to our operating expenses, we continue to support our top line momentum through our investments behind our iconic brands and our people. Our reported advertising expense increased 24% and on an underlying basis grew 23% in the first half as we lapped the impact of the early stages of the pandemic on-premise activations, consumer events, summer festivals and sponsorships were rescheduled or canceled. 
Reported SG&A expenses increased 10% with underlying growth of 8%, driven by the timing of compensation-related expenses non-income tax items and the cycling of lower discretionary spend during the same period last year due to COVID-19. 
In total, on a rig basis, operating income decreased 15% and largely driven by the effect of acquisitions and divestitures, primarily the gain on the sale of Early Times, Canadian Mist and Collingwood brands last year and the decrease in distributor inventories and on an underlying basis, operating income grew 13% for the first half. 
The decrease in reported operating income combined with an increase in our effective tax rate resulted in a 24% decrease in diluted EPS to $0.89 per share. And finally, to our fiscal 2022 outlook, even with the volatility and potential resurgence of COVID-19 due to emerging variance, we remain confident in our top line growth momentum based on the continuing performance of our U.S. business, the collective strength of our developed markets, which performed well throughout the pandemic in the off-premise channel and should continue to benefit from the reopening of the on-premise channel and increasing levels in tourism. 
In the aggregate, we still expect strong growth in our emerging international markets as well as Travel Retail as we cycle the effect of easier comparisons, they continue their path to recovery. And further, we do not expect our noncore business mainly used barrel sales to have a material impact on our results this year. We also believe our portfolio remains well positioned to continue to benefit from growing premiumization trends. 
Additionally, as we mentioned last quarter, given the strength of our brands, we are able to focus on value growth through revenue growth management initiatives and have increased price on a number of our brands in the U.S. including Jack Daniel's. We believe our ability to take price reflects the health and the investments we are making behind our brands as well as a more favorable pricing environment. 
Based on our strong results in the first half of the fiscal year, coupled with solid consumer takeaway trends, we now expect underlying net sales to grow in the high single-digit range. 
Turning to gross margin. We continue to manage through the unfavorable impact of global supply chain disruptions and have deployed a number of risk mitigation strategies to address the various constraints on our business. While we expect these disruptions to continue throughout the remainder of the fiscal year, we believe the impact will become less significant in the second half of the year. We believe this along with persistent cost headwinds related to Avi, logistics cost and commodity prices will continue to have a negative impact on our gross margin. 
We also believe we will have a modest impact from the removal of tariffs in the EU. The tariffs are scheduled to end on January 1, 22022. Therefore, the impact to the full year fiscal 2022 will be minimal, but it will be a tailwind. As a result of these factors, we still expect gross margin for the fiscal year to be flat or slightly down. The spirits category continues to take share from beer and wine, and we will continue to invest behind our brands to ensure we optimize our opportunity to gain share in the market. We expect underlying advertising expense to be in line with top line growth, which is consistent with our long-term philosophy. 
We also remain committed to supporting our various strategic initiatives including our 3 new RTCs of Russia, Belgium and Taiwan, the continued expansion of our emerging brands team in select international markets and the increased investment in our digital marketing and e-commerce capabilities. Therefore, we now expect our underlying operating expenses, advertising and SG&A to be in the high single-digit range, and we now expect our underlying operating income to grow in the high single-digit range, in line to slightly below underlying net sales growth. 
Lastly, we continue to expect our fiscal 2022 effective tax rate to be in the range of about 22% to 23%. As a reminder, the seasonality of our results are expected to be volatile for the remainder of the year, particularly our operating income as a result of unusual comparisons in our prior year. 
Before I conclude my remarks, I wanted to briefly highlight our long-standing capital allocation philosophy that has produced strong results for our investors and allowed us to maintain a healthy balance sheet. As I shared during our Investor Day in September, our 4 guiding principles are: first, to fully invest behind our business; second, to pay increasing regular dividends; third, to opportunistically look for acquisitions that we believe create long-term value; and finally, to seek opportunities to return cash to shareholders in excess of regular dividends. 
Throughout the pandemic, we thoughtfully and judiciously prioritized managed and allocated capital and emerge with an even stronger balance sheet. As we announced on November 18, the Brown-Forman Board of Directors approved a 5% increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend. We are proud to be a member of the prestigious S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index, having paid regular quarterly cash dividends for 78 consecutive years and increased the regular dividend for 38 consecutive years. 
In addition, Brown-Forman's Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $1 per share or approximately $480 million on our Class A and Class B common stock. We firmly believe our capital allocation philosophy, coupled with our strategic priorities will continue to drive superior returns over the long term. 
In summary, we are pleased with the strong first half of the fiscal year. We are able to share these results today because of the strength of our brands and the commitment of our people, the strong and talented spirits that make up Brown-Forman. Over the last 20 months, our employees around the world have demonstrated the same high level of agility and resilience that we've seen exemplified throughout the course of our 151-year history. They have shown us once again that we can continue to build our brands, achieve our strategic ambitions and thrive in the long term, even under challenging conditions. All it requires is determination perseverance and a commitment to ensuring there's nothing better in the market than Brown-Forman. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Please open the line for questions."

Let me step back as kind of we knew this question was coming a little bit. I want to give you a little bit of a longer story of what has happened with the Jack Daniel's family and then the also the impact on the rest of the portfolio really over the last 2 years. 
So if we go back to fiscal '21, just a reminder, everyone, this is a global segment not U.S., I'll get to the U.S. towards the end. But just as we look back to fiscal '21, so the year that ended April 30, 2021, Jack Daniel's Tennessee were down 4% but Brown-Forman Corp. was plus 6%. So this was the year obviously that Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey with its huge on-premise presence around the world 1 in the decline. 
I mean I think the good news or the positive news out of that or the positive takeaway out of that was that Brown-Forman has now got enough legs under the stool that when Tennessee struggles a little bit, the company can deliver a plus 6. So we felt pretty good about that. Now moving forward, now moving into fiscal '22. The on-premise business in the U.S. really started to come back in a stronger way, sort of late spring, early summer, and Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey came with that and had a very, very strong start to the fiscal year, as you mentioned. But then at the same time, as that is happening, the supply chain problems creep into our situation really in late spring, early summer. 
And Jack Daniel's Tennessee with key was the first to really feel it. And so we drew down inventories at the beginning of the year really throughout the entire supply chain on a global basis. But eventually, that started to hit order. We started to have out of stock problems later in the kind of late summer, early fall. And we had to make some tough decisions. 
And so what we did was prioritized. This is sort of, I'll say, August time frame, August, September time frame, where we said we have to keep Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey moving and healthy particularly as the on-premises reopening again. And so the glass really got prioritized for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, and you've seen pretty good performance out of the brand throughout even, I think, through the first half, and feeling pretty confident in the outlook even in the second half. But what happened with that, that has been so difficult was, in particular, the Jack Daniel's flavors in the U.S. Gentleman Jack, globally, Woodford, which is primarily a U.S. brand, also felt it even Old Forester felt it. 
So we began to those brands all began to soften really September, October time frame. And so a lot of you all that are looking at, say, NABCA data or Nielsen data that's coming through in that September, October time frame, especially as I said on the flavors. If you look at Schedule B in the earnings release, it has the distributor inventory, and you can see the difference between reported and underlying there. 
And you can see there are huge numbers on there as we've really taken down inventories, particularly in the United States fought off these out-of-stock problems. Now that it's a long way of getting around of saying this or getting an important point across [indiscernible]. 
We do believe the worst is behind us. But it has been a challenging difficult situation in the last few months particularly if you take a brand like Woodford, just as an example or even gentleman Jack, the consumer momentum behind those brands is so strong that to have out of stocks just absolutely makes life very difficult. Our commercial teams obviously, are very frustrated with that whole situation. But as are the production teams and everywhere else, it is a massive inside the company to try to mitigate these challenges as best we can. And we're doing it. 
And as I say, I think it's behind us. So you'll start to see improved numbers -- takeaway numbers going forward, particularly in the U.S. An important point to make on all that is all this is inside the guidance that we gave. So we were able to raise sales guidance even after fighting these problems. So thank you for listening to me."

I think it's great that you have the question out on the board and how we think about tariffs and the great news of 3.5 years and that they have now been removed as of January 1. What is removed as of January 1 is the European Union portion of the tariffs. We continue to have tariffs on American Whiskey brands for the United Kingdom. 
So with that, when you think about the information that we've put out previously, our European Union portion of that is approximately 80%. And then where you think we are in the fiscal year, that starts on January 1, which only leaves us 4 months of our fiscal year. We do have inventory in the markets that we have to work through. 
And then with the remaining months in our fiscal year not being the largest volume month than we don't get, like we said, a modest positive impact in this fiscal year. And to your point on '23, we are very excited about looking forward. But what for today and for what we need to be focused on is delivering to all of our shareholders, the outlook that we just issued today, which is high single digits on both the top line and the bottom line as we move forward. So we've got to focus on delivering that. But as Latin mentioned, we now are incredibly excited that this tailwind that has been a tailwind for for this headwind, that's been a headwind for far too long, is now turning into a tailwind. 
Did you follow the math that we -- it just doesn't affect much in this fiscal year, largely because of the inventory that we've got to March through before hand. So you're only getting a month or a couple of months' worth of benefit."

So as it relates to how we're thinking about it for the full year, we have that full -- we have everything that we can estimate built into our full year guidance. we have said flat to slightly down. But really, it's really all coming around -- we're getting closer to flat. But I do think it's prudent that we stay slightly down in the inflationary environment that we're in, and we're seeing inflationary costs, as we mentioned, on grains and aluminum and energy and even for some of our wood. So again, just to be prudent, we established that guidance last quarter.

What we've been talking about, I think, in the last couple of quarters, and I'll bring it up again now is just as you mentioned, there hasn't been a lot of pricing really not only in the U.S. but globally in the world of spirits over the last really decade. And we want to see more balance to that for sure, both within volume and price. 
And so I mean I think as you've heard us talk about before, we've put a lot of money into people and in the systems and really trying to grow our capabilities in revenue growth management and those become part of the story as to how we intend on getting our price up. in some cases, just taking a frontline price increase too. So it's sort of all in with all the tools that we have. I mean, I think given the inflationary environment that we're in right now that we're all seeing, it would certainly be a missed opportunity if we can take price right now. 
And so we are doing it. You're not really seeing it in the numbers yet. It's just -- that's just a timing thing. I think you'll start to see it come through as we get into the latter half of this year and into next summer and really trying to change the mentality even within the company to focus on value share, focus really on our super premium brands, make sure our innovation pipeline, all those things all add up together to try to get a better price/mix balance in everything that we do.

And then as we got into the back half of the year, we started to invest much more heavily. So not only are we comping against kind of the easier comps in the first half of this year. We're also investing at, I would call it, the more traditional seasonality balance across. But again, with our top line growth, we are able to invest at a higher rate, and we will put that in back against the opportunities that we see. 
And as Lawson mentioned, with our strong growth that we are having in the U.S. on an underlying basis. Of course, we'll continue to focus on the U.S. But then through our emerging brand groups in the European division, when we look at just really the strong double-digit growth that they are creating both from our super-premium American whiskey and our tequila brands, actually, albeit on a smaller base. That strong double-digit growth, we are continuing to to fuel the momentum there as well as our international markets where we made adjustments in the early portions of the pandemic.

But I mean there has been a reduction in discounting or promotional levels really, I mean, I think, globally over the last few months. So there's no reason to put something on promotion, if you're hedging on to having a stock problem. 
And so that's been the shortest term impact. But I mean longer term, have we reeducated the consumer a little bit? I think it probably is too early to make that call. But I do think that -- look, I mean, there is inflation and there is pricing coming through on so many consumer categories right now that consumers aren't really going to have an option. 
I mean I think as so many of the brands, and we expect to see the industry -- and we've heard comments from -- even from other competitors that now is the time to rebalance a little bit the volume and the value trends."

People as a shift back to on-premise, you drink less at the on-premise occasion. Do you think it more of as an occasion rather than every -- when we were all locked in our houses. But spirits volumes have remained pretty resilient. So any thoughts you might offer things that you're seeing in your consumer research that are driving that different outside of just this long-term trend of share gains for the industry?"

I mean, you bring up what I think is 1 of the more most important sort of things that's happening these days that we're trying to measure and I'm sure you are, too. And that's really is the U.S. spirits market, is it at a stepped-up growth rate? It certainly was, as you mentioned, for sort of the 12 months -- the first 12 months of the pandemic. But now we're in the second -- we're closing out the second 12 months. 
And the trends that we're looking at are still very strong on a -- particularly, I'm just staring at a 2-year stack, which I encourage everyone to do that as opposed to the 1 year because I think within Brown-Forman, particularly on a 1-year basis, you're going to be looking -- you kind of get apples and oranges mixed up because we did not fall nearly as far as our competitive set at the beginning of the pandemic. And so our comparisons are a little bit more difficult now. 
So that's why we're internally really focused on that on the stack. But if I look at NAFTA data, I mean, TDS is still up there in the sort of low double-digit range, and it's not slowing down. In fact, 3 months is better than 12%. So I mean, you've got some real strong trends in spirits it seems like it's retained its share gains that it made during the pandemic. And just the question is how long can it hold it? I don't expect double-digit growth necessarily to hold forever. But a U.S. spirits market that used to be maybe a 4.5% or 5% growth market, is it 6 or 7 now. And we'll see as the next few months and quarters sort of go by. But right now, it feels pretty good."

I'm pleased to share our second quarter and first half of fiscal '22 results with you today. But before I do, we'll open up with a toast, a toast to the fact that after 3.5 years, the U.S. and EU reached an agreement on trade in steel and aluminum and the EU will be removing tariffs on American whiskey on January 1, 2022. 
The tariffs have been in place longer than I've been in this role. And as such, it's been one of the most discussed topics of my tenure as CEO, having been a part of our conversations in the past 12 quarterly earnings calls as well as the last 3 annual stockholder meetings. It's been an exhausting and expensive chapter in the company's 151-year history, as we've been so disproportionately impacted by the tariffs compared to our competitors. We've remained strong and resilient as an organization, and I believe we are very well positioned to deliver solid growth in the short and the medium and in the long term. That said though, you can be certain that we look forward to the return of a level playing field for American whiskey in the EU and hope a similar outcome can very soon be achieved between the U.S. and the U.K. 
So with that, let's turn our attention to the other headlines of our first half. First, our top line growth remains strong, driven by the reopening of the on-premise channel, the return of tourism and the cycling of the lower comparisons during the first half of last year, most notably in the emerging markets and travel retail. Second, we really do have pretty significant optimism about the health of the spirits industry and our business in particular. We continue to see strong consumer demand across our portfolio of brands, and we're benefiting from consumers increased preference for spirits and the sustained growth for both the American whiskey and tequila categories. 
Our portfolio, which consists largely of premium and super premium brands is also benefiting from the continued premiumization trends across our industry. Our other major headline is that we continue to face challenges from the supply chain, largely related to glass supply, which has really impacted our finished goods inventories, along with the inventories of both the distributor and retailer levels. This is a contributing factor to the difference in our reported and underlying results. While we're working to mitigate this impact, the supply chain challenges along with higher input costs, mainly related to agave continue to pressure our gross margin. Leanne is going to talk more about this in just a few minutes. 
I'll start with the top line, where our overall underlying net sales increased 12% in the first half even as supply chain disruptions had an adverse effect on the year-to-date results. This was led by a double-digit underlying net sales increase for the Jack Daniel's family of brands. Within the Jack family, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey fueled the growth with underlying net sales of plus 15%. The first half of this fiscal year is benefiting from relatively easy comparisons as the prior year included a time period where the on-premise channel was largely closed around the world. 
On a 2-year CAGR, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey grew underlying net sales 3%, which is similar to the low single-digit growth the brand delivered pre-pandemic. The consumer trends of flavor and convenience continue to drive the growth of the Jack Daniel's flavors and Jack Daniel's RTDs. Higher volumes of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey just celebrated its 10th year in the market as well as the continued international launch of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Apple contributed to high single-digit growth in underlying net sales for the Jack Daniel's flavors.  Jack Daniel's RTDs grew underlying net sales mid-single digits in the first half of the fiscal year. Notably, this growth comes against difficult comparisons. On a 2-year CAGR the Jack Daniel's our TDs delivered 19% underlying net sales growth. 
So overall, we believe consumer demand for RTDs remains very strong on a global basis, Woodford Reserve continued to benefit from premiumization trends, which were only amplified by the pandemic and the growth in the American whiskey category. The brand again delivered double-digit underlying net sales growth despite supply chain challenges. We believe the underlying consumer momentum for Woodford Reserve remains incredibly strong. 
Our full strength of tequilas Herradura and el Jimador continue to benefit from the strength of the tequila category and grew underlying net sales in the first half by 46% and 19% respectively. This increase more than offset a decline in new mix, which, as a reminder, experienced exceptional growth in the first quarter of fiscal '21, driven by the temporary interruption in Mexico's beer supply chain. 
In addition, our emerging brands portfolio in the U.S. continued its momentum, growing strong double digits even as it was cycling the strong double-digit comparison in the first half of last year. Old Forester, Chambord, our single malt scotch portfolio and Fords Gin led this growth. We also strengthened our investment behind our emerging brands teams in several markets in Europe this past year. 
Based on our experience in the U.S., we know that super premium brands benefit from a high level of focus and we're seeing the benefit in Europe already as the Woodford Reserve family of brands, the single malt scotches as well as our tequilas and Chambord have responded with very strong growth. I do think our portfolio of super premium brands, supported by a dedicated emerging brands team offers the company a really big opportunity for growth internationally, and we plan to be more aggressive in our expansion plans in the future. 
The key themes in the first half of this fiscal year are really about our focused efforts on driving top line momentum but while absorbing the cost of the tariffs and significant increases in input costs, especially agave and wood, and through it all, we continue to invest in the long-term health of our brands. But thankfully, I do believe many of the headwinds we have faced are beginning to become tailwinds. The emphasis on long-term growth and performance is built into Brown-Forman's DNA. 
We're fortunate to have a shareholder base that understands the importance of making decisions today that will deliver value for the next generation. This long-term perspective is replicated time and time again in all that we do, and is foundational to our business strategy as well as our integrated environmental, social and governance commitments. 
We recently updated our global sustainability goals, which serve as a road map for advancing our sustainability efforts, reducing the company's environmental footprint and increasing our positive impact on the community and the environment. The goals were highlighted in our most recent annual report, but given the importance of the work, I wanted to call special attention to them today. The new sustainability goals center around really 4 pillars: climate action, specifically to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; water stewardship; circular economy; and our supply chain. We recognize the increased importance for organizations like Brown-Forman to play a leading role in the environmental stewardship and look forward to sharing our progress against these goals in the years to come. 
In a moment, I'll hand the call over to Leanne who will provide more details on our first half of fiscal '22 results as well as our recent capital allocation actions. But before I do, on behalf of the Brown-Forman Board of Directors and executive leadership team, I want to say thank you to the 4,700 Brown-Forman employees around the globe who give me a multitude of reasons to be thankful as we mark the end of another calendar year. As a company, we've lived our values of integrity, respect, trust, teamwork and excellence each and every time we've had headwinds and challenges come our way. 
The last few years have not been easy, but it has been a beautiful thing to watch how our teams have responded and produced solid business results. By living these values to people have enabled our business to be resilient and I believe that because of our people, Brown-Forman will get better year after year and continue to thrive for generations to come. 
Leanne, I'll now hand the call over to you."

As Lawson reviewed our headlines for the first half, I will provide additional details on our business results and our outlook for fiscal 2022. Starting with the top line. Reported net sales were up 9% in the first half of the fiscal year compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. This growth was driven by favorable price/mix, higher volumes and the positive effect of foreign exchange, partly offset by an estimated net decrease in distributor inventories and the effect of the sale of Early Times, Canadian Mist and Collingwood brands during the first half of fiscal 2021. 
The decrease in distributor inventory is primarily due to the supply chain disruptions Lawson mentioned and that I'll address in more detail momentarily. From an underlying net sales growth perspective, we experienced broad-based growth across all of our geographic clusters of the U.S., developed international markets and emerging markets as well as our travel retail channel. 
Starting with the U.S. business, which represents approximately half of our underlying net sales. For the first half of fiscal 2022, underlying net sales grew 6% due to higher volumes as well as positive size and channel mix. Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey was the largest contributor to growth, fueled by higher volumes and a favorable channel mix shift with the reopening of the on-premise channel. Recent trends observed by mobility and open table reflect a stabilization in the on-premise channel just below their prepandemic levels. 
Consumer premiumization trends continue to propel our premium bourbons led by Woodford Reserve and Old Forester, both with their strong double-digit underlying growth rates, along with strong consumer demand for our tequila brands resulted in higher volumes of Herradura and el Jimador. This growth was partially offset by lower volumes in the off-premise channel due to strong prior year comparisons. 
Supply chain disruptions, particularly for the Jack Daniel's flavors and Woodford Reserve also had an adverse effect on our first half results and reduced inventory levels. These disruptions impacted our finished goods inventories along with inventories at our distributors and retailers. In the e-premise channel, our market share remained slightly above 2% and well above prepandemic levels, even as the on-premise channel reopens and consumers began to return to in-store shopping. 
Developed international markets collectively delivered strong underlying net sales growth, up double digits in the first half, with broad-based growth across the markets despite supply chain challenges. This growth was largely driven by the reopening of the on-premise as well as a rebound of tourism in some markets. 
The Jack Daniel's family of brands experienced strong growth driven by Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, high single-digit volume growth led by markets such as Germany and the U.K., where the brand is gaining share. The brand also grew in Spain as tourism returns and Korea where whiskey consumption shifted to international brands. Jack Daniel's ready-to-drinks experienced strong volume growth in Germany, where we continue to be a category leader and the U.K. These gains were partially offset by lower volumes in Australia due to strong prior year comparisons. Jack Daniel's Tennessee Honey grew volume double digits, fueled by gains in France, Czechia and Korea, and collectively, the Jack Daniel's super-premium brands, Gentleman Jack and Jack Daniel's Single Barrel grew volume low single digits as they were significantly impacted by supply chain challenges. 
In addition to the Jack Daniel's family, collectively, our super premium brands delivered very strong double-digit underlying net sales growth. As Lawson mentioned, we continue to invest in these brands through our emerging brands group in Europe. Collectively, our emerging markets continue to rebound against easier comparisons with strong double-digit underlying net sales growth driven by the growth of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey in Turkey, Brazil and Chile, the continued launch of Jack Daniel's Apple, most notably in Brazil and Chile, and collectively, our full strength tequila brands grew double digits in Mexico as the down trading trend shifted back towards premiumization, which more than offset the strong prior year comparisons of New Mix RTDs. 
While New Mix is down year-over-year, the brand is performing above its prepandemic levels. And from an innovation perspective, we continue to innovate in the RTD category and recently launched el Jimador Seltzer in Mexico in October. 
Finally, our Travel Retail business continued to experience a strong rebound as we cycled against significant declines during the early days of the pandemic. Volumes continue to remain below their prepandemic levels as international airline travel and the cruise business have not fully recovered. 
Moving on to gross profit and gross margin. In the first half of the fiscal year, reported gross profit increased 9% with underlying growth of 12%, in line with our underlying top line growth. and gross margin was down 10 basis points year-over-year. This represents an improvement in gross margin in the second quarter compared to the same period last year. Consistent with last quarter, we continue to navigate the impacts of global supply chain disruptions and input cost headwinds. 
As we shared last quarter, our supply chain disruptions have largely been driven by glass supply constraints. While glass supply constraints have eased in the second quarter, they resulted in a decrease in our finished goods inventory along with the inventories at both the distributor and retailer. These challenges have had a negative impact on our price mix in the first half of this fiscal year due to unfavorable product mix on our higher-margin brands include Jack Daniel's family of brands as well as Woodford Reserve. And similar to many other CPG companies, we have also experienced higher-than-expected logistics cost. 
The input cost headwinds related to agave and commodity prices, largely grain and aluminum also continued throughout the first half of the year. Consistent with our last call, greater demand of our tequila brands, driven by the continued growth in the U.S. and a faster-than-expected rebound in Mexico has required a greater supply of agave. As a reminder, agave costs are below their peak, though easing at a slower pace than expected due to the higher demand within the category. 
Turning to our operating expenses, we continue to support our top line momentum through our investments behind our iconic brands and our people. Our reported advertising expense increased 24% and on an underlying basis grew 23% in the first half as we lapped the impact of the early stages of the pandemic on-premise activations, consumer events, summer festivals and sponsorships were rescheduled or canceled. 
Reported SG&A expenses increased 10% with underlying growth of 8%, driven by the timing of compensation-related expenses non-income tax items and the cycling of lower discretionary spend during the same period last year due to COVID-19. 
In total, on a reported basis, operating income decreased 15%, largely driven by the effect of acquisitions and divestitures, primarily the gain on the sale of Early Times, Canadian Mist and Collingwood brands last year and the decrease in distributor inventories and on an underlying basis, operating income grew 13% for the first half. 
The decrease in reported operating income combined with an increase in our effective tax rate resulted in a 24% decrease in diluted EPS to $0.89 per share. And finally, to our fiscal 2022 outlook, even with the volatility and potential resurgence of COVID-19 due to emerging variance, we remain confident in our top line growth momentum based on the continuing performance of our U.S. business, the collective strength of our developed markets, which performed well throughout the pandemic in the off-premise channel and should continue to benefit from the reopening of the on-premise channel and increasing levels in tourism. 
In the aggregate, we still expect strong growth in our emerging international markets as well as Travel Retail as we cycle the effect of easier comparisons, they continue their path to recovery. And further, we do not expect our noncore business, mainly used barrel sales to have a material impact on our results this year. We also believe our portfolio remains well positioned to continue to benefit from growing premiumization trends. 
Additionally, as we mentioned last quarter, given the strength of our brands, we are able to focus on value growth through revenue growth management initiatives and have increased price on a number of our brands in the U.S. including Jack Daniel's. We believe our ability to take price reflects the health and the investments we are making behind our brands as well as a more favorable pricing environment. 
Based on our strong results in the first half of the fiscal year, coupled with solid consumer takeaway trends, we now expect underlying net sales to grow in the high single-digit range. 
Turning to gross margin. We continue to manage through the unfavorable impact of global supply chain disruptions and have deployed a number of risk mitigation strategies to address the various constraints on our business. While we expect these disruptions to continue throughout the remainder of the fiscal year, we believe the impact will become less significant in the second half of the year. We believe this along with persistent cost headwinds related to agave, logistics cost and commodity prices will continue to have a negative impact on our gross margin. 
We also believe we will have a modest impact from the removal of tariffs in the EU. The tariffs are scheduled to end on January 1, 2022. Therefore, the impact to the full year fiscal 2022 will be minimal, but it will be a tailwind. As a result of these factors, we still expect gross margin for the fiscal year to be flat or slightly down. The spirits category continues to take share from beer and wine, and we will continue to invest behind our brands to ensure we optimize our opportunity to gain share in the market. We expect underlying advertising expense to be in line with top line growth, which is consistent with our long-term philosophy. 
We also remain committed to supporting our various strategic initiatives including our 3 new RTCs of Russia, Belgium and Taiwan, the continued expansion of our emerging brands team in select international markets and the increased investment in our digital marketing and e-commerce capabilities. Therefore, we now expect our underlying operating expenses, advertising and SG&A to be in the high single-digit range, and we now expect our underlying operating income to grow in the high single-digit range, in line to slightly below underlying net sales growth. 
Lastly, we continue to expect our fiscal 2022 effective tax rate to be in the range of about 22% to 23%. As a reminder, the seasonality of our results are expected to be volatile for the remainder of the year, particularly our operating income as a result of unusual comparisons in our prior year. 
Before I conclude my remarks, I wanted to briefly highlight our long-standing capital allocation philosophy that has produced strong results for our investors and allowed us to maintain a healthy balance sheet. As I shared during our Investor Day in September, our 4 guiding principles are: first, to fully invest behind our business; second, to pay increasing regular dividends; third, to opportunistically look for acquisitions that we believe create long-term value; and finally, to seek opportunities to return cash to shareholders in excess of regular dividends. 
Throughout the pandemic, we thoughtfully and judiciously prioritized managed and allocated capital and emerged with an even stronger balance sheet. As we announced on November 18, the Brown-Forman Board of Directors approved a 5% increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend. We are proud to be a member of the prestigious S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index, having paid regular quarterly cash dividends for 78 consecutive years and increased the regular dividend for 38 consecutive years. 
In addition, Brown-Forman's Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $1 per share or approximately $480 million on our Class A and Class B common stock. We firmly believe our capital allocation philosophy, coupled with our strategic priorities will continue to drive superior returns over the long term. 
In summary, we are pleased with the strong first half of the fiscal year. We are able to share these results today because of the strength of our brands and the commitment of our people, the strong and talented spirits that make up Brown-Forman. Over the last 20 months, our employees around the world have demonstrated the same high level of agility and resilience that we've seen exemplified throughout the course of our 151-year history. They have shown us once again that we can continue to build our brands, achieve our strategic ambitions and thrive in the long term, even under challenging conditions. All it requires is determination, perseverance and a commitment to ensuring there's nothing better in the market than Brown-Forman. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. Please open the line for questions."

Let me step back as kind of we knew this question was coming a little bit. I want to give you a little bit of a longer story of what has happened with the Jack Daniel's family and then the also the impact on the rest of the portfolio rea",782,"All right. Kevin. Let me step back as kind of we knew this question was coming a little bit. I want to give you a little bit of a longer story of what has happened with the Jack Daniel's family and then the also the impact on the rest of the portfolio really over the last 2 years. 
So if we go back to fiscal '21, just a reminder, everyone, this is a global segment not U.S., I'll get to the U.S. towards the end. But just as we look back to fiscal '21, so the year that ended April 30, 2021, Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey sales were down 4% but Brown-Forman Corp. was plus 6%. So this was the year obviously that Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey with its huge on-premise presence around the world went into decline. 
I mean I think the good news or the positive news out of that or the positive takeaway out of that was that Brown-Forman has now got enough legs under the stool that when Tennessee Whiskey struggles a little bit, the company can deliver a plus 6. So we felt pretty good about that. Now moving forward, now moving into fiscal '22. The on-premise business in the U.S. really started to come back in a stronger way, sort of late spring, early summer, and Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey came with that and had a very, very strong start to the fiscal year, as you mentioned. But then at the same time, as that is happening, the supply chain problems creep into our situation really in late spring, early summer. 
And Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey was the first to really feel it. And so we drew down inventories at the beginning of the year, really throughout the entire supply chain on a global basis. But eventually, that started to hit us harder. We started to have out of stock problems later in the kind of late summer, early fall. And we had to make some tough decisions. 
And so what we did was prioritize.  This is sort of, I'll say, August time frame, August, September time frame, where we said we have to keep Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey moving and healthy particularly as the on-premises reopening again. And so the glass really got prioritized for Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, and you've seen pretty good performance out of the brand throughout even, I think, through the first half, and feeling pretty confident in the outlook even in the second half. But what happened with that, that has been so difficult was, in particular, the Jack Daniel's flavors in the U.S. Gentleman Jack globally, Woodford, which is primarily a U.S. brand also felt it, even Old Forester felt it. 
So we began to -- those brands all began to soften really September, October time frame. And so a lot of you all that are looking at, say, NABCA data or Nielsen data that's coming through in that September, October time frame, especially as I said on the flavors. If you look at Schedule B in the earnings release, it has the distributor inventory column, you can see the difference between reported and underlying there. 
And you can see there are huge numbers on there as we've really taken down inventories, particularly in the United States and we fought off these out-of-stock problems. Now that it's a long way of getting around of saying this or getting an important point across that the situation is improving now. 
We do believe the worst is behind us. But it has been a challenging difficult situation in the last few months particularly if you take a brand like Woodford, just as an example or even gentleman Jack, the consumer momentum behind those brands is so strong that to have out of stocks just absolutely makes life very difficult. Our commercial teams obviously, are very frustrated with that whole situation. But as are the production teams and everywhere else, it is a massive effort inside the company to try to mitigate these challenges as best we can. And we're doing it. 
And as I say, I think it's behind us. So you'll start to see improved numbers -- takeaway numbers going forward, particularly in the U.S. An important point to make on all that is all this is inside the guidance that we gave. So we were able to raise sales guidance even after fighting through all of these problems. So thank you for listening to me. That was a long answer to that but I wanted -- we needed to kind of get that out there before we get through the rest of this call, I think, because it affects everything."

I mean, if I'm honest, it's been too soon to see anything particularly in November, it's just not impacting results right now.

I mean, I think -- I don't think -- well, let me guess -- I don't think the Omicron is having a big of an effect as really -- I mean I think the restaurants and the labor shortage and all the other challenges that the on-premise world is having that we've all experienced, I'm sure if you go out to dinner, is having a bigger limiting impact on the on-premise really than variants."

So I'll take that one, and I'll start with.

I think it's great that you have the question out on the board and how we think about tariffs and the great news of 3.5 years and that they have now been removed as of January 1. What is removed as of January 1 is the European Union portion of the tariffs. We continue to have tariffs on American Whiskey brands for the United Kingdom. 
So with that, when you think about the information that we've put out previously, our European Union portion of that is approximately 80%. And then where you think we are in the fiscal year, that starts on January 1, which only leaves us 4 months of our fiscal year. We do have inventory in the markets that we have to work through. 
And then with the remaining months in our fiscal year not being the largest volume month than we don't get, like we said, a modest positive impact in this fiscal year. And to your point on '23, we are very excited about looking forward. But what for today and for what we need to be focused on is delivering to all of our shareholders, the outlook that we just issued today, which is high single digits on both the top line and the bottom line as we move forward. So we've got to focus on delivering that. But as Lawson mentioned, we now are incredibly excited that this tailwind that has been a tailwind for -- this headwind, that's been a headwind for far too long, is now turning into a tailwind."

So as it relates to how we're thinking about it for the full year, we have that full -- we have everything that we can estimate built into our full year guidance. We have set it flat to slightly down. But really, it's really all coming around -- we're getting closer to flat. But I do think it's prudent that we stay slightly down in the inflationary environment that we're in, and we're seeing inflationary costs, as we mentioned, on grains and aluminum and energy and even for some of our wood. So again, just to be prudent, we established that guidance last quarter. We continue to believe that gives the guidance to give, though, with the small positive impact of tariffs, we are moving back towards closer to flat."

What we've been talking about, I think, in the last couple of quarters, and I'll bring it up again now is just as you mentioned, there hasn't been a lot of pricing really, not only in the U.S. but globally in the world of spirits over the last really decade. And we want to see more balance to that for sure, both within volume and price. 
And so I mean I think as you've heard us talk about before, we've put a lot of money into people and in the systems and really trying to grow our capabilities in revenue growth management and those become part of the story as to how we intend on getting our price up. In some cases, just taking a frontline price increase too. So it's sort of all in with all the tools that we have. I mean, I think given the inflationary environment that we're in right now that we're all seeing, it would certainly be a missed opportunity if we can take price right now. 
And so we are doing it. You're not really seeing it in the numbers yet. It's just -- that's just a timing thing. I think you'll start to see it come through as we get into the latter half of this year and into next summer and really trying to change the mentality even within the company to focus on value share, focus really on our super premium brands, make sure our innovation pipeline, all those things all add up together to try to get a better price/mix balance in everything that we do. So yes, so I mean, it is a bit of a mindset difference, I think, within the company that just really hasn't been there, as I said, for 8 or 10 years."

But again, with our top line growth, we are able to invest at a higher rate, and we will put that back against the opportunities that we see. 
And as Lawson mentioned, with our strong growth that we are having in the U.S. on an underlying basis. Of course, we'll continue to focus on the U.S. But then through our emerging brand groups in the European division, when we look at just really the strong double-digit growth that they are creating both from our super-premium American whiskey and our tequila brands, actually, albeit on a smaller base. That strong double-digit growth, we are continuing  fuel the momentum there as well as our international markets where we made adjustments in the early portions of the pandemic. Does that help?"

As I said, we have some out-of-stock problems in the U.S. that are uncomfortable and that we are trying to plug right now. We're all working very hard to have that happen. 
Outside of the United States, the supply chain problems are not quite as severe, largely because they are Tennessee Whiskey led as opposed to the rest of the portfolio. And we've been able to supply those markets earlier on when we were tight. So it's not really a Christmas. We're not -- I say we're not worried, but we're less concerned about the international supply chain challenges right now. It is really a U.S. thing that needs to catch up. Look, there are going to be some lost sales. 
We've said we've included it in the guidance, but clearly it is pinching us this year. The question is madly trying to get cases out of the shelf right now. I mean look it's December 8 or whatever it is, some of that, if you're not there by now, you're probably not going to get there. But I do think it will have some benefit, though, in the year-to-go period, too. I mean there's so much going on in this year-ago period as the comps get very, very difficult in Q4. There's also going to be some offset as we replenish distributors and retailers in the U.S. and really around the world also. So we'll see.

It may be premature to answer the question because I know or even think about it, because I know pricing is really just going in the U.S. on Jack Daniel's. But how do you think that -- is it possible that the promotional environment changes, that consumers that perhaps had gotten accustomed to buying Jack and Jim Beam, for example, on deal have been weaned off of that over the last 2 years. I'd be curious to get your thoughts on that."

But I mean there has been a reduction in discounting or promotional levels really, I mean, I think, globally over the last few months. So there's no reason to put something on promotion, if you're hedging on to having a stock problem. 
And so that's been the shortest term impact. But I mean longer term, have we reeducated the consumer a little bit? I think it probably is too early to make that call. But I do think that -- look, I mean, there is inflation and there is pricing coming through on so many consumer categories right now that consumers aren't really going to have an option. 
I mean I think as so many of the brands, and we expect to see the industry -- and we've heard comments from -- even from other competitors that now is the time to rebalance a little bit the volume and the value trends."

People as they shift back to on-premise, you drink less at the on-premise occasion. Do you think it more of as an occasion rather than everyday while we were all locked in our houses. But spirits volumes have remained pretty resilient. So any thoughts you might offer things that you're seeing in your consumer research that are driving that different outside of just this long-term trend of share gains for the industry?"

I mean, you bring up what I think is one of the more most important sort of things that's happening these days is that we're trying to measure and I'm sure you are, too, and that's really is the U.S. spirits market, is it at a stepped-up growth rate?",310,"Yes. I mean, you bring up what I think is one of the more most important sort of things that's happening these days is that we're trying to measure and I'm sure you are, too, and that's really is the U.S. spirits market, is it at a stepped-up growth rate? It certainly was, as you mentioned, for sort of the 12 months -- the first 12 months of the pandemic. But now we're in the second -- we're closing out the second 12 months. 
And the trends that we're looking at are still very strong on a -- particularly, I'm just staring at a 2-year stack, which I encourage everyone to do that as opposed to the 1 year because I think within Brown-Forman, particularly on a 1-year basis, you're going to be looking -- you kind of get apples and oranges mixed up because we did not fall nearly as far as our competitors did at the beginning of the pandemic. And so our comparisons are a little bit more difficult now. 
So that's why we're internally really focused on that on the 2-year stack. But if I look at NAFTA data, I mean, TDS is still up there in the sort of low double-digit range, and it's not slowing down. In fact, 3 months is better than 12.  So I mean, you've got some real strong trends in spirits, it seems like it's retained its share gains that it made during the pandemic. And just the question is how long can it hold it? I don't expect double-digit growth necessarily to hold forever. But a U.S. spirits market that used to be maybe a 4.5% or 5% growth market, is it 6 or 7 now. And I think we'll see as the next few months and quarters sort of go by.
