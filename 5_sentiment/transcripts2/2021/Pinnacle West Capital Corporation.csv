I want to spend a few minutes looking back on 2020 because there were certainly challenges, but there are also many impressive accomplishments. So as part of my operations update, I'll",1084,"Great. Thank you, Stephanie, and thank you all for joining us today. 
I want to spend a few minutes looking back on 2020 because there were certainly challenges, but there are also many impressive accomplishments. So as part of my operations update, I'll share with you some of the most notable successes from 2020. I'll also provide a regulatory update and highlight our goals for 2021, and then Ted will discuss our 2020 earnings and our approach to communicating forward-looking financial expectations. 
I'd like to start by recognizing our field team's exceptional execution in 2020. Our nonnuclear fleet recorded its best reliability performance since 2007 with a summertime equivalent availability factor of 95.3%. We also celebrated our best year ever for service reliability. When you exclude voluntary and proactive fire mitigation impacts. With that performance, the average APS customer experienced less than 1 power outage and face fewer total minutes of interrupted service than industry averages. 
And Palo Verde surpassed the 1 billion gross megawatt hours mark for production over the life of the plant, and it achieved the summer reliability capacity factor of 100%. And in addition, the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Nuclear Energy announced Palo Verde was the nation's top producer of carbon-free energy for the 25th year in a row, highlighting its important contribution to our clean energy commitment. 
Our team's performance was even more meaningful given the record-setting summer. In 2020, we set a new record for peak demand on our system, beating the former 2017 record by 4% and then surpassing that record 6 more times. Our partnership and support, both to and from our customers was another defining aspect to me of 2020. On the most challenging summer days, our customers responded to our time of use rate structure and a request to voluntarily conserve by reducing peak demand up to 240 megawatts. 
Our customers were there for us last year, and we were there for our customers. In 2020, we provided more than $15 million in pandemic aid to our customers and our communities. And our commitment to our customers, communities and to each other is captured in our new APS promise, which we adopted last year. 
The APS promise incorporates the principles and behaviors that will empower us to achieve our strategic goals. It represents the opportunity to build on our cultural strengths and develop new behaviors that will enable our future success. And I want to share with you an example of this behavior involves Glenn Chamberlin, who's a storekeeper at our Yucca power plant in Yuma, and he assisted a customer who rode his bike to the plant in an effort to pay his bill. 
Glen not only located the nearest bill payment location, but he also provided the customer water and helped them get to the grocery store to pay his bill. Glen went above and beyond his duties to ensure that this customer had a positive experience with APS, and it's a great example of the APS promise an action by doing the right thing and being empowered to go the extra mile literally in this case, our customers. 
Turning now to regulatory. We started 2021 with 2 new commissioners and a new Chair. Commissioner Tovar, a Democrat and Commissioner O'connor, a Republican, joined the bench in addition, Commissioner Marches Peterson was elected chairwoman. After her election, Chairman Mark has Peterson outlined several priorities, including moving forward with the commission's energy rules improving Arizona's regulatory climate and establishing permanent disconnect rules. 
With regard to the commission's energy rules, the Arizona legislature has introduced 2 identical measures, 1 in the Senate and 1 in the House of Representatives that seek to limit the commission's ability to set energy policy. Each version was heard by the respective Natural Resources Energy and Water Committee and they passed along party lines. 
Although we can't predict if these bills will ultimately pass and be signed by the governor, we do know that this will not change our investment plans in clean energy or our commitment to become 100% carbon-free by 2050. For our Rate Case, the hearing began on January 14 and is expected to conclude by mid-March. After the hearing, the parties will file briefs and the administrative law judge will issue what's called a recommended opinion in order. 
Finally, the commission will schedule the case for an open meeting to vote, and our current expectation is that the case will likely conclude around midyear. On February 22, APS entered into a settlement agreement with the Arizona Attorney General's office related to the implementation of new service plans from our 2016 rate case, including the execution of our customer education and outreach plan. 
The settlement resulted in APS paying $24.75 million, $24 million of which will be returned to as many as 228,000 eligible APS customers. So moving all customers to new plans in the 2017, 2018 time frame was a major undertaking and an industry first. There are areas we could have done better to guide customers through the process. 
Recognizing that, we've embraced lessons learned and applied a lot of improvement, and it's my hope that the settlement agreement will enable us to concentrate on building a best-in-class customer experience which, in turn, will provide improved shareholder value for the long term. And I've said this before, and I think it's important, we will create shareholder value by creating customer value. 
Looking forward, our goals for 2021 include continuously improving our customer communication and engagement, enhancing our regulatory relationship and continued execution of our clean energy commitment. 
On January 22, we celebrated 1 year since announcing our goal to reach 100% clean carbon-free energy by 2050. Over the past year, we secured more than 400 megawatts of clean energy resources. And we've also issued RFPs late last year to acquire battery storage and renewables. Those RFPs are expected to add more than 1 gigawatt of clean energy resources to the system. In addition to reducing carbon through our generation resources, we also committed to transition 30% of our light-duty vehicles and equipment to electric and ultimately, to operate a 100% clean carbon-free transportation fleet by 2050. 
Our performance in 2020 demonstrates that we have what it takes to forge a path forward and to keep our company strong. In 2021, we look forward to supporting our growing customer base while maintaining our financial health. 
So I want to thank you for your time today, and I'll turn the call over to Ted."

With Jeff having covered our 2020 performance highlights, I'll cover our full year 2020 financial results. I'll also provide additional details around our customer and sales growth forecast, capital program and rate base growth. 
As I mentioned in our third quarter call, we historically have not provided forward-looking guidance during a pending rate case. Consistent with that approach, we will hold off on providing 2020 earnings guidance until after our current rate case concludes. 
For full year 2020, we earned $4.87 per share compared to $4.70 per share in 2019. Excluding the $0.17 impact from the settlement with the attorney general, our 2020 earnings would have been $5.04 per share and near the midpoint of our $4.95 to $5.15 guidance range. 
The decrease in earnings per share resulted from -- resulting from the settlement was offset by $125 million increase in pretax gross margin or $0.83 per share year-over-year from weather. In response to the unusually large weather benefit, we did accelerate the timing of future O&M initiatives. While the pull forward increased our 2020 total O&M, our originally budgeted O&M was trending down. 
In 2020, we met our goal to reduce O&M by $20 million, largely through lean initiatives and automation. In addition, every leader in the company completed White Belt Lean Sigma training. This is an important milestone in our effort to embed a mindset of cost management and customer affordability across the enterprise and to equip our people with the skills and tools to identify and implement ways we can be more efficient and cost-effective. 
This mindset will continue to be a top priority in 2021. 
Turning now to our customer and sales growth. In 2020, we experienced 2.3% customer growth and 1.4% weather-normalized sales growth compared to 2019. Even with the impacts from COVID, we energized more than 27,000 new customers and 5 new substations supporting data centers. 
For 2021, we expect retail customer growth to be between 1.5% and 2.5%. With that trend continuing through 2023, we expect weather-normalized retail electric sales growth between 0.5% to 1.5% in 2021 and between 1% to 2% on average from 2021 through 2023. 
Our guidance now includes estimated contributions of several large data centers that have been interconnected. We will continue to estimate contributions and evaluate our sales growth guidance as these and other new data centers develop more usage history. Although the total impact from COVID-19 on future sales is still unknown, the 2020 impact for the period from March 13 through December 31 was a 1% increase. While residential weather-normalized sales increased 5%. The increase was partially offset by a 4% decrease in commercial and industrial sales. 
These trends have the potential to normalize somewhat through 2021. Our customer and sales growth expectations are supported by the strength we continue to see in our economy. In 2020, Arizona was the third fastest-growing state in the U.S. in addition, construction employment increased by 0.7% in 2020, which places Metro Phoenix among the strongest construction industries in the U.S. 
The uptick in companies relocating Arizona has supported the strength in our construction employment. Another recent example of a new company moving Arizona, Taiwan Semiconductor, selected a site in our service territory to build its new $12 billion facility. We recognize that growth is a key differentiator for Pinnacle West, and we actively engage in economic development to attract new employers and to help existing companies expand their Arizona operations. 
Our success in this area was recently recognized by site selection magazine, which named APS a 2020 top utility in economic development. 
Moving now to CapEx and rate base. As shown on Slides 11 and 12, we have refreshed and rolled forward by 1 year, our capital program and rate base forecast. Our current forecast includes $1.5 billion of capital investments per year for 2021 through 2023. The $150 million reduction in 2021 and $225 million reduction in 2022, reflect our ongoing refinement to balance customer bill impacts while still executing our clean energy plan. 
Specifically, we've updated our pricing assumptions based on pricing we are seeing from actual bids, refreshed our capital requirements to support customer growth and updated the timing of when new resources will be added. Because the outcome of the current rate case is still pending, we are not assuming our future clean energy investments will be recovered through an adjusted mechanism. 
If a recovery mechanism supporting the facilitation of clean energy transition is approved, we will refresh our assumptions and future forecasts to reflect this in other rate case outcomes. 
Importantly, our resource needs still exist, but we are striving to ensure rate gradualism as we procure clean energy resources. 
In closing, our strategy, our team and our fundamental growth are consistent strengths that provide the backbone we need to succeed in the long run. We look forward to providing more detailed guidance at an investor briefing to be scheduled after the rate case is completed. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

But keep in mind, Dariusz, we've historically guided to flat O&M per kilowatt hour sales growth, and we will continue to focus on our lean efforts.

If you were following the hearings, some of the dialogue that's happening right now. We continue to advocate for the advanced energy mechanism. There's some dialogue from other parties that are recognizing the fact that we have in the past, recovered capital investments. 
I'm thinking here, Arizona Sun, which was recovered through our renewable energy surcharge. And so there's some dialogue in the case that says, well, does the advanced energy mechanism have to be it? Or are there opportunities to use other mechanisms. And so that's still a live issue in the case. 
If we ultimately get through the case and the commission doesn't approve an adjustment mechanism, then you would likely be in the next case, making that proposal and again, continuing to demonstrate the benefits that, that brings. And 1 of the primary ones, as Ted mentioned, rate gradualism that's really what we're trying to do here is you don't want to build up a bunch of capital investments then come in with a larger rate increase. If you can manage that over a more gradual pace, you're able to keep rate increases kind of closer to the -- closer to a 0 real, so under the rate of inflation. 
And so we'll continue to make the points as we move forward, but there's several different paths this could ultimately go."

And the challenge, of course, is there's not things change kind of year-over-year. There's not necessarily a sweet spot. It's always good if you can keep the rate pressure kind of at or below the rate of inflation, certainly over the long term. And that's what we've been successful in doing. 
If you go back and look at the last probably 10, 15 years. But it gets a little lumpy. And so growth helps. So as you get additional growth in that can pick up some of the costs for the additional resources. But as Ted's pointed out, we've got retiring assets that need to be replaced. And the biggest benefit that comes from retiring something like a coal asset is that you save the fuel cost and you move into more 0 marginal cost resources. 
And it's really that changing a -- putting a resource that consumes fuel cost and that gets passed through our fuel adjustor, power supply adjuster with a 0 marginal cost resource that creates that headroom because we're changing out expense from the carrying cost of the asset. And so that's where some of this timing is being driven as when you look at Cholla retiring, it's in the 2024 time frame. So it's outside of our planning window, but that's what we're trying to triangulate is to make sure that we're not putting unnecessary or unacceptable build pressure on as we manage through the 2030 clean commitment.

I want to spend a few minutes looking back on 2020 because there were certainly challenges, but there were also many impressive accomplishments. So as part of my operations update, I'll share with you some of the most notable successes from 2020. I'll also provide a regulatory update and highlight our goals for 2021, and then Ted will discuss our 2020 earnings and our approach to communicating forward-looking financial expectations. 
I'd like to start by recognizing our field team's exceptional execution in 2020. Our nonnuclear fleet recorded its best reliability performance since 2007 with a summertime equivalent availability factor of 95.3%. We also celebrated our best year ever for service reliability, when you exclude voluntary and proactive fire mitigation impacts. With that performance, the average APS customer experienced less than 1 power outage and faced fewer total minutes of interrupted service than industry averages. 
And Palo Verde surpassed the 1 billion gross megawatt hours mark for production over the life of the plant, and it achieved the summer reliability capacity factor of 100%. In addition, the U.S. Department of Energy's Office of Nuclear Energy announced Palo Verde was the nation's top producer of carbon-free energy for the 25th year in a row, highlighting its important contribution to our clean energy commitment. 
Our team's performance was even more meaningful given the record-setting summer. In 2020, we set a new record for peak demand on our system, beating the former 2017 record by 4% and then surpassing that record 6 more times. Our partnership and support, both to and from our customers was another defining aspect to me of 2020. On the most challenging summer days, our customers responded to our time of use rate structure and a request to voluntarily conserve by reducing peak demand up to 240 megawatts. 
Our customers were there for us last year, and we were there for our customers. In 2020, we provided more than $15 million in pandemic aid to our customers and our communities. And our commitment to our customers, communities and to each other is captured in our new APS promise, which we adopted last year. 
The APS promise incorporates the principles and behaviors that will empower us to achieve our strategic goals. It represents the opportunity to build on our cultural strengths and develop new behaviors that will enable our future success. And I want to share with you an example of this behavior that involves Glen Chamberlin, who's a storekeeper at our Yucca Power Plant in Yuma, and he assisted a customer who rode his bike to the plant in an effort to pay his bill. 
Glen not only located the nearest bill payment location, but he also provided the customer water and helped them get to the grocery store to pay his bill. Glen went above and beyond his duties to ensure that this customer had a positive experience with APS, and it's a great example of the APS promise at action by doing the right thing and being empowered to go the extra mile literally in this case, our customers. 
Turning now to regulatory. We started 2021 with 2 new commissioners and a new Chair. Commissioner Tovar, a Democrat; and Commissioner O'Connor, a Republican, joined the bench. In addition, Commissioner Márquez Peterson was elected Chairwoman. After her election, Chairwoman, Márquez Peterson outlined several priorities, including moving forward with the commission's energy rules, improving Arizona's regulatory climate and establishing permanent disconnect rules.
With regard to the commission's energy rules, the Arizona legislature has introduced 2 identical measures, 1 in the Senate and 1 in the House of Representatives that seek to limit the commission's ability to set energy policy. Each version was heard by the respective Natural Resources, Energy and Water Committee and they passed along party lines. 
Although we can't predict if these bills will ultimately pass and be signed by the governor, we do know that this will not change our investment plans in clean energy or our commitment to become 100% carbon-free by 2050. For our rate case, the hearing began on January 14 and is expected to conclude by mid-March. After the hearing, the parties will file briefs and the administrative law judge will issue what's called a recommended opinion in order.
Finally, the commission will schedule the case for an open meeting to vote, and our current expectation is that the case will likely conclude around midyear. On February 22, APS entered into a settlement agreement with the Arizona Attorney General's Office related to the implementation of new service plans from our 2016 rate case, including the execution of our customer education and outreach plan. 
The settlement resulted in APS paying $24.75 million, $24 million of which will be returned to as many as 228,000 eligible APS customers. So moving all customers to new plans in the 2017, 2018 time frame was a major undertaking and an industry first. There are areas we could have done better to guide customers through the process. 
Recognizing that, we've embraced lessons learned and applied a lot of improvement, and it's my hope that the settlement agreement will enable us to concentrate on building a best-in-class customer experience which, in turn, will provide improved shareholder value for the long term. And I've said this before, and I think it's important, we will create shareholder value by creating customer value. 
Looking forward, our goals for 2021 include continuously improving our customer communication and engagement, enhancing our regulatory relationship and continued execution of our clean energy commitment. 
On January 22, we celebrated 1 year since announcing our goal to reach 100% clean carbon-free energy by 2050. Over the past year, we secured more than 400 megawatts of clean energy resources. And we've also issued RFPs late last year to acquire battery storage and renewables. Those RFPs are expected to add more than 1 gigawatt of clean energy resources to the system. In addition to reducing carbon through our generation resources, we also committed to transition 30% of our light-duty vehicles and equipment to electric, and ultimately, to operate a 100% clean carbon-free transportation fleet by 2050. 
Our performance in 2020 demonstrates that we have what it takes to forge a path forward and to keep our company strong. In 2021, we look forward to supporting our growing customer base while maintaining our financial health. 
So I want to thank you for your time today, and I'll turn the call over to Ted."

With Jeff having covered our 2020 performance highlights, I'll cover our full year 2020 financial results. I'll also provide additional details around our customer and sales growth forecast, capital program and rate base growth. 
As I mentioned in our third quarter call, we historically have not provided forward-looking guidance during a pending rate case. Consistent with that approach, we will hold off on providing 2020 earnings guidance until after our current rate case concludes. 
For full year 2020, we earned $4.87 per share compared to $4.70 per share in 2019. Excluding the $0.17 impact from the settlement with the Attorney General, our 2020 earnings would have been $5.04 per share and near the midpoint of our $4.95 to $5.15 guidance range. 
The decrease in earnings per share resulted from -- resulting from the settlement was offset by $125 million increase in pretax gross margin or $0.83 per share year-over-year from weather. In response to the unusually large weather benefit, we did accelerate the timing of future O&M initiatives. While the pull forward increased our 2020 total O&M, our originally budgeted O&M was trending down. 
In 2020, we met our goal to reduce O&M by $20 million, largely through lean initiatives and automation. In addition, every leader in the company completed White Belt Lean Sigma training. This is an important milestone in our effort to embed a mindset of cost management and customer affordability across the enterprise and to equip our people with the skills and tools to identify and implement ways we could be more efficient and cost-effective. This mindset will continue to be a top priority in 2021. 
Turning now to our customer and sales growth. In 2020, we experienced 2.3% customer growth and 1.4% weather-normalized sales growth compared to 2019. Even with the impacts from COVID, we energized more than 27,000 new customers and 5 new substations supporting data centers. 
For 2021, we expect retail customer growth to be between 1.5% and 2.5%, with that trend continuing through 2023. We expect weather-normalized retail electric sales growth between 0.5% to 1.5% in 2021 and between 1% to 2% on average from 2021 through 2023. 
Our guidance now includes estimated contributions of several large data centers that have been interconnected. We will continue to estimate contributions and evaluate our sales growth guidance as these and other new data centers develop more usage history. Although the total impact from COVID-19 on future sales is still unknown, the 2020 impact for the period from March 13 through December 31 was a 1% increase. While residential weather-normalized sales increased 5%., the increase was partially offset by a 4% decrease in commercial and industrial sales. 
These trends have the potential to normalize somewhat through 2021. Our customer and sales growth expectations are supported by the strength we continue to see in our economy. In 2020, Arizona was the third fastest-growing state in the U.S. In addition, construction employment increased by 0.7% in 2020, which places Metro Phoenix among the strongest construction industries in the U.S. 
The uptick in companies relocating Arizona has supported the strength in our construction employment. Another recent example of a new company moving Arizona, Taiwan Semiconductor, selected a site in our service territory to build its new $12 billion facility. We recognize that growth is a key differentiator for Pinnacle West, and we actively engage in economic development to attract new employers and to help existing companies expand their Arizona operations. 
Our success in this area was recently recognized by Site Selection magazine, which named APS a 2020 top utility in economic development. 
Moving now to CapEx and rate base. As shown on Slides 11 and 12, we have refreshed and rolled forward by 1 year our capital program and rate base forecast. Our current forecast includes $1.5 billion of capital investments per year for 2021 through 2023. The $150 million reduction in 2021 and $225 million reduction in 2022 reflect our ongoing refinement to balance customer bill impacts while still executing our clean energy plan. 
Specifically, we've updated our pricing assumptions based on pricing we are seeing from actual bids, refreshed our capital requirements to support customer growth and updated the timing of when new resources will be added. Because the outcome of the current rate case is still pending, we are not assuming our future clean energy investments will be recovered through an adjusted mechanism. 
If a recovery mechanism supporting the facilitation of clean energy transition is approved, we will refresh our assumptions and future forecasts to reflect this and other rate case outcomes. 
Importantly, our resource needs still exist, but we are striving to ensure rate gradualism as we procure clean energy resources. 
In closing, our strategy, our team and our fundamental growth are consistent strengths that provide the backbone we need to succeed in the long run. We look forward to providing more detailed guidance at an investor briefing to be scheduled after the rate case is complete.
This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

If you were following the hearings, some of the dialogue that's happening right now. We continue to advocate for the advanced energy mechanism. There's some dialogue from other parties that are recognizing the fact that we have, in the past, recovered capital investments. 
I'm thinking here, Arizona Sun, which was recovered through our renewable energy surcharge. And so there's some dialogue in the case that says, well, does the advanced energy mechanism have to be it? Or are there opportunities to use other mechanisms? And so that's still a live issue in the case. 
If we ultimately get through the case and the commission doesn't approve an adjustment mechanism, then you would likely be, in the next case, making that proposal and again continuing to demonstrate the benefits that, that brings, and 1 of the primary ones, as Ted mentioned, rate gradualism that's really what we're trying to do here is you don't want to build up a bunch of capital investments then come in with a larger rate increase. If you can manage that over a more gradual pace, you're able to keep rate increases kind of closer to the -- closer to a 0 real, so under the rate of inflation.

When the rate case concludes, we'll take that opportunity to look at our guidance going forward, including the capital plan. The benefit of the mechanism, as Jeff pointed out, is it promotes rate gradualism and helps ensure a minimal and more gradual bill impact to customers over time. So that's 1 of the important elements of the mechanism, but we'll really take a point to look at the entire rate case outcome, including whether the proposed mechanism is approved to then look at guidance going forward, including CapEx."

The timing between now and 2030 still leaves a lot of opportunity for us to continue to execute and invest in clean generation. And as stated earlier, the fuel savings that will create that bill headroom is largely beyond this 2023 period, and therefore, creates an opportunity for continued clean energy investments while minimizing bill impact."

And the challenge, of course, is there's not -- things change kind of year-over-year. There's not necessarily a sweet spot. It's always good if you can keep the rate pressure kind of at or below the rate of inflation, certainly over the long term. And that's what we've been successful in doing, if you go back and look at the last probably 10, 15 years. 
But it gets a little lumpy. And so growth helps. So as you get additional growth in, that can pick up some of the costs for the additional resources. But as Ted's pointed out, we've got retiring assets that need to be replaced. And the biggest benefit that comes from retiring something like a coal asset is that you save the fuel cost and you move into more 0 marginal cost resources.
And it's really that changing a -- putting a resource that consumes fuel cost and that gets passed through our fuel adjustor, power supply adjustor with a 0 marginal cost resource that creates that headroom because we're changing out expense from the carrying cost of the asset. And so that's where some of this timing is being driven as when you look at Cholla retiring, it's in the 2024 time frame. So it's outside of our planning window, but that's what we're trying to triangulate is to make sure that we're not putting unnecessary or unacceptable build pressure on as we manage through the 2030 clean commitment.

And so before Ted discusses the details of our first quarter results, I'll provide a few updates on our recent operational and regulatory developments. And I'll also touch on our progress towards achieving our 2021 goals. Spring is an important time of year for our summer preparedness work. And while we've always had a robust summer preparedness program, resource adequacy has recently become a more visible topic given the events in neighboring states over the past year. 
To serve our customers with top-tier reliability, each year, we perform preventative maintenance, emergency operations center drills, acquire critical spare equipment, conduct fire mitigation line patrols and execute a comprehensive plan to support public safety and first responders. We're also procuring an additional 450 megawatts of seasonal peaking capacity, including hydro power. And we expanded our contract up to 60 megawatts for demand response from our commercial and industrial customers to help ensure that we've got adequate resources through the 2021 summer season. 
Additional information detailing our summer preparedness work can be found on the Pinnacle West website under the Events and Presentations tab. Our procurement process is another important way that we help ensure long-term resource adequacy. Last year, we announced the addition of 141 megawatts of battery storage to be located on 6 of our APS owned solar sites. 
Development has begun, and this project is on track to meet the expected 2022 in-service date. We also announced 2 RFPs last year, including an all-source RFP and a battery RFP. The response to these solicitations was robust, and we're in the process of reviewing the proposals. We expect to narrow the potential projects under review to a smaller pool soon. 
On the regulatory front, the commission continues to evaluate the clean energy rules preliminarily approved last year. In fact, the commission is scheduled to discuss the clean energy rules at their open meeting today. The commission may hold their final vote today or they may choose to continue the discussion. For our rate case, the hearing concluded in March initial briefs were filed on April 6, and reply briefs were filed on April 30. The ACC is scheduled to discuss at their open meeting today, whether to reopen the evidentiary record in our pending case to include additional evidence, including evidence regarding adjusted cost recovery mechanisms. 
We believe the rate case record is sufficient and that adjusters provide substantial benefit to customers by supporting both critical programs and reflecting changes in utility costs that can be properly passed on to customers. Pending this decision, the next steps in this rate case are that the administrative law judge will issue a recommended opinion and order and the commission will schedule the case for an open meeting to vote.  We currently expect the decision on the rate case will be issued during the third quarter of 2021. 
Turning to our 2021 goals. On the fourth quarter 2020 earnings call, we highlighted improving our customer communication and engagement, enhancing our regulatory relationship and continuing to execute our clean energy commitment as 3 key priorities. We've made progress towards these objectives during the first quarter, but we recognize there's more work to do. Customer enrollment in our Cool Rewards program surpassed 36,000 connected smart thermostats. We're also working on a customer bill redesign project to simplify customer bills. 
And a lot of the work that we're doing in the customer communication and education space is the result of collaboration with an input from our customer advisory and our stakeholder advisory boards. I can say we truly appreciate the individuals and organizations that participate in these forums, and they provide us with tremendous feedback. 
In the regulatory space, we appreciate the commission's balanced decision to implement our annual power supply adjusted rate change, 50% in April and 50% in November, instead of our typical February 1 implementation date. This decision recognizes and balances the ongoing COVID impacts on customers, providing rate gradualism and helping to ensure that the company remains financially secure. 
I already covered some of the progress we've made on procuring additional clean energy. I'm also proud to share that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency selected APS as a 2021 ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year in recognition of our demand-side management programs. These programs contributed to our overall 2020 energy efficiency savings of nearly 586,000 megawatt hours. And they will contribute to reducing lifetime carbon emissions by an estimated 2.1 billion. 
In addition, we continue to explore partnerships with our customers to expand our microgrid offerings. I'll close my comments by sharing that Daniel Froetscher, President and Chief Operating Officer, will retire this August after serving nearly 41 years with the company. Daniel has been instrumental in the success of this company over the past 4 decades. In particular, he served as a respected and admired leader, both within the companies and in the communities that we serve and as a mentor to many. I can express in words, my gratitude and appreciation for Daniel's contribution. I joined my colleagues in congratulating Daniel on his retirement. Thanks, Dan."

With Jeff, having covered our operational and regulatory updates, I'll cover our first quarter 2021 financial results. I'll also provide additional details around our customer and sales growth. As I mentioned on the fourth quarter 2020 call, we will provide 2021 and forward-looking guidance at an investor briefing to be scheduled after the rate case concludes. 
2021 started strong. Earning $0.32 per share compared to $0.27 per share in the first quarter of 2020. Higher pension and other post-retirement nonservice credits, higher transmission revenue and weather all contributed to the increase in earnings, partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expense due to higher planned outage expense compared to the prior year period. 
We also experienced 2.1% customer growth and positive weather-normalized sales growth, both within our expected guidance for the first quarter compared to the same period in 2020. Economic development continues to support our customer and sales growth as headlines regarding new companies moving to our state are becoming even more frequent. 
Chris Camacho, The Greater Phoenix Economic Counsel, President and CEO, said the organization is working with 291 companies that are considering relocating or expanding in the Phoenix area. To support the expansion of businesses Phoenix is projected to add 18.4 million square feet of new industrial space in 2021, placing the valley second nationwide after Dallas according to a study by commercial search. 
This represents a 76% increase over last year for industrial construction. The influx from business relocation also adds to the residential population growth we have experienced. Turning to our financial health. We are following the status of President Biden's infrastructure and tax plan, including the potential for new tax incentives. And we'll integrate any necessary changes to our resource procurement plans and capital forecast if the proposal passes. 
With regard to the potential for our corporate tax rate increase, we are well positioned to address future changes through our existing team adjuster mechanism. As an update on our customer delinquent account balances, The cumulative total dollar amount of all residential accounts and arrears has decreased 30% since December 31, 2020. We see this trend continuing as customers are paying down past due balances. 
We expect the commission's preliminary vote at the April open meeting to implement a permanent summer disconnect moratorium will result in this continuing trend of increasing delinquent balances through the summer and decreasing balances after the expiration of the annual moratorium. For 2021, we expect the increased bad debt expense associated with the summer disconnect moratorium and COVID-19 disconnect moratorium will result in a negative impact to our 2021 operating results of approximately $20 million to $30 million pretax compared to prior years that did not have a disconnect moratorium. 
This is consistent with the results we experienced in 2020. Including the impacts from COVID and the summer disconnect moratorium, we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, solid investment-grade credit ratings, a well-funded pension and sufficient liquidity. In addition, our focus and progress on cost-saving initiatives continues to result in improvements. As a recent example, our supply chain team installed a new inventory optimization software. 
The software uses scenario-based service-level driven methodologies to establish optimal inventory policies. Since implementation in August of last year, this software has reduced our inventory by nearly $9 million, which mitigates potential inventory write-off risk in the future. Our lean efforts continue for managing costs, combined with the key initiatives Jeff highlighted for 2021. They all support our commitment to provide long-term value to both shareholders and customers. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

And as you may know, if you go back to many of the commission's different policy decisions. We have, for example, our LFCR adjuster mechanism because originally, the state had set a policy for full revenue decoupling. And when there was concern about actually going to full revenue decoupling, that was adopted as a mitigation measure. So it's a core piece of the overall energy efficiency structure that was adopted in the state.

And they estimate our service territory to be ultimately the second largest data center hub in the country. So we continue to think that for a variety of reasons, this is a good location for data centers. We're seeing those in early stages of development. 
I think the key, though, is at what rate do the data centers actually fill up from a server capacity standpoint, and therefore, an energy demand standpoint, building the shell of the data center and therefore, interconnecting it as 1 thing. But it takes time for those data centers to then fill up from a capacity and demand standpoint. So that's That's what we'll continue to monitor over time."

We've got a fair amount of electric vehicle manufacturing. So it's -- the real pivot has been in 2007 after that recession, we were primarily a construction residential growth economy, and we're now much more in industrial growth economy. And data centers are obviously a piece of that."

When you look at the vacancy rates, for example, in commercial leasing, If you look year-over-year, pre-COVID post-COVID, they're really only down about 1%. So it went from about 11.5% vacancy to 12.5%. But it's certainly something that we continue to monitor. And when we look at the overall usage trends, you still see a meaningful increase in residential and a meaningful reduction compared to historical patterns of commercial industrial. And so the key will be as businesses get more comfortable with reopening how do those 2 normalize. All that said, it doesn't take away from the fact that we've got a very high influx of new meter sets being installed, residential and commercial.

And so before Ted discusses the details of our first quarter results, I'll provide a few updates on our recent operational and regulatory developments. And I'll also touch on our progress towards achieving our 2021 goals. 
Spring is an important time of year for our summer preparedness work. And while we've always had a robust summer preparedness program, resource adequacy has recently become a more visible topic given the events in neighboring states over the past year. 
To serve our customers with top-tier reliability, each year, we perform preventative maintenance, emergency operations center drills, acquire critical spare equipment, conduct fire mitigation line patrols and execute a comprehensive plan to support public safety and first responders. 
We're also procuring an additional 450 megawatts of seasonal peaking capacity, including hydro power. And we expanded our contract up to 60 megawatts for demand response from our commercial and industrial customers to help ensure that we've got adequate resources through the 2021 summer season. 
Additional information detailing our summer preparedness work can be found on the Pinnacle West website under the Events and Presentations tab. Our procurement process is another important way that we help ensure long-term resource adequacy. Last year, we announced the addition of 141 megawatts of battery storage to be located on 6 of our APS-owned solar sites. 
Development has begun, and this project is on track to meet the expected 2022 in-service date. We also announced 2 RFPs last year, including an all-source RFP and a battery RFP. The response to these solicitations was robust, and we're in the process of reviewing the proposals. We expect to narrow the potential projects under review to a smaller pool soon. 
On the regulatory front, the commission continues to evaluate the clean energy rules preliminarily approved last year. In fact, the commission is scheduled to discuss the clean energy rules at their open meeting today. The commission may hold their final vote today or they may choose to continue the discussion. 
For our rate case, the hearing concluded in March. Initial briefs were filed on April 6, and reply briefs were filed on April 30. The ACC is scheduled to discuss at their open meeting today, whether to reopen the evidentiary record in our pending case to include additional evidence, including evidence regarding adjusted cost recovery mechanisms. 
We believe the rate case record is sufficient and that adjusters provide substantial benefit to customers by supporting both critical programs and reflecting changes in utility costs that can be properly passed on to customers. Pending this decision, the next steps in this rate case are that the administrative law judge will issue a recommended opinion in order and the commission will schedule the case for an open meeting to vote.  We currently expect the decision on the rate case will be issued during the third quarter of 2021. 
Turning to our 2021 goals. On the fourth quarter 2020 earnings call, we highlighted improving our customer communication and engagement, enhancing our regulatory relationship and continuing to execute our clean energy commitment as 3 key priorities. We've made progress towards these objectives during the first quarter, but we recognize there's more work to do. Customer enrollment in our Cool Rewards program surpassed 36,000 connected smart thermostats. We're also working on a customer bill redesign project to simplify customer bills. 
And a lot of the work that we're doing in the customer communication and education space is the result of collaboration with an input from our customer advisory and our stakeholder advisory boards. I can say we truly appreciate the individuals and organizations that participate in these forums, and they provide us with tremendous feedback. 
In the regulatory space, we appreciate the commission's balanced decision to implement our annual power supply adjusted rate change, 50% in April and 50% in November, instead of our typical February 1 implementation date. This decision recognizes and balances the ongoing COVID impacts on customers, providing rate gradualism and helping to ensure that the company remains financially secure. 
I already covered some of the progress we've made on procuring additional clean energy. I'm also proud to share that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency selected APS as a 2021 ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year in recognition of our demand-side management programs. These programs contributed to our overall 2020 energy efficiency savings of nearly 586,000 megawatt hours. And they will contribute to reducing lifetime carbon emissions by an estimated 2.1 billion pounds. In addition, we continue to explore partnerships with our customers to expand our microgrid offerings. 
I'll close my comments by sharing that Daniel Froetscher, President and Chief Operating Officer, will retire this August after serving nearly 41 years with the company. Daniel has been instrumental in the success of this company over the past 4 decades. In particular, he served as a respected and admired leader, both within the companies and in the communities that we serve and as a mentor to many. I can express in words, my gratitude and appreciation for Daniel's contribution. I joined my colleagues in congratulating Daniel on his retirement. Thanks, Dan."

With Jeff, having covered our operational and regulatory updates, I'll cover our first quarter 2021 financial results. I'll also provide additional details around our customer and sales g",613,"Thank you, Jeff, and thanks again to everyone for joining us today. With Jeff, having covered our operational and regulatory updates, I'll cover our first quarter 2021 financial results. I'll also provide additional details around our customer and sales growth. As I mentioned on the fourth quarter 2020 call, we will provide 2021 and forward-looking guidance at an investor briefing to be scheduled after the rate case concludes. 
2021 started strong earning $0.32 per share compared to $0.27 per share in the first quarter of 2020. Higher pension and other post-retirement nonservice credits, higher transmission revenue and weather all contributed to the increase in earnings, partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expense due to higher planned outage expense compared to the prior year period. 
We also experienced 2.1% customer growth and positive weather-normalized sales growth, both within our expected guidance for the first quarter compared to the same period in 2020. Economic development continues to support our customer and sales growth as headlines regarding new companies moving to our state are becoming even more frequent. 
Chris Camacho, The Greater Phoenix Economic Council President and CEO, said the organization is working with 291 companies that are considering relocating or expanding in the Phoenix area. To support the expansion of businesses, Phoenix is projected to add 18.4 million square feet of new industrial space in 2021, placing the valley second nationwide after Dallas according to a study by commercial search. This represents a 76% increase over last year for industrial construction. The influx from business relocation also adds to the residential population growth we have experienced. 
Turning to our financial health. We are following the status of President Biden's infrastructure and tax plan, including the potential for new tax incentives. And we'll integrate any necessary changes to our resource procurement plans and capital forecast if the proposal passes. 
With regard to the potential for our corporate tax rate increase, we are well positioned to address future changes through our existing team adjuster mechanism. As an update on our customer delinquent account balances the cumulative total dollar amount of all residential accounts and arrears has decreased 30% since December 31, 2020. We see this trend continuing as customers are paying down past due balances. 
We expect the commission's preliminary vote at the April open meeting to implement a permanent summer disconnect moratorium will result in this continuing trend of increasing delinquent balances through the summer and decreasing balances after the expiration of the annual moratorium. 
For 2021, we expect the increased bad debt expense associated with the summer disconnect moratorium and COVID-19 disconnect moratorium will result in a negative impact to our 2021 operating results of approximately $20 million to $30 million pretax compared to prior years that did not have a disconnect moratorium. This is consistent with the results we experienced in 2020. 
Including the impacts from COVID and the summer disconnect moratorium, we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, solid investment-grade credit ratings, a well-funded pension and sufficient liquidity. In addition, our focus and progress on cost-saving initiatives continues to result in improvements. 
As a recent example, our supply chain team installed a new inventory optimization software. The software uses scenario-based service-level driven methodologies to establish optimal inventory policies. Since implementation in August of last year, this software has reduced our inventory by nearly $9 million, which mitigates potential inventory write-off risk in the future. Our lean efforts continue for managing costs, combined with the key initiatives Jeff highlighted for 2021. They all support our commitment to provide long-term value to both shareholders and customers. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

And as you may know, if you go back to many of the commission's different policy decisions. We have, for example, our LFCR adjuster mechanism because originally, the state had set a policy for full revenue decoupling. And when there was concern about actually going to full revenue decoupling, that was adopted as a mitigation measure. So that's a core piece of the overall energy efficiency structure that was adopted in the state.

And of course, really, we didn't see the effects of COVID until the very end of Q1 last year. So from that standpoint, I still see that to be a fairly mild impact compared to what it otherwise could have been. 
When you look at the vacancy rates, for example, in commercial leasing, If you look year-over-year, pre-COVID post-COVID, they're really only down about 1%. So it went from about 11.5% vacancy to 12.5%. But it's certainly something that we continue to monitor. And when we look at the overall usage trends, you still see a meaningful increase in residential and a meaningful reduction compared to historical patterns of commercial industrial. And so the key will be as businesses get more comfortable with reopening how do those 2 normalize. All that said, it doesn't take away from the fact that we've got a very high influx of new meter sets being installed, residential and commercial. And so when we net it together, we still expect to see net positive growth."

And so before Ted discusses the details of our first quarter results, I'll provide a few updates on our recent operational and regulatory developments. And I'll also touch on our progress towards achieving our 2021 goals. 
Spring is an important time of year for our summer preparedness work. And while we've always had a robust summer preparedness program, resource adequacy has recently become a more visible topic given the events in neighboring states over the past year. 
To serve our customers with top-tier reliability, each year, we perform preventative maintenance, emergency operations center drills, acquire critical spare equipment, conduct fire mitigation line patrols and execute a comprehensive plan to support public safety and first responders. 
We're also procuring an additional 450 megawatts of seasonal peaking capacity, including hydro power. And we expanded our contract up to 60 megawatts for demand response from our commercial and industrial customers to help ensure that we've got adequate resources through the 2021 summer season. 
Additional information detailing our summer preparedness work can be found on the Pinnacle West website under the Events and Presentations tab. Our procurement process is another important way that we help ensure long-term resource adequacy. Last year, we announced the addition of 141 megawatts of battery storage to be located on 6 of our APS-owned solar sites. 
Development has begun, and this project is on track to meet the expected 2022 in-service date. We also announced 2 RFPs last year, including an all-source RFP and a battery RFP. The response to these solicitations was robust, and we're in the process of reviewing the proposals. We expect to narrow the potential projects under review to a smaller pool soon. 
On the regulatory front, the commission continues to evaluate the clean energy rules preliminarily approved last year. In fact, the commission is scheduled to discuss the clean energy rules at their open meeting today. The commission may hold their final vote today or they may choose to continue the discussion. 
For our rate case, the hearing concluded in March. Initial briefs were filed on April 6, and reply briefs were filed on April 30. The ACC is scheduled to discuss at their open meeting today, whether to reopen the evidentiary record in our pending case to include additional evidence, including evidence regarding adjusted cost recovery mechanisms. 
We believe the rate case record is sufficient and that adjusters provide substantial benefit to customers by supporting both critical programs and reflecting changes in utility costs that can be properly passed on to customers. Pending this decision, the next steps in this rate case are that the administrative law judge will issue a recommended opinion in order and the commission will schedule the case for an open meeting to vote.  We currently expect the decision on the rate case will be issued during the third quarter of 2021. 
Turning to our 2021 goals. On the fourth quarter 2020 earnings call, we highlighted improving our customer communication and engagement, enhancing our regulatory relationship and continuing to execute our clean energy commitment as 3 key priorities. We've made progress towards these objectives during the first quarter, but we recognize there's more work to do. Customer enrollment in our Cool Rewards program surpassed 36,000 connected smart thermostats. We're also working on a customer bill redesign project to simplify customer bills. 
And a lot of the work that we're doing in the customer communication and education space is the result of collaboration with an input from our customer advisory and our stakeholder advisory boards. I can say we truly appreciate the individuals and organizations that participate in these forums, and they provide us with tremendous feedback. 
In the regulatory space, we appreciate the commission's balanced decision to implement our annual power supply adjusted rate change, 50% in April and 50% in November, instead of our typical February 1 implementation date. This decision recognizes and balances the ongoing COVID impacts on customers, providing rate gradualism and helping to ensure that the company remains financially secure. 
I already covered some of the progress we've made on procuring additional clean energy. I'm also proud to share that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency selected APS as a 2021 ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year in recognition of our demand-side management programs. These programs contributed to our overall 2020 energy efficiency savings of nearly 586,000 megawatt hours. And they will contribute to reducing lifetime carbon emissions by an estimated 2.1 billion pounds. In addition, we continue to explore partnerships with our customers to expand our microgrid offerings. 
I'll close my comments by sharing that Daniel Froetscher, President and Chief Operating Officer, will retire this August after serving nearly 41 years with the company. Daniel has been instrumental in the success of this company over the past 4 decades. In particular, he served as a respected and admired leader, both within the companies and in the communities that we serve and as a mentor to many. I can express in words, my gratitude and appreciation for Daniel's contribution. I joined my colleagues in congratulating Daniel on his retirement. Thanks, Dan."

With Jeff, having covered our operational and regulatory updates, I'll cover our first quarter 2021 financial results. I'll also provide additional details around our customer and sales growth. As I mentioned on the fourth quarter 2020 call, we will provide 2021 and forward-looking guidance at an investor briefing to be scheduled after the rate case concludes. 
2021 started strong earning $0.32 per share compared to $0.27 per share in the first quarter of 2020. Higher pension and other post-retirement nonservice credits, higher transmission revenue and weather all contributed to the increase in earnings, partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expense due to higher planned outage expense compared to the prior year period. 
We also experienced 2.1% customer growth and positive weather-normalized sales growth, both within our expected guidance for the first quarter compared to the same period in 2020. Economic development continues to support our customer and sales growth as headlines regarding new companies moving to our state are becoming even more frequent. 
Chris Camacho, The Greater Phoenix Economic Council President and CEO, said the organization is working with 291 companies that are considering relocating or expanding in the Phoenix area. To support the expansion of businesses, Phoenix is projected to add 18.4 million square feet of new industrial space in 2021, placing the valley second nationwide after Dallas according to a study by commercial search. This represents a 76% increase over last year for industrial construction. The influx from business relocation also adds to the residential population growth we have experienced. 
Turning to our financial health. We are following the status of President Biden's infrastructure and tax plan, including the potential for new tax incentives. And we'll integrate any necessary changes to our resource procurement plans and capital forecast if the proposal passes. 
With regard to the potential for our corporate tax rate increase, we are well positioned to address future changes through our existing team adjuster mechanism. As an update on our customer delinquent account balances the cumulative total dollar amount of all residential accounts and arrears has decreased 30% since December 31, 2020. We see this trend continuing as customers are paying down past due balances. 
We expect the commission's preliminary vote at the April open meeting to implement a permanent summer disconnect moratorium will result in this continuing trend of increasing delinquent balances through the summer and decreasing balances after the expiration of the annual moratorium. 
For 2021, we expect the increased bad debt expense associated with the summer disconnect moratorium and COVID-19 disconnect moratorium will result in a negative impact to our 2021 operating results of approximately $20 million to $30 million pretax compared to prior years that did not have a disconnect moratorium. This is consistent with the results we experienced in 2020. 
Including the impacts from COVID and the summer disconnect moratorium, we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, solid investment-grade credit ratings, a well-funded pension and sufficient liquidity. In addition, our focus and progress on cost-saving initiatives continues to result in improvements. 
As a recent example, our supply chain team installed a new inventory optimization software. The software uses scenario-based service-level driven methodologies to establish optimal inventory policies. Since implementation in August of last year, this software has reduced our inventory by nearly $9 million, which mitigates potential inventory write-off risk in the future. Our lean efforts continue for managing costs, combined with the key initiatives Jeff highlighted for 2021. They all support our commitment to provide long-term value to both shareholders and customers. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

I mean this is a question that has come up, not just with us but with other utilities. We can get you a copy of the letter that we filed prior to the open meeting today that, again, tried to lay out the real value that these adjusters create and the fact that they're very common throughout the country. So a lot of this right now is let's continue to provide the support for the structure that we have. 
And as you may know, if you go back to many of the commission's different policy decisions. We have, for example, our LFCR adjuster mechanism because originally, the state had set a policy for full revenue decoupling. And when there was concern about actually going to full revenue decoupling, that was adopted as a mitigation measure. So that's a core piece of the overall energy efficiency structure that was adopted in the state. 
And so we're -- this is the kind of information that is continuing to go to the commissioners. We feel like there's a good record to support that. And they're going to have to decide today whether they want to take additional testimony."

And they estimate our service territory to be ultimately the second largest data center hub in the country. So we continue to think that for a variety of reasons, this is a good location for data centers. We're seeing those in early stages of development. 
I think the key, though, is at what rate do the data centers actually fill up from a server capacity standpoint, and therefore, an energy demand standpoint, building the shell of the data center and therefore, interconnecting it is one thing. But it takes time for those data centers to then fill up from a capacity and demand standpoint. So that's what we'll continue to monitor over time."

We've got a fair amount of electric vehicle manufacturing. So it's -- the real pivot has been in 2007. After that recession, we were primarily a construction residential growth economy, and we're now much more in industrial growth economy and data centers are obviously a piece of that."

When you look at the vacancy rates, for example, in commercial leasing, If you look year-over-year, pre-COVID post-COVID, they're really only down about 1%. So it went from about 11.5% vacancy to 12.5%. But it's certainly something that we continue to monitor. And when we look at the overall usage trends, you still see a meaningful increase in residential and a meaningful reduction compared to historical patterns of commercial industrial. And so the key will be as businesses get more comfortable with reopening how do those 2 normalize. All that said, it doesn't take away from the fact that we've got a very high influx of new meter sets being installed, residential and commercial. And so when we net it together, we still expect to see net positive growth."

And so before Ted discusses the details of our first quarter results, I'll provide a few updates on our recent operational and regulatory developments. And I'll also touch on our progress towards achieving our 2021 goals. 
Spring is an important time of year for our summer preparedness work. And while we've always had a robust summer preparedness program, resource adequacy has recently become a more visible topic given the events in neighboring states over the past year. 
To serve our customers with top-tier reliability, each year, we perform preventative maintenance, emergency operations center drills, acquire critical spare equipment, conduct fire mitigation line patrols and execute a comprehensive plan to support public safety and first responders. 
We're also procuring an additional 450 megawatts of seasonal peaking capacity, including hydro power. And we expanded our contract up to 60 megawatts for demand response from our commercial and industrial customers to help ensure that we've got adequate resources through the 2021 summer season. 
Additional information detailing our summer preparedness work can be found on the Pinnacle West website under the Events and Presentations tab. Our procurement process is another important way that we help ensure long-term resource adequacy. Last year, we announced the addition of 141 megawatts of battery storage to be located on 6 of our APS-owned solar sites. 
Development has begun, and this project is on track to meet the expected 2022 in-service date. We also announced 2 RFPs last year, including an all-source RFP and a battery RFP. The response to these solicitations was robust, and we're in the process of reviewing the proposals. We expect to narrow the potential projects under review to a smaller pool soon. 
On the regulatory front, the commission continues to evaluate the clean energy rules preliminarily approved last year. In fact, the commission is scheduled to discuss the clean energy rules at their open meeting today. The commission may hold their final vote today or they may choose to continue the discussion. 
For our rate case, the hearing concluded in March. Initial briefs were filed on April 6, and reply briefs were filed on April 30. The ACC is scheduled to discuss at their open meeting today, whether to reopen the evidentiary record in our pending case to include additional evidence, including evidence regarding adjusted cost recovery mechanisms. 
We believe the rate case record is sufficient and that adjusters provide substantial benefit to customers by supporting both critical programs and reflecting changes in utility costs that can be properly passed on to customers. Pending this decision, the next steps in this rate case are that the administrative law judge will issue a recommended opinion in order and the commission will schedule the case for an open meeting to vote. We currently expect the decision on the rate case will be issued during the third quarter of 2021. 
Turning to our 2021 goals. On the fourth quarter 2020 earnings call, we highlighted improving our customer communication and engagement, enhancing our regulatory relationship and continuing to execute our clean energy commitment as 3 key priorities. We've made progress towards these objectives during the first quarter, but we recognize there's more work to do. Customer enrollment in our Cool Rewards program surpassed 36,000 connected smart thermostats. We're also working on a customer bill redesign project to simplify customer bills. 
And a lot of the work that we're doing in the customer communication and education space is the result of collaboration with an input from our customer advisory and our stakeholder advisory boards. I can say we truly appreciate the individuals and organizations that participate in these forums, and they provide us with tremendous feedback. 
In the regulatory space, we appreciate the commission's balanced decision to implement our annual power supply adjusted rate change, 50% in April and 50% in November, instead of our typical February 1 implementation date. This decision recognizes and balances the ongoing COVID impacts on customers, providing rate gradualism and helping to ensure that the company remains financially secure. 
I already covered some of the progress we've made on procuring additional clean energy. I'm also proud to share that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency selected APS as a 2021 ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year in recognition of our demand-side management programs. These programs contributed to our overall 2020 energy efficiency savings of nearly 586,000 megawatt hours. And they will contribute to reducing lifetime carbon emissions by an estimated 2.1 billion pounds. In addition, we continue to explore partnerships with our customers to expand our microgrid offerings. 
I'll close my comments by sharing that Daniel Froetscher, President and Chief Operating Officer, will retire this August after serving nearly 41 years with the company. Daniel has been instrumental in the success of this company over the past 4 decades. In particular, he served as a respected and admired leader, both within the companies and in the communities that we serve and as a mentor to many. I can express in words, my gratitude and appreciation for Daniel's contribution. I joined my colleagues in congratulating Daniel on his retirement. Thanks, Dan."

With Jeff, having covered our operational and regulatory updates, I'll cover our first quarter 2021 financial results. I'll also provide additional details around our customer and sales growth. As I mentioned on the fourth quarter 2020 call, we will provide 2021 and forward-looking guidance at an investor briefing to be scheduled after the rate case concludes. 
2021 started strong earning $0.32 per share compared to $0.27 per share in the first quarter of 2020. Higher pension and other post-retirement nonservice credits, higher transmission revenue and weather all contributed to the increase in earnings, partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expense due to higher planned outage expense compared to the prior year period. 
We also experienced 2.1% customer growth and positive weather-normalized sales growth, both within our expected guidance for the first quarter compared to the same period in 2020. Economic development continues to support our customer and sales growth as headlines regarding new companies moving to our state are becoming even more frequent. 
Chris Camacho, The Greater Phoenix Economic Council President and CEO, said the organization is working with 291 companies that are considering relocating or expanding in the Phoenix area. To support the expansion of businesses, Phoenix is projected to add 18.4 million square feet of new industrial space in 2021, placing the valley second nationwide after Dallas according to a study by commercial search. This represents a 76% increase over last year for industrial construction. The influx from business relocation also adds to the residential population growth we have experienced. 
Turning to our financial health. We are following the status of President Biden's infrastructure and tax plan, including the potential for new tax incentives. And we'll integrate any necessary changes to our resource procurement plans and capital forecast if the proposal passes. 
With regard to the potential for our corporate tax rate increase, we are well positioned to address future changes through our existing team adjuster mechanism. As an update on our customer delinquent account balances the cumulative total dollar amount of all residential accounts and arrears has decreased 30% since December 31, 2020. We see this trend continuing as customers are paying down past due balances. 
We expect the commission's preliminary vote at the April open meeting to implement a permanent summer disconnect moratorium will result in this continuing trend of increasing delinquent balances through the summer and decreasing balances after the expiration of the annual moratorium. 
For 2021, we expect the increased bad debt expense associated with the summer disconnect moratorium and COVID-19 disconnect moratorium will result in a negative impact to our 2021 operating results of approximately $20 million to $30 million pretax compared to prior years that did not have a disconnect moratorium. This is consistent with the results we experienced in 2020. 
Including the impacts from COVID and the summer disconnect moratorium, we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, solid investment-grade credit ratings, a well-funded pension and sufficient liquidity. In addition, our focus and progress on cost-saving initiatives continues to result in improvements. 
As a recent example, our supply chain team installed a new inventory optimization software. The software uses scenario-based service-level driven methodologies to establish optimal inventory policies. Since implementation in August of last year, this software has reduced our inventory by nearly $9 million, which mitigates potential inventory write-off risk in the future. Our lean efforts continue for managing costs, combined with the key initiatives Jeff highlighted for 2021. They all support our commitment to provide long-term value to both shareholders and customers. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

So it's a little bit of a question now of how long that will take her to prepare it. As I mentioned in my opening comments, they're likely to discuss today, whether they want to reopen the evidentiary hearing and have a little bit more testimony taken around adjusters. If that happens, that could add a little bit of time to it. So we just don't have a lot of visibility on to where that's going right now. But our best estimates on what we know right now is that given how long it usually takes a judge to prepare a recommended order and opinion that were in the third quarter."

And as you may know, if you go back to many of the commission's different policy decisions. We have, for example, our LFCR adjuster mechanism because originally, the state had set a policy for full revenue decoupling. And when there was concern about actually going to full revenue decoupling, that was adopted as a mitigation measure. So that's a core piece of the overall energy efficiency structure that was adopted in the state.

And they estimate our service territory to be ultimately the second largest data center hub in the country. So we continue to think that for a variety of reasons, this is a good location for data centers. We're seeing those in early stages of development. 
I think the key, though, is at what rate do the data centers actually fill up from a server capacity standpoint, and therefore, an energy demand standpoint, building the shell of the data center and therefore, interconnecting it is one thing. But it takes time for those data centers to then fill up from a capacity and demand standpoint. So that's what we'll continue to monitor over time."

When you look at the vacancy rates, for example, in commercial leasing, If you look year-over-year, pre-COVID post-COVID, they're really only down about 1%. So it went from about 11.5% vacancy to 12.5%. But it's certainly something that we continue to monitor. And when we look at the overall usage trends, you still see a meaningful increase in residential and a meaningful reduction compared to historical patterns of commercial industrial. And so the key will be as businesses get more comfortable with reopening how do those 2 normalize. All that said, it doesn't take away from the fact that we've got a very high influx of new meter sets being installed, residential and commercial.

And I'll also touch on our progress towards achieving our 2021 goals. 
Spring is an important time of year for our summer preparedness work. And while we've always had a robust summer preparedness program, resource adequacy has recently become a more visible topic given the events in neighboring states over the past year. 
To serve our customers with top-tier reliability, each year, we perform preventative maintenance, emergency operations center drills, acquire critical spare equipment, conduct fire mitigation line patrols and execute a comprehensive plan to support public safety and first responders. 
We're also procuring an additional 450 megawatts of seasonal peaking capacity, including hydro power. And we expanded our contract up to 60 megawatts for demand response from our commercial and industrial customers to help ensure that we've got adequate resources through the 2021 summer season. 
Additional information detailing our summer preparedness work can be found on the Pinnacle West website under the Events and Presentations tab. Our procurement process is another important way that we help ensure long-term resource adequacy. Last year, we announced the addition of 141 megawatts of battery storage to be located on 6 of our APS-owned solar sites. 
Development has begun, and this project is on track to meet the expected 2022 in-service date. We also announced 2 RFPs last year, including an all-source RFP and a battery RFP. The response to these solicitations was robust, and we're in the process of reviewing the proposals. We expect to narrow the potential projects under review to a smaller pool soon. 
On the regulatory front, the commission continues to evaluate the clean energy rules preliminarily approved last year. In fact, the commission is scheduled to discuss the clean energy rules at their open meeting today. The commission may hold their final vote today or they may choose to continue the discussion. 
For our rate case, the hearing concluded in March. Initial briefs were filed on April 6, and reply briefs were filed on April 30. The ACC is scheduled to discuss at their open meeting today, whether to reopen the evidentiary record in our pending case to include additional evidence, including evidence regarding adjusted cost recovery mechanisms. 
We believe the rate case record is sufficient and that adjusters provide substantial benefit to customers by supporting both critical programs and reflecting changes in utility costs that can be properly passed on to customers. Pending this decision, the next steps in this rate case are that the administrative law judge will issue a recommended opinion in order and the commission will schedule the case for an open meeting to vote. We currently expect the decision on the rate case will be issued during the third quarter of 2021. 
Turning to our 2021 goals. On the fourth quarter 2020 earnings call, we highlighted improving our customer communication and engagement, enhancing our regulatory relationship and continuing to execute our clean energy commitment as 3 key priorities. We've made progress towards these objectives during the first quarter, but we recognize there's more work to do. Customer enrollment in our Cool Rewards program surpassed 36,000 connected smart thermostats. We're also working on a customer bill redesign project to simplify customer bills. 
And a lot of the work that we're doing in the customer communication and education space is the result of collaboration with an input from our customer advisory and our stakeholder advisory boards. I can say we truly appreciate the individuals and organizations that participate in these forums, and they provide us with tremendous feedback. 
In the regulatory space, we appreciate the commission's balanced decision to implement our annual power supply adjusted rate change, 50% in April and 50% in November, instead of our typical February 1 implementation date. This decision recognizes and balances the ongoing COVID impacts on customers, providing rate gradualism and helping to ensure that the company remains financially secure. 
I already covered some of the progress we've made on procuring additional clean energy. I'm also proud to share that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency selected APS as a 2021 ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year in recognition of our demand-side management programs. These programs contributed to our overall 2020 energy efficiency savings of nearly 586,000 megawatt hours. And they will contribute to reducing lifetime carbon emissions by an estimated 2.1 billion pounds. In addition, we continue to explore partnerships with our customers to expand our microgrid offerings. 
I'll close my comments by sharing that Daniel Froetscher, President and Chief Operating Officer, will retire this August after serving nearly 41 years with the company. Daniel has been instrumental in the success of this company over the past 4 decades. In particular, he served as a respected and admired leader, both within the companies and in the communities that we serve and as a mentor to many. I can express in words, my gratitude and appreciation for Daniel's contribution. I joined my colleagues in congratulating Daniel on his retirement. Thanks, Dan."

296957,710395220,2295182,"Pinnacle West Capital Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 05, 2021",2021-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Pinnacle West Capital Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jeff, and thanks again to everyone for joining us today. With Jeff, having covered our operational and regulatory updates, I'll cover our first quarter 2021 financial results. I'll also provide additional details around our customer and sales g",613,"Thank you, Jeff, and thanks again to everyone for joining us today. With Jeff, having covered our operational and regulatory updates, I'll cover our first quarter 2021 financial results. I'll also provide additional details around our customer and sales growth. As I mentioned on the fourth quarter 2020 call, we will provide 2021 and forward-looking guidance at an investor briefing to be scheduled after the rate case concludes. 
2021 started strong earning $0.32 per share compared to $0.27 per share in the first quarter of 2020. Higher pension and other post-retirement nonservice credits, higher transmission revenue and weather all contributed to the increase in earnings, partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expense due to higher planned outage expense compared to the prior year period. 
We also experienced 2.1% customer growth and positive weather-normalized sales growth, both within our expected guidance for the first quarter compared to the same period in 2020. Economic development continues to support our customer and sales growth as headlines regarding new companies moving to our state are becoming even more frequent. 
Chris Camacho, The Greater Phoenix Economic Council President and CEO, said the organization is working with 291 companies that are considering relocating or expanding in the Phoenix area. To support the expansion of businesses, Phoenix is projected to add 18.4 million square feet of new industrial space in 2021, placing the valley second nationwide after Dallas according to a study by commercial search. This represents a 76% increase over last year for industrial construction. The influx from business relocation also adds to the residential population growth we have experienced. 
Turning to our financial health. We are following the status of President Biden's infrastructure and tax plan, including the potential for new tax incentives. And we'll integrate any necessary changes to our resource procurement plans and capital forecast if the proposal passes. 
With regard to the potential for our corporate tax rate increase, we are well positioned to address future changes through our existing team adjuster mechanism. As an update on our customer delinquent account balances the cumulative total dollar amount of all residential accounts and arrears has decreased 30% since December 31, 2020. We see this trend continuing as customers are paying down past due balances. 
We expect the commission's preliminary vote at the April open meeting to implement a permanent summer disconnect moratorium will result in this continuing trend of increasing delinquent balances through the summer and decreasing balances after the expiration of the annual moratorium. 
For 2021, we expect the increased bad debt expense associated with the summer disconnect moratorium and COVID-19 disconnect moratorium will result in a negative impact to our 2021 operating results of approximately $20 million to $30 million pretax compared to prior years that did not have a disconnect moratorium. This is consistent with the results we experienced in 2020. 
Including the impacts from COVID and the summer disconnect moratorium, we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, solid investment-grade credit ratings, a well-funded pension and sufficient liquidity. In addition, our focus and progress on cost-saving initiatives continues to result in improvements. 
As a recent example, our supply chain team installed a new inventory optimization software. The software uses scenario-based service-level driven methodologies to establish optimal inventory policies. Since implementation in August of last year, this software has reduced our inventory by nearly $9 million, which mitigates potential inventory write-off risk in the future. Our lean efforts continue for managing costs, combined with the key initiatives Jeff highlighted for 2021. They all support our commitment to provide long-term value to both shareholders and customers. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

And as you may know, if you go back to many of the commission's different policy decisions. We have, for example, our LFCR adjuster mechanism because originally, the state had set a policy for full revenue decoupling. And when there was concern about actually going to full revenue decoupling, that was adopted as a mitigation measure. So that's a core piece of the overall energy efficiency structure that was adopted in the state.

I think the key, though, is at what rate do the data centers actually fill up from a server capacity standpoint, and therefore, an energy demand standpoint, building the shell of the data center and therefore, interconnecting it is one thing. But it takes time for those data centers to then fill up from a capacity and demand standpoint. So that's what we'll continue to monitor over time."

When you look at the vacancy rates, for example, in commercial leasing, If you look year-over-year, pre-COVID post-COVID, they're really only down about 1%. So it went from about 11.5% vacancy to 12.5%. But it's certainly something that we continue to monitor. And when we look at the overall usage trends, you still see a meaningful increase in residential and a meaningful reduction compared to historical patterns of commercial industrial. And so the key will be as businesses get more comfortable with reopening how do those 2 normalize. All that said, it doesn't take away from the fact that we've got a very high influx of new meter sets being installed, residential and commercial. And so when we net it together, we still expect to see net positive growth."

I know that the release has a recommended opinion in order and our pending case is the most significant development for all of you, and both Ted and I will discuss that shortly. But I do want to cover some operational and customer matters before we go there. 
So as we progress through the summer season, I'm proud to say our team continues to excel in delivering reliable service to our customers. Arizona experienced several dozen sizable wildfires in June with only mild damage to our infrastructure and minimal customer outages. We have strong vegetation management and fire mitigation programs as well as mandatory line inspection prior to reenergizing in high-risk areas. And all of these contributed to the protection of our infrastructure and reliable service for our customers. We also successfully navigated through an early summer heat wave that resulted in 6 consecutive days of at least 115 degrees and 3 days approaching our all-time peak demand. Our resource procurement efforts and reserve margin standards ensured that we were able to meet the needs of our customers through the hot summer last year, through the early heat wave this year, and we expect these efforts will continue through the balance of the summer. 
Following the heat wave in June, July brought a relentless series of monsoon storms. So it's good to see the monsoon back, but that does present challenges for us. In a 5-day period during mid-July, our teams restored power to more than 120,000 customers affected by storm-related outages and we effectively communicated with our customers regarding outage status and expected service restoration times. Our field crews worked in wet, humid and muddy conditions with no safety events. I'm extremely proud of their exemplary work and the level of service that they've provided. 
With the weather we've already experienced this summer, it remains as important as ever to continue assisting our communities through our heat relief support programs. APS has partnered with St. Vincent De Paul, the Salvation Army and Lyft to ensure that Arizonans have access to an emergency shelter and eviction protection programs, to cooling and hydration stations, and have transportation to the nearest cooling shelter as part of heat relief initiatives offered throughout the summer. This is another example of our effort to collaborate for the benefit of our customers, our communities and our company. 
That focus on customer experience remains a top priority as we look to improve our J.D. Power customer satisfaction scores. We are pleased to see a measurable increase in our year-to-date residential customer satisfaction, but we recognize there's more work to do. We understand the importance of a high-quality customer experience, and I'm grateful and proud of our teams for employing a continuous improvement mindset to drive change for the benefit of our customers. 
So now on to the regulatory front. As you all know, the Administrative Law Judge issued the recommended opinion in order for our rate case on August 2. I will say that we are disappointed and concerned by the recommendation, which would not appropriately allow for the recovery of important investments needed to serve customers reliably. Ted will speak to our estimates of the potential financial impacts if the ROO were to be adopted by the commission. However, I do want to note that this is a recommendation from the Administrative Law Judge, it's not yet a final order of the commission. 
A summary of the key points from the ROO can be found in our investor deck on Slide 23. From that, you can see that the Administrative Law Judge recommended a $3.6 million revenue increase or a nonfuel $29 million revenue decrease; a 9.16% return on equity; an implied 0.05% return on fair value; the disallowance of the deferral and investment in the Four Corners SCR project; and recovery of the deferral and investment in the [ Acacio ] modernization project. There is no question that Four Corners has been a critical asset in serving our customers through the record heat the past several years. Without the EPA-mandated installation of SCRs, that plant would not have been allowed to operate and there just is not enough capacity in the West to reliably run the system without Four Corners. 
We continue to believe that the commission and other stakeholders recognize the importance of investing in assets such as Four Corners to maintain reliability, given the challenges that we've all seen in the West. And we've seen that as we work through the California wheel through order and the concern that the commission has expressed on limitations that reliability challenges in a neighboring state is imposing on Arizona. So Four Corners is critical for us to continue to serve our customers, and our goal is to continue to work with the commission to recover prudent investments and ensure that quality service can be maintained for our customers. The ROO, if approved as is, would put this objective in jeopardy. 
So where are we procedurally? We'll file exceptions to the ROO. They're currently asking for exceptions on August 23, and then the commission will schedule the case to be voted on at a future open meeting. We would expect a decision on this rate case to be issued during the third quarter of 2021. If the outcome of the case does not provide for necessary investments to support customer growth and to maintain the financial health of the company, we have the option to petition the commission for reconsideration of that decision, to challenge the legality of the decision through the court system or to file another rate case, and we will evaluate all of these options after the conclusion of the case to determine the best path forward to serve our customers and to provide value and predictability to our shareholders. In the meantime, we'll follow the rate case procedural schedule, and we'll articulate and advocate the areas in which we disagree with the recommended order. 
On the ESG front, in May, the commission voted to preliminarily approve new clean energy rules that would provide for a final standard of 100% clean energy by 2070 with interim standards, the first of which requires a 50% reduction in carbon emissions by December of 2032. A final commission vote on the clean energy rules package is required for the rules to become effective. We think we're well aligned with the commission on the interim goals and expect to continue our current path to achieve 100% clean energy by 2050. 
We've executed a contract for an additional 60 megawatts of utility-owned energy storage to be located at our APS solar sites. This contract with a 2023 in-service date will complete the addition of storage on all of our current APS-owned solar facilities. In addition, we're working through our current all-source RFP for 600 to 800 megawatts of additional resources, with decisions from that RFP expected in the third quarter of this year. Our MSCI ESG rating improved from a single A to AA this year, with MSCI noting our strong water management performance and decarbonization efforts as key score attributes. 
So we made good progress through the first half of this year, improving our customer experience, enhancing our stakeholder relationships and working towards achieving our ESG and clean energy goals. We need to work through the recommended opinion and order and ensure that our perspective is understood by the commission. So there's certainly more work to do, but I do want to acknowledge the team's dedication and commitment. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ted."

With Jeff, having covered our operational and regulatory updates, I will cover our second quarter 2021 financial results. I'll also provide additional details around our customer and sale",803,"Thank you, Jeff, and thanks again to everyone for joining us today. With Jeff, having covered our operational and regulatory updates, I will cover our second quarter 2021 financial results. I'll also provide additional details around our customer and sales growth and potential impacts from the Administrative Law Judge's recommended opinion and order. 
Our performance in the second quarter remained strong, earning $1.91 per share compared to $1.71 per share in the second quarter of 2020. Higher pension and other post-retirement nonservice credits, higher sales and usage and weather, all contributed to the increase in earnings, partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expenses compared to the prior year period. We experienced 2.3% customer growth and 5.7% weather-normalized sales growth during the second quarter compared to the same period in 2020. Residential sales increased 1.3% and commercial and industrial sales increased 10.3% compared to the second quarter of 2020. The increase in C&I reflects the reopening and return to in-person work we are seeing this year compared to the second quarter last year and COVID business closures that occurred last year and primarily remote work environment. Given the strong rebound in C&I sales and continued residential strength, we're increasing our 2021 sales estimate to 1% to 2% growth from our previous estimate of 0.5% to 1.5% growth. 
The labor market in Arizona is also recovering from the COVID pandemic impacts. For 2021 through the end of May, employment in Metro Phoenix increased 1% compared to 2.2% increase in the entire U.S. -- to be clear, that's 1% in Metro Phoenix compared to a 0.2% increase in the entire U.S. In 2020, Arizona was the third fastest-growing state in the U.S. As a result of this continued strong population growth, Arizona reached the highest level of residential housing permits since 2006 last year. This year, through May, Maricopa County has already reached 21,000 housing permits, which puts housing permits on pace to exceed last year. We believe the relatively low mortgage rates, low cost of living, desirable place with more space and affordable housing will continue to be a driver and grow Metro Phoenix housing market and benefit the overall local economy. This continues to be one of our core strengths of our long-term growth thesis. 
Turning to our financial health, while the recommended opinion and order from the Administrative Law Judge is not a final order from the commission, we want to be transparent about the potential estimated financial implications if the commission were to approve the recommended opinion and order as written. For perspective, the general rule of thumb is that every 50 basis point reduction in ROE equates to approximately $32 million in revenue requirement. Regarding the potential impact from the recommendation to deny Four Corners of the -- to deny recovery of Four Corners SCR investment and deferral, as of June 30, 2021, the SCR deferral balance was approximately $75 million, and the net book value of the asset was approximately $320 million net of accumulated deferred income taxes. Because this is only a recommendation from the ALJ and not a decision from the commission, we will not be making any changes to the deferral at this time. If the commission denies recovery of the deferral, it would likely result in a write-off of approximately $75 million, which is net of accumulated deferred income tax. If the commission also denies recovery of the investment itself, we will consider all regulatory and legal avenues to mitigate any potential write-offs. 
In summary, we estimate the ROO, if approved, could decrease annual net income up to about $90 million, which includes the nonfuel decrease as well as the effects of incremental costs we incur once rates become effective. We're already a top quartile performer for O&M and are employing additional robust cost management improvements throughout the enterprise. This magnitude of a revenue decrease would be significant and detrimental to all of our stakeholders, including customers. 
Regarding our financing plans, we expect to issue up to $500 million of long-term debt at APS during the remainder of 2020 to fund capital investments. We will hold an investor briefing if the rate case concludes, at which time we will provide financial guidance including any forecasted Pinnacle West level funding needs. 
As we continue to navigate through the evolving pandemic and the resolution of our current rate case, we will continue to focus on our commitment to our shareholders customers, communities and our team. The fundamentals within our service territory of strong and diverse economic growth and increasing population and the general attractiveness of Arizona, our strong operational performance, our disciplined cost management all bode well for the future. We will continue to work hard to resolve these current challenges. 
This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

But if the recommendation were to hold at a final decision, then that would trigger a likely write-off of the deferral, which at this time -- or as of June 30, that balance is about $75 million. 
However, if the recommendation for disallowance of the actual plant of SCR was decided on the commission, we do have other options, both within the regulatory space and legal space. And as a result, we'd evaluate our options at that time and that would not necessarily trigger a write-off then, given the fact that you do have other paths to pursue even if a decision was made consistent with the ROO."

If you go back to the time that, that contract was entered into, there was a big debate about solar thermal versus solar photovoltaic, where is the future of it, the importance of the capacity value and the molten salt storage for us, and he had a very different natural gas price profile. 
And so it is, to look today and go back that far and say that this was imprudent, and it's a PPA, so it's a purchase power agreement. It's not an item that's in our rate base and it was done consistent with the commission direction at the time. So the commissioners at the time were very, very excited, very much pushing to have that project move forward. And so understand that [ Chairwoman Marquess Peterson's ] viewpoint on that. We'll continue to share our perspective on it, but it's clear to me that, that was prudent when it was entered into at the time. It was consistent with the standards that we had at the time.

I think what's important is we have the dialogue with the stakeholders and the commission is the understanding that it's a balance.

And if our requirement, if the cost to issue equity is higher, because we're not able to maintain the competitive field to attract equity investment in, and that's ultimately going to be a higher cost to customers. And so that's the important thing. 
And this is we're doing everything that we can to manage costs. We're looking at ways that we can, again, move out of variable fuel resources and start saving on the fuel bill. But we've got to do that in balance. And I think that's the message we have to continue to send to the commission is that you -- if all you focus on is the short-term rate impacts don't reflect on where we are with respect to the work that's already happened in lowering our rates over the last few years, ultimately, it's going to end up costing customers more.

And aside from the current case that we're in from a regulatory construct standpoint, our top priority is to continue to work with stakeholders and the commission to minimize regulatory lag. And that includes getting back to the time frame of the cases that we had before. 
We've actually got a pretty good track record of relatively short duration rate cases. This one is a bit of an anomaly, particularly given it fell within a year of COVID, that certainly had an impact. But aside from that, whether it be our clean investments or investments to continue to support the robust growth within the service territory, we recognize that, that lag has an impact, and we believe there's options to be able to continue to mitigate it, and that is a priority for us, both within this case and beyond. 
We look at the capital plan and aside from investing in clean, we have to fund the growth. We've got commercial industrial customers coming, that demand investment in infrastructure to be able to continue to drive this local economy. And so we need to make sure that we're aligned with our stakeholders and the regulator on the need to continue to fund that capital to be able to fuel Arizona's growth because if you look at the $1.5 billion in our guidance by far, the majority of that is just to keep up with Arizona's growth, and it's our job to do it."

There's nothing else that we could go get. There's no other resource that we could use to keep the lights on. 
And so you have to continue to operate it. So that's why -- and that's why I'm struggling in particular with this recommendation, is this has been clearly demonstrated over the last 2 summers as not just used and useful, but necessary from a capacity basis in the face of a bunch of challenges around capacity, whether it's California or Texas, has just brought that to a highlight. And so you're now putting us in a position to say, well, you got to run the plant, but we're not going to give you a recovery of either the investment in the plant that's required to continue to operate it or the ongoing operating expenses of it, just don't think that's a reasonable outcome."

And just one perspective, we've got some ownership in a couple of wind farms, one is in Missouri and one is in Minnesota. And I think it will be important for us to share with the regulators that the returns that we see from capital invested in those states is better than the returns we can get here in Arizona that puts you in a real predicament. So the ROEs are important to maintain the attractiveness to get capital invested in states and have continued to invest in needed reliability, but we do have some assets that are outside the traditional regulated platform.

I know that the release has a recommended opinion in order and our pending case is the most significant development for all of you, and both Ted and I will discuss that shortly. But I do want to cover some operational and customer matters before we go there.  
So as we progress through the summer season, I'm proud to say our team continues to excel in delivering reliable service to our customers. Arizona experienced several dozen sizable wildfires in June with only mild damage to our infrastructure and minimal customer outages. We have strong vegetation management and fire mitigation programs as well as mandatory line inspection prior to reenergizing in high-risk areas. And all of these contributed to the protection of our infrastructure and reliable service for our customers. We also successfully navigated through an early summer heat wave that resulted in 6 consecutive days of at least 115 degrees and 3 days approaching our all-time peak demand. Our resource procurement efforts and reserve margin standards ensure that we were able to meet the needs of our customers through the hot summer last year, through the early heat wave this year, and we expect these efforts will continue through the balance of the summer.  
Following the heat wave in June, July brought a relentless series of monsoon storms. So it's good to see the monsoon back, but that does present challenges for us. In a 5-day period during mid-July, our teams restored power to more than 120,000 customers affected by storm-related outages and we effectively communicated with our customers regarding outage status and expected service restoration times. Our field crews worked in wet, humid and muddy conditions with no safety events. I'm extremely proud of their exemplary work and the level of service that they've provided.  
With the weather we've already experienced this summer, it remains as important as ever to continue assisting our communities through our heat relief support programs. APS has partnered with St. Vincent De Paul, the Salvation Army and Lyft to ensure that Arizonans have access to an emergency shelter and eviction protection programs, to cooling and hydration stations, and have transportation to the nearest cooling shelter as part of heat relief initiatives offered throughout the summer. This is another example of our effort to collaborate for the benefit of our customers, our communities and our company.  
That focus on customer experience remains a top priority as we look to improve our J.D. Power customer satisfaction scores. We are pleased to see a measurable increase in our year-to-date residential customer satisfaction, but we recognize there's more work to do. We understand the importance of a high-quality customer experience, and I'm grateful and proud of our teams for employing a continuous improvement mindset to drive change for the benefit of our customers.  
So now on to the regulatory front. As you all know, the administrative law judge issued the recommended opinion in order for our rate case on August 2. I will say that we are disappointed and concerned by the recommendation, which would not appropriately allow for the recovery of important investments needed to serve customers reliably. Ted will speak to our estimates of the potential financial impacts if the rule were to be adopted by the commission. However, I do want to note that this is a recommendation from the administrative law judge, it's not yet a final order of the commission.  
A summary of the key points from the rule can be found in our investor deck on Slide 23. From that, you can see that the administrative law judge recommended a $3.6 million revenue increase or a nonfuel $29 million revenue decrease; a 9.16% return on equity; an implied 0.05% return on fair value; the disallowance of the deferral and investment in the Four Corners SCR project; and recovery of the deferral and investment in the Ocotillo Modernization Project. There is no question that Four Corners has been a critical asset in serving our customers through the record heat the past several years. Without the EPA-mandated installation of SCRs, that plant would not have been allowed to operate and there just is not enough capacity in the West to reliably run the system without Four Corners.  
We continue to believe that the commission and other stakeholders recognize the importance of investing in assets such as Four Corners to maintain reliability, given the challenges that we've all seen in the West. And we've seen that as we work through the California wheel through order and the concern that the commission has expressed on limitations that reliability challenges in a neighboring state is imposing on Arizona. So Four Corners is critical for us to continue to serve our customers, and our goal is to continue to work with the commission to recover prudent investments and ensure that quality service can be maintained for our customers. The ROO, if approved as is, would put this objective in jeopardy.  
So where are we procedurally? We'll file exceptions to the ROO. They're currently asking for exceptions on August 23, and then the commission will schedule the case to be voted on at a future open meeting. We would expect a decision on this rate case to be issued during the third quarter of 2021. If the outcome of the case does not provide for necessary investments to support customer growth and to maintain the financial health of the company, we have the option to petition the commission for reconsideration of that decision to challenge the legality of the decision through the court system or to file another rate case. And we will evaluate all of these options after the conclusion of the case to determine the best path forward to serve our customers and to provide value and predictability to our shareholders. In the meantime, we'll follow the rate case procedural schedule, and we'll articulate and advocate the areas in which we disagree with the recommended order.  
On the ESG front, in May, the commission voted to preliminarily approve new clean energy rules that would provide for a final standard of 100% clean energy by 2070 with interim standards, the first of which requires a 50% reduction in carbon emissions by December of 2032. A final commission vote on the clean energy rules package is required for the rules to become effective. We think we're well aligned with the commission on the interim goals and expect to continue our current path to achieve 100% clean energy by 2050.  
We've executed a contract for an additional 60 megawatts of utility-owned energy storage to be located at our APS solar sites. This contract with a 2023 in-service date will complete the addition of storage on all of our current APS-owned solar facilities. In addition, we're working through our current all-source RFP for 600 to 800 megawatts of additional resources, with decisions from that RFP expected in the third quarter of this year.  
Our MSCI ESG rating improved from a single A to AA this year, with MSCI noting our strong water management performance and decarbonization efforts as key score attributes. So we made good progress through the first half of this year, improving our customer experience, enhancing our stakeholder relationships and working towards achieving our ESG and clean energy goals. We need to work through the recommended opinion and order and ensure that our perspective is understood by the commission. So there's certainly more work to do, but I do want to acknowledge the team's dedication and commitment.  
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ted."

With Jeff having covered our operational and regulatory updates, I will cover our second quarter 2021 financial results. I'll also provide additional details around our customer and sales",802,"Thank you, Jeff, and thanks again to everyone for joining us today. With Jeff having covered our operational and regulatory updates, I will cover our second quarter 2021 financial results. I'll also provide additional details around our customer and sales growth and potential impacts from the administrative law judge's recommended opinion and order.  
Our performance in the second quarter remained strong, earning $1.91 per share compared to $1.71 per share in the second quarter of 2020. Higher pension and other post-retirement nonservice credits, higher sales and usage and weather, all contributed to the increase in earnings, partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expenses compared to the prior year period. We experienced 2.3% customer growth and 5.7% weather-normalized sales growth during the second quarter compared to the same period in 2020. Residential sales increased 1.3% and commercial and industrial sales increased 10.3% compared to the second quarter of 2020. The increase in C&I reflects the reopening and return to in-person work we are seeing this year compared to the second quarter last year and COVID business closures that occurred last year and primarily remote work environment. Given the strong rebound in C&I sales and continued residential strength, we're increasing our 2021 sales estimate to 1% to 2% growth from our previous estimate of 0.5% to 1.5% growth.  
The labor market in Arizona is also recovering from the COVID pandemic impacts. For 2021 through the end of May, employment in Metro Phoenix increased 1% compared to 0.2% increase in the entire U.S. To be clear, that's 1% in Metro Phoenix compared to a 0.2% increase in the entire U.S. In 2020, Arizona was the third fastest-growing state in the U.S. As a result of this continued strong population growth, Arizona reached the highest level of residential housing permits since 2006 last year. This year, through May, Maricopa County has already reached 21,000 housing permits, which puts housing permits on pace to exceed last year. We believe the relatively low mortgage rates, low cost of living, desirable place with more space and affordable housing will continue to be a driver and grow Metro Phoenix housing market and benefit the overall local economy. This continues to be one of our core strengths of our long-term growth thesis.  
Turning to our financial health. While the recommended opinion and order from the administrative law judge is not a final order from the commission, we want to be transparent about the potential estimated financial implications if the commission were to approve the recommended opinion and order as written. For perspective, the general rule of thumb is that every 50 basis point reduction in ROE equates to approximately $32 million in revenue requirement. Regarding the potential impact from the recommendation to deny Four Corners of the -- to deny recovery of Four Corners SCR investment and deferral, as of June 30, 2021, the SCR deferral balance was approximately $75 million, and the net book value of the asset was approximately $320 million net of accumulated deferred income taxes. Because this is only a recommendation from the ALJ and not a decision from the commission, we will not be making any changes to the deferral at this time. If the commission denies recovery of the deferral, it would likely result in a write-off of approximately $75 million, which is net of accumulated deferred income tax. If the commission also denies recovery of the investment itself, we will consider all regulatory and legal avenues to mitigate any potential write-offs.  
In summary, we estimate the ROO, if approved, could decrease annual net income up to about $90 million, which includes the nonfuel decrease as well as the effects of incremental costs we incur once rates become effective.  
We're already a top quartile performer for O&M and are employing additional robust cost management improvements throughout the enterprise. This magnitude of a revenue decrease would be significant and detrimental to all of our stakeholders, including customers.  
Regarding our financing plans, we expect to issue up to $500 million of long-term debt at APS during the remainder of 2020 to fund capital investments. We will hold an investor briefing at the rate case concludes, at which time we will provide financial guidance, including any forecasted Pinnacle West level funding needs.  
As we continue to navigate through the evolving pandemic and the resolution of our current rate case, we will continue to focus on our commitment to our shareholders customers, communities and our team. The fundamentals within our service territory of strong and diverse economic growth and increasing population and the general attractiveness of Arizona, our strong operational performance, our disciplined cost management all bode well for the future. We will continue to work hard to resolve these current challenges.  
This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call over to the operator for questions."

However, if the recommendation for disallowance of the actual plant of SCR was decided upon at the commission, we do have other options, both within the regulatory space and legal space. And as a result, we'd evaluate our options at that time and that would not necessarily trigger a write-off then, given the fact that you do have other paths to pursue even if a decision was made consistent with the ROO."

If you go back to the time that, that contract was entered into, there was a big debate about solar thermal versus solar photovoltaic, where is the future of it, the importance of the capacity value and the molten salt storage for us, and he had a very different natural gas price profile. 
And so it is, to look today and go back that far and say that this was imprudent, and it's a PPA, so it's a purchase power agreement. It's not an item that's in our rate base and it was done consistent with the commission direction at the time. So the commissioners at the time were very, very excited, very much pushing to have that project move forward. And so understand that Chairwoman Marquez-Peterson's viewpoint on that. We'll continue to share our perspective on it, but it's clear to me that, that was prudent when it was entered into at the time. It was consistent with the standards that we had at the time.

And so that's the important thing. 
And this is we're doing everything that we can to manage costs. We're looking at ways that we can, again, move out of variable fuel resources and start saving on the fuel bill. But we've got to do that in balance. And I think that's the message we have to continue to send to the commission is that you -- if all you focus on is the short-term rate impacts don't reflect on where we are with respect to the work that's already happened in lowering our rates over the last few years, ultimately, it's going to end up costing customers more.

And aside from the current case that we're in from a regulatory construct standpoint, our top priority is to continue to work with stakeholders and the commission to minimize regulatory lag. And that includes getting back to the time frame of the cases that we had before. 
We've actually got a pretty good track record of relatively short duration rate cases. This one is a bit of an anomaly, particularly given it fell within a year of COVID, that certainly had an impact. But aside from that, whether it be our clean investments or investments to continue to support the robust growth within the service territory, we recognize that, that lag has an impact, and we believe there's options to be able to continue to mitigate it. And that is a priority for us, both within this case and beyond. 
We look at the capital plan and aside from investing in clean, we have to fund the growth. We've got commercial industrial customers coming, that demand investment in infrastructure to be able to continue to drive this local economy. And so we need to make sure that we're aligned with our stakeholders and the regulator on the need to continue to fund that capital to be able to fuel Arizona's growth because if you look at the $1.5 billion in our guidance by far, the majority of that is just to keep up with Arizona's growth, and it's our job to do it."

And so you have to continue to operate it. So that's why -- and that's why I'm struggling in particular with this recommendation, is this has been clearly demonstrated over the last 2 summers as not just used and useful, but necessary from a capacity basis in the face of a bunch of challenges around capacity, whether it's California or Texas, has just brought that to a highlight. And so you're now putting us in a position to say, well, you got to run the plant, but we're not going to give you a recovery of either the investment in the plant that's required to continue to operate it or the ongoing operating expenses of it.

And I think it will be important for us to share with the regulators that the returns that we see from capital invested in those states is better than the returns we can get here in Arizona that puts you in a real predicament. So the ROEs are important to maintain the attractiveness to get capital invested in states and have continued to invested in needed reliability, but we do have some assets that are outside the traditional regulated platform.

These are indeed challenging times for us. But right up front, I want to make it clear that while we may be navigating some short-term challenges, as you'll see, the midterm prospects post 2022 are positive, and we remain confident in our ability to create renewed growth and deliver strong shareholder returns. 
I know the conclusion of the 2019 rate case is the most significant development and everyone is interested in hearing more about that. But before we cover the rate case, you can see from the 4 main topics we will discuss today. I'll cover our third quarter results and our expectations for the remainder of 2021. I will then turn it over to Jeff to discuss our rate case outcome, next steps and strategy coming out of this case. Finally, I will wrap up with 2022 guidance and our long-term financial outlook. 
Focusing on the third quarter, our performance remained strong, earning $3 per share compared to $3.07 per share in third quarter of 2020. Mild weather was a significant factor, largely offset by strong sales. We experienced a mild July and August, driven by one of the wettest monsoon seasons in recent history. Residential cooling degree days in the third quarter decreased 27.5% compared to the same time a year ago and were 10.6% lower than historical 10-year averages. As a reminder, third quarter last year was the hottest on record. Robust sales and usage growth in addition to increased transmission sales this quarter mitigated most of the weather impacts. 
Looking at full year, I'll provide an update to the 2021 key drivers and earnings guidance. Customer growth and weather-normalized sales growth remain important drivers for the remainder of the year. We are updating weather-normalized sales guidance to 3% to 4%, up from 1% to 2%, based on continued robust customer growth and strong residential usage. Lastly, with the conclusion of the 2019 rate case, we're now able to provide full year guidance. 
We expect earnings per share to be within the range of $5.25 to $5.35 per share. Before I continue with our long-term financial outlook, I'll turn it over to Jeff to provide an update on our rate case."

As all of you know, after a series of open meetings and public discussions, the commission issued a final decision in our 2019 rate case. This rate case was complex and the issues were numerous. I'll hi",1561,"Thanks, Ted, and thank you all for joining us today. As all of you know, after a series of open meetings and public discussions, the commission issued a final decision in our 2019 rate case. This rate case was complex and the issues were numerous. I'll highlight a few of the main issues that were decided, the revenue requirement, SCRs and the ROE. I'll also discuss our next step and strategy coming out of this case. 
And then lastly, as Ted mentioned, he'll provide the 2022 guidance and our long-term financial outlook. This outcome was not what we wanted in the process that transpired was not constructive. Everything we have said on the record with our regulators about what's so damaging and concerning about this decision holds true. It is a decision that makes everything we're committed to doing more challenging and more costly for a time. 
What this decision has not done is change our mission as a company nor our commitment to delivering value to our customers and you, our investors. It has not changed the commitment of our employees to operational excellence in all that we do. In fact, we're using the expertise and the track record that we've built in the areas of long-term planning, cost management, innovation, and serving as an active voice and advocate for the Arizona business community to emerge from this case with a robust strategy. 
We're not apologetic about standing up for what's right for our customers and our communities and for our investors, the owners of this company. It's your confidence in us and your investment in us that makes it possible to deliver the product and services that power Arizona's economy and way of life. 
We don't take that for granted, and we'll lay out for you today how we plan to continue to create values at competitive levels amidst the headwinds and the challenges that this case has created. As a reminder, this case was unique for many reasons. We are compelled by the commission to file this case under a question of whether we are over earning. We're also required to fully litigate this case instead of pursuing settlement opportunities. This is our first fully litigated rate case in over 15 years. We still believe that rate case settlements are the standard, and this case was definitely an exception. 
And finally, this case was centered around cost recovery of coal asset. In contrast, our future investment recovery will be premised on infrastructure supporting clean energy and our customer growth. Let me walk through some of the major decisions of the case. First, the commission adopted a total base rate decrease of $119 million, inclusive of fuel. The commission did reverse its initial vote to move the SCR issue to a separate proceeding and instead provided partial recovery of the SCRs with a disallowance of $216 million. We disagree with the commission's decision that the SCR investment was imprudent and don't believe that the record in this case, supports that conclusion. 
As I've stated before, the Four Corners Power Plant is a critically important reliability asset for the entire Southwest region. It's used and useful currently serving customers and the investment in the SCRs was required to keep the plant running under federal law. In addition, the commission voted to lower the ROE from the recommended opinion in orders already low ROE of 9.16% to 8.7%. With this, part of the decision the commission has adopted an ROE that's meaningfully below the national average of 9.4% for electric utilities and the company disagrees with the commission's rationale. 
We have embraced a culture focused on customer service and don't believe that a penalty was warranted, and the ROE granted ignores the fact that we're one of the fastest-growing states in the country, and we need to attract capital in order to fund the growth and economic development that we're experiencing in Arizona. In addition, the commission moved away from the long-standing practice of providing risk premium for serving as the operator of the largest clean nuclear-generating station in the country. We'll continue to navigate through these challenges by leveraging our strong growth and seeking judicial review of the decision through the courts. 
Although we're disappointed by the commission's decision, importantly, we now have clarity of the path forward. And so let me share our next steps and strategy as we look to the future. We continue to remain optimistic about our future for many reasons, and I'll discuss each of these reasons in more detail. First, we have a solid track record for performance and have grown earnings and our dividends steadily throughout this tough time, although we're looking at a reset with this rate case outcome. 
And despite the challenges of our regulatory environment, both for Arizona and our company, we believe that we have the ability to create long-term value and steady growth from here. And Ted will later share our financial outlook and the actions that we're taking as a management team to get us there. In addition to our earnings track record, we've delivered on our promise to provide affordable energy to our customers. And I'll share, I think, a great example. We've seen a 6% weather-normalized increase in demand for residential electricity from 2018 to 2020. But during that same period, we've lowered the average residential customer bill by more than 7%. 
We remain focused on customer affordability and keeping it central to our plans to provide long-term sustainable growth. That focus, coupled with continued cost management creates headroom for the future. The second reason that I'm optimistic about our future is our best-in-class service territory. Arizona remains among the fastest-growing states in the country. Where other states are experiencing little or negative customer growth, we're projecting 1.5% to 2.5% retail customer growth in 2021 and 3% to 4% weather-normalized sales growth. 
We expect 43,000 housing permits this year in Maricopa County alone, levels that have not been recent before the Great Recession. We believe the constructive business environment and the ample job growth that it creates a competitive cost of living and a desirable climate will continue to grow the Metro Phoenix housing market and benefit the local economy. 
Focusing on our service territory specifically, we continue to see development from a variety of sectors, which is helping to diversify our local economy more than ever. In particular, Phoenix is becoming a leader in attracting high-tech and data center customers. As you may remember, Taiwan Semiconductor broke ground on their $12 billion investment earlier this year, cementing Phoenix as one of the top semiconductor hubs in the country. 
More recently, Core Power announced their intention to build a 1 million square foot lithium-ion battery manufacturing facility. We'll continue to focus our economic development approach on helping to attract and expand businesses and job creators. The third reason that we're confident is the clear path for our transition to clean energy. We came out with our clean energy commitment in early 2020, and I'm proud that we've made significant progress towards that commitment. 
As you know, earlier this year, we announced that our Four Corners power plant would begin seasonal operations in 2023. This will reduce annual carbon emissions from the plant by an estimated 20% to 25% compared to current conditions, In addition, we remain committed to end the use of coal at our remaining Cholla units by 2025 and to completely exit coal by 2031. Since our clean energy commitments announcement, we've procured nearly 1,400 megawatts of additional clean energy and storage. Obviously, Arizona enjoys some of the best solar conditions in the world, and we are well positioned to capitalize on this resource as we continue that clean energy transition. 
Turning to our regulatory environment. Although this last case was not constructive, I believe we'll be able to reasonably navigate through the regulatory environment in the future. I'll underscore that this last case was unique in nearly every aspect. We plan on filing a new rate case as soon as practicable, and we'll be looking to improve the ROE commensurate with rising interest rates and peer returns. 
Historically, outcomes achieved through settlement have delivered new and innovative customer programs and other results that benefit a broad and diverse range of vested interest in our state's energy future. We would aim to achieve a settled outcome in our next case because we believe that the nature of that process itself yields more informed, constructive and mutually beneficial results. We'll work to find alignment with stakeholders and the regulators so that we can improve things for all interested parties. Finally, I'm optimistic about the future because we have a well-thought-out long-term strategy that my entire management team and I are committed to executing. We've refocused on the customer and have built a customer-centric strategy that will allow us to deliver exceptional customer service results. 
We were the most improved large utility in J.D. Power's 2020 residential electric service study, and we're focused on making continued improvements. Near term, our focus and priorities remain on improving our customer experience, customer communications, providing safe and reliable service and continuing to engage with stakeholders to advance our shared priorities of clean, reliable and affordable energy for Arizona residents and businesses. I'll now turn it over to Ted to provide guidance and to share our long-term financial outlook."
296957,1684906845,2427841,"Pinnacle West Capital Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2021",2021-11-05,"Earnings Calls","Pinnacle West Capital Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jeff. Now I'll walk through our 2022 guidance and long-term financial outlook. As Jeff discussed, this last case was not the outcome we were looking for, and we recognize this rate case is a regulatory reset. We're providing a 2022 earnings gui",1347,"Thank you, Jeff. Now I'll walk through our 2022 guidance and long-term financial outlook. As Jeff discussed, this last case was not the outcome we were looking for, and we recognize this rate case is a regulatory reset. We're providing a 2022 earnings guidance range of $3.80 to $4 per share given the full effects of the rate case. We recognize this is a significant reduction compared to 2021 so we've illustrated key factors contributing to the change in earnings. As you can see on Slide 19, we're starting with the midpoint of our 2021 guidance and walking through the drivers to get us to the midpoint of our 2022 guidance. 
No surprise, the most significant driver is the recent rate case decision with a negative $0.90 impact. This reflects an additional $13 million downward adjustment beyond the $90 million net income impact estimated for the recommended opinion and order last quarter. In addition, growth and depreciable plan, higher interest expense related to new financing needs and lower pension OPEB nonservice credits make up the remaining negative drivers. We are focused on cost management and expect O&M savings to provide some positive impact to get us to our 2022 guidance range of $3.80 to $4 per share. 
Turning to the future. We are prepared to use all levers we have available to help us mitigate the impact of this case, and we remain optimistic of our ability to provide long-term value. As you can see, investors can expect 7 objectives from us, and I'll touch on each one. Our plan is expected to provide strong long-term earnings growth off of 2022 for the next 5 years. I want to be transparent and reemphasize that this is projected 5% to 7% earnings growth builds on our 2022 guidance. We realize that 2021 base year is a lower growth rate at about 1% to 2%. However, we believe 2022 is the appropriate place to anchor our long-term outlook given the valuation reset that has already occurred, and we're focused on creating shareholder value from this point going forward. 
There are a number of factors that can provide upside potential to our growth guidance. For example, we have the ability to meet -- we have the ability to invest in more clean energy if we achieve more constructive cost recovery. In addition, robust economic development opportunities may drive increased sales and customer growth. Those, along with other factors, could provide upside to our guidance. 
The second objective shareholders can expect from us is an optimized capital management plan. As Jeff discussed, we continued to experience solid growth in our service territory, which is the primary driver behind our capital plan. Study population growth is expected to drive average annual customer growth in the range of 1.5% to 2.5% through 2024. In addition, we expect average annual sales growth to be in the range of 3.5% to 4.5% through 2024 on a weather-normalized basis. We have updated our capital plan to $4.7 billion from 2022 to 2024. While this represents a modest increase from prior levels, we believe this is prudent until we're in a better place to secure timely and constructive cost recovery. We are committed to taking a balanced approach to managing our capital plan to support customer growth, reliability and our clean transition, while limiting our equity needs to minimize dilution as we recover from the outcome of this case. 
Third, as you can see from 2019 to 2024, we project that our rate base growth will remain steady at an average annual growth rate of 5% to 6%. I want to highlight that our FERC jurisdictional transmission investments continue to represent a meaningful portion of that growth at almost 1/4 of the total rate case. These investments benefit from superior-authorized returns and a more favorable cost recovery construct in our ACC jurisdictional investments. We believe this steady growth will allow us the opportunity to provide solid earnings growth from transmission in the future. 
Next, I'd like to provide clarity on our financing plans going forward. We've previously stated that we would issue equity prior to the next rate case. We understand this case was not constructive, and we're committed to doing everything we can to protect shareholders from further dilution. Therefore, we're deferring our equity issuance and have no plans to issue equity until the conclusion of the next rate case. In the meantime, we'll leverage our sales growth and the strength of our balance sheet to support our investment needs. While we show equity or equity alternatives in the plan, we have no plans for this to be sourced earlier than 2024, protecting investors from dilution during this period. 
Moving to O&M. We have a solid track record of disciplined cost management and previously announced that we have initiated additional cost-savings programs. We understand the importance of efficiency and instituting lean initiatives. With that in mind, we're updating our O&M guidance to show, one, a reduction of O&M expense from 2021 to 2022; two, a goal of keeping total O&M flat during this period; and three, a goal of declining O&M per kilowatt-hour. 
Cost management and lean processes will continue to be a strong focus of our management team to mitigate both inflationary pressures and regulatory lag. We anticipate another important expectation that investors can look forward to as our attractive dividend yield. Yesterday, our Board of Directors announced an increase in our quarterly shareholder dividend from $0.83 to $0.85 per share. We have consistently grown our dividend for 10 years straight, and we are committed to dividend growth going forward. Our longer-term objective is to grow the dividend commensurate with earnings growth and target a long-term dividend payout ratio of 65% to 75%. 
We understand that we're not there now, but we are confident in our plan and that we will eventually grow back into this payout range. Turning to the final item, our balance sheet. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, providing us flexibility in our sources of capital over the next few years. We have an attractive long-term debt maturity profile and no debt maturing at APS until 2024. 
Additionally, we maintain robust and durable sources of liquidity with our $1.2 billion of credit facilities recently extended to 2026 and a well-funded and largely derisked pension. Taking a closer look at our ratings, we continue to have solid investment-grade credit ratings, even with the recent downgrade by Fitch and the credit reviews announced by Moody's and S&P, our balance sheet targets include 3 key components: maintaining credit rating strength, maintaining an APS equity layer greater than 50% and an FFO to debt range of 16% to 18%. In summary, we're taking action during this reset and have a plan for attractive growth going forward. Importantly, we plan to defer all equity until 2024, further reduce O&M and optimize the balance sheet and capital program during this reset period. 
In return, we have the highest dividend yield among peers, which stands today above 5%. While certainly a factor in the current valuation, even at a stock price 20% higher than current levels, we offer a dividend yield more competitive than peers. In addition, we announced long-term EPS growth guidance of 5% to 7% from 2022 for the next 5 years. With the attractive dividend yield and solid EPS CAGR, we anticipate a competitive 10% to 12% total shareholder return going forward. In the short term, we are laser-focused on doing everything we can to protect investors during this reset period and then transitioning to a renewed era of growth so that we can provide a competitive return going forward. 
We remain optimistic about the future. Although the final outcome of this rate case was worse than we had expected, we have a path forward that is centered around our long-term track record of constructive rate case outcomes, our robust service territory growth, continued balance sheet strength and a focused management team that is taking action. This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

And then the pension item also something, I don't know if it was just me or if that was already known. 
But could you walk through a couple of those items in as much detail as possible. And finally, you talked about that sales growth that's very robust, but didn't seem like that was explicitly laid out in this walk so, what's being assumed here?"

First, depreciation is certainly a drag, particularly given that the test year for this case has been over 2 years ago. So we've continued robust investments since then, and that certainly has an impact going forward. So we haven't detailed out anything beyond the fact that ongoing depreciation until we file our next case, certainly is an impact. 
And given the outcome of this case, that definitely shows next year. With respect to the pension, we benefited from favorable market returns this year. We still expect there to be a benefit next year. But because our pension is in such strong status, we continue to rebalance and derisk the pension. That certainly gives us a view that we'll have likely less market returns next year in terms of favorable nonservice credits. So that's really just a factor of continuing with our liability-driven investment strategy and derisking the pension going forward. 
And then finally, on sales growth, we can't say enough about the economic development that we see in our service territory. We try to look beyond the COVID impact. So for example, if you look at growth in 2021 compared to 2019, really just avoid the comparison to 2020 given the COVID anomalies, we're at over 6% with the normalized sales growth right now. 
And that is all true customer growth and usage increases absent any COVID impacts. And that's before some of our large industrial customers that are under construction now come online, TSMC being one of them. So we look at the record housing permits levels, the amount of development that's going on right now and I really believe strongly that the growth going forward is solid and based on economic development, and that's why we're comfortable with the range from '22 to '24 being in the 3.5% to 4.5% standpoint. 
This year, we're at the range of 3% to 4%. And last quarter, we already exceeded that range. So we believe those are good numbers going forward."

Thanks for the question, Soo. I mean I think that's one of the more important things. We ended up having some of the discussion about the long-term negative impacts that happen, credit rating downgrade issues, things like that, that was happening at the open meeting instead of ahead of time. And so I think one of the important things, just as we are working very hard to be as transparent as we can be with you is to then be as transparent as we can be with all the different parties that would likely participate in that next case. I think that we do have areas of significant alignment when you look at the move towards more clean energy deployment and how we do that and just connecting the dots to say that If you're going to actually meet the growth that we're seeing in the State and at the same time, begin this transition and what are the benefits? 
I think one of the key things -- and if you go back to Lea Marquez-Peterson's letter asking on how we could move to a $0.09 rate, while I don't think that's realistic given the fuel mix that we have here in Arizona. It's a great topic of conversation around how we do things like fuel for steel. So if we can reduce our fuel burn and the $1 billion that we spend on fuel and replace that with batteries and storage, you can really manage rate pressure, but that's going to have to be an investment that we need to have the ability to invest in. 
And so to me, it's really connecting all those dots and working with the stakeholders ahead of time and making sure that as much of that conversation as possible takes place before we file. And I think Ted mentioned, it takes about 4 months to get ready for a filing. We intend to file pretty quickly. But the idea is we've got to have that conversation so that people can put in context what a decision like this actually means. And meeting Arizona's growth and managing a transition to clean energy. So it's going to be a lot of dialogue. 
It's not just with the commission. It's with the stakeholders that will be involved, but I'm anxious to start on that."

And so what we have to do is we have to go to the commission first. You have to ask for rehearing. That's a -- we have 20 days fast for rehearing. The commission has 20 days to act on that if they don't act on it within 20 days, then it's deemed denied and that opens up then your access to the courts. And so I won't go into the more detailed strategy, but we were very clear in the hearing that the prudent standard that was used just does not match the record in the case. 
And so we were very clear that -- I think we gave them 1 option to say if we could do a debt return that we would be able to move forward with that. But the partial recovery that they gave, which means there was a disallowance of the [ $260 ] million doesn't leave us a choice but to go to court on that issue. So that's the near-term process. What happens down the road with securitization, I mean those are all things later. 
With respect to getting in and settling, I think one of the things that this case did show is the challenge of not having a settlement where you do have a more limited scope of issues to look at. This was pretty wide open in terms of everything that was involved for both the hearing division, the parties and then ultimately, the commissioners. And so I think we would continue to advocate for settlement as being a better outcome because you are able to do a lot of those trade-offs with the parties who are most affected, rather than having it go to a commission or a judge where it often can be a binary outcome, somebody they're going to lose it all or they're going to win it all. 
And in a lot of cases, that compromise is much better. So I still think that that's the best path moving forward, that's what we would be working towards. And again, we're going to have this period of time when we finally get out of [ X ] part A to hopefully be able to have some conversation with the policymakers on how to make this more constructive."

It makes it really hard to think about how you're going to navigate this clean energy transition. And so I think we were trying to be as transparent and as clear as we could be with the commission when we were in the open meeting about what we would have to do, given this outcome. 
And so that's unfortunate. I mean, I would much rather not be in that position. But as we move through that, I don't think anybody is going to be surprised by it.

We're now moving forward in a pretty aggressive way with those systems, but their established technology. 
They're known. There's more of them being installed. We're not the first movers on it.

These are indeed challenging times for us. But right up front, I want to make it clear that while we may be navigating some short-term challenges, as you'll see, the midterm prospects post for 2022 are positive, and we remain confident in our ability to create renewed growth and deliver strong shareholder returns.
I know the conclusion of the 2019 rate case is the most significant development and everyone is interested in hearing more about that. But before we cover the rate case, you can see from the 4 main topics we will discuss today. I'll cover our third quarter results and our expectations for the remainder of 2021. I will then turn it over to Jeff to discuss our rate case outcome, next steps and strategy coming out of this case. Finally, I will wrap up with 2022 guidance and our long-term financial outlook.
Focusing on the third quarter, our performance remained strong, earning $3 per share compared to $3.07 per share in third quarter of 2020. Mild weather was a significant factor, largely offset by strong sales. We experienced a mild July and August, driven by one of the wettest monsoon seasons in recent history. Residential cooling degree days in the third quarter decreased 27.5% compared to the same time a year ago and were 10.6% lower than historical 10-year averages. As a reminder, third quarter last year was the hottest on record. Robust sales and usage growth in addition to increased transmission sales this quarter mitigated most of the weather impacts.
Looking at full year, I'll provide an update to the 2021 key drivers and earnings guidance. Customer growth and weather-normalized sales growth remain important drivers for the remainder of the year. We are updating weather-normalized sales guidance to 3% to 4%, up from 1% to 2%, based on continued robust customer growth and strong residential usage.
Lastly, with the conclusion of the 2019 rate case, we're now able to provide full year guidance. We expect earnings per share to be within the range of $5.25 to $5.35 per share. Before I continue with our long-term financial outlook, I'll turn it over to Jeff to provide an update on our rate case."

As all of you know, after a series of open meetings and public discussions, the commission issued a final decision in our 2019 rate case. This rate case was complex, and the issues were numerous. I'll highlight a few of the main issues that were decided, the revenue requirement, SCRs and the ROE. I'll also discuss our next step and strategy coming out of this case. And then lastly, as Ted mentioned, he'll provide the 2022 guidance and our long-term financial outlook.
This outcome was not what we wanted in the process that transpired was not constructive. Everything we have said on the record with our regulators about what's so damaging and concerning about this decision holds true. It is a decision that makes everything we're committed to doing more challenging and more costly for a time.
What this decision has not done it is change our mission as a company nor our commitment to delivering value to our customers and you, our investors. It has not changed the commitment of our employees to operational excellence in all that we do. In fact, we're using the expertise and the track record that we've built in the areas of long-term planning, cost management, innovation, and serving as an active voice and advocate for the Arizona business community to emerge from this case with a robust strategy.
We're not apologetic about standing up for what's right for our customers and our communities and for our investors, the owners of this company. It's your confidence in us and your investment in us that makes it possible to deliver the product and services that power Arizona's economy and way of life. We don't take that for granted, and we'll lay out for you today how we plan to continue to create values at competitive levels amidst the headwinds and the challenges that this case has created.
As a reminder, this case was unique for many reasons. We are compelled by the commission to file this case under a question of whether we are over earning. We're also required to fully litigate this case instead of pursuing settlement opportunities. This is our first fully litigated rate case in over 15 years. We still believe that rate case settlements are the standard, and this case was definitely an exception.
And finally, this case was centered around cost recovery of coal asset. In contrast, our future investment recovery will be premised on infrastructure supporting clean energy and our customer growth.
Let me walk through some of the major decisions of the case. First, the commission adopted a total base rate decrease of $119 million, inclusive of fuel. The commission did reverse its initial vote to move the SCR issue to a separate proceeding and instead provided partial recovery of the SCRs with a disallowance of $216 million. We disagree with the commission's decision that the SCR investment was imprudent and don't believe that the record in this case, supports that conclusion.
As I've stated before, the Four Corners Power Plant is a critically important reliability asset for the entire Southwest region. It's used and useful currently serving customers and the investment in the SCRs was required to keep the plant running under federal law.
In addition, the commission voted to lower the ROE from the recommended opinion in orders already low ROE of 9.16% to 8.7%. With this, part of the decision the commission has adopted an ROE that's meaningfully below the national average of 9.4% for electric utilities and the company disagrees with the commission's rationale.
We have embraced a culture focused on customer service and don't believe that a penalty was warranted, and the ROE granted ignores the fact that we're one of the fastest-growing states in the country, and we need to attract capital in order to fund the growth and economic development that we're experiencing in Arizona.
In addition, the commission moved away from the long-standing practice of providing a risk premium for serving as the operator of the largest clean nuclear-generating station in the country. We'll continue to navigate through these challenges by leveraging our strong growth and seeking judicial review of the decision through the courts.
Although we're disappointed by the commission's decision, importantly, we now have clarity of the path forward. And so let me share our next steps and strategy as we look to the future. We continue to remain optimistic about our future for many reasons, and I'll discuss each of these reasons in more detail.
First, we have a solid track record for performance and have grown earnings and our dividends steadily throughout this tough time, although, we're looking at a reset with this rate case outcome. And despite the challenges of our regulatory environment, both for Arizona and our company, we believe that we have the ability to create long-term value and steady growth from here. And Ted will later share our financial outlook and the actions that we're taking as a management team to get us there.
In addition to our earnings track record, we've delivered on our promise to provide affordable energy to our customers. And I'll share, I think, a great example. We've seen a 6% weather-normalized increase in demand for residential electricity from 2018 to 2020. But during that same period, we've lowered the average residential customer bill by more than 7%.
We remain focused on customer affordability and keeping it central to our plans to provide long-term sustainable growth. That focus, coupled with continued cost management creates headroom for the future. The second reason that I'm optimistic about our future is our best-in-class service territory. Arizona remains among the fastest-growing states in the country. Where other states are experiencing little or negative customer growth, we're projecting 1.5% to 2.5% retail customer growth in 2021 and 3% to 4% weather-normalized sales growth.
We expect 43,000 housing permits this year in Maricopa County alone, levels that have not been recent before the Great Recession. We believe the constructive business environment and the ample job growth that it creates a competitive cost of living and a desirable climate will continue to grow the Metro Phoenix housing market and benefit the local economy.
Focusing on our service territory specifically, we continue to see development from a variety of sectors, which is helping to diversify our local economy more than ever. In particular, Phoenix is becoming a leader in attracting high-tech and data center customers. As you may remember, Taiwan Semiconductor broke ground on their $12 billion investment earlier this year, cementing Phoenix as one of the top semiconductor hubs in the country.
More recently, KORE Power announced their intention to build a 1 million square foot lithium-ion battery manufacturing facility. We'll continue to focus our economic development approach on helping to attract and expand businesses and job creators. The third reason that we're confident is the clear path for our transition to clean energy. We came out with our clean energy commitment in early 2020, and I'm proud that we've made significant progress towards that commitment.
As you know, earlier this year, we announced that our Four Corners Power Plant would begin seasonal operations in 2023. This will reduce annual carbon emissions from the plant by an estimated 20% to 25% compared to current conditions. In addition, we remain committed to end the use of coal at our remaining Cholla units by 2025 and to completely exit coal by 2031. Since our clean energy commitments announcement, we've procured nearly 1,400 megawatts of additional clean energy and storage. Obviously, Arizona enjoys some of the best solar conditions in the world, and we are well positioned to capitalize on this resource as we continue that clean energy transition.
Turning to our regulatory environment. Although this last case was not constructive, I believe we'll be able to reasonably navigate through the regulatory environment in the future. I'll underscore that this last case was unique in nearly every aspect. We plan on filing a new rate case as soon as practicable, and we'll be looking to improve the ROE commensurate with rising interest rates and peer returns.
Historically, outcomes achieved through settlement have delivered new and innovative customer programs and other results that benefit a broad and diverse range of vested interest in our state's energy future. We would aim to achieve a settled outcome in our next case because we believe that the nature of that process itself yields more informed, constructive and mutually beneficial results. We'll work to find alignment with stakeholders and the regulators so that we can improve things for all interested parties.
Finally, I'm optimistic about the future because we have a well-thought-out long-term strategy that my entire management team and I are committed to executing. We've refocused on the customer and have built a customer-centric strategy that will allow us to deliver exceptional customer service results.
We were the most improved large utility in J.D. Power's 2020 residential electric service study, and we're focused on making continued improvements. Near term, our focus and priorities remain on improving our customer experience, customer communications, providing safe and reliable service and continuing to engage with stakeholders to advance our shared priorities of clean, reliable and affordable energy for Arizona residents and businesses.
I'll now turn it over to Ted to provide guidance and to share our long-term financial outlook."
296957,1684906845,2427933,"Pinnacle West Capital Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 05, 2021",2021-11-05,"Earnings Calls","Pinnacle West Capital Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Jeff. Now I'll walk through our 2022 guidance and long-term financial outlook. As Jeff discussed, this last case was not the outcome we were looking for, and we recognize this rate case is a regulatory reset. We're providing a 2022 earnings gui",1348,"Thank you, Jeff. Now I'll walk through our 2022 guidance and long-term financial outlook. As Jeff discussed, this last case was not the outcome we were looking for, and we recognize this rate case is a regulatory reset. We're providing a 2022 earnings guidance range of $3.80 to $4 per share given the full effects of the rate case. We recognize this is a significant reduction compared to 2021. So we've illustrated key factors contributing to the change in earnings.
As you can see on Slide 19, we're starting with the midpoint of our 2021 guidance and walking through the drivers to get us to the midpoint of our 2022 guidance. No surprise, the most significant driver is the recent rate case decision with a negative $0.90 impact. This reflects an additional $13 million downward adjustment beyond the $90 million net income impact estimated for the Recommended Opinion and Order last quarter.
In addition, growth and depreciable plan, higher interest expense related to new financing needs and lower pension OPEB nonservice credits make up the remaining negative drivers. We are focused on cost management and expect O&M savings to provide some positive impact to get us to our 2022 guidance range of $3.80 to $4 per share.
Turning to the future. We are prepared to use all levers we have available to help us mitigate the impact of this case, and we remain optimistic of our ability to provide long-term value. As you can see, investors can expect 7 objectives from us, and I'll touch on each one.
Our plan is expected to provide strong long-term earnings growth off of 2022 for the next 5 years. I want to be transparent and reemphasize that this is projected 5% to 7% earnings growth builds on our 2022 guidance. We realize that 2021 base year is a lower growth rate at about 1% to 2%. However, we believe 2022 is the appropriate place to anchor our long-term outlook given the valuation reset that has already occurred, and we're focused on creating shareholder value from this point going forward.
There are a number of factors that can provide upside potential to our growth guidance. For example, we have the ability to meet -- we have the ability to invest in more clean energy if we achieve more constructive cost recovery. In addition, robust economic development opportunities may drive increased sales and customer growth. Those, along with other factors, could provide upside to our guidance.
The second objective shareholders can expect from us is an optimized capital management plan. As Jeff discussed, we continued to experience solid growth in our service territory, which is the primary driver behind our capital plan. Steady population growth is expected to drive average annual customer growth in the range of 1.5% to 2.5% through 2024.
In addition, we expect average annual sales growth to be in the range of 3.5% to 4.5% through 2024 on a weather-normalized basis. We have updated our capital plan to $4.7 billion from 2022 to 2024. While this represents a modest increase from prior levels, we believe this is prudent until we're in a better place to secure timely and constructive cost recovery.
We are committed to taking a balanced approach to managing our capital plan to support customer growth, reliability and our clean transition, while limiting our equity needs to minimize dilution as we recover from the outcome of this case.
Third, as you can see from 2019 to 2024, we project that our rate base growth will remain steady at an average annual growth rate of 5% to 6%. I want to highlight that our FERC jurisdictional transmission investments continue to represent a meaningful portion of that growth at almost 1/4 of the total rate. These investments benefit from superior authorized returns and a more favorable cost recovery construct in our ACC jurisdictional investments. We believe this steady growth will allow us the opportunity to provide solid earnings growth from transmission in the future.
Next, I'd like to provide clarity on our financing plans going forward. We've previously stated that we would issue equity prior to the next rate case. We understand this case was not constructive, and we're committed to doing everything we can to protect shareholders from further dilution. Therefore, we're deferring our equity issuance and have no plans to issue equity until the conclusion of the next rate case. In the meantime, we'll leverage our sales growth and the strength of our balance sheet to support our investment needs. While we show equity or equity alternatives in the plan, we have no plans for this to be sourced earlier than 2024, protecting investors from dilution during this period.
Moving to O&M. We have a solid track record of disciplined cost management and previously announced that we have initiated additional cost-savings programs. We understand the importance of efficiency and instituting lean initiatives. With that in mind, we're updating our O&M guidance to show; one, a reduction of O&M expense from 2021 to 2022; two, a goal of keeping total O&M flat during this period; and three, a goal of declining O&M per kilowatt hour.
Cost management and lean processes will continue to be a strong focus of our management team to mitigate both inflationary pressures and regulatory lag. We anticipate another important expectation that investors can look forward to as our attractive dividend yield. Yesterday, our Board of Directors announced an increase in our quarterly shareholder dividend from $0.83 to $0.85 per share. We have consistently grown our dividend for 10 years straight, and we are committed to dividend growth going forward. Our longer-term objective is to grow the dividend commensurate with earnings growth and target a long-term dividend payout ratio of 65% to 75%. We understand that we're not there now, but we are confident in our plan and that we will eventually grow back into this payout range.
Turning to the final item, our balance sheet. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, providing us flexibility in our sources of capital over the next few years. We have an attractive long-term debt maturity profile and no debt maturing at APS until 2024. Additionally, we maintain robust and durable sources of liquidity with our $1.2 billion of credit facilities recently extended to 2026 and a well-funded and largely derisked pension.
Taking a closer look at our ratings, we continue to have solid investment-grade credit ratings, even with the recent downgrade by Fitch and the credit reviews announced by Moody's and S&P. Our balance sheet targets include 3 key components: maintaining credit rating strength; maintaining an APS equity layer greater than 50%; and an FFO to debt range of 16% to 18%.
In summary, we're taking action during this reset and have a plan for attractive growth going forward. Importantly, we plan to defer all equity until 2024, further reduce O&M and optimize the balance sheet and capital program during this reset period.
In return, we have the highest dividend yield among peers, which stands today above 5%. While certainly a factor in the current valuation, even at a stock price 20% higher than current levels, we offer a dividend yield more competitive than peers.
In addition, we announced long-term EPS growth guidance of 5% to 7% from 2022 for the next 5 years. With the attractive dividend yield and solid EPS CAGR, we anticipate a competitive 10% to 12% total shareholder return going forward. In the short term, we are laser-focused on doing everything we can to protect investors during this reset period and then transitioning to a renewed era of growth so that we can provide a competitive return going forward.
We remain optimistic about the future. Although the final outcome of this rate case was worse than we had expected, we have a path forward that is centered around our long-term track record of constructive rate case outcomes, our robust service territory growth, continued balance sheet strength and a focused management team that is taking action.
This concludes our prepared remarks. I'll now turn the call back over to the operator for questions."

It seemed like the depreciable plant, maybe the D&A component of it is seem a little bit higher than what I was expecting. And then the pension item also something, I don't know if it was just me or if that was already known.
But could you walk through a couple of those items in as much detail as possible. And finally, you talked about that sales growth that's very robust, but didn't seem like that was explicitly laid out in this walk, so what's being assumed here?"

First, depreciation is certainly a drag, particularly given that the test year for this case has been over 2 years ago. So we've continued robust investments since then, and that certainly has an impact going forward. So we haven't detailed out anything beyond the fact that ongoing depreciation until we file our next case, certainly is an impact. And given the outcome of this case, that definitely shows next year.
With respect to the pension, we benefited from favorable market returns this year. We still expect there to be a benefit next year. But because our pension is in such strong status, we continue to rebalance and derisk the pension. That certainly gives us a view that we'll have likely less market returns next year in terms of favorable nonservice credits. So that's really just a factor of continuing with our liability-driven investment strategy and derisking the pension going forward.
And then finally, on sales growth, we can't say enough about the economic development that we see in our service territory. We try to look beyond the COVID impact. So for example, if you look at growth in 2021 compared to 2019, really just avoid the comparison to 2020 given the COVID anomalies, we're at over 6% with the normalized sales growth right now. And that is all true customer growth and usage increases absent any COVID impacts.
And that's before some of our large industrial customers that are under construction now come online, TSMC being one of them. So we look at the record housing permits levels, the amount of development that's going on right now and I really believe strongly that the growth going forward is solid and based on economic development, and that's why we're comfortable with the range from '22 to '24 being in the 3.5% to 4.5% standpoint.
This year, we're at the range of 3% to 4%. And last quarter, we already exceeded that range. So we believe those are good numbers going forward."

Thanks for the question, Insoo. I mean I think that's one of the more important things. We ended up having some of the discussion about the long-term negative impacts that happen, credit rating downgrade issues, things like that, that was happening at the open meeting instead of ahead of time.
And so I think one of the important things, just as we are working very hard to be as transparent as we can be with you is to then be as transparent as we can be with all the different parties that would likely participate in that next case.
I think that we do have areas of significant alignment when you look at the move towards more clean energy deployment and how we do that and just connecting the dots to say that if you're going to actually meet the growth that we're seeing in the state and at the same time, begin this transition and what are the benefits?
I think one of the key things -- and if you go back to Chairwoman Marquez-Peterson's letter asking on how we could move to a $0.09 rate, while I don't think that's realistic given the fuel mix that we have here in Arizona. It's a great topic of conversation around how we do things like fuel for steel. So if we can reduce our fuel burn and the $1 billion that we spend on fuel and replace that with batteries and storage, you can really manage rate pressure, but that's going to have to be an investment that we need to have the ability to invest in. 
And so to me, it's really connecting all those dots and working with the stakeholders ahead of time and making sure that as much of that conversation as possible takes place before we file. And I think Ted mentioned, it takes about 4 months to get ready for a filing. We intend to file pretty quickly. But the idea is we've got to have that conversation so that people can put in context what a decision like this actually means. And meeting Arizona's growth and managing a transition to clean energy. So it's going to be a lot of dialogue. It's not just with the commission. It's with the stakeholders that will be involved, but I'm anxious to start on that."

I know that Chair made some comments in recent weeks as well. Is there an ability to settle right now as best you perceive it?

And so what we have to do is we have to go to the commission first. You have to ask for rehearing. That's a -- we have 20 days ask for rehearing. The commission has 20 days to act on that if they don't act on it within 20 days, then it's deemed denied and that opens up then your access to the courts. And so I won't go into the more detailed strategy, but we were very clear in the hearing that the prudent standard that was used just does not match the record in the case.
And so we were very clear that -- I think we gave them one option to say if we could do a debt return that we would be able to move forward with that. But the partial recovery that they gave, which means there was a disallowance of the $216 million doesn't leave us a choice but to go to court on that issue. So that's the near-term process. What happens down the road with securitization, I mean those are all things later?
With respect to getting in and settling, I think one of the things that this case did show is the challenge of not having a settlement where you do have a more limited scope of issues to look at. This was pretty wide open in terms of everything that was involved for both the hearing division, the parties and then ultimately, the commissioners. And so I think we would continue to advocate for settlement as being a better outcome because you are able to do a lot of those trade-offs with the parties who are most affected, rather than having it go to a commission or a judge where it often can be a binary outcome, somebody they're going to lose it all or they're going to win it all. And in a lot of cases, that compromise is much better.
So I still think that that's the best path moving forward, that's what we would be working towards. And again, we're going to have this period of time when we finally get out of ex party to hopefully be able to have some conversation with the policymakers on how to make this more constructive."

But when you start thinking about the amount of investments that we need to put in, and if every time we do that, there's a look backwards to say, well, maybe there's a different technology that would have been better or cheaper.
It makes it really hard to think about how you're going to navigate this clean energy transition. And so I think we were trying to be as transparent and as clear as we could be with the commission when we were in the open meeting about what we would have to do, given this outcome. And so that's unfortunate. I mean, I would much rather not be in that position.
But as we move through that, I don't think anybody is going to be surprised by it. And the point is to say, let's figure out how we can align on what we can align on.

So certainly, we'll be looking for the filing that will be coming forward sooner rather than later and the outcome of that next case to project over the long term. And that's why that ranges over the next 5 years."

And there is a lot of new technology that's coming in.
So I do think probably everybody in the industry is trying to figure out how do you derisk new technology projects. So you don't run out -- look at, for example, our battery storage work. We put a pause after we had the McMicken event. So that we could deeply, deeply understand safety around lithium-ion utility-scale batteries. We're now moving forward in a pretty aggressive way with those systems, but their established technology.
They're known. There's more of them being installed. We're not the first movers on it. And so I think that you'll see a lot of work on trying to make sure that we're managing that risk because I think it's a good point. But one of the important things for us was to get clarity on -- you don't use hindsight to go back and look at what was an appropriate decision when circumstances have changed."
