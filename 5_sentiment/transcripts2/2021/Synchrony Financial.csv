It was a true test to our resilience, our agility and our strength as a business. We're proud of the way Synchrony managed through these challenges. Though there have been significant developments that provide hope that the pandemic will begin to moderate, the virus resurgence and resulting regional shutdown and continued impact on unemployment is something we are still managing through and build pandemic continues to impact results. We are encouraged by some of those trends that have developed. Later in the call, Brian Wenzel will detail these impacts on the quarter's results and provide a view on how we think this year might develop. 
I will provide a high-level overview here. Let's first focus on our quarterly results, including some of our recent successes, which are outlined on Slides 3 and 4. The earnings were $738 million or $1.24 per diluted share, an increase of $0.09 over last year. Loan receivables were down 6% to $81.9 billion, and average active accounts decreased 10% from last year, with new accounts down 19%. Purchase volume per account increased 10% over last year to $602. An average active balance per account increased 4% to just under $1,200. Net interest margin was down 37 basis points to 14.64% and the efficiency ratio was 37.1% for the quarter. Net charge-offs hit a new low at 3.16%. As a result of our liquidity and funding strategy, in response to COVID-19 impact on our balance sheet, deposits were down $2.3 billion or 4% versus last year. 
This includes a strategic decision to slow overall deposit growth, given the excess liquidity we have. Total deposits comprise 80% of our funding and our direct deposit platform remains an important funding source. Our ability to service and provide digital tools to customers, makes our bank attractive to depositors, and we will continue to build out additional capabilities. During the quarter, we returned $128 million in the quarter through a common stock dividend. We also announced that the Board authorized $1.6 billion in share repurchases for 2021, beginning in the first quarter. 
We have a solid pipeline across our platforms, a mix of start-up and existing programs. But we are being very disciplined around risk and returns, given the uncertainty in the current environment. And while this retail landscape is shifting, we believe similar opportunities will continue, as evidenced by recent wins. I will touch upon a few highlights. We announced that we will become the issuer of Walgreens co-branded Credit Card program in the U.S., the first such credit program in the retail health sector. The card will allow customers to earn rewards for purchases anywhere Mastercard is accepted. We expect to launch the new program in the second half of 2021. This new agreement built upon the company's existing strategic partnership. CareCredit is already accepted at more than 9,000 Walgreens and Duane Reade stores. 
We are committed to providing Walgreen customers and patients with unparalleled experiences, a best-in-class loyalty program and the ability to manage their health and wellness spending. In addition, we renewed our strategic partnership with Mattress Firm. We provide flexible financing solutions and innovative business tools that empowered mattress firm to meet their customers at critical moments in the purchasing journey, which is increasingly online. Our digital tools and industry-leading credit program team, including marketing, and analytic retail experts have optimized every step of the omnichannel customer journey to deliver a competitive user experience. We look forward to many more years as a strategic partner of Mattress Firm. We also reached a definitive agreement to acquire Alegro Credit, a leading provider of point-of-sale consumer financing for audiology products and dental services. Allegro offers numerous customers loan options through its merchant partners with flexible payment terms at the point of sale. These products are designed to offer customers choice to purchase the products and services they need [indiscernible]. 
The addition of Allegro credits merchant network and customers complements our strategy of growing CareCredit, our leading health and wellness financing platform. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021. Altogether this quarter, we signed 9 renewals and won 7 new deals, along with the acquisition. I cannot overstate the importance of digital innovation to the success of our programs. Consumers are rapidly adopting technologies that enable contactless commerce and expect engagement along their digital purchase journeys. We are leveraging our digital assets and continuously investing to ensure our partners are well positioned in this rapidly evolving dynamic. These investments include the capabilities to empower SaaS and seamless integration with our partners' digital assets, enable customer choice at the point of sale, enhance contactless experiences, facilitate a seamless and easy application process, bringing the in-store experience to a customer's digital devices for applications and payment and integrate our financing office throughout the entire digital shopping experience. 
We also continue to expand our digital penetration of all aspects of our customer journey, apply, buy and service. Approximately, 60% of our applications were done digitally during the fourth quarter and grew 18% in mobile channel applications. In retail card, 51% of our sales occurred online. Finally, approximately 65% of our payments were made digitally. In short, we are rising to the challenges presented by this difficult time. We have strengthened the strategic positioning of our business and expanded the opportunity set that lies before us. And we're investing in the right strategy that will enable near-term successes while also driving considerable shareholder value over the long term. With our future in mind, as you know, a few weeks ago, we announced some important changes to the leadership of this company. Effective April 1, I will transition to the role of Executive Chair of our Board of Directors, and Brian Doubles will become Synchrony's President and CEO. 
Synchrony means so much to me, and 1 of my goals as CEO was to set up a thoughtful leadership transition with a successor who will advance what we have built. Both the Board and I believe there is no 1 in the world that are equipped to do that than Brian. Brian has helped to build Synchrony every step of the way. He has been my trusted partner for more than a decade, including through our IPO. When we started Synchrony back in 2014, we set out to build a great business with a great culture that delivers for our partners and customers every day. Together with our 16,500 employees, we are doing just that. 
With Synchrony in a position of strength, now it's the time to implement this transition, allowing Brian to continue the incredible progress that has been made and to drive the next stage of Synchrony's exciting growth journey. I look forward to working with Brian through this transition and continuing to support Synchrony's growth and future success as Executive Chair. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."

We truly would not be where we are or who we are today without her leadership, and it's an absolute honor to succeed her and lead Synchrony into the future. I am also grateful that we will continue to benefit from Margaret's expertise and leadership in her role as Executive Chair, and I am excited to partner with her and the Board, our leadership team, and especially our employees as we continue to capitalize on our momentum. There is a lot to be excited about as we continue Synchrony's journey. We have a strong business, a winning culture, and a tremendous opportunity to build on this strong foundation. As incoming CEO, I will continue to implement the strategy that we've developed over the last few years, and which has enabled the momentum that our business has today. 
We will continue to leverage our competitive strength, deepen our market leadership and invest in digital, data analytics and new product offerings to create a seamless customer experience. We will continue to grow our business and drive value for all of our stakeholders, our investors, our employees, our partners and our customers. On that note, I'd like to shift gears and turn to Slide 5 to talk about just 1 example of the strategy that we implemented to enhance the utility and value of our offerings, and which has become an important part of our business today. 
Equal payment financing. Fundamental to our business is our objective to provide a full suite of products that can be tailored to serve the evolving needs of our customers and partners, while earning appropriate economic returns. Our partners' most critical needs are centered on their ability to offer a product that can seamlessly integrate with our digital access and systems, deliver higher average order volumes and sales, increased conversion rates, and deepen customer loyalty. By the same token, customers have their own unique set needs, including financing solutions that fit within their budget, are transparent and easy and convenient to use, and which offer them flexibility in their purchase and financing decisions. 
We have extensive experience in installment lending, which has informed our approach to equal payment finance. We think about these products in 2 categories: first, revolving products. We offer mid and long-term equal payment plans with promotional periods anywhere from 12 to 162 months, depending on the product category. We also offer short-term equal payment plans with promotional periods of 3 to 12 months. Second, Closed End products. We offer collateralized installment products for bigger ticket purchases with promotional periods from 12 to 180 months. And we also offer short and long-term installment loans to asset pay product. These products went anywhere from 3 to 36 months. All of these products are priced appropriately to meet our partner and customer objectives with APR starting at 0% and each of these products, in turn, offer distinct benefits and address the unique objectives of our partners and customers. Revolving [indiscernible] products, for example, can be embedded inside of an existing revolving account, eliminating the need for a customer to open a new account. And given the nature of their functionality, they also provide for repeat purchases as well as higher engagement and loyalty to the partners plan. Meanwhile, Closed End Products tend to appeal to customers that prefer regular predictable payments. To put our overall equal payment financing strategy and perspective, we currently have $15 billion in equal payment balances, 56% of which have 0% APR financing. We have about 74,000 partners or locations offering our payment plan products. And we have an overall repeat purchase rate of approximately 30% within 24 months of the first purchase. 
Synchrony's success in this and our other core strategies has been driven by our commitment to data-driven innovation, a deep understanding of our partners' objectives and customer needs and our ability to adapt is the competitive landscape and market conditions have evolved over time. Our organization is built around being nimble, responsive and results oriented. We leverage our decades of underwriting experience, our proprietary data analytics and our industry expertise in order to design and implement customized solutions that address our partners' needs while also delivering appropriate economic outcomes. This is what has driven Symphony's long-standing track record and deepened our market leadership over the years. We are excited to drive this momentum forward in 2021 simply by continuing to enhance the value we offer to all those we serve. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian Wenzel."
260334235,699818996,2185747,"Synchrony Financial, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2021",2021-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Synchrony Financial","Executives","Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone.

Before I begin, I want to congratulate Margaret and Brian on their new roles and thank them for what they have done for Synchrony and for me personally. I speak for everyone in the company when I say we look forward to working closely with them in the next chapter for Synchrony. As we begin 2021, we're encouraged by the developments being made to fight the pandemic, and continue to be inspired by those in the front lines. For our part, we remain dedicated to keeping our employees safe in helping our partners, customers and communities during this difficult period, guided by our values and principles and with the partner centric focus, we are working to help our constituents navigate this environment with an eye towards the future and the opportunities ahead of us as we begin to overcome the pandemic. 
During the fourth quarter, the pan data continued to impact our growth and several areas, as noted on Slide 7. However, our business mix, which includes a significant digital component and certain industries benefiting from saying at home such as home related products and services, veterinary services, and electronics and appliances have out balanced against some of the effects of the economic downturn. Purchase volume was essentially flat, down 1% versus last year and in line with our expectations for the quarter, despite some pressure from new shutdowns and restrictions as the pandemic progressed during the quarter. The continued pressure caused our average active accounts to be down 10% and a decrease in loan receivables of 6%. Payment rates continue to be elevated relative to normalized levels. Interest and fees on loans were down 11% from last year, consistent with the core decrease we experienced last quarter. Dual and co-branded cards account for 38% of our purchase line in the fourth quarter and declined 4% from the prior year. On a loan receivable basis, they account for 24% of the portfolio and declined 10% from the prior year. 
While we're seeing positive trending in our growth metric as we enter the quarter, the acceleration of the pandemic result in regional shutdowns and diminished effects of the Care Act stimulus slowed that early momentum. While our sales are stable, we are encouraged by recent developments, including the recently enacted stimulus, the proposed stimulus, a new administration and national rollout of a vaccine. We believe these factors will have a positive impact. It should provide momentum as we progress through 2021. 
I'll provide a more comprehensive view on 2021 shortly. RSAs increased $18 million or 2% from last year. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables was 5.2% for the quarter. This was elevated from the historical average, primarily due to the significant improvement in net charge-offs and the elimination of Walmart, which operated at a lower than company average RSA percentage. The improvement in net charge-offs resulted in a decrease in the provision for credit losses of $354 million or 32% from last year. This was partially offset by a reserve build in the fourth quarter of $119 million. 
Other income decreased $22 million, mainly due to higher loyalty costs. Other expense decreased $79 million or 7% from last year due to lower purchase volume and average active accounts, coupled with lower employee costs as we have begun to implement our strategic plan to reduce operating expenses. Moving to our platform results on Slide 8. Our sales platforms continue to be impacted in varying degrees due to COVID-19, and their trajectories through this period have been different based on factors such as business and partner mix, digital concentration, provider access and availability of hard line goods. In Retail Card, loan receivables were down 8%, with the COVID-19 impact being partially offset by strong growth in digital programs. That resiliency is evident in the growth in purchase line, which was up 1% over last year. Other performance metrics were down due to the impact from COVID-19. 
We're excited about the launch of our new value prop with Sam's Club. They are an important and valued partner, and we're excited about the changes in this program for Sam's club members. The continued strength of powersports and home specialty and payment solutions helped offset some of the impact from COVID-19. Loan receivables declined 2%. Average active account and interest and fees on loans were down 9%, which was driven primarily by lower yield on loan receivables, purchase line decreased 7% this quarter. 
We signed several new programs and renewed several key partnerships this quarter. We continue to drive growth organically through our partnerships and networks and added over 2,800 new merchants during the quarter. We also continue to drive higher card reuse, which now stands at approximately 34% of purchase volume, excluding oil and gas. Our efforts and successes are expanding an already solid base for growth as we exit the pandemic. Although CareCredit was impacted the most by COVID-19 earlier this year, we began to see some improvement as the year progressed as providers continue to increase elective and planned services from the trough in the second quarter. 
That said, rising infection rates and increasing stay at home restriction did slow some of this progress. Loan receivables declined 7%, with interest and fees on loans decreasing 4% and primarily driven by lower merchant discount revenue as a result of the decline in purchase volume, which was down 6%. Average active accounts decreased 10%. As Margaret noted earlier, we're excited about our partner activity within this platform including the acquisition of LEGO credit, our Aspen dental renewal and expansion and our new partnership with community veterinary partners. During the quarter, we also continued to grow our CareCredit network and enhance utility of our card. The expansions of our network and acceptance strategy has helped to drive reuse rate to 59% of purchase line in the fourth quarter. We are proud of these achievements, I'm particularly excited about the opportunities we see to drive future growth in this platform as the impact of the pandemic subsides. 
I'll move to Slide 9 and cover our net interest income and margin trends. Net interest income decreased 9% from last year primarily driven by an 11% decrease in interest and fees on loan receivables to the impact of COVID-19. Net interest margin was 14.64% compared to last year's margin of 15.01%, largely driven by the impact of COVID-19 on loan receivables, an increase in liquidity and lower benchmark rates. Specifically, the mix of loan receivables as a percent of total earning assets declined approximately 30 basis points from 80.2% to 79.9%, driven by higher liquidity held during the quarter. This accounted for 5 basis points of the net interest margin decline. The loan receivables yield of 19.93% was down 94 basis points versus last year and was a driver of a 75 basis point reduction in our net interest margin. The liquidity yield declined as a result of lower benchmark rates and accounted for a 30 basis point reduction in our net interest margin. These impacts were partially offset by an 89 basis point decrease in the total interest-bearing liabilities cost to 1.69%, primarily due to lower benchmark rates and a higher proportion of deposit funding. This provides a 73 basis point increase in our net interest margin. 
Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 10. In terms of specific dynamics in the quarter, I'll start with the delinquency trends. The 30-plus delinquency rate was 3.07% compared to 4.44% last year. The 90-plus delinquency rate was 1.40% compared to 2.15% last year. Higher payment trends have helped drive the improvement in delinquency rates. Focusing on net charge-off trends. The net charge-off rate was 3.16% compared to 5.15% last year. The reduction in the net charge-off rate was primarily driven by improving delinquency trend as customer payment behavior improved throughout 2020. The allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 12.54% and with the increase to last year being primarily driven by the adoption of CECL in 2020 and the impact from COVID-19. Moving to Slide 11. I will cover expenses for the quarter. Overall expenses were $1 billion for the quarter, down $79 million or 7% from last year. The decrease was driven by lower purchase volume and average active accounts as well as reduction in employee costs and operational losses. The efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter was 37.1% compared to 34.8% last year. The ratio was negatively impacted by lower revenue that resulted from lower receivables and lower interest and fee yield, which was partially offset by the reduction in employee costs and operational losses. 
Moving to Slide 12. Given the reduction in our loan receivables and strengthen our deposit platform, we continue to carry a higher level of liquidity, while we believe it's prudent to maintain a higher liquidity level during this uncertain and volatile period, we are actively managing our funding profile to mitigate excess liquidity where appropriate. As a result of this strategy, there is a shift in the mix of our funding during the quarter. Deposits declined $2.3 billion from last year. Our securitized and unsecured funding sources were down $2.6 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. This resulted in deposits being 80% of our funding compared to 77% last year with securitized and unsecured funding, each comprising 10% of our funding sources at quarter end. 
Total liquidity, including undrawn credit facilities, was $23.7 billion, which equated to 24.7% of our total assets, up from 22% last year. Before I provide details on our capital position, it should be noted that we elected to take the benefit of the transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies in March, which had 2 primary benefits. First, it delays the effects of the CECL transition adjustment for an incremental 2 years; and second, it allows for a portion of the current period provisioning to be deferred and amortized with the transition adjustment. With this framework, we ended the quarter at 15.9% CET1 under the CECL transition rules, 180 basis points above last year's level of 14.1%. 
The Tier 1 capital ratio was 16.8% under CECL transition rules compared to 15.0% last year. The total capital ratio increased 180 basis points as well to 18.1%. And the Tier 1 capital plus reserves ratio on a fully phased-in basis increased to 27.0% compared to 21.4% last year, reflecting the increase in reserves as a result of implementing CECL. During the quarter, we paid a common stock dividend of $0.22 per share. For the full year, we returned approximately $1.5 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and common stock dividends. As we finish 2020 and enter 2021, we have continued to assess the capital and liquidity strength of the company and the stability of our business at this point in the pandemic. With this backdrop, the Board has authorized $1.6 billion in share repurchases for 2021, beginning in the first quarter. Repurchases are subject to our capital plan, and regulatory restrictions as well as overall market conditions, including any potential deterioration from the ongoing pandemic. 
Next, on Slide 13, we are providing a framework on key drivers for 2021. It goes without saying that the current environment will have periods of uncertainty and volatility until the pandemic is under control and the resulting impact to the economic environment is more fully known. While our visibility is limited, we're providing this framework about how we are thinking about the year might unfold based on our best assessment as of today. These views assume that in the first half of the year, there is continuing pressure from the pandemic and a slow economic recovery. In the second half, we assume that pandemic is largely under control and economic recovery accelerates. 
First quarter purchase items is expected to be consistent with the trends that developed at the end of 2020. Second quarter comparisons will obviously reflect the economic trough experienced in second quarter '20. The second half of the year, we anticipate improving growth trends as the pandemic impact moderate and macroeconomic growth accelerates. Regarding loan receivable growth. In the first half, we expect continued higher payment rates from the stimulus actions to impact loan growth. In the second half of the year, we believe payment rates will slow as stimulus abate, and we returned to more normalized payment behavior patterns, combined with the expected increase in purchase volume from an improving macroeconomic environment, these drivers will contribute to accelerating asset growth. 
For net interest margin, overall, we expect continued improvement as we enter 2021. Regarding the improvement in the first half we anticipate that higher payment rates will contribute to continued excess liquidity impacting asset mix. In the second half, excess liquidity is reduced through asset growth and slowing payment rates, which drive normalized interest and fee yields leading to increasing NIM. With respect to our view on credit for the year, delinquencies are expected to increase with peak delinquencies occurring in third quarter 2021 and result in sequential quarter increases in net charge-offs. We would expect reserves to be largely driven by asset growth and the impacts from any changes in the credit macroeconomic scenario. We anticipate a reserve release during 2021 as the credit macroeconomic environment develops. 
RSAs will remain elevated in the first half primarily reflecting the strong program performance, including revenue and net charge-offs. In the second half, we expect lower RSAs, generally reflecting the higher net charge-offs, partially offset by higher revenue. As we outlined previously, we've implemented cost reductions across the organization. We believe this will result in expense reductions of approximately $210 million during the year. Partially offsetting these cost reductions will be expense increases related to growth in addition to the anticipated increase in delinquent accounts. We will continue to closely monitor how the pandemic develops and its impact to the macroeconomic environment and adjust as the landscape unfolds. 
As we enter 2021, we remain optimistic in the strength and the strategic position of our business to meet the challenges and exit the pandemic period in a stronger position than when we entered. We will continue to make investments in our people, products, technology and platforms to drive long-term value and continue to ensure safety of our employees, while meeting the needs of our partners, merchants, providers and cardholders.

So I think as you slide into 2021, what you're going to see is as we continue to expect NIM to rise, there will be a benefit that will flow back through the RSA to the retailers pushing it upward. But then as credit normalizes, that will deflate it. So our expectation is it remains a little bit elevated. We would not expect that type of elevation at the end of the year as we exit out of 2021.

So I was wondering if there was potential, we could see some of these short-term products evolve into your own buy now pay later product? 
And second, just given some of the new players in the space are charging merchants, pretty healthy fees for these products, can you maybe just talk about the pricing on merchant discount rates in some of your equal pay products? And can you maybe use pricing as a lever to drive volumes towards your offering and maybe away from some of these newer entrants?"

I think you really got to take a step back and say, look, our strategy really to provide a full suite of products that fit both what our partners want, but also what consumers are looking for. And obviously, buy now, pay later is a trend that's not going away. Installment loans, a trend that's not going away. If you take a step back and you think about our business, we have such a broad set of partners that you really just can't have a 1 size fits all strategy. 
So as you know, Ryan, we sit down with each 1 of our partners, we sit down and say, okay, what are you trying to achieve? How can we help you drive sales, how can we help you communicate life cycle market to your customers? And that means that they will want to offer a variety of products. In some cases, a revolving product is going to make more sense. In some cases, an installment product is a better fit. If you think about bigger ticket products, that steers more towards longer-term installment. That can be on a revolving product or closed end. And then smaller ticket, the trend that we've seen recently is that tends to steer more shorter-term and more shorter-term installment. And so again, it comes back to really what the partner wants at the end of the day. 
Now you make a really good point. Obviously, merchant discount pricing plays into this. The shorter you go and if you're not charging interest on the account, then obviously, you charge a higher merchant discount. And so again, it comes down to what the partner wants and what the consumer wants at the end of the day. Look, I feel great about the product set that we have. The one thing that I would not underestimate, though, is the product is really just 1 piece of the equation. What we've been working on and what's really important is how do you embed the product in the shopping journey. And so that -- the way that we integrate is more important than ever. So it really comes down to features and capabilities, even more than the products. At the end of the day, these products are not that complex. It's really about how do we integrate, how do we embed the financing offer throughout the shopping journey."

I guess it's a little weird because the credit quality being so strong is affecting you guys a little bit more because you're sharing some of the upside there with the retailers.

Did you start to see it wear off a little bit in the fourth quarter? I'm just trying to figure out sort of how stimulus, how long you think credit sort of remains this favorable at this point in time, understanding your forecast that things might revert to the mean?"

We've seen that throughout 2020, most certainly, we saw an influx of payments, right, when the most recent stimulus package hit. So payment rates actually elevated back higher in the early part of January. So clearly, stimulus is in effect, and you do see it wear off. Now what's interesting, more interesting about this latest stimulus is it's not surgical as much. It's going to a broad-based population. So the effectiveness as we continue to move on even with further stimulus, our portfolio shifted. We used to be 27% subprime, now we're 23% subprime. So the effects of that will not hold. 
So we do assume that when the stimulus burns off here, most certainly from the 1 in December, but if there's another stimulus that does get enacted in the first quarter, that will burn off, and you'll see payment rates elevate back, and then you'll see delinquencies come back into the portfolio. Well, certainly, we're expecting, given the high level of unemployment that delinquencies will build pretty quickly here as we move out. But again, we haven't seen that to date in the credit metrics that you have seen. So there is a chance, though, that with the future stimulus and if you get the pandemic under control, with the vaccine that you may flatten the ultimate loss curve here and have a bridge, which is what we would hope for."

As we roll out to the broader population soon, we expect that to continue to be a big part of our growth story as we go forward with the company.

But I'd say that our experience has always been that customers can compartmentalize pen. So if you think about Venmo, I think that's going to become more of an everyday use card, particularly with folks that use that app all day long. And we think as it's integrated into that payment mechanism, and the ability to really split payments and actually experience that back and forth between how people spend. But I think the big opportunity on Venmo really is the fact that you can use that card now in broader merchants. 
So I think as the QR code becomes more of a go to type of technology. It's still not where it needs to be. But we think that's really the other big opportunity with Venmo. So you have the in-app experience where people are working together to purchase things. But then in-store or the QR code opportunity presents a whole different, I think, different set of experiences and maybe broaden stack customer base for us. So we're excited about that. 
On the other 2, it really is the value prop that I think makes another big difference where for Walgreens, what we do know, and we know this through a CareCredit that people do compartmentalize their health care spend. And as consumers are being asked to really bear a bigger burden on health care spends, we spend, we view this card to be a great way for us to enter into the broader space of health care. You know that's been part of our strategy. I should also say that it's building on the relationship we already had with Walgreens because we already had the card -- the CareCredit card accepted in Walgreens. Now this is really tying our card with their value prop, connecting the 2 together and really allowing customers who have health care needs and wellness needs to really leverage that and then get the rewards. And then again, we're going to work towards making all this digital. So it's a really seamless, frictionless experience for the consumer. 
And then Verizon is really, I think the value prop on Verizon in terms of how you use Verizon, I think all I joke all the time for those who -- I'm old, so I have kids who are old. They're still on my plan. You never really get the kids off the plan, by the way, leveraging that value prop and using that towards your bill, I think, is another really positive momentum that we're seeing. So we think all 3 of these programs have real growth potential. I think it really demonstrates for us our ability to really be agile in a very difficult environment to roll out during the pandemic and to really meet the needs of what I would say are really strong value props, leveraging technology."

So it's important to note that the announcement that we made and the Board authorized is slightly different than we historically done. This is for a calendar year. Obviously, the Fed has put some restrictions in for the first quarter, but we're going to go through our process. We've been going through a quarterly process from a governance perspective, looking at loss stresses, looking at the way our balance sheet will perform. And I think if you go back a quarter, we weren't sure we'd be in this position to start the year. We were thinking more back half of the year. But I think as we talk with the Board, we recognize the strength and the capital and liquidity of the company. We recognize the stability of the company as we progress through the back half of 2020. 
As we look into 2021, we -- again, it's uncertain. There's going to be volatility, but we're optimistic that the pandemic comes under control in the first half and that the macroeconomic piece picks up. So we thought it was prudent to start. We'll go through a process and submit our formal capital plan to the Fed at the end of March, beginning of April. And then we'll circle back with what that amount is. We think that's a prudent amount, right, given this is a transitional year, right, relative to the visibility and uncertainty. So obviously, we haven't changed our long-term view with regards to capital and where we want to get to. It's just really the pace. And so we're comfortable that this is a good place to start, and we can always revisit as we move through the year."

And by the way, it does sit in CareCredit. So I should clarify that. Doe sit in CareCredit. We believe that the everyday spend around wellness is an area where consumers are looking for rewards. We believe Walgreens is a great partner because we were already in there accepting the Walgreen -- the CareCredit card. So we believe this space is a real ripe opportunity because of our unique knowledge and experience in this space for over 30 years, and we really see Walgreens as a way for us to really continue to expand and differentiate ourselves in the health care business.

That's why we put a slide in the deck today just to kind of lay out in more detail how much of this busine",516,"Yes, sure, Betsy. It really does come down to the individual partner and what they're trying to achieve. And I think obviously, this is a hot topic. That's why we put a slide in the deck today just to kind of lay out in more detail how much of this business we actually do today. I don't think it's well-known that we have $15 billion of balances that are on equal pay products, both short and long term. 
And I think it really does come down to partner choice. So as I said, we sit down with each 1 of our partners, in some cases, they love the idea of an equal pay product because that's what the consumer wants. That's what their customer wants, but they want to put it on a revolving product. And part of the reason for that is it gives them an ongoing relationship with the customer, right? It allows them to drive the repeat usage. It allows them to do the life cycle marketing. All of those things that are really important to our partners and that, frankly, they've been trying to drive for the last 5 or 6 years. 
We always talk to you about how much reuse we get on the card. And that's a big priority for our partners is creating that lasting relationship with their customer. And then we also have some customers that, depending on their customer base and the types of products they sell, that they're actually interested in more of a short-term closed-end installment product. And so we're able to provide that as well through SetPay, and we can do that very short term, we can do it longer term. But it really is customized for the individual partner in terms of what they're trying to achieve. 
The 1 thing I can tell you is we are seeing slightly higher growth rates on those installment products than we're seeing on the other products in the portfolio, which I think is good news. I mean, we absolutely have to stay ahead of that curve. It's rapidly evolving. But the product is just 1 piece of the equation. I touched on this earlier, what our partners really want to make sure we can do. And this is very different depending on the types of partners is how do we integrate into their digital point of sale. And if I look across the investments that we're making in the company, that's 1 of the biggest ones. So it's not enough just to have the product, actually having the product is the easier part in a lot of cases. But how do you integrate seamlessly inside of all of our partners' digital assets. So how do you do that online? How do you do it in their mobile app? 
And you can imagine, given the breadth of our partner base, we have to have solutions that customize for each of those individual partners. And so it really is more about the experience than the actual product at the end of the day.  Did I answer your question."

So we've maintained that so for us, we're going to continue to invest. I mean, 2020 was a big year for us when you think about the investment to stand up a Venmo and Verizon. And again, we're looking forward to a full Venmo launch here in 2021. So we've invested quite a bit. 
Walgreens comes right behind this. We continue to drive core productivity in which we're continuing the investment. And again, the way we're positioning the company for the longer term, Bill, is to look at if I'm thinking out 2025, what is an above-average ROA, and we're going to drive that efficiency ratio back down into a range where it has been more historically. But really delivers that ROA given the revenue mix and loss content that we see in that portfolio mix. That being said, we are going to find ways in order to either increase the margin of the of the portfolios or to drive incremental costs out to maintain and perhaps expand that investment technology. That is something that we want to do and we feel we need to do for the medium and long term."

The first piece in all our modeling as we move through '20 and really '21, we've always modeled in the transition adjustment relative to CECL and, most certainly, that would come out of -- we view the capital generation in those years as we move out. This is roughly around, I think, 60 basis points. Assuming that the rules state [indiscernible] we are continuing, to be honest with you, engage with dialogues with our stakeholders about a form of permanent capital relief because we obviously believe that when you look at our Tier 1 plus reserves at 27% that is very high, where we are and that we believe that there should be credit, whether it sits in Tier 2 or in Tier 1 relative to CECL. 
So that's always been a factor as part of our plans and shouldn't really impact it. With regard to your second part of your question, that the improvement in the macroeconomic scenario, most certainly, we're not tied to the $1.6 billion. That's where we view it today. We're going to go through our capital planning process here in the first quarter and get our capital plan approved by the Board in March, submitted in April. And then hopefully, we'll come back to you in the second quarter with a fuller perspective. But there is a scenario where clearly we can return potential more capital. I think right now, $1.6 billion is we're sitting January 29 and a transition in a year that is a little bit uncertain, is not a bad place to start the year at. So we're going to continue to monitor the same way of quarter out. We thought we weren't going to do anything until the back half of this year. So we'll continue to evaluate it, Bill."

I mean, Walmart, clearly, if you strip that out, we'll push the RSA higher because it operated at a lower RSA level than the company average. Absent that, there's nothing fundamental. I think what's challenging people, and I can appreciate it from an outside-in perspective is CECL has dramatically impacted the profitability of the company. And it's very difficult. We've lagged CECL, but when you don't see delinquency formation at a retail partner, it's difficult to go to them and say, okay, even though I haven't seen delinquencies, they're going to come at some point, here's $100 million, $200 million. So that is unfortunately pushing the RSA higher here. And then when you look at credit really outperforming the loss in in NIM, we have a higher RSA. I think when you look at it over time, if you look at '20 and '21 combined together, it's going to get back down the average. And most certainly, as we exit the pandemic, there's nothing structurally that they should operate at different level ex the Walmart impact."

Obviously, shorter-dated promotions, you're maybe getting more merchant discount, you're getting less off of the APR or the consumer. But I wouldn't see having a material impact on our overall profitability return, longer term, you might just see the components change, which, as you know, both of those run through net interest income.

It was a true test to our resilience, our agility and our strength as a business. We're proud of the way Synchrony managed through these challenges. Though there have been significant developments that provide hope that the pandemic will begin to moderate, the virus resurgence and resulting regional shutdown and continued impact on unemployment is something we are still managing through. And though the pandemic continues to impact results, we are encouraged by some of those trends that have developed. Later in the call, Brian Wenzel will detail these impacts on the quarter's results and provide a view on how we think this year might develop. I will provide a high-level overview here. 
Let's first focus on our quarterly results, including some of our recent successes, which are outlined on Slides 3 and 4. Earnings were $738 million or $1.24 per diluted share, an increase of $0.09 over last year. Loan receivables were down 6% to $81.9 billion, and average active accounts decreased 10% from last year, with new accounts down 19%. Purchase volume per account increased 10% over last year to $602. And average active balance per account increased 4% to just under $1,200. Net interest margin was down 37 basis points to 14.64% and the efficiency ratio was 37.1% for the quarter. Net charge-offs hit a new low at 3.16%. 
As a result of our liquidity and funding strategy, in response to COVID-19 impact on our balance sheet, deposits were down $2.3 billion or 4% versus last year. This includes a strategic decision to slow overall deposit growth, given the excess liquidity we have. Total deposits comprise 80% of our funding and our direct deposit platform remains an important funding source. Our ability to service and provide digital tools to customers, makes our bank attractive to depositors, and we will continue to build out additional capabilities. 
During the quarter -- we returned $128 million in the quarter through a common stock dividend. We also announced that the Board authorized $1.6 billion in share repurchases for 2021, beginning in the first quarter. We have a solid pipeline across our platforms, a mix of start-up and existing programs. But we are being very disciplined around risk and returns, given the uncertainty in the current environment. And while this retail landscape is shifting, we believe similar opportunities will continue, as evidenced by recent wins. I will touch upon a few highlights. 
We announced that we will become the issuer of Walgreens co-branded credit card program in the U.S., the first such credit program in the retail health sector. The card will allow customers to earn rewards for purchases anywhere Mastercard is accepted. We expect to launch the new program in the second half of 2021. This new agreement is built upon the company's existing strategic partnership. CareCredit is already accepted at more than 9,000 Walgreens and Duane Reade stores. 
We are committed to providing Walgreens customers and patients with unparalleled experiences, a best-in-class loyalty program and the ability to manage their health and wellness spending. In addition, we renewed our strategic partnership with Mattress Firm. We provide flexible financing solutions and innovative business tools that empowered Mattress Firm to meet their customers at critical moments in the purchasing journey, which is increasingly online. Our digital tools and industry-leading credit program team, including marketing, and analytic retail experts have optimized every step of the omnichannel customer journey to deliver a competitive user experience. We look forward to many more years as a strategic partner of Mattress Firm. 
We also reached a definitive agreement to acquire Allegro Credit, a leading provider of point-of-sale consumer financing for audiology products and dental services. Allegro offers numerous customers loan options through its merchant partners with flexible payment terms at the point of sale. These products are designed to offer customers choice to purchase the products and services they need or want. The addition of Allegro Credit's merchant network and customers complements our strategy of growing CareCredit, our leading health and wellness financing platform. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021. 
Altogether this quarter, we signed 9 renewals and won 7 new deals, along with the acquisition. I cannot overstate the importance of digital innovation to the success of our programs. Consumers are rapidly adopting technologies that enable contactless commerce and expect engagement along their digital purchase journeys. We are leveraging our digital assets and continuously investing to ensure our partners are well positioned in this rapidly evolving dynamic. These investments include the capabilities to empower SaaS and seamless integration with our partners' digital assets, enable customer choice at the point of sale, enhance contactless experiences, facilitate a seamless and easy application process, bring the in-store experience to a customer's digital devices for applications and payment, and integrate our financing office throughout the entire digital shopping experience.  
We also continue to expand our digital penetration of all aspects of our customer journey: apply, buy and service. Approximately, 60% of our applications were done digitally during the fourth quarter and grew 18% in mobile channel applications. In Retail Card, 51% of our sales occurred online. Finally, approximately 65% of our payments were made digitally. 
In short, we are rising to the challenges presented by this difficult time. We have strengthened the strategic position of our business and expanded the opportunity set that lies before us. And we're investing in the right strategy that will enable near-term successes while also driving considerable shareholder value over the long term. With our future in mind, as you know, a few weeks ago, we announced some important changes to the leadership of this company. Effective April 1, I will transition to the role of Executive Chair of our Board of Directors, and Brian Doubles will become Synchrony's President and CEO.  
Synchrony means so much to me, and one of my goals as CEO was to set up a thoughtful leadership transition with a successor who will advance what we have built. Both the Board and I believe there is no one in the world better equipped to do that than Brian. Brian has helped to build Synchrony every step of the way. He has been my trusted partner for more than a decade, including through our IPO. When we started Synchrony back in 2014, we set out to build a great business with a great culture that delivers for our partners and customers every day. Together, with our 16,500 employees, we are doing just that.  
With Synchrony in a position of strength, now is the time to implement this transition, allowing Brian to continue the incredible progress that has been made and to drive the next stage of Synchrony's exciting growth journey. I look forward to working with Brian through this transition and continuing to support Synchrony's growth and future success as Executive Chair.  
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."

We truly would not be where we are or who we are today without her leadership, and it's an absolute honor to succeed her and lead Sync",773,"I want to start by thanking Margaret for all that she has done for Synchrony and for me personally over the last decade. We truly would not be where we are or who we are today without her leadership, and it's an absolute honor to succeed her and lead Synchrony into the future. I am also grateful that we will continue to benefit from Margaret's expertise and leadership in her role as Executive Chair. And I am excited to partner with her and the Board, our leadership team, and especially our employees as we continue to capitalize on our momentum. 
There is a lot to be excited about as we continue Synchrony's journey. We have a strong business, a winning culture, and a tremendous opportunity to build on this strong foundation. As incoming CEO, I will continue to implement the strategy that we've developed over the last few years, and which has enabled the momentum that our business has today. We will continue to leverage our competitive strength, deepen our market leadership and invest in digital, data analytics and new product offerings to create a seamless customer experience. We will continue to grow our business and drive value for all of our stakeholders, our investors, our employees, our partners and our customers. 
On that note, I'd like to shift gears and turn to Slide 5 to talk about just 1 example of the strategy that we implemented to enhance the utility and value of our offerings, and which has become an important part of our business today, equal payment financing. Fundamental to our business is our objective to provide a full suite of products that can be tailored to serve the evolving needs of our customers and partners, while earning appropriate economic returns. Our partners' most critical needs are centered on their ability to offer a product that can seamlessly integrate with our digital assets and systems, deliver higher average order volumes and sales, increase conversion rates and deepen customer loyalty. 
By the same token, customers have their own unique set needs, including financing solutions that fit within their budget, are transparent and easy and convenient to use, and which offer them flexibility in their purchase and financing decisions.  
We have extensive experience in installment lending, which has informed our approach to equal payment financing. We think about these products in 2 categories. First, revolving products. We offer mid- and long-term equal payment plans with promotional periods anywhere from 12 to 162 months, depending on the product category. We also offer short-term equal payment plans with promotional periods of 3 to 12 months. Second, closed-end products. We offer collateralized installment products with bigger ticket purchases with promotional periods from 12 to 180 months. And we also offer short and long-term installment loans through our SetPay product. These products run anywhere from 3 to 36 months. 
All of these products are priced appropriately to meet our partner and customer objectives with APR starting at 0%, and each of these products, in turn, offer distinct benefits and address the unique objectives of our partners and customers. Revolving equal pay products, for example, can be embedded inside of an existing revolving account, eliminating the need for a customer to open a new account. And given the nature of their functionality, they also provide for repeat purchases as well as higher engagement and loyalty to the partners plan. 
Meanwhile, closed-end products can be appealed to customers that prefer regular predictable payments. To put our overall equal payment financing strategy in perspective, we currently have $15 billion in equal payment balances, 56% of which have 0% APR financing. We have about 74,000 partners or locations offering our payment plan products. And we have an overall repeat purchase rate of approximately 30% within 24 months of the first purchase.  
Synchrony's success in this and our other core strategies has been driven by our commitment to data-driven innovation, a deep understanding of our partners' objectives and customer needs, and our ability to adapt as the competitive landscape and market conditions have evolved over time. Our organization is built around being nimble, responsive and results oriented. We leverage our decades of underwriting experience, our proprietary data analytics and our industry expertise in order to design and implement customized solutions that address our partners' needs while also delivering appropriate economic outcomes. This is what has driven Symphony's long-standing track record and deepened our market leadership over the years. We are excited to drive this momentum forward in 2021 simply by continuing to enhance the value we offer to all those we serve.  
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian Wenzel."
260334235,699818996,2185854,"Synchrony Financial, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2021",2021-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Synchrony Financial","Executives","Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone.

Before I begin, I want to congratulate Margaret and Brian on their new roles and thank them for what they have done for Synchrony and for me personally. I speak for everyone in the company when I say we look forward to working closely with them in the next chapter for Synchrony. As we begin 2021, we're encouraged by the developments being made to fight the pandemic, and continue to be inspired by those in the front lines. For our part, we remain dedicated to keeping our employees safe in helping our partners, customers and communities during this difficult period, guided by our values and principles. And with the partner-centric focus, we are working to help our constituents navigate this environment with an eye towards the future and the opportunities ahead of us as we begin to overcome the pandemic.  
During the fourth quarter, the pandemic continued to impact our growth and several areas, as noted on Slide 7. However, our business mix, which includes a significant digital component and certain industries benefiting from staying at home, such as home-related products and services, veterinary services, and electronics and appliances have outbalanced against some of the effects of the economic downturn. Purchase volume was essentially flat, down 1% versus last year and in line with our expectations for the quarter, despite some pressure from new shutdowns and restrictions as the pandemic progressed during the quarter. The continued pressure caused our average active accounts to be down 10% and a decrease in loan receivables of 6%. Payment rates continue to be elevated relative to normalized levels. Interest and fees on loans were down 11% from last year, consistent with the core decrease we experienced last quarter. Dual and co-branded cards account for 38% of our purchase line in the fourth quarter and declined 4% from the prior year. On a loan receivable basis, they account for 24% of the portfolio and declined 10% from the prior year.  
While we're seeing positive trending in our growth metric as we enter the quarter, the acceleration of the pandemic result in regional shutdowns and diminished effects of the CARES Act stimulus slowed that early momentum. While our sales are stable, we are encouraged by recent developments, including the recently enacted stimulus, the proposed stimulus, a new administration and national rollout of a vaccine. We believe these factors will have a positive impact. It should provide momentum as we progress through 2021.  
I'll provide a more comprehensive view on 2021 shortly. RSAs increased $18 million or 2% from last year. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables was 5.2% for the quarter. This was elevated from the historical average, primarily due to the significant improvement in net charge-offs and the elimination of Walmart, which operated at a lower than company average RSA percentage. The improvement in net charge-offs resulted in a decrease in the provision for credit losses of $354 million or 32% from last year. This was partially offset by a reserve build in the fourth quarter of $119 million.  
Other income decreased $22 million, mainly due to higher loyalty costs. Other expense decreased $79 million or 7% from last year due to lower purchase volume and average active accounts, coupled with lower employee costs as we have begun to implement our strategic plan to reduce operating expenses. 
Moving to our platform results on Slide 8. Our sales platforms continue to be impacted in varying degrees due to COVID-19, and their trajectories through this period have been different based on factors such as business and partner mix, digital concentration, provider access and availability of hardline goods. In Retail Card, loan receivables were down 8%, with the COVID-19 impact being partially offset by strong growth in digital programs. That resiliency is evident in the growth in purchase line, which was up 1% over last year. Other performance metrics were down due to the impact from COVID-19.  
We're excited about the launch of our new value prop with Sam's Club. They are an important and valued partner, and we're excited about the changes in this program for Sam's Club members. The continued strength of powersports and home specialty and payment solutions helped offset some of the impact from COVID-19. Loan receivables declined 2%. Average active account and interest and fees on loans were down 9%, which was driven primarily by lower yield on loan receivables. Purchase line decreased 7% this quarter.  
We signed several new programs and renewed several key partnerships this quarter. We continue to drive growth organically through our partnerships and networks and added over 2,800 new merchants during the quarter. We also continue to drive higher card reuse, which now stands at approximately 34% of purchase volume, excluding oil and gas. Our efforts and successes are expanding an already solid base for growth as we exit the pandemic. Although CareCredit was impacted the most by COVID-19 earlier this year, we began to see some improvement as the year progressed as providers continue to increase elective and planned services from the trough in the second quarter.  
That said, rising infection rates and increasing stay-at-home restrictions did slow some of this progress. Loan receivables declined 7% with interest and fees on loans decreasing 4%, primarily driven by lower merchant discount revenue as a result of the decline in purchase volume, which was down 6%. Average active accounts decreased 10%. As Margaret noted earlier, we're excited about our partner activity within this platform including the acquisition of Allegro Credit, our Aspen Dental renewal and expansion and our new partnership with Community Veterinary Partners. 
During the quarter, we also continued to grow our CareCredit network and enhance utility of our card. The expansions of our network and acceptance strategy has helped to drive reuse rate to 59% of purchase line in the fourth quarter. We are proud of these achievements, I'm particularly excited about the opportunities we see to drive future growth in this platform as the impact of the pandemic subsides.  
I'll move to Slide 9 and cover our net interest income and margin trends. Net interest income decreased 9% from last year primarily driven by an 11% decrease in interest and fees on loan receivables due to the impact of COVID-19. Net interest margin was 14.64% compared to last year's margin of 15.01%, largely driven by the impact of COVID-19 on loan receivables, an increase in liquidity and lower benchmark rates. Specifically, the mix of loan receivables as a percent of total earning assets declined approximately 30 basis points from 80.2% to 79.9%, driven by higher liquidity held during the quarter. This accounted for 5 basis points of the net interest margin decline. 
The loan receivables yield of 19.93% was down 94 basis points versus last year and was a driver of a 75 basis point reduction in our net interest margin. The liquidity yield declined as a result of lower benchmark rates and accounted for a 30 basis point reduction in our net interest margin. These impacts were partially offset by an 89 basis point decrease in the total interest-bearing liabilities cost to 1.69%, primarily due to lower benchmark rates and a higher proportion of deposit funding. This provides a 73 basis point increase in our net interest margin. 
Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 10. In terms of specific dynamics in the quarter, I'll start with the delinquency trends. The 30-plus delinquency rate was 3.07% compared to 4.44% last year. The 90-plus delinquency rate was 1.40% compared to 2.15% last year. Higher payment trends have helped drive the improvement in delinquency rates. Focusing on net charge-off trends. The net charge-off rate was 3.16% compared to 5.15% last year. The reduction in the net charge-off rate was primarily driven by improving delinquency trend as customer payment behavior improved throughout 2020. The allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 12.54% with the increase to last year being primarily driven by the adoption of CECL in 2020 and the impact from COVID-19. 
Moving to Slide 11. I will cover expenses for the quarter. Overall expenses were $1 billion for the quarter, down $79 million or 7% from last year. The decrease was driven by lower purchase volume and average active accounts as well as reduction in employee costs and operational losses. The efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter was 37.1% compared to 34.8% last year. The ratio was negatively impacted by lower revenue that resulted from lower receivables and lower interest and fee yield, which was partially offset by the reduction in employee costs and operational losses.  
Moving to Slide 12. Given the reduction in our loan receivables and strength in our deposit platform, we continue to carry a higher level of liquidity. While we believe it's prudent to maintain a higher liquidity level during this uncertain and volatile period, we are actively managing our funding profile to mitigate excess liquidity where appropriate. As a result of this strategy, there is a shift in the mix of our funding during the quarter. Deposits declined $2.3 billion from last year. Our securitized and unsecured funding sources were down $2.6 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. This resulted in deposits being 80% of our funding compared to 77% last year with securitized and unsecured funding, each comprising 10% of our funding sources at quarter end.  
Total liquidity, including undrawn credit facilities, was $23.7 billion, which equated to 24.7% of our total assets, up from 22% last year. Before I provide details on our capital position, it should be noted that we elected to take the benefit of the transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies in March, which had 2 primary benefits. First, it delays the effects of the CECL transition adjustment for an incremental 2 years; and second, it allows for a portion of the current period provisioning to be deferred and amortized with the transition adjustment. With this framework, we ended the quarter at 15.9% CET1 under the CECL transition rules, 180 basis points above last year's level of 14.1%.  
The Tier 1 capital ratio was 16.8% under CECL transition rules compared to 15.0% last year. The total capital ratio increased 180 basis points as well to 18.1%. And the Tier 1 capital plus reserves ratio on a fully phased-in basis increased to 27.0% compared to 21.4% last year, reflecting the increase in reserves as a result of implementing CECL. During the quarter, we paid a common stock dividend of $0.22 per share. For the full year, we returned approximately $1.5 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and common stock dividends. As we finish 2020 and enter 2021, we have continued to assess the capital and liquidity strength of the company and the stability of our business at this point in the pandemic. 
With this backdrop, the Board has authorized $1.6 billion in share repurchases for 2021, beginning in the first quarter. Repurchases are subject to our capital plan, and regulatory restrictions as well as overall market conditions, including any potential deterioration from the ongoing pandemic.  
Next, on Slide 13, we are providing a framework on key drivers for 2021. It goes without saying that the current environment will have periods of uncertainty and volatility until the pandemic is under control and the resulting impact to the economic environment is more fully known. While our visibility is limited, we're providing this framework about how we are thinking about the year might unfold based on our best assessment as of today. These views assume that in the first half of the year, there is continuing pressure from the pandemic and a slow economic recovery. In the second half, we assume that pandemic is largely under control and economic recovery accelerates.  
First quarter purchase items is expected to be consistent with the trends that developed at the end of 2020. Second quarter comparisons will obviously reflect the economic trough experienced in second quarter '20. The second half of the year, we anticipate improving growth trends as the pandemic impact moderate and macroeconomic growth accelerates. Regarding loan receivable growth. In the first half, we expect continued higher payment rates from the stimulus actions to impact loan growth. In the second half of the year, we believe payment rates will slow as stimulus abate, and we return to more normalized payment behavior patterns, combined with the expected increase in purchase volume from an improving macroeconomic environment. These drivers will contribute to accelerating asset growth.  
For net interest margin, overall, we expect continued improvement as we enter 2021. Regarding the improvement, in the first half, we anticipate that higher payment rates will contribute to continued excess liquidity impacting asset mix. In the second half, excess liquidity is reduced through asset growth and slowing payment rates, which drive normalized interest and fee yields leading to increasing NIM. With respect to our view on credit for the year, delinquencies are expected to increase with peak delinquencies occurring in third quarter 2021 and result in sequential quarter increases in net charge-offs. We would expect reserves to be largely driven by asset growth and the impacts from any changes in the credit macroeconomic scenario. We anticipate a reserve release during 2021 as the credit macroeconomic environment develops.  
RSAs will remain elevated in the first half, primarily reflecting the strong program performance, including revenue and net charge-offs. In the second half, we expect lower RSAs, generally reflecting the higher net charge-offs, partially offset by higher revenue. As we outlined previously, we've implemented cost reductions across the organization. We believe this will result in expense reductions of approximately $210 million during the year. Partially offsetting these cost reductions will be expense increases related to growth in addition to the anticipated increase in delinquent accounts. We will continue to closely monitor how the pandemic develops and its impact to the macroeconomic environment and adjust as the landscape unfolds.  
As we enter 2021, we remain optimistic in the strength and the strategic position of our business to meet the challenges and exit the pandemic period in a stronger position than when we entered. We will continue to make investments in our people, products, technology and platforms to drive long-term value and continue to ensure safety of our employees, while meeting the needs of our partners, merchants, providers and cardholders.  
I will now turn the call over to the operator to begin the Q&A portion of our call."

Obviously, the elevation that we've seen as we enter into 2021, was really driven by credit, which was 200 basis points better on net charge-offs, slightly offset by -- or offset by some of the interest expense and NIM. But clear",147,"Yes. Agree. Thanks, Ryan. Obviously, the elevation that we've seen as we enter into 2021, was really driven by credit, which was 200 basis points better on net charge-offs, slightly offset by -- or offset by some of the interest expense and NIM. But clearly, elevated. So I think as you slide into 2021, what you're going to see is as we continue to expect NIM to rise, there will be a benefit that will flow back through the RSA to the retailers pushing it upward. But then as credit normalizes, that will deflate it. So our expectation is it remains a little bit elevated. We would not expect that type of elevation at the end of the year as we exit out of 2021. And I think as you get into 2022 and beyond, it should be back into the normal-type range that we've operated pre-pandemic."

I think you really got to take a step back and say, look, our strategy is really to provide a full suite of products that both what our partners want, but also what consumers are looking for.

I think you really got to take a step back and say, look, our strategy is really to provide a full suite of products that both what our partners want, but also what consumers are looking for. And obviously, buy now, pay later is a trend that's not going away. Installment loans is a trend that's not going away. If you take a step back and you think about our business, we have such a broad set of partners that you really just can't have a one-size-fits-all strategy.  
So as you know, Ryan, we sit down with each one of our partners. We sit down and say, okay, what are you trying to achieve? How can we help you drive sales? How can we help you communicate life cycle market to your customers? And that means that they will want to offer a variety of products. In some cases, a revolving product is going to make more sense. In some cases, an installment product is a better fit. If you think about bigger ticket products, that steers more towards longer-term installment. That can be on a revolving product or closed end. And then smaller ticket, the trend that we've seen recently is that tends to steer more shorter-term and more shorter-term installment. And so again, it comes back to really what the partner wants at the end of the day.  
Now you make a really good point. Obviously, merchant discount pricing plays into this. The shorter you go and if you're not charging interest on the account, then obviously, you charge a higher merchant discount. And so again, it comes down to what the partner wants and what the consumer wants at the end of the day. 
Look, I feel great about the product set that we have. The one thing that I would not underestimate, though, is the product is really just 1 piece of the equation. What we've been working on and what's really important is how do you embed the product in the shopping journey. And so that -- the way that we integrate is more important than ever. So it really comes down to features and capabilities, even more than the products. At the end of the day, these products are not that complex. It's really about how do we integrate, how do we embed the financing offer throughout the shopping journey."

We've seen that throughout 2020, most certainly, we saw an influx of payments, right, when the most recent stimulus package hit. So payment rates actually elevated back higher in the early part of January. So clearly, stimulus is in effect, and you do see it wear off. Now what's interesting, more interesting about this latest stimulus is it's not surgical as much. It's going to a broad-based population. So the effectiveness as we continue to move on even with further stimulus, our portfolio shifted. We used to be 27% subprime, now we're 23% subprime. So the effects of that will not hold.  
So we do assume that when the stimulus burns off here, most certainly from the one in December, but if there's another stimulus that does get enacted in the first quarter, that will burn off, and you'll see payment rates elevate back, and then you'll see delinquencies come back into the portfolio. Well, certainly, we're expecting, given the high level of unemployment, that delinquencies will build pretty quickly here as we move out. But again, we haven't seen that to date in the credit metrics that you have seen. So there is a chance, though, that with the future stimulus and if you get the pandemic under control, with the vaccine that you may flatten the ultimate loss curve here and have a bridge, which is what we would hope for."

On Venmo, we did the soft launch in the fall, that's gone also very well, and consumers are really liking how the product operates within the Venmo app. 
I think there's a lot of technology that both parties built out to make that really an integrated experience for consumers, and we are getting a lot of positive momentum there. As we roll out to the broader population soon, we expect that to continue to be a big part of our growth story as we go forward with the company.

But I'd say that our experience has always been that customers can compartmentalize  spends. So if you think about Venmo, I think that's going to become more of an everyday use card, particularly with folks that use that app all day long. And we think as it's integrated into that payment mechanism, and the ability to really split payments and actually experience that back and forth between how people spend. But I think the big opportunity on Venmo really is the fact that you can use that card now in broader merchants.  
So I think as the QR code becomes more of a go-to type of technology, it's still not where it needs to be. But we think that's really the other big opportunity with Venmo. So you have the in-app experience where people are working together to purchase things. But then in-store or the QR code opportunity presents a whole different, I think, different set of experiences and maybe broadens that customer base for us. So we're excited about that. 
On the other 2, it really is the value prop that I think makes another big difference. Where for Walgreens, what we do know, and we know this through CareCredit that people do compartmentalize their health care spend. And as consumers are being asked to really bear a bigger burden on health care spends, we spend, we view this card to be a great way for us to enter into the broader space of health care. You know that's been part of our strategy. I should also say that it's building on the relationship we already had with Walgreens because we already had the card -- the CareCredit card accepted in Walgreens. Now this is really tying our card with their value prop, connecting the 2 together and really allowing customers who have health care needs and wellness needs to really leverage that and then get the rewards. And then again, we're going to work towards making all this digital. So it's a really seamless, frictionless experience for the consumer.  
And then Verizon is really, I think the value prop on Verizon in terms of how you use Verizon, I think all -- I joke all the time for those who -- I'm also -- I have kids who are old. They're still on my plan. You never really get the kids off the plan, by the way. Leveraging that value prop and using that towards your bill, I think, is another really positive momentum that we're seeing. So we think all 3 of these programs have real growth potential. I think it really demonstrates for us our ability to really be agile in a very difficult environment to roll out during the pandemic and to really meet the needs of, what I would say are, really strong value props, leveraging technology."

So it's important to note that the announcement that we made and the Board authorized is slightly different than we've historically done. This is for a calendar year. Obviously, the Fed has put some restrictions in for the first quarter, but we're going to go through our process. We've been going through a quarterly process from a governance perspective, looking at loss stresses, looking at the way our balance sheet will perform. And I think if you go back a quarter, we weren't sure we'd be in this position to start the year. We were thinking more back half of the year. But I think as we talk with the Board, we recognize the strength and the capital and liquidity of the company. We recognize the stability of the company as we progress through the back half of 2020. 
As we look into 2021, we -- again, it's uncertain. There's going to be volatility, but we're optimistic that the pandemic comes under control in the first half and that the macroeconomic piece picks up. So we thought it was prudent to start. We'll go through a process and submit our formal capital plan to the Fed at the end of March, beginning of April. And then we'll circle back with what that amount is. And we think that's a prudent amount, right, given this is a transitional year, right, relative to the visibility and uncertainty. 
So obviously, we haven't changed our long-term view with regards to capital and where we want to get to. It's just really the pace. And so we're comfortable that this is a good place to start, and we can always revisit as we move through the year."

We believe that consumers -- and by the way, it does sit in CareCredit. So I should clarify that. Does sit in CareCredit. We believe that the everyday spend around wellness is an area where consumers are looking for rewards. 
We believe Walgreens is a great partner because we were already in there accepting the Walgreen -- the CareCredit card. So we believe this space is a real ripe opportunity because of our unique knowledge and experience in this space for over 30 years, and we really see Walgreens as a way for us to really continue to expand and differentiate ourselves in the health care business.

But we will have capital beyond that ability to grow the book.

It really does come down to the individual partner and what they're trying to achieve. And I think obviously, this is a hot topic. That's why we put a slide in the deck today just to kind of lay out in more detail how much of this business we actually do today. I don't think it's well-known that we have $15 billion of balances that are on equal pay products, both short and long term. 
And I think it really does come down to partner choice. So as I said, we sit down with each one of our partners. In some cases, they love the idea of an equal pay product because that's what the consumer wants. That's what their customer wants, but they want to put it on a revolving product. And part of the reason for that is it gives them an ongoing relationship with the customer, right? It allows them to drive the repeat usage. It allows them to do the life cycle marketing. All of those things that are really important to our partners and that, frankly, they've been trying to drive for the last 5 or 6 years. 
We always talk to you about how much reuse we get on the card. And that's a big priority for our partners is creating that lasting relationship with their customer. And then we also have some customers that, depending on their customer base and the types of products they sell, that they're actually interested in more of a short-term, closed-end installment product. And so we're able to provide that as well through SetPay, and we can do that very short term, we can do it longer term. But it really is customized for the individual partner in terms of what they're trying to achieve. 
The one thing I can tell you is we are seeing slightly higher growth rates on those installment products than we're seeing on the other products in the portfolio, which I think is good news. I mean, we absolutely have to stay ahead of that curve. It's rapidly evolving. But the product is just 1 piece of the equation. I touched on this earlier. What our partners really want to make sure we can do, and this is very different depending on the types of partners is how do we integrate into their digital point of sale. And if I look across the investments that we're making in the company, that's one of the biggest one. So it's not enough just to have the product, actually having the product is the easier part in a lot of cases. But how do you integrate seamlessly inside of all of our partners' digital assets. So how do you do that online? How do you do it in their mobile app? 
And you can imagine, given the breadth of our partner base, we have to have solutions that customize for each of those individual partners. And so it really is more about the experience than the actual product at the end of the day. Does that answer your question?"

We reprioritized certain things inside of that, that were greater short-term opportunities. So we've maintained that. So for us, we're going to continue to invest. I mean 2020 was a big year for us when you think about the investment to stand up a Venmo and a Verizon. And again, we're looking forward to a full Venmo launch here in 2021. So we've invested quite a bit. 
Walgreens comes right behind this. We continue to drive core productivity in which we're continuing the investment. And again, the way we're positioning the company for the longer term, Bill, is to look at if I'm thinking out 2025, what is an above-average ROA, and we're going to drive that efficiency ratio back down into a range where it has been more historically. But really delivers that ROA given the revenue mix and loss content that we see in that portfolio mix. That being said, we are going to find ways in order to either increase the margins of the of the portfolios or to drive incremental costs out to maintain and perhaps expand that investment technology. That is something that we want to do and we feel we need to do for the medium and long term."

So let me unpack that. The first piece, in all our modeling as we move through '20 and really '21, we've always modeled in the transition adjustment relative to CECL and, most certainly, that would come out of -- we view the capital generation in those years as we move out. This is roughly around, I think, 60 basis points. Assuming that the rule stay intact. We are continuing to, to be honest with you, engage with dialogues with our stakeholders about a form of permanent capital relief because we obviously believe that when you look at our Tier 1 plus reserves at 27%, that is very high where we are and that we believe that there should be credit, whether it sits in Tier 2 or in Tier 1 relative to CECL. 
So that's always been a factor as part of our plans and shouldn't really impact it. With regard to your second part of your question, that the improvement in the macroeconomic scenario, most certainly, we're not tied to the $1.6 billion. That's where we view it today. We're going to go through our capital planning process here in the first quarter and get our capital plan approved by the Board in March, submit it in April. And then hopefully, we'll come back to you in the second quarter with a fuller perspective. But there is a scenario where clearly we can return potential more capital. I think right now, $1.6 billion is we're sitting January 29, and a transition in a year that is a little bit uncertain, is not a bad place to start the year at. So we're going to continue to monitor the same way quarter out. We thought we weren't going to do anything until the back half of this year. So we'll continue to evaluate it, Bill."

I mean, Walmart, clearly, if you strip that out, will push the RSA higher because it operate at a lower RSA level than the company average. Absent that, there's nothing fundamental. I think what's challenging people, and I can appreciate it from an outside-in perspective is CECL has dramatically impacted the profitability of the company. And it's very difficult. We've lagged CECL, but when you don't see delinquency formation at a retail partner, it's difficult to go to them and say, ""okay, even though I haven't seen delinquencies, they're going to come at some point, here's $100 million, $200 million."" 
So that is unfortunately pushing the RSA higher here. And then when you look at credit really outperforming the loss in NIM, we have a higher RSA. I think when you look at it over time, if you look at '20 and '21 combined together, it's going to get back down the average. And most certainly, as we exit the pandemic, there's nothing structurally that they should operate at different level, ex the Walmart impact."

I think there are certainly trade-offs. And I think how you earn on these products is a little bit different. Obviously, shorter-dated promotions, you're maybe getting more merchant discount, you're getting less off of the APR of the consumer. But I wouldn't see having a material impact on our overall profitability return, longer term.

It is truly an honor and a privilege to talk to you today for the first time as the CEO of Synchrony. Building on our strong foundation, I believe Synchrony is exceptionally well positioned for this next chapter of our growth journey. There is strong momentum in the business, driven by the ongoing implementation of our strategy and the unwavering hard work and commitment of our people. While this past year has been challenging and unprecedented in many ways, we are starting to see positive signs of recovery. And we are seeing the benefits of the strategic initiatives that we accelerated in the new programs that we launched last year. I am very optimistic and excited about the opportunities ahead, and I'm honored to lead Synchrony into the future. 
And with that, I'd like to get into some of the highlights of our first quarter results. Earnings were $1 billion or $1.73 per diluted share, an increase of $1.28 over last year. The resilience of our business has been evident as we navigated the pandemic. From the underlying fundamentals of our business, including diverse programs and networks and solid underwriting to our ability to quickly adapt to meet the moment with easily integrated seamless digital solutions. We have demonstrated that our business is structured to execute even in the most challenging operating environments. 
And as we begin to emerge from this challenging period, we have seen many of our growth drivers outperformed pre pandemic levels experienced during the first quarter of last year. Importantly, purchase volume increased a strong 8% over last year, with a substantial increase in purchase volume per account of 18%. While we're seeing strong trends on purchase volume, loan receivables were down 7% to $76.9 billion, given elevated payment rates with the infusion of additional stimulus this quarter. Though average balances per account have rebounded, increasing 1% over the first quarter of last year as have new accounts, which were up 3%. 
Net interest margin was down 117 basis points to 13.98% as further stimulus continue to elevate payment rates, which lowered our receivable mix and yield. The efficiency ratio was 36.1% for the quarter. We are on track with our strategic plans to reduce our expense base, removing $210 million of expenses by the end of the year. Credit continued to perform exceedingly well with net charge-offs of 3.62% this quarter, compared to 5.36% last year. As a result of our liquidity and funding strategy in response to the COVID-19 impact on our balance sheet, deposits were down $1.9 billion or 3% versus last year. Given our excess liquidity, we have been slowing our overall deposit growth. 
Total deposits comprised 81% of our funding as our direct deposit platform remains an important funding source. Our ability to service and provide digital tools to customers makes our bank attractive to the positives, and we will continue to build out additional capabilities. 
During the quarter, we returned $328 million in capital through share repurchases of $200 million and $128 million in common stock dividends. We continue to have a solid pipeline of new opportunities across our platforms, but we are being very disciplined around risk and returns, and it is critical to ensure that our partnerships are structured with strong alignment that benefits both parties. Having said that, as we previously announced, we will not renew our partnership with the GAAP as we were not able to reach terms that made sense for our company. We expect that exiting this partnership and redeploying the capital will be EPS neutral relative to current program economics and accretive to proposed renewal terms. 
We have been on a journey to grow with partners who leverage our digital capabilities to help them drive sales and meet the rapidly changing needs of their customers. Our ability to win programs with transformational digital innovation has been demonstrated with a number of recent wins. These capabilities are also integral to the success of all of our programs as consumers are rapidly adopting technologies that enable contactless commerce and expect engagement along their digital purchase journeys. We are leveraging our vast digital assets as well as our strong data analytics capabilities to make the entire consumer experience more personalized and meaningful. We have continued to expand our digital penetration across the customer journey from apply, to buy, to servicing. Approximately 60% of our applications were done digitally during the first quarter, and we grew 14% in mobile channel applications. In retail card, 50% of our sales occurred online and approximately 65% of payments were made digitally. 
The investments we are making in digital and data analytics continue to pay off. During the quarter, we renewed 10 programs, including American Eagle, Ashley Homestore, Syco and Phillips 66. We also added 10 new programs, including Prime Healthcare, Mercy Health and Emory Healthcare, which furthers our penetration of health systems. And we are also expanding the utility of our CareCredit card. Our patient financing app is now available on the Epic app orchard. This makes CareCredit available to hundreds of health care organizations using Epic Mychart and enabling cardholders to use CareCredit to take co-pays deductibles and medical expenses not covered by insurance. Not only does this technology integration provide a way to increase the usage and acceptance of CareCredit, but also helps health services and hospital providers on efficient, financially healthy organizations by helping to improve revenue cycle management and reduce debt risk. We are excited by the prospects to support patients beyond elective care as we expand to offer payment options for non elective medical expenses in routine care. 
I'll spend a few minutes today outlining our CareCredit strategy. And providing a framework to think about the opportunities that lie ahead. Over the last several years, we've been transforming CareCredit to become a more comprehensive solution for consumer financing and payments in health care, pet care and wellness by expanding our relationships with providers, retailers, payers and pharmacies. We have unparalleled scale and depth in this space. With $9.3 billion of receivables and acceptance of approximately 250,000 enrolled provider, health and wellness retail locations. The card is used by more than 8 million cardholders. We are in more than 80% of dental offices nationwide and over 40 health care specialties, 13 of which we entered into since 2018. We see big opportunity in health systems and hospitals and have rapidly expanded our reach by launching 8 new programs in 2020, bringing our total to 13. 
With the growth in our pet vertical, we are now in over 85% of that practices and have grown pets in force by 174% since our acquisition of the Pets Best insurance business 2 years ago. A big part of our success is the engagement we have with our cardholders. Our cardholders give us high marks as we have increased our customer satisfaction score to 92% from 78% back in 2009. 
Our Net Promoter Score is nearly double the credit card industry average. And as proof of the value our cardholders place on the card, we've been able to increase our repeat sales to nearly 60%. That is a testament to the hard work that we put into creating a strong value proposition for the card and for increasing utility as we build our network, 1 office and provider at a time. And our growth numbers reflect these efforts and the position we hold in this space. Our receivables have increased 44% in 7 years, we have also increased the breadth of our business with an increase in provider locations of 41% in that time frame, and active accounts currently stand at $5.7 million, another double-digit increase in 7 years. We have built an incredible platform for growth we are in an enviable position as we chart the course forward, continuing to evolve to capture further opportunity. 
There is still tremendous opportunity to continue to unlock growth in dental, veterinary and specialty industries. We are making investments to simplify the customer and provider experience and leveraging technology to support more consumer-driven, self service capabilities. We have ample room for growth with increased penetration among our existing partners and through innovation to make it increasingly easy to engage with our network. Just recently, we acquired Allegro Credit, which has both deepened our penetration in audiology and other industries while also enabling new products and capabilities. With a steady increase in out-of-pocket health care costs and the popularity of high deductible health care plans, consumers are assuming more of the financial responsibility for their health care. This translates to a significant opportunity of more than $405 billion in out-of-pocket health expenditures in the U.S. but flexible and extended financing is only a small component of overall health care payments, so there is significant runway for growth. 
We're also expanding beyond the traditional care credit industries and capitalizing on the evolving health care landscape that has increased focus on overall wellness. We have moved beyond elective care financing and now support patients by enabling them to pay for non elective medical bills, planned procedures and routine medical care as we expand into health systems and more health care specialties. This will be enhanced by ongoing integrations with practice management software and the recent news about CareCredit becoming available through Epic app Orchard. Further, we have expanded our utility, creating more ways to access health care services by partnering with pharmacies. CareCredit is already accepted at more than 17,000 pharmacies nationwide, and we recently announced that we will become the issuer of the Walgreens co-branded credit card program in the U.S. The first such credit program in the retail health sector and expect to launch the new program in the second half of 2021. 
We are also transforming our pet business to be a more comprehensive financial solution provider and to meet the needs of pet parents throughout their pet care journey. Now more than ever, Americans are invested in their pets. With both pet ownership and cost increasing significantly over the past several years, and that trend grew even more during the pandemic. Americans spend more than $100 billion on pet expenditures. There is a large market outside of that practices with significant opportunity to provide new products, financing alternatives and services. CareCredit supports a lifetime of care for pets and with the acquisition of Pets Best Insurance, we currently offer a complementary solution with veterinary care to support pet owners with simple, flexible financial options. We continue to integrate the Pets Best Insurance offering to capitalize on the payment and customer experience synergies. We're also looking for ways to expand into other pet adjacencies through products and services and retail. By focusing on the needs of our partners and customers and bringing substantial scale and expertise, we believe we will drive loyalty to the CareCredit network and as a result, should see outsized growth in the future. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."

This is an important period of time for our company and the world as we continue to emerge from the pandemic. Our business and the actions we have taken over the past year leave us well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities which lie ahead of us. I share Brian's sentiment of appreciation on the unwavering commitment of our people, I want to thank all those involved in development, delivery and administration of vaccines to help us emerge from this imperil difficult period of time. 
I'll now provide an update on our first quarter results. The pandemic and resultant government stimulus actions have impacted several key areas of our business over the past year. However, our business mix has helped us to mitigate some impact from the pandemic as certain areas have performed very well, including digital, home related products and services, veterinary services, electronics and appliances. Performance in these areas have provided support against the overall effects of the economic downturn as we exit the first quarter, we are starting to see greater signs of economic recovery more broadly. Purchase volume increased 8% versus last year and exceeded our expectations for the quarter. From a macroeconomic perspective, we have seen consumer confidence reach a 1-year high in March, unemployment continued to improve and easing of some of the remaining local restrictions. This is evident in the increase in purchase value per account, which is up 18% over last year. 
Average active accounts were down 8%, which marks a slowing in the rate of decline, it remains impacted by the macroeconomic effects of pandemic in 2020 and uneven recovery in the first quarter. We did originate over 5 million new accounts, an increase of 3% versus first quarter 2020, which is a positive sign and reflective of improved consumer sentiment. Loan receivables declined 7%, which was worse than our expectations. The driver was higher-than-expected elevation and payment rates, which resulted primarily from the recently enacted stimulus. Interest and fees on loans were down 14% from last year, driven by the elevated payment rate in addition to lower delinquencies. Dual and co-branded cards accounted for 38% of the purchase volume in the first quarter and increased 6% from the prior year. Our loan receivable basis they account for 23% of the portfolio and declined 10% from the prior year. 
Overall, we saw positive momentum in several of our growth metrics this quarter, the higher payment rates is impacting loan receivable growth. However, we're still cautious about the state of the pandemic with the recent rise in confirmed cases we are encouraged by the progress made with the national rollout of a vaccine and lifting some of the remaining restrictions. We remain optimistic of the positive momentum and continued improvement as we progress through 2021. RSAs increased $63 million or 7% from last year. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables was 5.1% for the quarter. This was elevated from the historical average, primarily due to the significant improvement in net charge-offs. We reduced our loan loss reserves this quarter due to an improved macroeconomic outlet, combined with the decline in loan receivables. This, coupled with lower net charge-offs, resulted in a significant decrease in the provision for credit losses of $1.3 billion or 80% from last year. 
Other income increased $34 million, mainly due to investment income. Other expense decreased $70 million or 7% from last year due to lower operational losses and lower marketing costs, partially offset by an increase in employee costs. 
Moving to our platform results on Slide 9. Our sales platforms continue to be impacted in varying degrees due to the pandemic restrictions and elevated payment rates. Their trajectories have been different based on factors such as business and partner mix, digital concentration, provider access and availability of hard line goods. We have seen broad-based momentum in purchase volume as consumers become increasingly confident as we begin to exit the pandemic. In retail card, loan receivables declined 9% but showed momentum with purchase volume increasing 11% versus last year. Average active accounts were down 7% and interest and fees were down 16% due to the impact from the pandemic. We're excited with our new American Eagle program and continue to see significant opportunity with our recently launched programs with Verizon and Venmo as those programs begin to build. 
The strength of our powersports and home and specialty and payment solutions continue to help offset some of the impact from pandemic shutdowns and higher payment rates. During the quarter, loan receivables declined 1%, and average active accounts were down 9%, interest and fees were down 11%, which was driven primarily by lower late fees, finance charges and merchant discount, all the result of the reduction in loan receivables. We did see positive momentum in purchase volume, which was up 3% over last year. Our focus on growing this platform resulted in several new programs being signed and renewing key partnerships, including Ashley Home Furniture during the quarter. We continue to drive organic growth through our partnerships and networks added over 3,900 new merchants during the quarter. We also continue to drive higher card reuse, which now stands at approximately 34% of purchase volume, excluding oil and gas. Although CareCredit sustained the largest overall impact from the pandemic restrictions, improvement in this platform has continued into 2021 as providers have increased elective and planned services from the trough in the second quarter of last year. This improvement is evident in our purchase volume being flat to last year. Loan receivables were down 8% this quarter and drove a decrease in interest and fees on loans of 7% as we recorded lower late fees and merchant discounts. 
During the quarter, we continue to grow our CareCredit network and enhance the utility of our card. The expansion of our network and acceptance strategies helped us drive the reuse rate to 59% of purchase volume in the first quarter. This is a powerful growth platform for our business, we remain excited about the opportunities to drive future growth as the impact of the pandemic subsides. 
I'll move to Slide 10 and cover our net interest income and margin trends. During the quarter, recently enacted stimulus contributed to an elevation of payment rates, which were up about 2 percentage points on average compared to the average payment rates we experienced pre pandemic. The difference was as high as 3.5 percentage points in March when the most recent stimulus plan was enacted. This has resulted in a reduction in loan receivables, which has had an impact on net interest income and net interest margin in the first quarter. Net interest income decreased 12% from last year, driven by lower finance charges and lease fees. The net interest margin was 13.98% compared to last year's margin of 15.15%, largely driven by the impact of the pandemic on loan receivables and increase in liquidity and lower benchmark rates. Specifically, the loan receivables yield of 19.32% was down 135 basis points versus last year, was the primary driver of 117 basis point reduction in our net interest margin. The mix of loan receivables as a percent of total earning assets declined over 3 percentage points from 81.7% and to 78.6%, driven by the higher liquidity held during the quarter. This accounted for 61 basis points of the net interest margin decline. The liquidity yield declined as a result of lower benchmark rates and accounted for 23 basis points reduction in our net interest margin. These impacts were partially offset by a 93 basis point decrease in the total interest-bearing liabilities cost to 1.57%, primarily due to lower benchmark rates. This provided a 78 basis point increase in our net interest margin. We continue to believe that in the second half of the year, excess liquidity will begin to be deployed into asset growth and slowing payer rates should result in higher interest and fee yields, leading to increasing net interest margin. 
Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 11. In terms of specific dynamics for the quarter, I'll start with delinquency trends. Our 30-plus delinquency rate was 2.83% compared to 4.24% last year. Our 90-plus delinquency rate was 1.52%, compared to 2.10% last year. Higher payment rates continue to drive delinquency improvements. Focusing on net charge-off trends. Our net charge-off rate was 3.62% compared to 5.36% last year. Our reduction in net charge-off rate was primarily driven by the improving delinquency trends as customer payment behavior improved over the last several quarters. Our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 12.88%. 
Moving to Slide 12, I'll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall expenses were down $70 million or 7% from last year to $932 million as we continue to execute on our strategic plan to reduce costs. Specifically, the decrease was driven by lower operational losses and lower marketing and business development costs, partially offset by higher employee costs. The efficiency ratio for the first quarter was 36.1%, compared to 32.7% last year. The ratio was negatively impacted by lower revenue that resulted from lower receivables and lower interest and fee yield, which was partially offset by a reduction in expenses. 
Moving to Slide 13. Given the reduction in our loan receivables and strengthen our deposit platform, we continue to carry a higher level of liquidity while we believe it's prudent to maintain a higher liquidity level during uncertain and volatile periods, we are actively managing our funding profile to mitigate excess liquidity where appropriate. As a result of this strategy, there is a shift in the mix of our funding during the quarter. Our deposits declined by $1.9 billion from last year. Our securitized and unsecured funding sources declined by $2.1 billion. This resulted in deposits being 81% of our funding, compared to 79% last year, with securitized funding comprising 9% and unsecured funding comprising 10% of our funding sources at quarter end. 
Total liquidity, including undrawn credit facilities, was $28 billion, which equated to 29.2% of our total assets, up from 25.3% last year. Before I provide details on our capital position, it should be noted that we elected to take the benefit of the transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies, which has 2 primary benefits. First, it delays the effect of the CECL transition adjustment for an incremental 2 years; and second, it allows for proportionately current period provisioning to be deferred and amortized with the transition adjustment. With this framework, we ended the quarter at 17.4% CET1 under the CECL transition rules, 310 basis points above last year's level of 14.3%. 
The Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.3% under the CECL transition rules, compared to 15.2% last year. The total capital ratio increased 320 basis points to 19.7%. And the Tier 1 capital plus reserves ratio on a fully phased-in basis increased to 28.7%, compared to 24.1% last year, reflecting the increase in the reserves as a result of implementing CECL. 
During the quarter, we returned $328 million to shareholders, which included $200 million in share repurchases and paid a common stock dividend of $0.22 per share. Given the continued uncertainty in the operating environment, I thought it would be helpful to provide color on our current view on the key earnings drivers for 2021, which we've laid out on Slide 14. Our views assume that the pressure from the pandemic and a slower economic recovery continues into the second quarter, with the second half seeing the pandemic largely under control and the acceleration of the economic recovery. First quarter purchase volume was stronger than we anticipated as we entered the year as local restrictions are lifted, with consumer confidence improving, so to consumers' willingness to spend. We currently believe these trends will hold and purchase volume will continue to recover across our platforms. In the second quarter, we will be comparing against a period of widespread shutdowns. In the second half, we anticipate improving growth trends as the pandemic impact moderates and macroeconomic growth accelerates. 
Regarding loan receivable growth. We expect that stimulus will continue to have an impact on payment rates and therefore, loan receive was into the next quarter. In the second half of 2021, we assume payment rates will moderate as the effects of the stimulus abates and will return to more normalized consumer payment behavior patterns. Combining this with the expected increase in purchase volume from an improving macroeconomic environment, this should contribute to loan receivable growth. For net interest margin, we expect the higher parent rates will continue to pressure loan receivables and generate excess liquidity, impacting interest and fee yield and asset mix. We continue to believe that excess liquidity will be reduced through asset growth and slowing payment rates in the second half of the year, which will drive improving interest and fee yields and asset mix leading to increasing net interest margin. 
With respect to credit, delinquencies are expect to increase from their current levels, but we now believe the peak will grow later than we anticipated, likely in early 2022. While current delinquencies will result in lower net charge-offs in the second quarter, we expect net charge-offs to rise resulting from the increases in delinquencies as we move through 2021. Given the magnitude of stimulus that was deployed during the pandemic, we believe the overall loss curve will be flatter than we initially thought, but it remains volatile and difficult to forecast into the effects of the stimulus and industry forbearance has abated. We expect reserves to be largely driven by asset growth, impact from any changes in credit and in our macroeconomic assumptions and certain combinations of these factors could result in further reserve releases this year. We expect RSAs to remain elevated into the second quarter primarily reflecting strong program performance, including an improvement in net charge-offs, partially offset by lower revenue. In the second half of the year, we continue to expect lower RSAs generally, reflecting higher net charge-offs partially offset by higher revenue. 
As we outlined previously, we've implemented cost reductions across the organization, and I'm pleased to report that we are on a pace to achieve our expense savings target of $210 million for the full year. Partially offsetting these cost reductions will be the expense increases relate growth in addition to anticipated increase in delinquency accounts. We will continue to closely monitor how the pandemic develops and its impact to the macroeconomic environment. At the foundation is our belief that we position ourselves well for the opportunities that will develop as the economic recovery takes from the hold. Further, we've made the investments to support our partners as they've been required to rapidly transform their businesses to meet the new digital realities. And we'll continue to make investments in our people, products, technology and platforms to drive long-term value and continue to ensure the safety of our employees while meeting the needs of our partners, merchants, providers and shareholders. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Brian for his final thoughts."

I'll provide a quick overview of key themes for the quarter and then turn it over so we can begin Q&A. Clearly, the pandemic has had significant impacts and has, in many ways, changed the way we do business. This quarter made it evidence that we are beginning to emerge on the other side of this period. Consumer sentiment has improved, the unemployment rate has dropped and U.S. retail posted the largest gain in 10 months. 
Our business is showing its resilience as growth has accelerated with purchase volume up 8% and 5 million new accounts opened this quarter. And although these solid growth metrics were tamped down by higher payment rates, which impacted loan receivables and NIM, these are headwinds that we anticipate will soon abate. Credit performance has continued to outperform and we continue to expand our CareCredit network, delivering new products, financing alternatives and experiences with a focus on overall wellness and pet. The bottom line is that we demonstrated that we were able to rapidly adapt to operate in a new environment while continuing to keep our eye on the long term, positioning ourselves well for the future. And in my opinion, we have never been in a stronger position. 
I'll now turn the call back to Jennifer to open the Q&A."

We saw the cash flow really start back in mid-March around the fourth. So on stimulus hard started to hit. So from there, we continue to see elevated payments, they are starting to trend down a little bit now as we get into the latter part of April. Obviously, we have a converging factor with tax returns. So stimulus clearly is the number 1 factor. When you think about the late field, if you went back and looked at our number of delinquent accounts, they're down over 30% from the '19 period, so pre pandemic. So so again, as you think about a rising net charge-off or even just a return to normalcy when you think about the charge-off environment. That late fee yield will come back into the book. And come in advance of when the charge-offs actually hit. So we would expect to see that yield begin to increase in the back half of the year. 
What I'd say, Moshe, as a lot of people focus on the margin of the business, we're at 14% today. We've kind of guided people to, call it, the 16% range in a normalized environment. If you break down the components of that for a second, the first piece is really the excess liquidity, which I started with, with the stimulus factors, right? So if you went back and looked at excess liquidity pre pandemic applied that to the book today, you'll probably pick up about 90 basis points on net interest margin from there. We previously talked about there's probably 25 or so basis points, 30 basis points in the benchmark rates, which we'll see how prime comes. And the residual amount, right, which is the mainly lately fee yield and interest yield we'll come back into the book and that will arise. So I think you can see a trajectory where this begins to accelerate in the back half of the year and begins to approach normalcy for us as we move into '22."

I think we would certainly expect that number to continue to grow. We're not in a fully open economy right now. As you know, I think there's -- look, there's a lot of reasons to be bullish when you look at the consumer, you look at the trends on jobs, unemployment back to 6%. I think consumer balance sheets are strong, they're starting to spend again. I think the fact that we saw 8% purchase volume growth and 11% of retail card is a really positive indicator. But that's not where it should be in a fully functioning open economy. And so I think there's still room across all the growth metrics to go further from here. We're still in the early innings in terms of a recovery. But most of the trends that we're seeing are pretty positive. 
The fact that we grew purchase volumes per account up 18% is a really good indicator that consumers are spending again. And I do think that will turn into more revolving behavior over time. I mean, the effects of the stimulus as Brian said they're going to wane over time. I think you're going to start to see that pretty soon as the confidence gets better, you tend to see consumers take on more debt and revolve a little bit more, which will help on balances and margins as well."

But we saw strength across each of the months in the quarter. So it outperformed what our expectations are. And as I think about loan growth, I think you probably will see an inflection point here in the second quarter, an acceleration into the back part of the year. So I do think you'll see positivity comes through the portfolio. And again, we have the tailwinds that are still existed in the CareCredit platform, right, as you have dental and planned services opening up and you still have the supply chain issues in the payment solutions platform.

So obviously, in the first quarter, we repurchased $200 million of shares in the quarter, that was part of the $1.6 billion we announced in the early part of January. And just to put that frame of reference, obviously, when we went to the Board and discussed with the Board, that authorization, that was in the December time frame off the models. As we move through the quarter, clearly, we have more information. We've updated our scenarios. We submitted our capital plan to the Fed in March and look forward to their feedback later this quarter. So obviously, we'll see what the results of that come back, but we're optimistic with regard to their support for our capital plan. It's not lost on us that we have the excess capital, Ryan, in the second quarter will again be subject to the limitations by the Fed, which will cap us out around $390 million for the current quarter with regard to the amount of repurchases that we can do. I would make the presumption we will be depending upon market conditions at that maximum. And then we'll be back to you and talk about the capital plan that we submitted back to the Fed. 
That being said, to the extent that the income profile of the business changes, we have not in that capital plan, dealt anything with GAAP and if that portfolio conveys that we would potentially revisit that and go back to the Fed if it's warranted. So we'll continue those discussions and dialogues with the Board and most certainly with our regulators. So there is an opportunity. 
With regard to your cadence question, clearly, we want to get back to our long-term, our long-term goal of being in line with peers, and we'll do that as prudently as possible. But obviously, we want to do it with support of all our constituents. They're not barriers to doing it. We just want to do it in a prudent fashion. And most certainly, we're not totally done with the pandemic care, but we'll move as prudently as possible to execute that."

With regard to the first part of your question, with regard to those targets. I mean, we talk about peer targets, so you think about the cap ones of discovers down in that 11 to 12, maybe 10.5 range. We'll see how the portfolio develops. We're optimistic we can get there in a reasonable period of time. I think if you go back we exited GE with 18%. We made it down to 14% before the pandemic hit. And we think we can get back in a fairly reasonable period of time. And if you remember right before the pandemic hit, we were on a path to execute a $3.6 billion capital plan. We're $3.3 billion into it. So we think we can employ it fairly rapidly once we feel comfortable."

I think look, CareCredit, I think, is probably the most exciting growth opportunity that we've got in the company today. And we try to lay that out for you in a couple of slides. I think first, just going after a market of this size that's growing as fast as it is. Obviously, health care costs are rising, high deductible plans are increasing in popularity. So less and less is being covered by insurance, and that's really where CareCredit comes in. We're a big player in the space today, but financing options in this space is still a very small fraction of the potential spend that's out there. So there is just a ton of room for growth. And I think about the growth in really 3 components. One is growing the core. We're in CareCredit accepting about 250,000 locations today. We're in 40 different specialties. We just entered into 10 new specialties just over the last 2 years. And we're in 80% at dental offices, 85% of that. So we've got a lot of scale. But with that said, there's still a lot of room to grow penetration inside of those providers because third-party financing options is still a relatively small percentage. So a lot of room for growth there. 
And then we talked a little bit about both health systems. We're in 13 large health systems today. That's a growing part of our business. We're paired up with big players like Kaiser Permanente, Cleveland Clinic, and then we talked about pets as really that third leg of the strategy. We're seeing just unbelievable growth in our pet insurance business that we bought a couple of years ago, up 174% since we bought it. So just a lot to be excited about. And then you touched on Walgreens. We had -- our CareCredit cards were accepted at Walgreens. We expanded that relationship to launch a new program and I think similar to Venmo and Verizon, this can be a top 10 program for us. And we're tapping into 90 million my Walgreens customers. So the opportunity is just huge. And we're actively working to get that launched in the second half of the year."

We reduced the number of proactive credit line increases. We reduced the number of invitation to apply and prescreen type offers on new accounts. 
As we move through into 2021, what we started to do in places where we obviously have known customers, we've begun to unwind a lot of those credit refinement. So we are shifting the cutoffs of more people will get a dual card, which would be a slightly higher line, but most certainly stimulate some spend in the world. We have begun a number of credit line increase type programs, which are customers that we've known and seeing credit behavior and payment behavior patterns. And then we've also begun to upgrade accounts from private label to dual card that would have qualified for dual card a year ago. So we're doing a number of things proactively. We just have not touched at the point of acquisition, changed any cutoffs, things like that. But again, we didn't do a lot of that last year. So I don't really expect us to do a lot of it changes now, but we have begun proactive increases. And the good news is, given our portfolio, we're able to do that with customers we know, and we're not taking incremental risk in our eyes."

I feel like some of that shift was certainly permanent, and we'll stay and we'll benefit there as well. So look, if you look across the portfolio, the 1 thing that I think about quite a bit. And we hear this from all of our partners, including all the providers in CareCredit, is there is a real pent-up demand, right, for pretty much everything. This pent-up desire to spend and get back to normal. We're talking to our providers in CareCredit, and they can't keep up with the appointments. Because so many people over the last year, they postponed things that weren't critical, they didn't want to go into the practices. And now you're seeing all of that start to flush through. So I think regardless of the category, there's a ton of pent-up desire to spend. And I think if if travel and entertainment dining, those things come back.

And I do think it does depend a little bit on the size of the ticket. I mean if somebody is getting braces for their kids, that's a big ticket item. They typically don't want to tie up their general purpose card utility with that purchase, and that's where CareCredit comes in. And that can be done on an equal pay installment loan, it can be done on a promotional financing product and and we tend to see really good revolve rates there as well."

We're going to have something to market with a couple of partners later this year. Just to take a step back more broadly, our strategy is really to provide a full suite of products. We have such a diverse array of partners that we really can't have a 1 size fits all strategy. We've got to be able to offer revolving products, short-dated installment, longer-term installment, equal pay products, buy now pay later products. And we want to do that in a way that we can bring that full suite of products to our partners and basically allow them to choose which products are best for their customers based on not only their customer, but what types of products are they selling. So not surprisingly, bigger ticket items tend to steer more towards a longer-term installment, that can be on a revolving product or closed end. And then smaller ticket, it tends to be shorter term, either through a product like Setpay or a Pay n 4 type product. So that's really the strategy to provide that comprehensive suite of products and then take that to our partners and really allow them to select from that menu in terms of what meets their customer needs-based on the products that they're selling in their strategy."

You're actually getting -- you're seeing the promotional financing offer so that, that becomes kind of part of how you're thinking about your treatment. So it's not once you actually get to your appointment, that you become aware of it, you can actually go through the whole process well in advance of your appointment and think about how you're going to pay for whether it's braces or whatever your treatment is going to be. And we found that to be really successful. So we've been building that brand awareness over time. It originated largely inside of the provider's office, but has certainly expanded to be more digital in nature through direct marketing and other channels."

So we're in line with those. It's not really products oriented. Well, certainly, for us, as we have those conversations really demonstrate to them the resiliency of this business and this customer because of the point of origination, we actually get stronger yields and risk-adjusted returns off. And again, when you combine that with the RSA buffer, it provides particular strength when it comes to having a lower capital ratio. Those are the conversations we're having with them."

But when we think of GAAP, when we think about all the various factors of the size of your loan book, how do you think about the long-term efficiency of the business moving forward over the next few years? Is there some pressure on efficiency until you get back to maybe your more traditional average loan book size? And is there some dynamics between the credit, CareCredit and the retail card there?

So I think the way to think about efficiency is when we went through last year, we underwent a strategic outlook. That said, if I look out to 2025, think about the mix of business I'm going to have think about trying to be a top ROA profile company. And I look at the revenue characteristics, the lost content characteristics, the RSA characteristics. What is my expense and efficiency ratio have to be in order to be a top-tier ROA and ahead of all of our peers to really generate that investment thesis. We then rolled that back into the plans that we put in place in the latter part of 2020. So I think we've engaged upon that, part of that is delivering over $210 million of benefit this year from a cost-out perspective. I think the greater pressure on the efficiency ratio in the short term, to be honest with you, is the revenue headwind that we have with the net interest margin and NII have been a little bit impacted or being impacted by stimulus and really terrific credit and life impact that comes from that. That's a little bit of headwind. I do think you're going to see this. This business model, right? We were built off a foundation of running expenses at a very manageable level given the loan balance size. I think as you see CareCredit's other business grow, you should be able to get operating leverage because they run at higher average balances. If you think about the bigger ticket size associated with those accounts. And then what can't be lost is the fact that we don't have to spend as much on marketing as our peers relative to generate those new accounts. So we are industry probably best or very attractive cost to acquire customers, which really puts us at a competitive advantage versus our peers. So we will tightly tightly manage the efficiency. And while we're doing this, we're going to continue to invest in the future of the digital assets that we put in play over the last several years, we're going to continue to invest for our long-term future. So it's a combination of investing and really having a business model set of partners where we can leverage it and generate that operating efficiency. As we probably grow above-average with peers and have a higher return than average peers is how I would think about Dominick."

It is truly an honor and a privilege to talk to you today for the first time as the CEO of Synchrony. Building on our strong foundation, I believe Synchrony is exceptionally well positioned for this next chapter of our growth journey. There is strong momentum in the business, driven by the ongoing implementation of our strategy and the unwavering hard work and commitment of our people. 
While this past year has been challenging and unprecedented in many ways, we are starting to see positive signs of recovery. And we are seeing the benefits of the strategic initiatives that we accelerated in the new programs that we launched last year. I am very optimistic and excited about the opportunities ahead, and I'm honored to lead Synchrony into the future.  
And with that, I'd like to get into some of the highlights of our first quarter results. Earnings were $1 billion or $1.73 per diluted share, an increase of $1.28 over last year. The resilience of our business has been evident as we navigated the pandemic. From the underlying fundamentals of our business, including diverse programs and networks and solid underwriting to our ability to quickly adapt to meet the moment with easily integrated seamless digital solutions, we have demonstrated that our business is structured to execute even in the most challenging operating environments.  
And as we begin to emerge from this challenging period, we have seen many of our growth drivers outperformed pre-pandemic levels experienced during the first quarter of last year. Importantly, purchase volume increased a strong 8% over last year, with a substantial increase in purchase volume per account of 18%. While we're seeing strong trends on purchase volume, loan receivables were down 7% to $76.9 billion, given elevated payment rates with the infusion of additional stimulus this quarter, though average balances per account have rebounded, increasing 1% over the first quarter of last year as have new accounts, which were up 3%.  
Net interest margin was down 117 basis points to 13.98% as further stimulus continue to elevate payment rates, which lowered our receivable mix and yield. The efficiency ratio was 36.1% for the quarter. We are on track with our strategic plans to reduce our expense base, removing $210 million of expenses by the end of the year. 
Credit continued to perform exceedingly well with net charge-offs of 3.62% this quarter, compared to 5.36% last year. As a result of our liquidity and funding strategy in response to the COVID-19 impact on our balance sheet, deposits were down $1.9 billion or 3% versus last year. Given our excess liquidity, we have been slowing our overall deposit growth. Total deposits comprised 81% of our funding as our direct deposit platform remains an important funding source. Our ability to service and provide digital tools to customers makes our bank attractive to depositors, and we will continue to build out additional capabilities.  
During the quarter, we returned $328 million in capital through share repurchases of $200 million and $128 million in common stock dividends. We continue to have a solid pipeline of new opportunities across our platforms, but we are being very disciplined around risk and returns, and it is critical to ensure that our partnerships are structured with strong alignment that benefits both parties. Having said that, as we previously announced, we will not renew our partnership with the GAAP as we were not able to reach terms that made sense for our company. We expect that exiting this partnership and redeploying the capital will be EPS neutral relative to current program economics and accretive to proposed renewal terms.  
We have been on a journey to grow with partners who leverage our digital capabilities to help them drive sales and meet the rapidly changing needs of their customers. Our ability to win programs with transformational digital innovation has been demonstrated with a number of recent wins. These capabilities are also integral to the success of all of our programs as consumers are rapidly adopting technologies that enable contactless commerce and expect engagement along their digital purchase journeys. We are leveraging our vast digital assets as well as our strong data analytics capabilities to make the entire consumer experience more personalized and meaningful. 
We have continued to expand our digital penetration across the customer journey from apply, to buy, to servicing. Approximately 60% of our applications were done digitally during the first quarter, and we grew 14% in mobile channel applications. In retail card, 50% of our sales occurred online and approximately 65% of payments were made digitally.  
The investments we are making in digital and data analytics continue to pay off. During the quarter, we renewed 10 programs, including American Eagle, Ashley Homestore, CITGO and Phillips 66. We also added 10 new programs, including Prime Healthcare, Mercy Health and Emory Healthcare, which furthers our penetration of health systems. And we are also expanding the utility of our CareCredit card. Our patient financing app is now available on the Epic's App Orchard. This makes CareCredit available to hundreds of health care organizations using Epic's MyChart and enabling cardholders to use CareCredit to take co-pays, deductibles and medical expenses not covered by insurance. Not only does this technology integration provide a way to increase the usage and acceptance of CareCredit, but also helps health services and hospital providers to run efficient, financially healthy organizations by helping to improve revenue cycle management and reduce debt risk. We are excited by the prospects to support patients beyond elective care as we expand to offer payment options for nonelective medical expenses and routine care.  
I'll spend a few minutes today outlining our CareCredit strategy and providing a framework to think about the opportunities that lie ahead. Over the last several years, we've been transforming CareCredit to become a more comprehensive solution for consumer financing and payments in health care, pet care and wellness by expanding our relationships with providers, retailers, payers and pharmacies. We have unparalleled scale and depth in this space. With $9.3 billion of receivables and acceptance of approximately 250,000 enrolled provider, health and wellness retail locations. The card is used by more than 8 million cardholders. We are in more than 80% of dental offices nationwide and over 40 health care specialties, 13 of which we entered into since 2018. We see big opportunity in health systems and hospitals and have rapidly expanded our reach by launching 8 new programs in 2020, bringing our total to 13.  
With the growth in our pet vertical, we are now in over 85% of vet practices and have grown pets in force by 174% since our acquisition of the Pets Best insurance business 2 years ago. 
A big part of our success is the engagement we have with our cardholders. Our cardholders give us high marks as we have increased our customer satisfaction score to 92% from 78% back in 2009. Our Net Promoter Score is nearly double the credit card industry average. And as proof of the value our cardholders place on the card, we've been able to increase our repeat sales to nearly 60%. That is a testament to the hard work that we put into creating a strong value proposition for the card and for increasing utility as we build our network, 1 office and provider at a time. And our growth numbers reflect these efforts and the position we hold in this space. Our receivables have increased 44% in 7 years. We have also increased the breadth of our business with an increase in provider locations of 41% in that time frame, and active accounts currently stand at 5.7 million, another double-digit increase in 7 years. We have built an incredible platform for growth and we are in an enviable position as we chart the course forward, continuing to evolve to capture further opportunity.  
There is still tremendous opportunity to continue to unlock growth in dental, veterinary and specialty industries. We are making investments to simplify the customer and provider experience and leveraging technology to support more consumer-driven, self-service capabilities. We have ample room for growth with increased penetration among our existing partners and through innovation to make it increasingly easy to engage with our network. Just recently, we acquired Allegro Credit, which has both deepened our penetration in audiology and other industries while also enabling new products and capabilities. 
With a steady increase in out-of-pocket health care costs and the popularity of high deductible health care plans, consumers are assuming more of the financial responsibility for their health care. This translates to a significant opportunity of more than $405 billion in out-of-pocket health expenditures in the U.S. but flexible and extended financing is only a small component of overall health care payments, so there is significant runway for growth.  
We're also expanding beyond the traditional care credit industries and capitalizing on the evolving health care landscape that has increased focus on overall wellness. We have moved beyond elective care financing and now support patients by enabling them to pay for nonelective medical bills, planned procedures and routine medical care as we expand into health systems and more health care specialties. This will be enhanced by ongoing integrations with practice management software and the recent news about CareCredit becoming available through Epic's App Orchard. 
Further, we have expanded our utility, creating more ways to access health care services by partnering with pharmacies. CareCredit is already accepted at more than 17,000 pharmacies nationwide, and we recently announced that we will become the issuer of the Walgreens co-branded credit card program in the U.S., the first such credit program in the retail health sector, and expect to launch the new program in the second half of 2021.  
We are also transforming our pet business to be a more comprehensive financial solution provider and to meet the needs of pet parents throughout their pet care journey. Now more than ever, Americans are invested in their pets. With both pet ownership and cost increasing significantly over the past several years and that trend grew even more during the pandemic, Americans spend more than $100 billion on pet expenditures. There is a large market outside of that practices with significant opportunity to provide new products, financing alternatives and services. 
CareCredit supports a lifetime of care for pets and with the acquisition of Pets Best insurance, we currently offer a complementary solution with veterinary care to support pet owners with simple, flexible financial options. We continue to integrate the Pets Best insurance offering to capitalize on the payment and customer experience synergies. We're also looking for ways to expand into other pet adjacencies through products and services in retail. 
By focusing on the needs of our partners and customers and bringing substantial scale and expertise, we believe we will drive loyalty to the CareCredit network and as a result, should see outsized growth in the future.  
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."

This is an important period of time for our company and the world as we continue to emerge from the pandemic. Our business and the actions we have taken over the past year leave us well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities which lie ahead of us. I share Brian's sentiment of appreciation on the unwavering commitment of our people. I want to thank all those involved in development, delivery and administration of vaccines to help us emerge from this highly difficult period of time.  
I'll now provide an update on our first quarter results. The pandemic and resultant government stimulus actions have impacted several key areas of our business over the past year. However, our business mix has helped us to mitigate some impact from the pandemic as certain areas have performed very well, including digital, home-related products and services, veterinary services, electronics and appliances. Performance in these areas have provided support against the overall effects of the economic downturn. As we exit the first quarter, we are starting to see greater signs of economic recovery more broadly. 
Purchase volume increased 8% versus last year and exceeded our expectations for the quarter. From a macroeconomic perspective, we have seen consumer confidence reach a 1-year high in March, unemployment continued to improve and easing of some of the remaining local restrictions. This is evident in the increase in purchase volume per account, which is up 18% over last year. Average active accounts were down 8%, which marks a slowing in the rate of decline that remains impacted by the macroeconomic effects of the pandemic in 2020 and uneven recovery in the first quarter. 
We did originate over 5 million new accounts, an increase of 3% versus first quarter 2020, which is a positive sign and reflective of improved consumer sentiment. Loan receivables declined 7%, which was worse than our expectations. The driver was higher-than-expected elevation in payment rates, which resulted primarily from the recently enacted stimulus.
 Interest and fees on loans were down 14% from last year, driven by the elevated payment rate in addition to lower delinquencies. Dual and co-branded cards accounted for 38% of the purchase volume in the first quarter and increased 6% than the prior year. On loan receivable basis, they accounted for 23% of the portfolio and declined 10% from the prior year.  
Overall, we saw positive momentum in several of our growth metrics this quarter, the higher payment rates is impacting loan receivable growth. However, we're still cautious about the state of the pandemic with the recent rise of confirmed cases. We are encouraged by the progress made with the national rollout of the vaccine and lifting of some of the remaining restrictions. We remain optimistic of the positive momentum and continued improvement as we progress through 2021. 
RSAs increased $63 million or 7% from last year. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables was 5.1% for the quarter. This was elevated from the historical average, primarily due to the significant improvement in net charge-offs. We reduced our loan loss reserves this quarter due to an improved macroeconomic outlook, combined with the decline in loan receivables. This, coupled with lower net charge-offs, resulted in significant decrease in the provision for credit losses of $1.3 billion or 80% from last year.  
Other income increased $34 million, mainly due to investment income. Other expense decreased $70 million or 7% from last year due to lower operational losses and lower marketing costs, partially offset by an increase in employee costs.  
Moving to our platform results on Slide 9. Our sales platforms continue to be impacted in varying degrees due to the pandemic restrictions and elevated payment rates. Their trajectories have been different based on factors such as business and partner mix, digital concentration, provider access and availability of hard line goods. We have seen broad-based momentum in purchase volume as consumers become increasingly confident as we begin to exit the pandemic. In retail card, loan receivables declined 9% but showed momentum with purchase volume increasing 11% versus last year. Average active accounts were down 7% and interest and fees were down 16% due to the impact from the pandemic. 
We're excited with our new American Eagle program and continue to see significant opportunity with our recently launched programs with Verizon and Venmo as those programs begin to build. The strength of our powersports and home and specialty and payment solutions continue to help offset some of the impact from pandemic shutdowns and higher payment rates. During the quarter, loan receivables declined 1%, and average active accounts were down 9%; interest and fees were down 11%, which was driven primarily by lower late fees, finance charges and merchant discount, all the result of the reduction in loan receivables. We did see positive momentum in purchase volume, which was up 3% over last year. 
Our focus on growing this platform resulted in several new programs being signed and renewing key partnerships, including Ashley Home Furniture during the quarter. We continue to drive organic growth through our partnerships and networks and added over 3,900 new merchants during the quarter. We also continue to drive higher card reuse, which now stands at approximately 34% of purchase volume, excluding oil and gas. Although CareCredit sustained the largest overall impact from the pandemic restrictions, improvement in this platform has continued into 2021 as providers have increased elective and planned services from the trough in the second quarter of last year. This improvement is evident in our purchase volume being flat to last year. Loan receivables were down 8% this quarter and drove a decrease in interest and fees on loans of 7% as we recorded lower late fees and merchant discounts.  
During the quarter, we continue to grow our CareCredit network and enhance the utility of our card. The expansion of our network and acceptance strategies helped us drive the reuse rate to 59% of purchase volume in the first quarter. This is a powerful growth platform for our business, and we remain excited about the opportunities to drive future growth as the impact from the pandemic subsides.  
I'll move to Slide 10 and cover our net interest income and margin trends. During the quarter, recently enacted stimulus contributed to an elevation of payment rates, which were up about 2 percentage points on average compared to the average payment rates we experienced pre pandemic. The difference was as high as 3.5 percentage points in March when the most recent stimulus plan was enacted. This has resulted in a reduction in loan receivables, which has had an impact on net interest income and net interest margin in the first quarter. 
Net interest income decreased 12% from last year, driven by lower finance charges and lease fees. The net interest margin was 13.98% compared to last year's margin of 15.15%, largely driven by the impact of the pandemic on loan receivables and increase in liquidity and lower benchmark rates. Specifically, the loan receivables yield of 19.32% was down 135 basis points versus last year and was the primary driver of 117 basis point reduction in our net interest margin. The mix of loan receivables as a percent of total earning assets declined over 3 percentage points from 81.7% and to 78.6%, driven by the higher liquidity held during the quarter. This accounted for 61 basis points of the net interest margin decline. 
The liquidity yield declined as a result of lower benchmark rates and accounted for 23 basis points reduction in our net interest margin. These impacts were partially offset by a 93 basis point decrease in the total interest-bearing liabilities cost to 1.57%, primarily due to lower benchmark rates. This provided a 78 basis point increase in our net interest margin. We continue to believe that in the second half of the year, excess liquidity will begin to be deployed into asset growth and slowing payment rates should result in higher interest and fee yields, leading to increasing net interest margin.  
Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 11. In terms of specific dynamics for the quarter, I'll start with delinquency trends. Our 30-plus delinquency rate was 2.83% compared to 4.24% last year. Our 90-plus delinquency rate was 1.52%, compared to 2.10% last year. Higher payment rates continue to drive delinquency improvements. Focusing on net charge-off trends. Our net charge-off rate was 3.62% compared to 5.36% last year. Our reduction in net charge-off rate was primarily driven by the improving delinquency trends as customer payment behavior improved over the last several quarters. Our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 12.88%.  
Moving to Slide 12, I'll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall, expenses were down $70 million or 7% from last year to $932 million as we continue to execute on our strategic plan to reduce costs. Specifically, the decrease was driven by lower operational losses and lower marketing and business development costs, partially offset by higher employee costs. The efficiency ratio for the first quarter was 36.1%, compared to 32.7% last year. The ratio was negatively impacted by lower revenue that resulted from lower receivables and lower interest and fee yield, which was partially offset by a reduction in expenses.  
Moving to Slide 13. Given the reduction in our loan receivables and strength in our deposit platform, we continue to carry a higher level of liquidity. While we believe it's prudent to maintain a higher liquidity level during uncertain and volatile periods, we are actively managing our funding profile to mitigate excess liquidity where appropriate. As a result of this strategy, there is a shift in the mix of our funding during the quarter. Our deposits declined by $1.9 billion from last year. Our securitized and unsecured funding sources declined by $2.1 billion. This resulted in deposits being 81% of our funding, compared to 79% last year, with securitized funding comprising 9% and unsecured funding comprising 10% of our funding sources at quarter end. Total liquidity, including undrawn credit facilities, was $28 billion, which equated to 29.2% of our total assets, up from 25.3% last year. 
Before I provide details on our capital position, it should be noted that we elected to take the benefit of the transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies, which has 2 primary benefits. First, it delays the effect of the CECL transition adjustment for an incremental 2 years; and second, it allows for proportionate current period provisioning to be deferred and amortized with the transition adjustment. With this framework, we ended the quarter at 17.4% CET1 under the CECL transition rules, 310 basis points above last year's level of 14.3%. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.3% under the CECL transition rules, compared to 15.2% last year. The total capital ratio increased 320 basis points to 19.7%. And the Tier 1 capital plus reserves ratio on a fully phased-in basis increased to 28.7%, compared to 24.1% last year, reflecting the increase in the reserves as a result of implementing CECL.  
During the quarter, we returned $328 million to shareholders, which included $200 million in share repurchases and paid a common stock dividend of $0.22 per share. 
Given the continued uncertainty in the operating environment, I thought it would be helpful to provide color on our current view on the key earnings drivers for 2021, which we've laid out on Slide 14. Our views assume that the pressure from the pandemic and a slower economic recovery continues into the second quarter, with the second half seeing the pandemic largely under control and the acceleration of the economic recovery. 
First quarter purchase volume was stronger than we anticipated as we entered the year as local restrictions are lifted, with consumer confidence improving, so the consumers' willingness to spend. We currently believe these trends will hold and purchase volume will continue to recover across our platforms. In the second quarter, we will be comparing against a period of widespread shutdowns. In the second half, we anticipate improving growth trends as the pandemic impact moderates and macroeconomic growth accelerates.  
Regarding loan receivable growth. We expect that stimulus will continue to have an impact on payment rates and therefore, loan receivables into the next quarter. In the second half of 2021, we assume payment rates will moderate as the effects of the stimulus abates and we will return to more normalized consumer payment behavior patterns. Combining this with the expected increase in purchase volume from an improving macroeconomic environment, this should contribute to loan receivable growth. 
For net interest margin, we expect the higher payment rates will continue to pressure loan receivables and generate excess liquidity, impacting interest and fee yield and asset mix. We continue to believe that excess liquidity will be reduced through asset growth and slowing payment rates in the second half of the year, which will drive improving interest and fee yields and asset mix leading to increasing net interest margin.  
With respect to credit, delinquencies are expected to increase from their current levels, but we now believe the peak will occur later than we anticipated, likely in early 2022. While current delinquencies will result in lower net charge-offs in the second quarter, we expect net charge-offs to rise resulting from the increases in delinquencies as we move through 2021. Given the magnitude of stimulus that was deployed during the pandemic, we believe the overall loss curve will be flatter than we initially thought, but it remains volatile and difficult to forecast as to the effects of the stimulus and industry forbearance has abated. We expect reserves to be largely driven by asset growth, impact from any changes in credit and in our macroeconomic assumptions and certain combinations of these factors could result in further reserve releases this year. 
We expect RSAs to remain elevated into the second quarter, primarily reflecting strong program performance, including an improvement in net charge-offs, partially offset by lower revenue. In the second half of the year, we continue to expect lower RSAs generally, reflecting higher net charge-offs, partially offset by higher revenue.  
As we outlined previously, we've implemented cost reductions across the organization, and I'm pleased to report that we are on a pace to achieve our expense savings target of $210 million for the full year. Partially offsetting these cost reductions will be the expense increases related to growth in addition to anticipated increase in delinquent accounts. We will continue to closely monitor how the pandemic develops and its impact to the macroeconomic environment. At the foundation, it is our belief that we position ourselves well for the opportunities that will develop as the economic recovery takes firmer hold. Further, we've made the investments to support our partners as they've been required to rapidly transform their businesses to meet the new digital realities. And we'll continue to make investments in our people, products, technology and platforms to drive long-term value and continue to ensure the safety of our employees while meeting the needs of our partners, merchants, providers and cardholders.  
I'll now turn the call back over to Brian for his final thoughts."

I'll provide a quick overview of key themes for the quarter and then turn it over so we can begin Q&A. 
Clearly, the pandemic has had significant impacts and has, in many ways, changed the way we do business. This quarter made it evident that we are beginning to emerge on the other side of this period. Consumer sentiment has improved, the unemployment rate has dropped and U.S. retail posted the largest gain in 10 months.  
Our business is showing its resilience as growth has accelerated with purchase volume up 8% and 5 million new accounts opened this quarter. And although these solid growth metrics were tamped down by higher payment rates, which impacted loan receivables and NIM, these are headwinds that we anticipate will soon abate. Credit performance has continued to outperform and we continue to expand our CareCredit network, delivering new products, financing alternatives and experiences with a focus on overall wellness and pet. The bottom line is that we demonstrated that we were able to rapidly adapt to operate in a new environment while continuing to keep our eye on the long term, positioning ourselves well for the future. And in my opinion, we have never been in a stronger position.  
I'll now turn the call back to Jennifer to open the Q&A."

We saw the cash flow really start back in mid-March around the fourth week itself since stimulus started to hit. So from there, we continue to see elevated payments. They are starting to trend down a little bit now as we get into latter part of April. Obviously, we have a converging factor with tax returns. So stimulus clearly is the #1 factor. When you think about the late fee yield, if you went back and looked at our number of delinquent accounts, they're down over 30% from the '19 period, so pre pandemic. 
So again, as you think about a rising net charge-off or even just a return to normalcy when you think about the charge-off environment, that late fee yield will come back into the book. And come in advance of when the charge-offs actually hit. So we would expect to see that yield begin to increase in the back half of the year.  
What I'd say, Moshe, as a lot of people focus on the margin of the business, we're at 14% today. We've kind of guided people to, call it, the 16% range in a normalized environment. If you break down the components of that for a second, the first piece is really the excess liquidity, which I started with, with the stimulus factors, right? So if you went back and looked at excess liquidity pre pandemic, apply that to the book today, you'll probably pick up about 90 basis points on net interest margin from there. We previously talked about there's probably 25 or so basis points, 30 basis points in the benchmark rates, which we'll see how prime comes. And the residual amount, right, which is the mainly late fee yield and interest yield will come back into the book and that will arise. So I think you can see a trajectory where this begins to accelerate in the back half of the year and begins to approach normalcy for us as we move into '22."

As you know, I think there's -- look, there's a lot of reasons to be bullish. When you look at the consumer, you look at the trends on jobs, unemployment back to 6% and then consumer balance sheets are strong and they're starting to spend again. I think the fact that we saw 8% purchase volume growth and 11% of retail card is a really positive indicator. But that's not where it should be in a fully functioning open economy. And so I think there's still room across all the growth metrics to go further from here. We're still in the early innings in terms of a recovery. But most of the trends that we're seeing are pretty positive. 
The fact that we grew purchase volumes per account up 18% is a really good indicator that consumers are spending again. And I do think that will turn into more revolving behavior over time. I mean, the effects of the stimulus, as Brian said, are going to -- they're going to wane over time. I think you're going to start to see that pretty soon as the confidence gets better, you tend to see consumers take on more debt and revolve a little bit more, which will help on balances and margins as well."

I'd say, we had a really good partnership for a number of years. We had great feedback actually from the client on our partnership model, our products, our capabilities. I think at the end of the day, this one just came down to terms and price. And our competition was just a lot more aggressive on both. There were some, I would call them really out of market terms where they were looking for guaranteed revenue that increased annually regardless of how the program performed. And for context, just given the turnaround that they've been working through, the program had been shrinking. And so there's really only so far you could go to guarantee those types of payments on a program like that. 
So look, we tried to reach an agreement. At the end of the day, there just wasn't a way for us to get our interest aligned. But I do think this is a pretty unique situation. I look at the pipeline today across all 3 platforms. We've got really attractive opportunities with very strong partners at attractive returns, where our interests are aligned. And I think that is so important. We talked about this for a number of years. We want programs where our interests are aligned in growing the program. We're doing that in a way that benefits both parties. So I still feel really good about the pipeline as I look across all 3 platforms."

And just to put that frame of reference, obviously, when we went to the Board and discussed with the Board, that authorization, that was in the December time frame off the models. As we move through the quarter, clearly, we have more information. We've updated our scenarios. We submitted our capital plan to the Fed in March and look forward to their feedback later this quarter. 
So obviously, we'll see what the results of that come back, but we're optimistic with regard to their support for our capital plan. It's not lost on us that we have the excess capital, Ryan, in the second quarter will again be subject to the limitations by the Fed, which will cap us out around $390 million for the current quarter with regard to the amount of repurchases that we can do. I would make the presumption we will be depending upon market conditions at that maximum. And then we'll be back to you and talk about the capital plan that we submitted back to the Fed. 
That being said, to the extent that the income profile of the business changes, we have not in that capital plan, dealt anything with GAAP and if that portfolio conveys that we would potentially revisit that and go back to the Fed if it's warranted. So we'll continue those discussions and dialogues with the Board and most certainly with our regulators. So there is an opportunity.

But obviously, we want to do it with support of all our constituents. They're not barriers to doing it. We just want to do it in a prudent fashion.

We're optimistic we can get there in a reasonable period of time. I think if you go back we exited GE with 18%. We made it down to 14% before the pandemic hit. And we think we can get back in a fairly reasonable period of time. And if you remember right before the pandemic hit, we were on a path to execute a $3.6 billion capital plan.

I think -- look, CareCredit, I think, is probably the most exciting growth opportunity that we've got in the company today. And we try to lay that out for you in a couple of slides. I think first, just going after a market of this size that's growing as fast as it is. Obviously, health care costs are rising, high deductible plans are increasing in popularity. So less and less is being covered by insurance, and that's really where CareCredit comes in. We're a big player in the space today, but financing options in this space is still a very small fraction of the potential spend that's out there. 
So there is just a ton of room for growth. And I think about the growth in really 3 components. One is growing the core wherein CareCredit is accepted in about 250,000 locations today. We're in 40 different specialties. We just entered into 10 new specialties just over the last 2 years. And we're in 80% at dental offices, 85% of that. So we've got a lot of scale. But with that said, there's still a lot of room to grow penetration inside of those providers because third-party financing options is still a relatively small percentage. So a lot of room for growth there. 
And then we talked a little bit about both health systems. We're in 13 large health systems today. That's a growing part of our business. We're paired up with big players like Kaiser Permanente, Cleveland Clinic. And then we talked about pets as really that third leg of the strategy. We're seeing just unbelievable growth in our pet insurance business that we bought a couple of years ago, up 174% since we bought it. So just a lot to be excited about. 
And then you touched on Walgreens. We had -- our CareCredit cards were accepted at Walgreens. We expanded that relationship to launch a new program and I think similar to Venmo and Verizon, this can be a top 10 program for us. And we're tapping into 90 million myWalgreens customers. So the opportunity is just huge. And we're actively working to get that launched in the second half of the year."

We're also increasing the level of investment that we're making in CareCredit. We've invested quite a bit, obviously, over the last 10 years.

If you remember, when we started back in the pandemic, we did tightening more on proactive type of credit extension. So we shifted the cutoff down on our private label and dual card product mix. We reduced the number of proactive credit line increases. We reduced the number of invitation to apply and prescreen type offers on new accounts. 
As we move through into 2021, what we started to do, in places where we obviously have known customers, we've begun to unwind a lot of those credit refinement. So we are shifting the cutoffs so more people will get a dual card, which would be a slightly higher line, but it most certainly stimulate some spend in the world. We have begun a number of credit line increase type programs, which are customers that we've known and seeing credit behavior and payment behavior patterns. And then we've also begun to upgrade accounts from private label to dual card that would have qualified for dual card a year ago. 
So we're doing a number of things proactively. We just have not touched at the point of acquisition, changed any cutoffs, things like that. But again, we didn't do a lot of that last year. So I don't really expect us to do a lot of it changes now, but we have begun proactive increases. And the good news is, given our portfolio, we're able to do that with customers we know, and we're not taking incremental risk in our eyes."

I feel like some of that shift was certainly permanent and will stay and we'll benefit there as well. 
So look, if you look across the portfolio, the one thing that I think about quite a bit, and we hear this from all of our partners, including all the providers in CareCredit, is there is a real pent-up demand, right, for pretty much everything. This pent-up desire to spend and get back to normal. We're talking to our providers in CareCredit, and they can't keep up with the appointments. Because so many people over the last year, they postponed things that weren't critical, they didn't want to go into the practices. And now you're seeing all of that start to flush through. So I think regardless of the category, there's a ton of pent-up desire to spend. And I think if travel, entertainment, dining, those things come back, I think that also spurs other types of spend that we'll see both on our dual cards but also in some of our adjacencies."

It actually is a fairly nice tailwind as we come out of this period."

And that can be done on an equal pay installment loan, it can be done on a promotional financing product and we tend to see really good revolve rates there as well."

And we want to do that in a way that we can bring that full suite of products to our partners and basically allow them to choose which products are best for their customers based on not only their customer, but what types of products are they selling. 
So not surprisingly, bigger ticket items tend to steer more towards a longer-term installment, that can be on a revolving product or closed end. And then smaller ticket, it tends to be shorter term, either through a product like SetPay or a Pay in 4 type product. So that's really the strategy to provide that comprehensive suite of products and then take that to our partners and really allow them to select from that menu in terms of what meets their customer needs based on the products that they're selling in their strategy."

We actually talk about it in the providers and talk about the benefits of it. And so that's the primary channel and at least has been historically. We also have a provider locator. And what we're trying to do is move up funnel a bit so that at the time that you're booking your appointment, because a lot of that is now happening online, you're actually getting -- you're seeing the promotional financing offer so that, that becomes kind of part of how you're thinking about your treatment. 
So it's not once you actually get to your appointment, that you become aware of it, you can actually go through the whole process well in advance of your appointment and think about how you're going to pay for whether it's braces or whatever your treatment is going to be. And we found that to be really successful. So we've been building that brand awareness over time. It originated largely inside of the provider's office, but has certainly expanded to be more digital in nature through direct marketing and other channels."

So we're in line with those. It's not really products oriented. And most certainly, for us, as we have those conversations, really demonstrating to them the resiliency of this business and this customer because of the point of origination, we actually get stronger yields and risk-adjusted returns off. And again, when you combine that with the RSA buffer, it provides particular strength when it comes to having a lower capital ratio. Those are the conversations we're having with them."

So I think the way to think about efficiency is when we went through last year, we underwent a strategic outlook. That said, if I look out to 2025, think about the mix of business I'm going to have, think about trying to be a top ROA profile company. And I look at the revenue characteristics, the lost content characteristics, the RSA characteristics, what is my expense and efficiency ratio have to be in order to be a top-tier ROA and ahead of all of our peers to really generate that investment thesis. We then roll that back into the plans that we put in place in the latter part of 2020. 
So I think we've engaged upon that, part of that is delivering over $210 million of benefit this year from a cost-out perspective. I think the greater pressure on the efficiency ratio in the short term, to be honest with you, is the revenue headwind that we have with the net interest margin and NII have been a little bit impacted or being impacted by stimulus and really terrific credit and late fee impact that comes from that. That's a little bit of headwind. I do think you're going to see this. This business model, right, we were built off a foundation of running expenses at a very manageable level given the loan balance size. 
I think as you see CareCredit and these other business grow, you should be able to get operating leverage because they run at higher average balances if you think about the bigger ticket size associated with those accounts. And then what can't be lost is the fact that we don't have to spend as much on marketing as our peers relative to generate those new accounts. So we are industry, probably, best or very attractive cost to acquire customers, which really puts us at a competitive advantage versus our peers. 
So we will tightly manage the efficiency. And while we're doing this, we're going to continue to invest in the future of the digital assets that we put in play over the last several years. We're going to continue to invest for our long-term future. So it's a combination of investing and really having a business model and set of partners where we can leverage it and generate that operating efficiency as we probably grow above-average with peers and have a higher return than average peers is how I would think about it, Dominick."

Synchrony delivered strong results during the second quarter, reflecting the power of our technology-enabled model, the durability of our partner centric value proposition and the early indications of a consume",3509,"Thanks, Kathryn, and good morning, everyone. Synchrony delivered strong results during the second quarter, reflecting the power of our technology-enabled model, the durability of our partner centric value proposition and the early indications of a consumer resurgence. With now more than a year of the COVID-19 pandemic moving into the rearview mirror, I am proud of how our team has continued to execute on our strategic priorities. 
Our multiproduct, multi capability strategy has enabled us to nimbly adapt and deliver best-in-class products and services to address our partners' evolving needs while also generating appropriate risk-adjusted returns for all our stakeholders. Let's get things started by reviewing some of the key financial highlights from the quarter. Net earnings reached a record $1.2 billion or $2.12 per diluted share. This reflected an increase of $2.06 over last year as we mark the anniversary of the pandemic initial impact on our business and really the world. We are deeply grateful for all of the frontline workers, scientists and leaders have done to support our community and make progress toward an eventual return to normalcy. Purchase volume grew 35% over last year, reflecting a 33% increase in purchase volume per account. This increased spend was broad-based across our 5 business platforms. This strength in purchase volume was largely offset by the persistently elevated payment rate trends resulting from the government stimulus and industry-wide forbearance actions, leading to a slight increase in loan receivables, which were $78.4 billion for the second quarter. 
Average balances per account were down about 4% for the period, while new accounts were up about 58%. Net interest margin of 13.78% was 25 basis points higher than last year. Elevated payment rates and excess liquidity levels continue to have an impact on receivables and yield. The efficiency ratio was 39.6% for the quarter, primarily reflecting lower net interest income. Expenses were down about 4% compared to last year and down 5% year-to-date as our cost efficiency initiatives continue as planned. We remain on track to remove about $210 million from our expense base by year-end, even as we continue to invest in our business. Credit continued to perform very well. Net charge-offs were 3.57% for the second quarter, down almost 178 basis points from last year. 
Turning to our balance sheet. Deposits were down $4 billion or 7% versus last year, reflecting retail deposit rate actions we took to manage our excess liquidity position. Deposits represented 81% of our funding mix at quarter end, a slight increase versus last year due to the retirement of some of our debt during the second quarter of 2021. During the quarter, we returned $521 million in capital through share repurchases of $393 million and $128 million in common stock dividends. We also continue to reinvest in our business. One of our greatest competitive differentiators remains our digital capabilities. We continue to invest in innovative products and services that enable our partners to meet their customers wherever and however they want to be met. That where and how, of course, can change fairly quickly ask can the objectives that our partners seek to achieve. So we need to stay nimble and ahead of the curve. We have continued to win and renew key partnerships, including our recent renewal with TJX companies. 
This has been a very valuable partnership for over 10 years now, and we are excited to continue to provide innovative financing products to TJX customers. We also renewed 10 other programs during the quarter, including Shophq, Daniels and Sutherland and added 4 new programs, including JCB and Oshner Health. Our go-to-market strategy utilizes innovative and scalable ways to reach and serve customers effectively across a broad spectrum of industries and financing needs and over the course of their life cycle. We have built a technology platform that harnesses our proprietary data analytics, cutting-edge digital capabilities to offer a customized suite of products specifically designed with our partners and their customers in mind, all while delivering appropriately aligned economic outcomes. Our recent business reorganization which included the creation of a growth organization and the redistribution of our partners from 3 sales platforms into 5 will allow us to better leverage these company resources and deliver swifter, more optimized products and capabilities for our partners and sustainable profitable growth for our business. In fact, the growth we expect to achieve within each platform will be driven by utilizing our suite of products to lifetime value, deploying more of our digital capabilities to expand customer reach or adapting our value propositions to harness organic trends as the landscape evolves. In the case of our home and auto platform, a combination of all 3. 
In particular, our home partnerships have been a focus of Synchrony's going back to our business inception when we started providing financing for appliance purchases. Over the years, we've significantly broadened the scope of this platform and expanded our customer reach. Today, Synchrony is penetrated across all distribution points in each sector of the home market from big retailers to independent merchants and contractors and OEMs and dealers our home platform provides financing solutions to about 60,000 merchants and locations across a broad spectrum of industries, including furniture and accessories, mattresses and bedding, appliances, windows, roofing, HVAC and flooring. Our partnerships are deeply rooted in industry expertise, data-driven strategic objectives and mutually beneficial economic outcomes. 
The average length of our top 20 partners is over 30 years because we are able to deliver a breadth of financing products, innovative digital capabilities and seamless customer experiences that are customized to each partner's needs as they evolve over time. Our data insights and analytics expertise when combined with the partner's own data empowers each merchant as they seek to optimize their marketing, customer acquisition and sales strategies. And the value that our suite of products provides to their customers is clear. About 58% of our sales are repeat purchases. Whether customers are looking to upgrade their living room couch or suddenly find themselves in need of a new washing machine, we enable our partners to consistently support those needs through a variety of financing options that are best suited to the customer and the particular purchase they're considering. So whether we've been entrusted to enhance customer loyalty, drive transaction volume, our Usher retailers' adoption of digital assets, our strategy has enabled steady growth across the home market. For the 4 years prior to the pandemic, Synchrony's home receivables grew at a 7% CAGR, and as consumer spend within home improvement, furniture and decor and electronic and appliances sectors each grew by between 4% and 8% annually. Certainly, the pandemic has brought with it both challenges and opportunities. As consumers quarantined in their homes, the desire to renovate their homes or upgrade their furniture and decor intensified. As people sought to leave crowded metropolitan communities for suburban neighborhoods, home improvement spend increased. 
In 2020 alone, the home industry represented an approximate $600 billion market opportunity. Synchrony serves a fraction of that today. Even as we normalize toward a prepandemic cadence, the consumers' desire to invest in their living spaces is as strong as ever, perhaps reflecting a secular shift in favor of more remote work. We have positioned our home platform very well to capitalize on these trends. We have opportunities to deepen the scope and reach of existing partnerships while also implementing a number of strategic initiatives to better leverage our core competencies and deepen our market penetration. For example, we have begun using more data and advanced analytics to enhance our acquisition marketing and drive higher repeat sales. 
We've also launched our direct-to-device capability, which puts the simplicity of our financing application and the power of our underwriting in the hands of the contractors and customers as they seek to install a new HVAC system, replace their windows or repair an oven. This direct-to-device technology is also being deployed in retailer locations which helps shorten checkout lines and delivers a completely digital solution to apply and buy win in store. In short, we are excited about the opportunities for growth that we see in our home platform. There are certainly some natural tailwinds in the industry that should fuel home spend even as life normalizes in a post-pandemic world. But we are actually more excited about the ways in which we're leveraging our technological innovations to extend our customer reach enhance the value of the products and services we offer and deepen our competitive differentiation. As we continue to execute on our long-term strategy, we are driving even greater customer lifetime value for our partners, better experiences for their customers and strong returns for our stakeholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian. 
Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. 
As Brian mentioned earlier, the strong results we achieved during the second quarter reflected a number of factors: first, healthy consumer with significant savings and pent-up demand to spend it leading to broad-based purchase volume growth. Second, continued strength in credit quality across our portfolio. We continue to closely monitor our portfolio as industry-wide forbearance begins to expire across the broader consumer finance landscape and for some customers as rental forbearance also expires. 
Finally, the strong positioning of our business, combined with consistent execution by our team, while we maintain focus on efficient delivery of customized financing solutions and digitally enabled customer experiences across our diverse portfolio of partners, merchants and providers focusing on the healthy consumer who has robust savings and desire to spend in an environment with improving economic trends. During the second quarter, consumer savings rates remained strong, unemployment continued to improve and consumer confidence reached a 16-month high. As a result, discretionary spend seems to be making a gradual return to pre-pandemic levels. 
In fact, a conference board survey from June indicated that there's also a healthy interest among consumers to spend on long-lasting manufactured goods over the next 6 months. including homes, cars and major household appliances, which we expect to be a positive tailwind for our home and auto platform in particular. Across our diverse set of platforms, strong consumer spend trends contributed to 35% higher purchase volume compared to last year, primarily reflecting 33% stronger purchase volume per account. When comparing these trends to the more normalized operating environment of the second quarter 2019 and excluding the impact of Walmart, purchase volume was 18% higher in the second quarter '21, and purchase volume per account was 22% higher. 
This demonstrates strong consumer demand, translating to higher spend relative to pre-pandemic levels. Dual and co-branded cards accounted for 39% of the purchase volume in the second quarter and increased 56% from last year. On a loan receivables basis, they accounted for 23% of the portfolio and were flat to the prior year. Average active accounts were up about 2% compared to last year, and new accounts were 58% higher, totaling more than 6 million new accounts in the second quarter and over 11 million new accounts year-to-date. Loan receivables reached $78.4 billion in the second quarter a slight increase year-over-year as the period strong purchase volume growth was largely offset by persistently elevated payment rate. This marks the first quarter of year-over-year growth since the start of the pandemic. Payment rate was almost 300 basis points higher when compared to last year, which primarily led to a 6% reduction in interest and fees on loans. RSAs increased $233 million or 30% from last year and were 5.25% of average receivables. The increase relative to last year's second quarter was primarily reflected in the significant improvement in net charge-offs. As a reminder, our retailer share ranges are designed to share in the program's performance. And when the portfolios are performing better on a risk-adjusted basis, our partner share in this performance. So the RSA is performing as it is designed and the elevated levels we have seen over the last few quarters are a reflection of Synchrony's particular financial strength through the pandemic. 
We continue to expect RSAs to decline as net charge-offs begin to rise. With an improved credit performance and a more optimistic macroeconomic environment, we reduced our loan loss reserves by $878 million this quarter. Other income decreased $6 million generally reflecting higher loyalty program costs from higher purchase volume during the quarter. Other expense decreased $38 million due to lower operational losses, partially offset by an increase in employee marketing and business development and information processing costs. 
Moving to Slide 8 and our platform results. We saw a broad-based purchase volume growth across all 5 platforms as consumers have become increasingly confident and remaining local restrictions are being lifted. Both our health and wellness and diversified value platforms experienced more than 50% growth in purchase volume. In health and wellness, this primarily reflected lifting of local restrictions on in-person interactions and consumers being more comfortable with the environment in undergoing elective procedures. The lifting of state restrictions was also a primary driver of the significant purchase volume growth in our diversified value platform as consumers increase their discretionary spend in categories like clothing and assorted household goods. Meanwhile, purchase volume grew by 30% in our digital platform, 25% in home and auto and 9% in lifestyle. Loan receivable growth trends by platform generally reflected stabilization or modest growth versus the prior year as the higher purchase volume was partially offset by the elevated payment rates. The one exception being our diversified value platform, which was also impacted by store closures in 2020. 
Average active account trends were mixed on a platform basis, up by as much as 5% in digital and down by as much as 6% in health and wellness. The active account growth in digital generally reflected the combination of a shift in the timing of an annual promotional events and the ramp-up of some of our recent partner launches. The active account decline in health and wellness was primarily associated with the continued strength in consumer balance sheets. Interest and fees were generally down across the platforms with the exception of lifestyle due to lower yield as a result of elevated payment trends we've been discussing. 
I'll move to Slide 9 to discuss net interest income and margin trends. During the quarter, the continued combined impacts of the March stimulus and high savings balance built during the pandemic led to higher than average payment rate across our portfolio. As Slide 9 shows, payment rate ran approximately 280 basis points higher than our 5-year historical average and about 300 basis points higher relative to last year's second quarter. It's worth noting the gradual moderation in payment rate from April to June, at which point, the payment rate was 18.5% a 90 basis point decrease for the March monthly peak of 19.4%. We expect continued gradual moderation in payment rate as consumers continue to spend the excess savings they accumulated resulting from the combined impact of stimulus and slower discretionary spend during the lockdown. 
Interest and fees were down about 6% in the second quarter, reflecting lower finance charge yield from elevated payment rate trends and continued lower delinquent accounts resulting from our strong credit performance. Net interest income decreased 2% from last year. The net interest margin was 13.78% compared to last year's margin of 13.53%, a 25 basis points year-over-year improvement driven by favorable interest-bearing liabilities cost and mix of interest-earning assets, partially offset by the pandemic's impact on loan receivable yields. More specifically, interest-bearing liabilities costs were 1.42%, a year-over-year improvement of 73 basis points, primarily due to lower benchmark rates. This provided a 62 basis point increase in our net interest margin. The mix of loan receivables as a percent of total earning assets increased by 170 basis points from 78% to 79.7%, driven by lower liquidity held during the quarter. This accounted for a 32 basis point increase in the margin. 
The loan receivables yield was 18.62% during the second quarter. The 84 basis points year-over-year reduction reflected the impact of higher payment rate and lower interest and fees which we discussed earlier and impacted our net interest margin by 65 basis points. We continue to believe that in the second half of the year, liquidity will continue to be deployed into asset growth and slowing payment rates should result in a higher interest and fee yields, leading to increasing net interest margin. Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 10. 
In terms of specific dynamics for the quarter, I'll start with the delinquency trends. Our 30-plus delinquency rate was 2.11% compared to 3.13% last year. Our 90-plus delinquency rate was 1% compared to 1.77% last year. Higher payment trends continue to drive delinquency improvements. Focusing on the net charge-off trends. Our net charge-off rate was 3.57% compared to 5.35% last year. Our reduction in net charge-off rate was primarily driven by improving delinquency trends as customer behavior pattern improved over the last several quarters. Our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 11.51%. As far as our credit outlook is concerned, we are monitoring trends in our portfolio closely as the accounts enrolled in multiple forbearance programs roll off, but have not seen any indication in our portfolio to date. 
Our best expectation at this time is that delinquencies should begin to rise sometime in the back half of 2021, leading to peak delinquencies in mid-2022. This would translate a net charge-off peak in late 2022. Moving to Slide 11, I will cover expenses for the quarter. 
Overall expenses were down $38 million or 4% from last year to $948 million as we continue to execute on our strategic plan to reduce costs and remain disciplined in managing our expense base. Specifically, the decrease was driven by lower operational losses, partially offset by increased employee marketing and business development and information processing costs. The efficiency ratio for the second quarter was 39.6% compared to 36.3% last year. The main driver of the increase of the efficiency ratio was a negative impact from lower revenue that resulted from a combination of lower receivables and lower interest and fee yield. This is partially offset by a reduction in expenses. 
Moving to Slide 12. Given the reduction in our loan receivables in 2020 and early 2021 and the strength in our deposit platform, we continue to carry a higher level of liquidity. While we believe it's prudent to maintain a higher liquidity level during uncertain and volatile periods, we continue to actively manage our funding profile to mitigate excess liquidity where appropriate. As a result of this strategy, there was a shift in our mix of funding during the quarter. 
Our deposits declined $4.3 billion from last year, our securitized and unsecured funding sources declined by $2.6 billion. This resulted in deposits being 81% of our funding compared to 80% last year with securitized funding comprising 10% and unsecured funding comprising 9% of our funding sources at quarter end. Total liquidity, including undrawn credit facilities, was $21.2 billion, which equated to 23% of our total assets, down from 29% last year. Before I provide details on our capital position, it should be noted that we elected to take the benefit of the transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies which had 2 primary benefits. First, it delays the effect of the CECL transition adjustment for an incremental 2 years; and second, it allows for a portion of the current period provisioning to be deferred and amortized with the transition adjustment. With this framework, we ended the quarter at 17.8% CET1 under the CECL transition rules, 250 basis points above last year's level of 15.3%. And -- The Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.7% under the CECL transition rules compared to 16.3% last year. 
The total capital ratio increased 250 basis points to 20.1%.  And the Tier 1 capital plus reserves ratio on a fully phased-in basis was 28% compared to 26.5% last year, reflecting the impact of the retained net income. During the quarter, we returned $521 million to shareholders, which included $393 million in share repurchases and paid a common stock dividend of $0.22 per share. During the quarter, we also announced the approval of a $2.9 billion share repurchase program through June 2022 as well as our plans to maintain our regular quarterly dividend. Our business generates a considerable amount of capital thanks to the scalability of our digital capabilities, the utility of our diversified product suite and the prioritization of growth at attractive risk-adjusted returns. We will continue to take an opportunistic approach to returning capital to shareholders as our business performance and market conditions allow, subject to our capital plan and any regulatory restrictions. As we exit the pandemic and the environment normalizes, we are confident in our capabilities and positioning of our business. We are emerging from this period as a stronger and more dynamic company, and we're excited about the opportunities we see to drive strong financial results and shareholder value. I will now turn the call back over to Brian for his final thoughts."

Consumer confidence continues to build.  The trends on retail sales and spending. All of that is translating into really good spend on our cards. So as we look across our 5 platforms, it really is broad-based. 35% purchase volume growth year-over-year, really strong across all 5 platforms. the fact that we were up 18% versus 2019, I think, is a really good indication. So it's not just that we're comping against a weak 2020. It really is broad-based growth across the company. And then as you look at kind of per account, purchase volume per account was up 33%. So that's another positive indicator. And then this is a little more anecdotal, but as we talk to our partners, no matter what segment we're in, they're seeing a lot of pent-up demand to spend. The providers in CareCredit their booking appointments now 3, 4 months out. They're opening the practices on Saturdays and Sundays to keep up with the volume. So I know that's a little more anecdotal, but as our teams are out every day talking to the partners that are in the stores, they're just seeing and feeling a lot of pent-up demand to spend. I don't know, Brian, if you want to add to that a little bit on."

We began -- we see now across the 29 largest banks that are beginning to trail down a little bit. So some of those will come back in line clearly, with the spending behavior patterns as well as the increase in the financial obligations as mortgage forbearance, auto forbearances and the enhanced unemployment benefits begin to fade here in the back half of the year."

We do think it begins to abate in the back half of the year. So I think from the purchase volume and receivable growth standpoint, it's the same. Clearly, the elevated payment rate and persistency of that will provide a little bit of headwind in net interest margin as we move into the back half of the year. From a credit perspective, the higher payment rate really is given us what I'd say almost pristine-type credit. So I think you'll see in the back half of the year. And really for the full year for the company, we're going to be sub-4% on a loss rate perspective, which is remarkable for this business given the high margins -- And then the RSA following those trends will be a little bit more elevated in the back half of the year, which, again, is working as it's designed to share in the upside performance of the company. So -- That's how I think about it. It's largely consistent with what we've said back in the first quarter. So thank you."

So our goal at the end of the day is to have a multiproduct, multi-capability solution. I think ultimately, that's what's going to win. And that's what we're offering to our providers. In terms of the competitive dynamics, it's hard to tell how others are underwriting. What I can tell you is we've been in this business a long time. It is really important to stay disciplined, which means you don't go a lot deeper and really good times and you try not to contract too much in bad times because we know that our partners really value that stability, the consistency of our underwriting, and they get used to a certain approval rate, and we try to protect that in both good times and bad times. 
And as we all know, if you've been in this business a long time, if you do take on substantially more risk and you're winning business by lowering your underwriting standards, and that's a losing strategy over the long term.

So I don't really see any data yet that says that, that's going to be a potential problem. 
Well, certainly, we'll watch and see whether or not that becomes a permanent credit and a permanent pull forward as legislation gets enacted later on this year. So we'll continue to watch it on."

I think the -- a lot of our partners are still in kind of the evaluation phase, where they look at the Bynopaylater product, and they obviously see a customer desire for that product, right, and a customer demand for it. But one of the big questions is, as you pointed out, it's around economics. And it's still early there. And I think some retailers are willing to pay what is a pretty steep merchant discount rate if they believe that they're attracting new customers and they're getting sales that they wouldn't otherwise get. But when they look at that comparison, they look at compared to some of our some of our products where not only do we not charge interchange. We're also paying them quite a bit through the RSA, and they look at that and they say, okay, clearly, economically, they would prefer that the purchase goes on the private label card or a co-brand card because it's much better for them financially. And so to the extent that they stop believing that they're actually getting incremental purchases or new customers, then the economic trade-off is very clear. And so I do think down the road, there's an economic reckoning that will happen, as this plays out, and it's still early in terms of these products and how they're offered. The other thing I would mention is that the other advantage in the things that we hear from our partners is they like they like the lifetime relationship that a card provides. They can do life cycle marketing, they can do promotions and offers over a number of years. And one of the things that we talk a lot about with our partners and one of the things that we measure across all of our partners' repeat purchases. And we talked to you guys a lot about that as well because that has been a big focus for us over the last 5 years. And one of the things that, frankly, our partners look to us for is that ongoing customer loyalty. We measure that. We look at it by customer. When was the last time they made a purchase, okay, let's send them a customized offer a promotion. So they really like that ability to do that life cycle marketing. So I think it's a combination of economics, and that's still kind of a TBD on how all this is going to shake out. But the other thing that we hear across the board is they want to have a long-term relationship with the customer. They really value the loyalty that a lot of our products provide."

So the way I would think about it, let's take liquidity first. in the portfolio. So clearly, we've been able to burn off some of that liquidity here in the second quarter, both through the $2 billion in asset growth that we had as well as the acceleration of some of the maturities and the funding profile. So we're running over $2 billion continued excess liquidity as we enter into the back half of the year. If you take out all the excess liquidity from here, there's probably another 40 basis points on to the net interest margin. that you'd see a lift from. 
Again, we've highlighted before, you probably have 20 to 30 basis points from benchmark rates, so put that off to the side. The residual comes in probably 2 fashions. One is late fees, which you're probably 80 to 90 basis points of lift going back to a normalized leaf feel. So not even at a loss rate higher than 5.5% than your normal load. And then you have the residual which will be they're evolve when payer rates come back in line. So the only thing I'd say is we do not see anything in the portfolio today that gives us any indication that the net interest margin in that 16% realm is not going to be the mean that we go back to, and we'll continue to watch it, but there's nothing fundamentally or structurally that we think is different. It's just really the timing to get there given the excess liquidity that the consumer has and that they're going to deploy here in the short term."

First, in terms of, to your point, the products and capabilities that we offer tend to align better by industry. And even more important than that, how we integrate and the products and capabilities and how we integrate them into the digital environment or the store footprint tends to align as well by industry. So one example for our purely digital players, PayPal, Venmo, Amazon, we're integrating through our API technology or through SyPi right inside of their app. And that's different than what we would do in home and auto, where for some of our larger partners, we're integrating both in their digital environment, mobile, online, but we also have tools and technologies to apply and buy in-store. 
And so because the product suite tends to be catered more towards industry because of the types of products that they're selling as well as whether or not they're purely digital or have a store footprint. It just made more sense to aligned by industry. I'd say the second piece of this, and we saw this in CareCredit over the last 30 years, it really is an advantage to get really deep domain expertise in an industry. And 1 of the things that I think has been a secret to our success in CareCredit is that domain expertise. Our teams get -- they built lifetime relationships. They get really deep in the different in the different domains that we support dental that, et cetera. And we're trying to replicate that in these other platforms. So those were the 2 primary reasons. I can tell you, it's been great just a couple of months in having these teams in place looking at these segments differently, seeing kind of natural synergies and ideas for new products and capabilities as they're out talking to partners and thinking about it more with an industry than to it.

What I can tell you is we measure our teams on increasing that penetration rate regardless of where they're at. So even for the more mature programs, our teams that are embedded inside of our partners, they get measured based on growth and driving that incremental tender share. So even in mature programs, we are very focused on that -- the penetration rate. Brian, if you want to take the second piece of that."

So I think we have the ability to -- and demonstrate capability to do that. So I think we're confident in our ability to get down there. Now with regard to the current authorization, right, we talked about this a little bit in the first quarter. That is a backwards-looking authorization, right? So the data in which we used to run our stress scenarios under our processes and our governance mechanisms were based off of December and early January assumptions, right? So that's where we had the capital plan put together and approved by our Board.

Synchrony delivered strong results during the second quarter, reflecting the power of our technology-enabled model, the durability of our partner-centric value proposition and the early indications of a consumer resurgence. With now more than a year of the COVID-19 pandemic moving into the rearview mirror, I am proud of how our team has continued to execute on our strategic priorities.
Our multiproduct, multi-capability strategy has enabled us to nimbly adapt and deliver best-in-class products and services to address our partners' evolving needs while also generating appropriate risk-adjusted returns for all our stakeholders.
Let's get things started by reviewing some of the key financial highlights from the quarter. Net earnings reached a record $1.2 billion or $2.12 per diluted share. This reflected an increase of $2.06 over last year, as we mark the anniversary of the pandemic's initial impact on our business and really the world. We are deeply grateful for all of the frontline workers, scientists and leaders have done to support our community and make progress toward an eventual return to normalcy.
Purchase volume grew 35% over last year, reflecting a 33% increase in purchase volume per account. This increased spend was broad-based across our 5 business platforms. This strength in purchase volume was largely offset by the persistently elevated payment rate trends resulting from the government stimulus and industry-wide forbearance actions, leading to a slight increase in loan receivables, which were $78.4 billion for the second quarter.
Average balances per account were down about 4% for the period, while new accounts were up about 58%. Net interest margin of 13.78% was 25 basis points higher than last year. Elevated payment rates and excess liquidity levels continue to have an impact on receivables yield. The efficiency ratio was 39.6% for the quarter, primarily reflecting lower net interest income. Expenses were down about 4% compared to last year and down 5% year-to-date as our cost-efficiency initiatives continue as planned. We remain on track to remove about $210 million from our expense base by year-end, even as we continue to invest in our business. Credit continued to perform very well. Net charge-offs were 3.57% for the second quarter, down almost 178 basis points from last year.
Turning to our balance sheet. Deposits were down $4 billion or 7% versus last year, reflecting retail deposit rate actions we took to manage our excess liquidity position. Deposits represented 81% of our funding mix at quarter end, a slight increase versus last year due to the retirement of some of our debt during the second quarter of 2021.
During the quarter, we returned $521 million in capital through share repurchases of $393 million and $128 million in common stock dividends. We also continue to reinvest in our business. One of our greatest competitive differentiators remains our digital capabilities. We continue to invest in innovative products and services that enable our partners to meet their customers wherever and however they want to be met. That where and how, of course, can change fairly quickly, as can the objectives that our partners seek to achieve. So we need to stay nimble and ahead of the curve.
We have continued to win and renew key partnerships, including our recent renewal with TJX companies. This has been a very valuable partnership for over 10 years now, and we are excited to continue to provide innovative financing products to TJX customers. We also renewed 10 other programs during the quarter, including Shop HQ, Daniels and Sutherlands and added 4 new programs, including JCB and Ochsner Health.
Our go-to-market strategy utilizes innovative and scalable ways to reach and serve customers effectively across a broad spectrum of industries and financing needs and over the course of their life cycle. We have built a technology platform that harnesses our proprietary data analytics, cutting-edge digital capabilities to offer a customized suite of products specifically designed with our partners and their customers in mind, all while delivering appropriately aligned economic outcomes.
Our recent business reorganization, which included the creation of a growth organization and the redistribution of our partners from 3 sales platforms into 5, will allow us to better leverage these company resources and deliver swifter, more optimized products and capabilities for our partners and sustainable profitable growth for our business. In fact, the growth we expect to achieve within each platform will be driven by utilizing our suite of products to expand lifetime value, deploying more of our digital capabilities to expand customer reach or adapting our value propositions to harness organic trends as the landscape evolves. In the case of our home and auto platform, a combination of all 3.
In particular, our home partnerships have been a focus of Synchrony's going back to our business inception when we started providing financing for appliance purchases. Over the years, we've significantly broadened the scope of this platform and expanded our customer reach. Today, Synchrony is penetrated across all distribution points in each sector of the home market. From big retailers to independent merchants and contractors and OEMs and dealers, our home platform provides financing solutions to about 60,000 merchants and locations across a broad spectrum of industries, including furniture and accessories, mattresses and bedding, appliances, windows, roofing, HVAC and flooring. Our partnerships are deeply rooted in industry expertise, data-driven strategic objectives and mutually beneficial economic outcomes.
The average length of our top 20 partners is over 30 years because we are able to deliver a breadth of financing products, innovative digital capabilities and seamless customer experiences that are customized to each partner's needs as they evolve over time. Our data insights and analytics expertise, when combined with the partner's own data, empowers each merchant as they seek to optimize their marketing, customer acquisition and sales strategies.
And the value that our suite of products provides to their customers is clear. About 58% of our sales are repeat purchases. Whether customers are looking to upgrade their living room couch or suddenly find themselves in need of a new washing machine, we enable our partners to consistently support those needs through a variety of financing options that are best suited to the customer and the particular purchase they're considering.
So whether we've been entrusted to enhance customer loyalty, drive transaction volume or usher our retailers' adoption of digital assets, our strategy has enabled steady growth across the home market. For the 4 years prior to the pandemic, Synchrony's home receivables grew at a 7% CAGR, as consumer spend within home improvement, furniture and decor and electronic and appliances sectors each grew by between 4% and 8% annually. Certainly, the pandemic has brought with it both challenges and opportunities. As consumers quarantined in their homes, the desire to renovate their homes or upgrade their furniture and decor intensified. As people sought to leave crowded metropolitan communities for suburban neighborhoods, home improvement spend increased.
In 2020 alone, the home industry represented an approximate $600 billion market opportunity. Synchrony serves a fraction of that today. Even as we normalize toward a pre-pandemic cadence, the consumers' desire to invest in their living spaces is as strong as ever, perhaps reflecting a secular shift in favor of more remote work. We have positioned our home platform very well to capitalize on these trends. We have opportunities to deepen the scope and reach of existing partnerships, while also implementing a number of strategic initiatives to better leverage our core competencies and deepen our market penetration. For example, we have begun using more data and advanced analytics to enhance our acquisition marketing and drive higher repeat sales.
We've also launched our direct-to-device capability, which puts the simplicity of our financing application and the power of our underwriting in the hands of the contractors and customers as they seek to install a new HVAC system, replace their windows or repair an oven. This direct-to-device technology is also being deployed in retailer locations, which helps shorten checkout lines and delivers a completely digital solution to apply and buy win in store.
In short, we are excited about the opportunities for growth that we see in our home platform. There are certainly some natural tailwinds in the industry that should fuel home spend even as life normalizes in a post-pandemic world. But we are actually more excited about the ways in which we're leveraging our technological innovations to extend our customer reach, enhance the value of the products and services we offer and deepen our competitive differentiation. As we continue to execute on our long-term strategy, we are driving even greater customer lifetime value for our partners, better experiences for their customers and strong returns for our stakeholders.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."
260334235,1671816575,2348140,"Synchrony Financial, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2021",2021-07-20,"Earnings Calls","Synchrony Financial","Executives","Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone.As Brian mentioned earlier, the strong results we achieved during the second quarter reflected a number of factors: first, a healthy consumer with significant savings and pent-up demand to spend it, leading to b",2055,"Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone.
As Brian mentioned earlier, the strong results we achieved during the second quarter reflected a number of factors: first, a healthy consumer with significant savings and pent-up demand to spend it, leading to broad-based purchase volume growth; second, continued strength in credit quality across our portfolio. We continue to closely monitor our portfolio as industry-wide forbearance begins to expire across the broader consumer finance landscape and for some customers as rental forbearance also expires.
Finally, the strong positioning of our business, combined with consistent execution by our team, while we maintain focus on efficient delivery of customized financing solutions and digitally enabled customer experiences across our diverse portfolio of partners, merchants and providers, focusing on the healthy consumer who has robust savings and desire to spend in an environment with improving economic trends. During the second quarter, consumer savings rates remained strong, unemployment continued to improve and consumer confidence reached a 16-month high. As a result, discretionary spend seems to be making a gradual return to pre-pandemic levels.
In fact, a conference board survey from June indicated that there's also a healthy interest among consumers to spend on long-lasting manufactured goods over the next 6 months, including homes, cars and major household appliances, which we expect to be a positive tailwind for our home and auto platform in particular. Across our diverse set of platforms, strong consumer spend trends contributed to 35% higher purchase volume compared to last year, primarily reflecting 33% stronger purchase volume per account. When comparing these trends to the more normalized operating environment of the second quarter 2019 and excluding the impact of Walmart, purchase volume was 18% higher in the second quarter '21, and purchase volume per account was 22% higher. This demonstrates strong consumer demand, translating to higher spend relative to pre-pandemic levels.
Dual and co-branded cards accounted for 39% of the purchase volume in the second quarter and increased 56% from last year. On a loan receivables basis, they accounted for 23% of the portfolio and were flat to the prior year. Average active accounts were up about 2% compared to last year, and new accounts were 58% higher, totaling more than 6 million new accounts in the second quarter and over 11 million new accounts year-to-date. Loan receivables reached $78.4 billion in the second quarter, a slight increase year-over-year as the period strong purchase volume growth was largely offset by persistently elevated payment rate. This marks the first quarter of year-over-year growth since the start of the pandemic.
Payment rate was almost 300 basis points higher when compared to last year, which primarily led to a 6% reduction in interest and fees on loans. RSAs increased $233 million or 30% from last year and were 5.25% of average receivables. The increase relative to last year's second quarter was primarily reflected in the significant improvement in net charge-offs. As a reminder, our retailer share arrangements are designed to share in the program's performance. And when the portfolios are performing better on a risk-adjusted basis, our partner share in this performance. So the RSA is performing as it is designed and the elevated levels we have seen over the last few quarters are a reflection of Synchrony's particular financial strength through the pandemic. We continue to expect RSAs to decline as net charge-offs begin to rise.
With an improved credit performance and a more optimistic macroeconomic environment, we reduced our loan loss reserves by $878 million this quarter. Other income decreased $6 million generally reflecting higher loyalty program costs from higher purchase volume during the quarter. Other expense decreased $38 million due to lower operational losses, partially offset by an increase in employee, marketing and business development and information processing costs.
Moving to Slide 8 and our platform results. We saw a broad-based purchase volume growth across all 5 platforms as consumers have become increasingly confident and remaining local restrictions are being lifted. Both our health and wellness and diversified value platforms experienced more than 50% growth in purchase volume. In health and wellness, this primarily reflected lifting of local restrictions on in-person interactions and consumers being more comfortable with the environment in undergoing elective procedures.
The lifting of state restrictions was also a primary driver of the significant purchase volume growth in our diversified value platform as consumers increase their discretionary spend in categories like clothing and assorted household goods. Meanwhile, purchase volume grew by 30% in our digital platform, 25% in home and auto and 9% in lifestyle.
Loan receivable growth trends by platform generally reflected stabilization or modest growth versus the prior year as the higher purchase volume was partially offset by the elevated payment rates. The one exception being our diversified value platform, which was also impacted by store closures in 2020.
Average active account trends were mixed on a platform basis, up by as much as 5% in digital and down by as much as 6% in health and wellness. The active account growth in digital generally reflected the combination of a shift in the timing of an annual promotional events and the ramp-up of some of our recent partner launches. The active account decline in health and wellness was primarily associated with the continued strength in consumer balance sheets. Interest and fees were generally down across the platforms with the exception of lifestyle due to lower yield as a result of elevated payment trends we've been discussing.
I'll move to Slide 9 to discuss net interest income and margin trends. During the quarter, the continued combined impacts of the March stimulus and high savings balance built during the pandemic led to higher-than-average payment rate across our portfolio. As Slide 9 shows, payment rate ran approximately 280 basis points higher than our 5-year historical average and about 300 basis points higher relative to last year's second quarter. It's worth noting the gradual moderation in payment rate from April to June, at which point, the payment rate was 18.5%, a 90 basis point decrease for the March monthly peak of 19.4%. We expect continued gradual moderation in payment rate as consumers continue to spend the excess savings they accumulated resulting from the combined impact of stimulus and slower discretionary spend during the lockdown.
Interest and fees were down about 6% in the second quarter, reflecting lower finance charge yield from elevated payment rate trends and continued lower delinquent accounts resulting from our strong credit performance. Net interest income decreased 2% from last year. The net interest margin was 13.78% compared to last year's margin of 13.53%, a 25 basis points year-over-year improvement, driven by favorable interest-bearing liabilities cost and mix of interest-earning assets, partially offset by the pandemic's impact on loan receivable yield. More specifically, interest-bearing liabilities costs were 1.42%, a year-over-year improvement of 73 basis points, primarily due to lower benchmark rates. This provided a 62 basis point increase in our net interest margin. The mix of loan receivables as a percent of total earning assets increased by 170 basis points from 78% to 79.7%, driven by lower liquidity held during the quarter. This accounted for a 32 basis point increase in the margin.
The loan receivables yield was 18.62% during the second quarter. The 84 basis points year-over-year reduction reflected the impact of higher payment rate and lower interest and fees which we discussed earlier and impacted our net interest margin by 65 basis points. We continue to believe that in the second half of the year, liquidity will continue to be deployed into asset growth and slowing payment rates should result in a higher interest and fee yields, leading to increasing net interest margin.
Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 10. In terms of specific dynamics for the quarter, I'll start with the delinquency trends. Our 30-plus delinquency rate was 2.11% compared to 3.13% last year. Our 90-plus delinquency rate was 1% compared to 1.77% last year. Higher payment trends continue to drive delinquency improvements.
Focusing on the net charge-off trends, our net charge-off rate was 3.57% compared to 5.35% last year. Our reduction in net charge-off rate was primarily driven by improving delinquency trends as customer behavior pattern improved over the last several quarters. Our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 11.51%. As far as our credit outlook is concerned, we are monitoring trends in our portfolio closely as the accounts enrolled in multiple forbearance programs roll off, but have not seen any indication in our portfolio to date. Our best expectation at this time is that delinquencies should begin to rise sometime in the back half of 2021, leading to peak delinquencies in mid-2022. This would translate a net charge-off peak in late 2022.
Moving to Slide 11, I will cover expenses for the quarter. Overall expenses were down $38 million or 4% from last year to $948 million, as we continue to execute on our strategic plan to reduce costs and remain disciplined in managing our expense base. Specifically, the decrease was driven by lower operational losses, partially offset by increased employee, marketing and business development and information processing costs. The efficiency ratio for the second quarter was 39.6% compared to 36.3% last year. The main driver of the increase of the efficiency ratio was a negative impact from lower revenue that resulted from a combination of lower receivables and lower interest and fee yield. This is partially offset by a reduction in expenses.
Moving to Slide 12. Given the reduction in our loan receivables in 2020 and early 2021 and the strength in our deposit platform, we continue to carry a higher level of liquidity. While we believe it's prudent to maintain a higher liquidity level during uncertain and volatile periods, we continue to actively manage our funding profile to mitigate excess liquidity where appropriate. As a result of this strategy, there was a shift in our mix of funding during the quarter.
Our deposits declined $4.3 billion from last year, our securitized and unsecured funding sources declined by $2.6 billion. This resulted in deposits being 81% of our funding compared to 80% last year, with securitized funding comprising 10% and unsecured funding comprising 9% of our funding sources at quarter end. Total liquidity, including undrawn credit facilities, was $21.2 billion, which equated to 23% of our total assets, down from 29% last year.
Before I provide details on our capital position, it should be noted that we elected to take the benefit of the transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies which had 2 primary benefits: first, it delays the effect of the CECL transition adjustment for an incremental 2 years; and second, it allows for a portion of the current period provisioning to be deferred and amortized with the transition adjustment. With this framework, we ended the quarter at 17.8% CET1 under the CECL transition rules, 250 basis points above last year's level of 15.3%. The Tier 1 capital ratio was 18.7% under the CECL transition rules compared to 16.3% last year. The total capital ratio increased 250 basis points to 20.1%. And the Tier 1 capital plus reserves ratio on a fully phased-in basis was 28% compared to 26.5% last year, reflecting the impact of the retained net income.
During the quarter, we returned $521 million to shareholders, which included $393 million in share repurchases and paid a common stock dividend of $0.22 per share. During the quarter, we also announced the approval of a $2.9 billion share repurchase program through June 2022 as well as our plans to maintain our regular quarterly dividend.
Our business generates a considerable amount of capital, thanks to the scalability of our digital capabilities, the utility of our diversified product suite and the prioritization of growth at attractive risk-adjusted returns. We will continue to take an opportunistic approach to returning capital to shareholders as our business performance and market conditions allow, subject to our capital plan and any regulatory restrictions.
As we exit the pandemic and the environment normalizes, we are confident in our capabilities and positioning of our business. We are emerging from this period as a stronger and more dynamic company, and we're excited about the opportunities we see to drive strong financial results and shareholder value.
I will now turn the call back over to Brian for his final thoughts."

Consumer confidence continues to build, the trends on retail sales and spending. All of that is translating into really good spend on our cards. So as we look across our 5 platforms, it really is broad-based. 35% purchase volume growth year-over-year, really strong across all 5 platforms. The fact that we were up 18% versus 2019, I think, is a really good indication. So it's not just that we're comping against a weak 2020, it really is broad-based growth across the company.
And then as you look at kind of per account, purchase volume per account was up 33%. So that's another positive indicator. And then this is a little more anecdotal, but as we talked to our partners, no matter what segment we're in, they're seeing a lot of pent-up demand to spend. The providers in CareCredit, their booking appointments now 3, 4 months out. They're opening the practices on Saturdays and Sundays to keep up with the volume. So I know that's a little more anecdotal, but as our teams are out every day talking to the partners that are in the stores, they're just seeing and feeling a lot of pent-up demand to spend.
I don't know, Brian, if you want to add to that a little bit on."

You again saw that lift here in the end of the first quarter into the second quarter with the stimulus actions. We began -- we see now across the 29 largest banks that are beginning to trail down a little bit. So some of those will come back in line clearly, with the spending behavior patterns as well as the increase in the financial obligations as mortgage forbearance, auto forbearances and the enhanced unemployment benefits begin to fade here in the back half of the year."

So the lack of the page I wouldn't confuse with the fact that we're changing that framework. Again, I think when you look at what we put out in the first quarter, we highlighted the continued high payment rates that would impact loan growth in the first half of the year, and that's going to continue. We do think it begins to abate in the back half of the year. So I think from the purchase volume and receivable growth standpoint, it's the same. Clearly, the elevated payment rate and persistency of that will provide a little bit of headwind in net interest margin as we move into the back half of the year.
From a credit perspective, the higher payment rate really has given us, what I'd say, almost pristine-type credit. So I think you'll see in the back half of the year and really for the full year for the company, we're going to be sub-4% on a loss rate perspective, which is remarkable for this business given the high margins. And then the RSA, following those trends, will be a little bit more elevated in the back half of the year, which, again, is working as it's designed to share in the upside performance of the company. So that's how I think about it. It's largely consistent with what we've said back in the first quarter, so."

They love the QR code, the ability to split payments and share. And so that program is off to a great start. It's still early, but all of the key indicators that we look at are performing really well.
And similarly on Verizon, this is another program for us that will be a top 10 program in the future, performing ahead of our expectations. I think great feedback on the val prop. It's definitely behaving like a top-of-wallet card, which is what we intended. That was the goal. And so we're seeing really good spend on Verizon products and even -- and outside as well.

I think, obviously, there are always new entrants in the buy now, pay later space. I think it's pretty clear at this point that every financial service provider out there will offer a buy now, pay later product. Equal pay financing is a big part of our business already. We highlighted we do over $15 billion of balances currently on equal pay products. We offer those products over 70,000 locations. So our goal at the end of the day is to have a multiproduct, multi-capability solution. I think ultimately, that's what's going to win. And that's what we're offering to our providers.
In terms of the competitive dynamics, it's hard to tell how others are underwriting. What I can tell you is we've been in this business a long time. It is really important to stay disciplined, which means you don't go a lot deeper in really good times and you try not to contract too much in bad times because we know that our partners really value that stability, the consistency of our underwriting, and they get used to a certain approval rate, and we try to protect that in both good times and bad times.
And as we all know, if you've been in this business a long time, if you do take on substantially more risk and you're winning business by lowering your underwriting standards, and that's a losing strategy over the long term. And so that's not how we operate. We've got a very experienced, disciplined credit team. And look, we want to win business based on our products and capabilities, based on our technology, our partnership model.

I think the -- a lot of our partners are still in kind of the evaluation phase, where they look at the buy now, pay later product, and they obviously see a customer desire for that product, right, and a customer demand for it. But one of the big questions is, as you pointed out, it's around economics. And it's still early there. And I think some retailers are willing to pay what is a pretty steep merchant discount rate if they believe that they're attracting new customers and they're getting sales that they wouldn't otherwise get. But when they look at that comparison, they look at compared to some of our products where not only do we not charge interchange, we're also paying them quite a bit through the RSA, and they look at that and they say, okay, clearly, economically, they would prefer that the purchase goes on the private label card or a co-brand card because it's much better for them financially. And so to the extent that they stop believing that they're actually getting incremental purchases or new customers, then the economic trade-off is very clear. And so I do think down the road, there's an economic reckoning that will happen, as this plays out, and it's still early in terms of these products and how they're offered.
The other thing I would mention is that the other advantage and the things that we hear from our partners is they like the lifetime relationship that a card provides. They can do life cycle marketing. They can do promotions and offers over a number of years. And one of the things that we talk a lot about with our partners and one of the things that we measure across all of our partners' repeat purchases. And we talked to you guys a lot about that as well because that has been a big focus for us over the last 5 years. And one of the things that, frankly, our partners look to us for is that ongoing customer loyalty. We measure that. We look at it by customer. When was the last time they made a purchase. Okay, let's send them a customized offer, a promotion. So they really like that ability to do that life cycle marketing. So I think it's a combination of economics, and that's still kind of a TBD on how all this is going to shake out. But the other thing that we hear across the board is they want to have a long-term relationship with the customer. They really value the loyalty that a lot of our products provide."

So the way I would think about it, let's take liquidity first in the portfolio. So clearly, we've been able to burn off some of that liquidity here in the second quarter, both through the $2 billion in asset growth that we had as well as the acceleration of some of the maturities in the funding profile. So we're running over $2 billion continued excess liquidity as we enter into the back half of the year. If you take out all the excess liquidity from here, there's probably another 40 basis points on to the net interest margin that you'd see a lift from.
Again, we've highlighted before, you probably have 20 to 30 basis points from benchmark rates, so put that off to the side. The residual comes in probably 2 fashions. One is late fees, which you're probably 80 to 90 basis points of lift going back to a normalized late fee load. So not even at a loss rate higher than 5.5%, but your normal load. And then you have the residual which will be -- they'Il revolve when payer rates come back in line. So the only thing I'd say is we do not see anything in the portfolio today that gives us any indication that the net interest margin in that 16% realm is not going to be the mean that we go back to, and we'll continue to watch it, but there's nothing fundamentally or structurally that we think is different. It's just really the timing to get there given the excess liquidity that the consumer has and that they're going to deploy here in the short term."

First, in terms of, to your point, the products and capabilities that we offer tend to align better by industry. And even more important than that, how we integrate the products and capabilities and how we integrate them into the digital environment or the store footprint tends to align as well by industry. So one example for our purely digital players, PayPal, Venmo, Amazon, we're integrating through our API technology or through SyPi right inside of their app. And that's different than what we would do in home and auto, where for some of our larger partners, we're integrating both in their digital environment, mobile, online, but we also have tools and technologies to apply and buy in-store.
And so because the product suite tends to be catered more towards industry because of the types of products that they're selling as well as whether or not they're purely digital or have a store footprint, it just made more sense to aligned by industry. I'd say the second piece of this, and we saw this in CareCredit over the last 30 years, it really is an advantage to get really deep domain expertise in an industry. And one of the things that I think has been a secret to our success in CareCredit is that domain expertise. Our teams get -- they built lifetime relationships. They get really deep in the different domains that we support dental that, et cetera. And we're trying to replicate that in these other platforms. So those were the 2 primary reasons. I can tell you, it's been great just a couple of months in having these teams in place, looking at these segments differently, seeing kind of natural synergies and ideas for new products and capabilities as they're out talking to partners and thinking about it more with an industry bend to it. So far, the progress has been really great."

Inside of each of those platforms, we have start-up programs where we're relatively small percentage of the payments inside of those programs, and we have very mature programs, where we can be 30%, 40% pen. What I can tell you is we measure our teams on increasing that penetration rate regardless of where they're at. So even for the more mature programs, our teams that are embedded inside of our partners, they get measured based on growth and driving that incremental tender share. So even in mature programs, we are very focused on that, the penetration rate. Brian, if you want to take the second piece of that?"

Synchrony's omnichannel capabilities enable our partners and customers to connect wherever and whenever they want to be met and the variety of financing options and value propositions we offer empowers them with choice. As we continue to anticipate and deliver on the needs of our partners and customers, we drive more value and greater utilization. 
This translated to an 11% increase in purchase volume per active account during the third quarter and 16% growth in total purchase volume compared to last year. Of course, this strength in purchase volume was largely offset by the persistently elevated payment rate trends resulting from government stimulus and industry-wide forbearance actions leading to a 2% increase in loans, including loans held for sale. 
Net interest margin of 15.45% was 165 basis points higher than last year, primarily reflecting a reduction in excess liquidity. Operating expenses were down 10% compared to last year and down 7% year-to-date as our cost efficiency initiatives continue as planned. 
We remain on track to reduce about $210 million from our expense base by year-end, even as we continue to invest in our business. The efficiency ratio was 38.7% for the quarter, largely flat with last year. 
Credit continued to perform very well. Net charge-offs were 2.18% for the third quarter, down 224 basis points from last year. Net earnings were $1.1 billion or $2 per diluted share and included a $0.33 benefit from the reserve release related to the reclassification of the GAAP portfolio to held for sale. 
Turning to our balance sheet. Deposits were down $3 billion or 5% versus last year, reflecting retail deposit rate actions we took to manage our excess liquidity. Deposits represented 82% of our funding mix at quarter end, a slight increase versus last year due to the retirement of debt. 
During the quarter, we've returned $1.4 billion in capital through share repurchases of $1.3 billion and $124 million in common stock dividends. We also continue to reinvest in our business. 
As we highlighted during our recent Investor Day, our ability to remain nimble and adapt to the ever-changing consumer finance landscape has been driven by our continued investment in our product suite and our innovative digital capabilities. 
In fact, if you think about the last decade alone, the introduction of digital wallets, point-of-sale financing and a greater variety of installment offerings, just to name a few has demonstrated the importance of diversity, accessibility and utility in both products and experience. 
EnsoSynchrony has continuously evolved adding new financing options, enhancing our technology platform and expanding our channels and distribution networks in order to reach and serve more partners and customers in sustainable ways that drive greater value for all. 
In addition to launching new products and partner programs, we are remaining focused on innovative ways to get scaled distribution of our product suite. Last week, we announced our expanded strategic partnership with Fiserv through which small businesses will now be able to access Synchrony products and services and accept private label credit card payments via the Clover point-of-sale and business management platform from Fiserv. 
This will enable accelerated growth for small businesses, empowering merchants to attract more customers and generate more revenue by offering our customers greater flexibility and choice in how they make purchases. We will also explore additional opportunities to cross-sell Synchrony products to existing Clover merchants. 
Importantly, this strategic partnership also deepened Synchrony's ecosystem and reinforces our growth strategy to expand and accelerate innovative product offerings through additional distribution channels. It builds on our momentum to bring our products to merchants faster and leverages Synchrony's leadership in financing, analytics and services. 
We're excited to utilize the point-of-sale innovations driven by Clover to continue to transform the way people purchase while helping merchants grow. Furthermore, as we and our partners here to provide more comprehensive customer access to financial products and resources, we are excited to expand our partnership with PayPal. 
As announced in late September, Synchrony will be launching PayPal Savings, a new PayPal-branded savings account. This unique opportunity will allow us to expand the distribution of our savings product to a unique set of customers with features and functionality inside the PayPal app, delivering an enhanced customer experience while also further diversifying our deposit base at an attractively low cost to acquire. 
In addition to our ongoing efforts to expand both our product suite and distribution network, we also seek to enhance partner and customer engagement through customized value positions and omnichannel capabilities. We recently launched 2 industry-first retail health and wellness credit cards, the -- myWalgreens MasterCard and -- myWalgreens private label credit card, which reward customers with savings on future health and wellness purchases. 
myWalgreens credit cardholders can earn 10% Walgreens Cash Rewards on eligible Walgreens branded products and 5% Walgreens cash rewards on other eligible brands and pharmacy purchases. myWalgreens MasterCard holders can also earn 3% of Walgreens cash rewards on eligible grocery and health and wellness purchases everywhere else, including health care providers and 1% Walgreens cash rewards on eligible purchases anywhere MasterCard credit cards are accepted. 
In a world where consumers are increasingly responsible for a greater proportion of their health-related costs. We believe these value propositions will drive considerable value while also providing greater financing flexibility for health-related needs and enhancing loyalty over time. 
Furthermore, Synchrony's digital capabilities allow us to seamlessly engage with customers wherever they are. We have deep digital integration across the Walgreens web, mobile and native app channels with the ability for customers to apply and instantly buy through all of these channels. 
We've launched frictionless customer experiences, leveraging technology capabilities like QR codes, Quick screen, which is a real-time prescreen of 1, customer-initiated prequalification, a directed device in-store application process, card servicing integrated seamlessly into the Walgreens app and API integration with the myWalgreens loyalty program. 
And while it's early, the initial data we're seeing indicates that both the value prop and dynamic customer experience we have achieved with Walgreens are resonating very well with cardholders and driving spend both inside and outside of Walgreens in categories such as grocery, health and wellness. 
By empowering our partners and customers with best-in-class wallet optionality and compelling outcomes, Synchrony is increasingly well positioned as the partner of choice. With more than 65 million active accounts, Synchrony has market-leading reach and deep diverse lending insights that enable us to better anticipate the needs of customers and therefore, which financing options will optimize utilization and drive lifetime value. 
So whether it comes in the form of our dual co-branded and private label credit cards, our various EPA installment products or our Synchrony Mastercard we deeply understand when, why and how customers seek financing solutions for their day-to-day purchases. 
We're particularly excited about the opportunity we see for our Synchrony MasterCard, which allows us to tap into the $500 billion general purpose credit card market. We are taking a measured approach to growth. However, by leveraging our scale and underwriting expertise, we've been able to identify better performing customer segments, acquire more customers at lower CPAs and fine-tune our channel strategy over the last 2 years. 
Today, Synchrony Mastercard offers a variety of value propositions, which we use in combination with our pricing strategy to expand our customer reach and optimize conversion. And we have great digital utility through dApply and integration in Apple Wallet as well as our mobile app. 
This allows customers to access their various bank products, their money market and high-yield savings accounts as well as our credit card balances and transaction data. This value proposition and seamless digital experience resonates very well with our customer, leading to purchase volume growth of 36% versus the same period in 2019. 
We're also seeing higher levels of engagement around the product and brand as spend per active account is up 40% versus 2019. So we're very excited about our Synchrony Mastercard. 
It's an important offering within our product suite strategy, that we believe will enable us to capture a larger portion of customers' top of wallet spend and which to drive highly scalable growth and above average returns to our business over the long term. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."
260334235,1682810764,2407323,"Synchrony Financial, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2021",2021-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Synchrony Financial","Executives","Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone.  Synchrony's third quarter financial results reflected broad-based strength across our business, highlighted by a double-digit purchase volume increase and continued loan growth, a significant improvement in our",2155,"Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone.  Synchrony's third quarter financial results reflected broad-based strength across our business, highlighted by a double-digit purchase volume increase and continued loan growth, a significant improvement in our net interest margin, historically low losses and delinquencies and continued cost discipline. 
The combination of these results led to $1.1 billion in net earnings or $2 per diluted share, a return on average assets of 4.9% and a return on tangible common equity of 40.1%. These results are a true testament to the power of Synchrony's unique business model, which builds on our deep domain expertise in consumer lending and leverages dynamic digital capabilities, delivered through our comprehensive multiproduct suite to reach and serve a deep and diverse universe of partners and customers. 
Looking at our third quarter performance in greater detail, beginning with purchase volume, which grew 16% compared to last year and 16% compared to 2019, excluding Walmart, demonstrates clear broad-based strength in consumer demand. This is also reflected in our purchase volume per account, which increased 11% compared to last year. 
Dual Card and co-branded cards accounted for 40% of the purchase volume in the third quarter and increased 29% from the prior year. On a loan receivable basis, excluding the impact of the reclassification of the GAAP portfolio to held for sale, dual and co-branded cards accounted for 24% of the portfolio and increased 4% from the prior year. 
Average active accounts increased 5% compared to last year, and new accounts increased 17%, totaling more than 6 million new accounts in the third quarter and over 17.5 million new accounts year-to-date. In late August, we reached an agreement for the sale of the GAAP portfolio, which led to the reclassification of $3.5 billion of loan receivables to held for sale and therefore reduce our ending loan receivables balance. 
Excluding the impact of the reclassification, loan receivables would have increased by 2% versus the prior year as the period strong purchase volume growth was largely offset by a persistently elevated payment rate. Payment rate for the third quarter was approximately 200 basis points higher when compared to the last year. 
Interest and fees on loans increased 2% compared to last year, reflecting similar growth in average loan receivables. Net interest income was 6% higher than last year, primarily reflecting a decline in interest expense due to lower benchmark rates. 
RSAs were $1.3 billion in the third quarter and 6.38% of average receivables. The $367 million year-over-year increase primarily reflected the impact of lower provision for credit losses and continued strong program performance including growth and improvement in net interest income. 
To put this in context, remember that our RSAs are designed to align interest between ourselves and each of our partners. This means driving growth at attractive risk-adjusted returns enhancing program profitability. This allows each partner to share the program's performance, so when profitability expands, our partners participate in that upside. 
So now when you think about the combined $1.4 billion year-over-year improvement in net interest income, net losses and the reserve change, we shared $367 million of that through the RSA. Focusing on our credit performance provision for losses was $25 million. 
Included in this quarter's provision was a reserve release of $407 million, which incorporated our continued strength in credit performance a more optimistic macroeconomic environment and the impact of reclassifying our GAAP portfolio loan receivables to held for sale. 
This resulted in a reserve reduction of approximately $247 million. Other income decreased $37 million, generally reflecting higher loyalty program cost from higher purchase volume during the quarter. Other expense decreased $106 million compared to the prior year. As you recall, last year, we recognized an $89 million restructuring charge, and we continue to see favorability from lower operational losses. 
Moving to Slide 8 in our platform results. We saw a broad-based purchase volume growth across all 5 platforms, reflecting strong consumer demand. Our home and auto, diversified in value digital and health and wellness platforms each experienced double-digit year-over-year growth in purchase volume. The 10% year-over-year increase in home and auto was generally driven by strong retailer performance across almost all verticals, while purchase volume and diversified value increased 25%, reflecting the continued return to in-person retail experiences. 
In digital, the 21% increase was due to broad-based growth across our partners coupled with growth in our new programs with Verizon and Venmo. In health and wellness, the 10% growth in purchase volume primarily reflected consumers being more comfortable with the environment and undergoing planned procedures. 
Meanwhile, purchase volume grew a more modest 2% in lifestyle, reflecting broad-based growth across the platform, but having a tough comparable to last year's strong growth in powersports. Loan receivable growth trends by platform generally reflected modest growth rates versus the prior year as higher purchase volume was largely offset by elevated payment rates.  The 1 exception being in our diversified value platform, which was impacted by store closures in 2020. 
Average active account trends range on a platform basis up by as much as 10% diversified value and 7% in digital, while home and auto and health and wellness average active accounts were generally flat. The active account growth and diversified value largely reflected the return to in-store retail experiences. 
Digital active accounts were up versus prior year due to greater engagement across our existing customer base as well as the impact of recent program launches. Interest and fee trends were generally improved across the platform with the exception of diversified value, which is down due to lower receivables. 
I'll move to Slide 9 to discuss net interest income and margin trends. The accumulated savings by consumers resulting from stimulus, forbearance and lower discretionary spending continued to impact the payment rates during the third quarter. Payment rates were approximately 260 basis points higher than our 5-year historical average. That said, we've begun to see some signs of moderation in certain cohorts as payment rate was about 200 basis points higher year-over-year compared to almost 300 basis points higher year-over-year comparison in the second quarter. We expect the payment rate to gradually normalize as consumer spending remains robust, excess savings have peaked and widespread forbearance dissipates. 
Interest and fees were up approximately 2% in the third quarter, reflect the average loan receivable growth. Net interest income increased 6% from last year, reflecting the year-over-year improvement in interest and fees as well as lower interest expense for the period. The net interest margin was 15.45% compared to last year's margin of 13.8%, a 165 basis point improvement year-over-year driven by the mix of interest-earning assets and favorable interest-bearing liabilities costs. 
More specifically, the mix of loan receivables as a percent of total earning assets 550 basis points from 78.3% to 83.8% driven by lower liquidity held during the quarter. This accounted for a 106 basis point increase in our net interest margin. Interest-bearing liabilities costs were 1.31%, a year-over-year improvement of 59 basis points primarily due to lower benchmark rates and funding mix. This provided a 51 basis point increase in our net interest margin. 
The loan receivables yield was 19.59%, a year-over-year improvement of 10 basis points. This resulted in an 8 basis point improvement in our net interest margin. Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 10. 
First, let's discuss our delinquency trends, where higher payment trends have continued to drive year-over-year improvements. Our 30-plus delinquency rate was 2.42% compared to 2.67% last year. Our 90-plus delinquency rate was 1.05% compared to 1.24% last year. It should be noted that removing the impact of the GAAP program from the third quarter of this year and last year, the 30-plus delinquency metric would have been down about 40 basis points versus 25 basis points and the 90-plus metric would be down about 25 basis points instead of 19 basis points. 
And in terms of our portfolio's loss performance, our net charge-off rate was 2.18% compared to 4.42% last year. This year-over-year improvement was primarily driven by strong delinquency trends we've experienced. Our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was 11.28%. 
Let's move to Slide 11 and discuss expenses. Overall expenses were down $106 million or 10% from last year to $961 million, primarily reflecting the impact of the prior year's restructuring charge of $89 million and lower operational losses. The efficiency ratio for the third quarter was 38.7% compared to 39.7% last year. This metric remains elevated relative to our historical average due to lower revenue resulting from the impact of higher payment rate and lower average receivables. 
We continue to maintain our disciplined focus on cost containment while we make strategic investments in our business to deepen our competitive advantage and drive long-term value for shareholders. Moving to Slide 12. Given the reduction in loan receivables in 2020 and early 2021, coupled with the strength of our deposit platform, we continue to carry a higher level of liquidity. 
While we believe it's prudent to maintain a higher liquidity level during uncertain and volatile periods, we continue to actively manage our funding profile to mitigate excess liquidity and optimize our funding profile. As a result of this strategy, there was a shift in our funding mix during the third quarter. 
Our deposits declined by $3.2 billion from last year and our securitized and unsecured funding sources declined by $3 billion. This resulted in deposits being 82% of our funding compared to 80% last year with securitized and unsecured funding, each comprising 9% of our funding sources at quarter end. 
Total liquidity, including undrawn credit facilities, was $18.4 billion, which equated to 20% of our total assets, down from 28% last year. Before I provide detail on our capital position, it should be noted that we elected to take the benefit of the transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies, which has 2 primary benefits. 
First, it delays the effect of the CECL transition adjustment for an incremental 2 years; and second, it allows for a portion of the current period provisioning to be deferred and amortized with the transition adjustment. With this framework, we ended the quarter at 17.1% CET1 under the CECL transition rules, 130 basis points above last year's level of 15.8%. 
The Tier 1 capital ratio was 18% of the CECL transition rules compared to 16.7% last year. The total capital ratio increased 120 basis points to 19.3%. And the Tier 1 capital plus reserves ratio on a fully phased-in basis decreased to 26.6% compared to 27.3% last year. 
During the quarter, we returned $1.4 billion to shareholders which included $1.3 billion in share repurchases and $124 million in common stock dividends. Our business generates strong returns and considerable capital resulting from our commitment to drive growth at appropriate risk-adjusted returns, the scalability of our technology platform and our ongoing cost discipline. 
We will continue to take the opportunistic approach to returning our excess capital to shareholders as our business performance and market conditions allow, subject to our capital plan and any regulatory restrictions. Finally, let me focus on our outlook for the fourth quarter, which is summarized on Slide 13 of our presentation. 
While there are a number of external variables that are difficult to predict with precision, we generally expect the third quarter's key operating trends to be stable in the fourth quarter. Underpinning our forecast is a stable and improving macroeconomic environment and the pandemic continue to be largely in control. 
We expect strong consumer demand through the holiday season to support continued strength in purchase volume. This strength partially offset by continued elevation of payment rates should lead to a modest growth in receivables. Our net interest margin will likely be consistent with 3Q '21. Our provision for credit losses will continue to reflect the impact of asset growth, credit performance and macroeconomic factors as well as continued reserve reductions related to the GAAP portfolio. 
As credit losses begin to normalize, we expect the RSA as a percent of average loan receivables to begin to moderate. Lastly, turning to our operating expense. We expect the acceleration in purchase volume to contribute to a slight sequential increase in absolute dollars for the fourth quarter. That said, we continue to expect the full year operating expenses to be down compared to 2020.  
As we close out the year and look forward to the future, we're excited about the opportunities we see to continue to drive strong financial results and shareholder value. We are well positioned to execute on the strategy we laid out during our Investor Day and drive sustainable growth and attractive risk-adjusted returns, simply by continuing to leverage our inherent core strengths, the breadth and depth of our business model, the scalability of our innovative digital capabilities and customer lifetime value expansion we drive through our diversified product suite and powerful value propositions. 
I'll now turn the call back over to Brian for his final thoughts."

Let me start and then Brian can jump in if he has other comments, Betsy. What I would say is, in comparison to general purpose cards, they had a larger dip and larger exposures to some T&E and some other purchases that we did not drop as much as them last year. 
So I think when we look at the purchase volume, first of all, it's broad-based across all our platforms. We have seen really solid performance. The exception being lifestyle, which again had a very difficult comp last year with regard to powersports and outdoor power equipment. But when we looked at it through the quarter, it was actually incredibly consistent from the first week of the quarter and each week as we moved throughout the quarter, and that's really extended in here through the first couple of weeks of October. 
So we are very pleased about the activity level on the card it's very broad-based. Even the exposure that we had to with travel and entertainment, we saw that pop up with our travel being up 75% on our either co-branded card or the Synchrony Mastercard. Restaurants were up 44%. So we're seeing that growth, but our business is very consistent, and we think that's really strength as we kind of move through here into the fourth quarter."

I just wanted to hone in on the RSI and understand how we should be thinking about that, realize that the profitability of the programs is up this quarter given the strength in NIM and given the strength in credit. I guess I'm wondering, as I think forward, how to think about that RSA trajectory because the rate of change in those 2 categories obviously starts to come down and credit starts to build. But then at the same time, there's marketing and other types of expenses that come into that RSA. And I'm wondering how I should think through the degree to which -- what's the new that you think we should be angling to."

So Betsy, and I just want to go back, continue to ground home the fact that the RSAs are working as they're designed, right, where the profitability of the company as it expands, we're going to share more in the RSA. So that is by design. It's the buffer we all want when in the downside is, but we prefer the upside. 
So right now, we're just going to -- we're going to pay more. So I think as you think about the trajectory as you move forward, right, it's going to move more in line with the NIM of the business and the net charge-offs, right? So we would expect charge-offs here probably at a trough and would be able to go up. 
So as the charge-offs begin to increase, that's going to go directly through and there's not really a lag effect when it comes to charge-offs through the RSA. And I think as you think about the margin of the business and the revenue side of the business, as delinquencies begin to rise, your revenue goes up, so that will flow through. And then we just start to get the write-offs come through the NIM will come down a little bit. 
So I think it's going to move, hopefully, in parallel. The only lag effect is on the change in reserves. But it should move with the business. And again, we think we're probably at the trough on delinquencies now, but we'll see how it develops. But we're pleased with the performance. We're pleased with how the RSA actually moved because it moved in line with the business -- the business results."

It's clearly going to be over-indexed in terms of online sales. That's speaking kind of particularly to our digital partners as they become a larger share of the overall business. But I will say that for some of the more traditional partners that we have, we have been, I believe, instrumental in helping them transform their footprint to be more digital. So that has been a big part of what we've tried to do, particularly over the last couple of years in response to the pandemic. 
Many of our partners had to close stores. They moved a lot of their sales online, and we're a big part of how they were able to meet that need and transform their businesses. So certainly leverage going forward, right?"

So I think if I were to lay out for you 2 cases on delinquency, the first being a little bit more conservative, which says you have a more sharper rise in delinquency that would begin starting here in the fourth quarter, would peak third quarter next year and result in that charge-off peak in the first quarter of '23. 
So that's a more conservative case. And the basis for that case becomes 1 where as you have individuals coming off of consumers coming off of forbearance, government assistance, rent or forbearance that they have not been able to sustain enough savings in order to avoid that. So that's a sharper case, a more conservative case. 
A more optimistic case, I would say you would see a slower rise in delinquencies as you move through to '22 into '23. And then really your loss rate comes back in line end of '23 into '24. And I say in line being back to the mean a call 5.5%. 
So it's a much more gradual rise. And that premises on the fact that the consumers were able to build up enough savings so that when the financial obligations come back online for them, they're able to continue to pay their bills and meet it. So those are kind of the bookends that I would think about."

So things are still really expensive out there, both in terms of capabilities as well as businesses. 
So we're certainly looking at a number of things, I'd say, existing businesses where we can leverage our scale to grow those businesses. I think Allegro Credit is a great example of that. Pets Best, a great example of that, where we're able to leverage our scale in CareCredit and health and wellness and buy those businesses and really growing well, which we shared a little bit at Investor Day around how we did that.

And then just how does it play into the business model, like the revenues and expenses on a go-forward basis? Does the complexion of those revenues change? Or how should we think about it?"

One is very focused on products. And we spent a lot of time on this at Investor Day. We believe we have the most comprehensive product suite out there whether it's private label, dual, co-brand cards, buy now, pay later, short- and long-term installment. 
And so we feel like that is obviously really important given the diversity of our partner set and what they want from us. The other really important part of the strategy is really around distribution of those financial products. So this is -- think about integration into the merchants and providers making it easier to apply for those products and really getting that scale. 
So it's 1 thing to have the products, but you've got to have the distribution channels as well. And so if you go back over time, we do a lot in terms of direct partner integration. So that's leveraging our API Synchrony plug-in, et cetera. But in some cases, we're looking to expand distribution through practice management systems like Epic.  Any time we can build a solution once and reach thousands of merchants, we absolutely want to do that. And that's really what Clover does for us. With the development of a single app, we can reach thousands of merchants we can tap into their roughly $180 billion of GPV. 
So we think this is a big opportunity and allows us to do something once and get immediate scale. And so if they're -- we're looking -- we're actively looking at other opportunities to do that for our products. But this is really -- think about it as really a two-pronged approach. You got to have the product set. But then you got to have a distribution channel or a set of distribution channels that allow you to scale quickly and get those products made available to our merchants and their customers."

Now again, CECL day 1 was 10%. We never actually had a normal quarter under CECL. But if you use that as a guidepost, that's where we would expect to move back towards. So you're right, there will be some rate, but again, asset builds will dominate. So the reserve provisioning there may be reserve builds that come that are partially offset by more normal rate reductions as you move closer depending upon how -- again, how credit performs and how the macroeconomic looks. But it won't avoid reserve builds if you're in an asset increasing environment."

So why don't we just take a step back, though. I think I'll break -- buy now, pay later into a couple of categories because I think right now, everything is getting lumped into to buy now, pay later. And as we've indicated in the past, we do about $1",766,"Yes. So why don't we just take a step back, though. I think I'll break -- buy now, pay later into a couple of categories because I think right now, everything is getting lumped into to buy now, pay later. And as we've indicated in the past, we do about $15 billion of installment, both short and long term. 
We offer those products in about 70,000 locations today. And I really think about it in 2 buckets. First, you've got what we call closed-end installment or buy now, pay later, that's growing really well for us. So that is just a closed-end loan, very simple, a number of different durations. 
And if you look over the past 3 years from 2017 to 2020, the purchase volume on those closed-end products have grown at about 46% a year. So we're definitely seeing really good traction there. We have buy now, pay later in market today with partners like Tolo, American Signature, Electronics Express, that's branded as set pay. 
And then we talked at Investor Day that starting in October, we will have our Pay in 4 product available for partners. So we're in discussions with them right now and talking about integration plans and getting that in market. I will tell you, to your point, they are focused on exactly what you said, which is how does this product compete with the products that they currently offer. 
And at Investor Day, we talked a lot about the economic equation for our partners. And I can tell you that is something that -- I think 6 to 9 months ago, they weren't all that focused on, but right now, they're very focused on it. So they're looking at the trade-offs between traditional product where they might earn an RSA and how does that compare to a short- or long-term installment product of pay in 4 where they're paying a merchant discount. 
And so I think the way this is going to play out is -- there's going to be a lot of kind of testing and learning and seeing how these products kind of work together, what the customer uptake is. And then at the end of the day, what the economic equation is back to the partner. So that's 1 big bucket of what we call installment, closed-end buy now, pay later. 
The other thing that we talked about is the buy now, pay later option or installment option that we offer on our cards, so on a revolving account. And this is where we continue to see a lot of really strong interest from our partners. And part of what they like about that is you can actually do multiple installment loans or buy now, pay later loans without an additional credit check or application process. 
It also gives the customer the ability to when they want to just make a regular purchase not on an installment basis and take advantage of the value prop. So save 5%, for instance, at Amazon. And what we've seen is customers really like to have that optionality. So for some purchases, they want to put it on a 6-month or a 12-month equal pay, buy now, pay later product. In some cases, they want to take advantage of the value prop. And what's nice about that product is it allows you to do both and really gives the customer that choice at the end of the day. 
The partners on their side, they really like that because it allows them to do more life cycle marketing, right? So they can push out offers and promotions around holiday and things like that. So they like that life cycle relationship that they're able to maintain with the customer. So look, at the end of the day, I think every one of our partners is looking at this a little bit differently. They're looking at the interplay between these products or looking at the economic equation. 
I think the good news is if you take a step back and you see how we're positioned. We have a very comprehensive suite of products. We can sit down with a partner and they can basically choose from a menu in terms of what they want to offer. And we can lay out for them an economic equation what we think it's going to do to their sales, et cetera. So I feel like we're very well positioned. We've got the product suite. We've got the ability to integrate quickly with our partners. And we think over time, the multiproduct strategy is the winning one."

And as we move into the fourth quarter, again, that rate is going to continue to be elevated. I'd point you to a couple of things as we think about payment rate and the trends. We've done a lot of analysis to try to make sure that we -- as we look at it, that we believe it's going to revert back to the mean. And everything we have seen still leads us to that conclusion that there is a reversion back in the meaning there are a couple of, what I would call, underlying data points that I would try to point you to. 
Number one, as we look at the savings rates for consumers, they are drifting down to a more normalized level in pre pandemic. And we look at that both as the big money center banks as well as the digitally oriented banks than what we see with regard to movement in our savings account. 
So one, savings is coming down. Savings rate is coming down, which, again, part of that's going to be the high purchase volume. The second, we start to look at cohorts inside of our portfolio. We do see very slight movements down. So for instance, if you looked at a product level, our dual card product sequentially second quarter to third quarter had a slight decline in the payment rate on a product level. 
That's a higher FICO customer that is beginning to migrate back down. When you look at it with regard to accounts that either pay, full pay between full pay or statement balance and min pay and then statement balance or less than statement balances across all those categories, we've seen slight reduction in that payment rate. So if you think about the people who paid statement balances, that is slightly lower third quarter versus second.  
The people are playing between statement balance and min balance that is lower in the third quarter than the second quarter. And then the min pay is up slightly, third quarter versus second and then the people paying less than the min pay is up slightly. 
So I think as we start seeing it very slight movements, those are movements that would tell us that the payment rate is going to move back towards the mean that we experienced pre pandemic. We're starting to see a little bit of signs there."

But I would imagine that our deposit funding rate will remain elevated versus the 70% to 75% that we historically have guided to. I think also there's an opportunity with our PayPal savings product to continue to broaden the reach to customers in retail. So we're excited about that when it comes out in the coming months. 
So we're going to continue to focus on trying to optimize the cost, but we also want to maintain access to the deep markets where that's secured, unsecured. As we begin to get the capital stack in order, we would probably access additional preferreds to build out the capital stack of the company and get down to our target level.

The power of Synchrony's model continued to show through in our third quarter financial results. We continue to reach and serve more partners and customers.

The power of Synchrony's model continued to show through in our third quarter financial results. We continue to reach and serve more partners and customers. New accounts grew 17% to $6.2 million and average active accounts increased 5% to 67.2 million during the period. This is in large part attributable to the powerful combination of our data-driven insights, our seamless customer experiences and our industry-leading product suite, which resonates deeply with customers.
Synchrony's omnichannel capabilities enable our partners and customers to connect wherever and whenever they want to be met and the variety of financing options and value propositions we offer empowers them with choice. As we continue to anticipate and deliver on the needs of our partners and customers, we drive more value and greater utilization.  
This translated to an 11% increase in purchase volume per active account during the third quarter and 16% growth in total purchase volume compared to last year. Of course, this strength in purchase volume was largely offset by the persistently elevated payment rate trends resulting from government stimulus and industry-wide forbearance actions leading to a 2% increase in loans, including loans held for sale.  
Net interest margin of 15.45% was 165 basis points higher than last year, primarily reflecting a reduction in excess liquidity. Operating expenses were down 10% compared to last year and down 7% year-to-date as our cost efficiency initiatives continue as planned.  
We remain on track to reduce about $210 million from our expense base by year-end, even as we continue to invest in our business. The efficiency ratio was 38.7% for the quarter, largely flat with last year.  
Credit continued to perform very well. Net charge-offs were 2.18% for the third quarter, down 224 basis points from last year. Net earnings were $1.1 billion or $2 per diluted share and included a $0.33 benefit from the reserve release related to the reclassification of the GAAP portfolio to held for sale.  
Turning to our balance sheet. Deposits were down $3 billion or 5% versus last year, reflecting retail deposit rate actions we took to manage our excess liquidity. Deposits represented 82% of our funding mix at quarter end, a slight increase versus last year due to the retirement of debt.  
During the quarter, we've returned $1.4 billion in capital through share repurchases of $1.3 billion and $124 million in common stock dividends. We also continue to reinvest in our business.  
As we highlighted during our recent Investor Day, our ability to remain nimble and adapt to the ever-changing consumer finance landscape has been driven by our continued investment in our product suite and our innovative digital capabilities.  
In fact, if you think about the last decade alone, the introduction of digital wallets, point-of-sale financing and a greater variety of installment offerings, just to name a few has demonstrated the importance of diversity, accessibility and utility in both products and experience.  
And so Synchrony has continuously evolved adding new financing options, enhancing our technology platform and expanding our channels and distribution networks in order to reach and serve more partners and customers in sustainable ways that drive greater value for all.  
In addition to launching new products and partner programs, we are remaining focused on innovative ways to get scaled distribution of our product suite. Last week, we announced our expanded strategic partnership with Fiserv through which small businesses will now be able to access Synchrony products and services and accept private label credit card payments via the Clover point-of-sale and business management platform from Fiserv.  
This will enable accelerated growth for small businesses, empowering merchants to attract more customers and generate more revenue by offering our customers greater flexibility and choice in how they make purchases. We will also explore additional opportunities to cross-sell Synchrony products to existing Clover merchants.  
Importantly, this strategic partnership also deepened Synchrony's ecosystem and reinforces our growth strategy to expand and accelerate innovative product offerings through additional distribution channels. It builds on our momentum to bring our products to merchants faster and leverages Synchrony's leadership in financing, analytics and services.  
We're excited to utilize the point-of-sale innovations driven by Clover to continue to transform the way people purchase while helping merchants grow. Furthermore, as we and our partners endeavor here to provide more comprehensive customer access to financial products and resources, we are excited to expand our partnership with PayPal.  
As announced in late September, Synchrony will be launching PayPal Savings, a new PayPal-branded savings account. This unique opportunity will allow us to expand the distribution of our savings product to a unique set of customers with features and functionality inside the PayPal app, delivering an enhanced customer experience while also further diversifying our deposit base at an attractively low cost to acquire.  
In addition to our ongoing efforts to expand both our product suite and distribution network, we also seek to enhance partner and customer engagement through customized value positions and omnichannel capabilities. We recently launched 2 industry-first retail health and wellness credit cards, the myWalgreens Mastercard and the myWalgreens private label credit card, which reward customers with savings on future health and wellness purchases.  
The myWalgreens credit card holders can earn 10% Walgreens cash rewards on eligible Walgreens branded products and 5% Walgreens cash rewards on other eligible brands and pharmacy purchases. The myWalgreens MasterCard holders can also earn 3% of Walgreens cash rewards on eligible grocery and health and wellness purchases everywhere else, including health care providers and 1% Walgreens cash rewards on eligible purchases anywhere Mastercard, credit cards are accepted.  
In a world where consumers are increasingly responsible for a greater proportion of their health-related costs, we believe these value propositions will drive considerable value while also providing greater financing flexibility for health-related needs and enhancing loyalty over time.  
Furthermore, Synchrony's digital capabilities allow us to seamlessly engage with customers wherever they are. We have deep digital integration across the Walgreens web, mobile and native app channels with the ability for customers to apply and instantly buy through all of these channels.  
We've launched frictionless customer experiences, leveraging technology capabilities like QR codes, quick screen, which is a real-time prescreen of 1, customer-initiated prequalification, a directed device in-store application process, card servicing integrated seamlessly into the Walgreens app and API integration with the myWalgreens loyalty program.  
And while it's early, the initial data we're seeing indicates that both the value prop and dynamic customer experience we have achieved with Walgreens are resonating very well with cardholders and driving spend both inside and outside of Walgreens in categories such as grocery, health and wellness.  
By empowering our partners and customers with best-in-class wallet optionality and compelling outcomes, Synchrony is increasingly well positioned as the partner of choice. With more than 65 million active accounts, Synchrony has market-leading reach and deep diverse lending insights that enable us to better anticipate the needs of customers and therefore, which financing options will optimize utilization and drive lifetime value.  
So whether it comes in the form of our dual, co-branded and private label credit cards, our various SetPay installment products or our Synchrony Mastercard we deeply understand when, why and how customers seek financing solutions for their day-to-day purchases.  
We're particularly excited about the opportunity we see for our Synchrony MasterCard, which allows us to tap into the $500 billion general purpose credit card market. We are taking a measured approach to growth. However, by leveraging our scale and underwriting expertise, we've been able to identify better performing customer segments, acquire more customers at lower CPAs and fine-tune our channel strategy over the last 2 years.  
Today, Synchrony MasterCard offers a variety of value propositions, which we use in combination with our pricing strategy to expand our customer reach and optimize conversion. And we have great digital utility through dApply and integration in Apple Wallet as well as our mobile app.  
This allows customers to access their various bank products, their money market and high-yield savings accounts as well as our credit card balances and transaction data. This value proposition and seamless digital experience resonates very well with our customer, leading to purchase volume growth of 36% versus the same period in 2019. 
We're also seeing higher levels of engagement around the product and brand as spend per active account is up 40% versus 2019. So we're very excited about our Synchrony Mastercard.  
It's an important offering within our product suite strategy that we believe will enable us to capture a larger portion of customers' top of wallet spend in which to drive highly scalable growth and above average returns to our business over the long term.  
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brian."
260334235,1682810764,2407409,"Synchrony Financial, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2021",2021-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Synchrony Financial","Executives","Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone.  Synchrony's third quarter financial results reflected broad-based strength across our business, highlighted by a double-digit purchase volume increase and continued loan growth, a significant improvement in our",2161,"Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone.  Synchrony's third quarter financial results reflected broad-based strength across our business, highlighted by a double-digit purchase volume increase and continued loan growth, a significant improvement in our net interest margin, historically low losses and delinquencies and continued cost discipline. 
The combination of these results led to $1.1 billion of net earnings or $2 per diluted share, a return on average assets of 4.9% and a return on tangible common equity of 40.1%. These results are a true testament to the power of Synchrony's unique business model, which builds on our deep domain expertise in consumer lending and leverages dynamic digital capabilities, delivered through our comprehensive multiproduct suite to reach and serve a deep and diverse universe of partners and customers.  
Looking at our third quarter performance in greater detail, beginning with purchase volume, which grew 16% compared to last year and 16% compared to 2019, excluding Walmart, demonstrates clear broad-based strength in consumer demand. This is also reflected in our purchase volume per account, which increased 11% compared to last year.  
Dual Card and co-branded cards accounted for 40% of the purchase volume in the third quarter and increased 29% from the prior year. On a loan receivable basis, excluding the impact of the reclassification of the GAAP portfolio to held for sale, Dual and co-branded cards accounted for 24% of the portfolio and increased 4% from the prior year.  
Average active accounts increased 5% compared to last year and new accounts increased 17%, totaling more than 6 million new accounts in the third quarter and over 17.5 million new accounts year-to-date. In late August, we reached an agreement for the sale of the GAAP portfolio, which led to the reclassification of $3.5 billion of loan receivables to held for sale and therefore reduce our ending loan receivables balance.  
Excluding the impact of the reclassification, loan receivables would have increased by 2% versus the prior year, as the period strong purchase volume growth was largely offset by a persistently elevated payment rate. Payment rate for the third quarter was approximately 200 basis points higher when compared to the last year.  
Interest and fees on loans increased 2% compared to last year, reflecting similar growth in average loan receivables. Net interest income was 6% higher than last year, primarily reflecting a decline in interest expense due to lower benchmark rates.  
RSAs were $1.3 billion in the third quarter and 6.38% of average receivables. The $367 million year-over-year increase primarily reflected the impact of lower provision for credit losses and continued strong program performance including growth and improvement in net interest income.  
To put this in context, remember that our RSAs are designed to align interest between ourselves and each of our partners. This means driving growth at attractive risk-adjusted returns enhancing program profitability. This allows each partner to share the program's performance, so when profitability expands, our partners participate in that upside.  
So now when you think about the combined $1.4 billion year-over-year improvement in net interest income, net losses and the reserve change, we shared $367 million of that through the RSA. Focusing on our credit performance provision for losses was $25 million.  
Included in this quarter's provision was a reserve release of $407 million, which incorporated our continued strength in credit performance a more optimistic macroeconomic environment and the impact of reclassifying our GAAP portfolio loan receivables to held for sale.  
This resulted in a reserve reduction of approximately $247 million. Other income decreased $37 million, generally reflecting higher loyalty program cost from higher purchase volume during the quarter. Other expense decreased $106 million compared to the prior year. As you recall, last year, we recognized an $89 million restructuring charge, and we continue to see favorability from lower operational losses.  
Moving to Slide 8 in our platform results. We saw a broad-based purchase volume growth across all 5 platforms, reflecting strong consumer demand. Our home and auto, diversified and value, digital and health and wellness platforms each experienced double-digit year-over-year growth in purchase volume. The 10% year-over-year increase in home and auto was generally driven by strong retailer performance across almost all verticals, while purchase volume and diversified and value increased 25% reflecting the continued return to in-person retail experiences.  
In digital, the 21% increase was due to broad-based growth across our partners coupled with growth in our new programs with Verizon and Venmo. In health and wellness, the 10% growth in purchase volume primarily reflected consumers being more comfortable with the environment and undergoing planned procedures.  
Meanwhile, purchase volume grew a more modest 2% in lifestyle, reflecting broad-based growth across the platform, but having a tough comparable to last year's strong growth in powersports. Loan receivable growth trends by platform generally reflected modest growth rates versus the prior year, as higher purchase volume was largely offset by elevated payment rates.  The one exception being in our diversified value platform, which was impacted by store closures in 2020.  
Average active account trends range on a platform basis up by as much as 10% diversified and value and 7% in digital, while home and auto and health and wellness average active accounts were generally flat. The active account growth and diversified and value largely reflected the return to in-store retail experiences.  
Digital active accounts were up versus prior year due to greater engagement across our existing customer base as well as the impact of recent program launches. Interest and fee trends were generally improved across the platform with the exception of diversified and value, which is down due to lower receivables.  
I'll move to Slide 9 to discuss net interest income and margin trends. The accumulated savings by consumers resulting from stimulus, forbearance and lower discretionary spending continued to impact the payment rates during the third quarter. Payment rates were approximately 260 basis points higher than our 5-year historical average. That said, we've begun to see some signs of moderation in certain cohorts, as payment rate was about 200 basis points higher year-over-year compared to almost 300 basis points higher year-over-year comparison in the second quarter. We expect the payment rate to gradually normalize as consumer spending remains robust, excess savings have peaked and widespread forbearance dissipates.  
Interest and fees were up approximately 2% in the third quarter, reflect the average loan receivable growth. Net interest income increased 6% from last year, reflecting the year-over-year improvement in interest and fees as well as lower interest expense for the period. The net interest margin was 15.45% compared to last year's margin of 13.8%, a 165 basis point improvement year-over-year driven by the mix of interest-earning assets and favorable interest-bearing liabilities costs.  
More specifically, the mix of loan receivables as a percent of total earning assets increased by 550 basis points from 78.3% to 83.8% driven by lower liquidity held during the quarter. This accounted for 106 basis point increase in our net interest margin. Interest-bearing liabilities costs were 1.31%, a year-over-year improvement of 59 basis points primarily due to lower benchmark rates and funding mix. This provided a 51 basis point increase in our net interest margin.  The loan receivables yield was 19.59%, a year-over-year improvement of 10 basis points. This resulted in an 8 basis point improvement in our net interest margin. 
Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 10. First, let's discuss our delinquency trends, where higher payment rate trends have continued to drive year-over-year improvements. Our 30-plus delinquency rate was 2.42% compared to 2.67% last year. Our 90-plus delinquency rate was 1.05% compared to 1.24% last year. It should be noted that removing the impact of the GAAP program from the third quarters of this year and last year, the 30-plus delinquency metric would have been down about 40 basis points versus 25 basis points and the 90-plus metric would be down about 25 basis points instead of 19 basis points.  
And in terms of our portfolio's loss performance, our net charge-off rate was 2.18% compared to 4.42% last year. This year-over-year improvement was primarily driven by strong delinquency trends we've experienced. Our allowance for credit losses, as a percent of loan receivables, was 11.28%.  
Let's move to Slide 11 and discuss expenses. Overall expenses were down $106 million or 10% from last year to $961 million, primarily reflecting the impact of the prior year's restructuring charge of $89 million and lower operational losses. The efficiency ratio for the third quarter was 38.7% compared to 39.7% last year. This metric remains elevated relative to our historical average due to lower revenue resulting from the impact of higher payment rate and lower average receivables.  
We continue to maintain our disciplined focus on cost containment while we make strategic investments in our business to deepen our competitive advantage and drive long-term value for shareholders. Moving to Slide 12. Given the reduction in loan receivables in 2020 and early 2021, coupled with the strength of our deposit platform, we continue to carry a higher level of liquidity.  
While we believe it's prudent to maintain a higher liquidity level during uncertain and volatile periods, we continue to actively manage our funding profile to mitigate excess liquidity and optimize our funding profile. As a result of this strategy, there was a shift in our funding mix during the third quarter.  
Our deposits declined by $3.2 billion from last year and our securitized and unsecured funding sources declined by $3 billion. This resulted in deposits being 82% of our funding compared to 80% last year with securitized and unsecured funding, each comprising 9% of our funding sources at quarter end.  
Total liquidity, including undrawn credit facilities, was $18.4 billion, which equated to 20% of our total assets, down from 28% last year. Before I provide detail on our capital position, it should be noted that we elected to take the benefit of the transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies, which has 2 primary benefits.  
First, it delays the effect of the CECL transition adjustment for an incremental 2 years; and second, it allows for a portion of the current period provisioning to be deferred and amortized with the transition adjustment. With this framework, we ended the quarter at 17.1% CET1 under the CECL transition rules, 130 basis points above last year's level of 15.8%.  
The Tier 1 capital ratio was 18% on the CECL transition rules compared to 16.7% last year. The total capital ratio increased 120 basis points to 19.3%. And the Tier 1 capital plus reserves ratio on a fully phased-in basis decreased to 26.6% compared to 27.3% last year.  
During the quarter, we returned $1.4 billion to shareholders, which included $1.3 billion in share repurchases and $124 million in common stock dividends. Our business generates strong returns and considerable capital resulting from our commitment to drive growth at appropriate risk-adjusted returns, the scalability of our technology platform and our ongoing cost discipline.  
We will continue to take the opportunistic approach to returning our excess capital to shareholders, as our business performance and market conditions allow, subject to our capital plan and any regulatory restrictions. Finally, let me focus on our outlook for the fourth quarter, which is summarized on Slide 13 of our presentation.  
While there are a number of external variables that are difficult to predict with precision, we generally expect the third quarter's key operating trends to be stable in the fourth quarter. Underpinning our forecast is a stable and improving macroeconomic environment and the pandemic continue to be largely in control.  
We expect strong consumer demand through the holiday season to support continued strength in purchase volume. This strength partially offset by continued elevation of payment rates should lead to a modest growth in receivables. Our net interest margin will likely be consistent with 3Q '21. Our provision for credit losses will continue to reflect the impact of asset growth, credit performance and macroeconomic factors as well as continued reserve reductions related to the GAAP portfolio.  
As credit losses begin to normalize, we expect the RSA as a percent of average loan receivables to begin to moderate. Lastly, turning to our operating expense. We expect the acceleration in purchase volume to contribute to a slight sequential increase in absolute dollars for the fourth quarter. That said, we continue to expect the full year operating expenses to be down compared to 2020.   
As we close out the year and look forward to the future, we're excited about the opportunities we see to continue to drive strong financial results and shareholder value. We are well positioned to execute on the strategy we laid out during our Investor Day and drive sustainable growth and attractive risk-adjusted returns, simply by continuing to leverage our inherent core strengths, the breadth and depth of our business model, the scalability of our innovative digital capabilities and customer lifetime value expansion we drive through our diversified product suite and powerful value propositions.

Let me start and then Brian can jump in if he has other comments, Betsy.

Let me start and then Brian can jump in if he has other comments, Betsy. What I would say is, in comparison to general purpose cards, they had a larger dip and larger exposures to some T&E and some other purchases that we did not drop as much as them last year. 
So I think when we look at the purchase volume, first of all, it's broad-based across all our platforms. We have seen really solid performance, the exception being lifestyle, which again had a very difficult comp last year with regard to powersports and outdoor power equipment. But when we looked at it through the quarter, it was actually incredibly consistent from the first week of the quarter and each week as we moved throughout the quarter, and that's really extended in here through the first couple of weeks of October. 
So we are very pleased about the activity level on the card. It's very broad-based. Even the little exposure that we had to with travel and entertainment, we saw that pop up with our travel being up 75% on our either co-branded card or the Synchrony MasterCard. Restaurants were up 44%. So we're seeing that growth, but our business is very consistent, and we think that's really strength as we kind of move through here into the fourth quarter."

I just wanted to hone in on the RSI and understand how we should be thinking about that, realize that the profitability of the programs is up this quarter given the strength in NIM and given the strength in credit. I guess I'm wondering, as I think forward, how to think about that RSA trajectory because the rate of change in those 2 categories obviously starts to come down and credit starts to build. But then at the same time, there's marketing and other types of expenses that come into that RSA.

So Betsy, and I just want to go back and continue to ground home the fact that the RSAs are working as they're designed, right, where the profitability of the company as it expands, we're going to share more in the RSA. So that is by design. It's the buffer we all want when in the downside is, but we prefer the upside. 
So right now, we're just going to -- we're going to pay more. So I think as you think about the trajectory as you move forward, right, it's going to move more in line with the NIM of the business and the net charge-offs, right? So we would expect charge-offs here probably at a trough and would be able to go up. 
So as the charge-offs begin to increase, that's going to go directly through and there's not really a lag effect when it comes to charge-offs through the RSA. And I think as you think about the margin of the business and the revenue side of the business, as delinquencies begin to rise, your revenue goes up, so that will flow through. And then we just start to get the write-offs come through, the NIM will come down a little bit. 
So I think it's going to move, hopefully, in parallel. The only lag effect is on the change in reserves. But it should move with the business. And again, we think we're probably at the trough on delinquencies now, but we'll see how it develops. But we're pleased with the performance. We're pleased with how the RSA actually moved because it moved in line with the business results."

It's clearly going to be over-indexed in terms of online sales. That's speaking kind of particularly to our digital partners as they become a larger share of the overall business. But I will say that for some of the more traditional partners that we have, we have been, I believe, instrumental in helping them transform their footprints to be more digital. So that has been a big part of what we've tried to do, particularly over the last couple of years in response to the pandemic, many of our partners had to close stores. 
They moved a lot of their sales online, and we're a big part of how they were able to meet that need and transform their businesses. So certainly leverage going forward, right."

So I think if I were to lay out for you 2 cases on delinquency, the first being a little bit more conservative, which says you have a more sharper rise in delinquency that would begin starting here in the fourth quarter, would peak third quarter next year and result in that charge-off peak in the first quarter of '23. 
So that's a more conservative case. And the basis for that case becomes one where, as you have individuals coming off of, consumers coming off of forbearance, government assistance, rent or forbearance that they have not been able to sustain enough savings in order to avoid that. So that's a sharper case, a more conservative case. 
A more optimistic case, I would say you would see a slower rise in delinquencies as you move through to '22 into '23. And then really your loss rate comes back in line end of '23 into '24. And I say in line being back to the mean a call 5.5%. 
So it's a much more gradual rise. And that premises on the fact that the consumers were able to build up enough savings so that when the financial obligations come back online for them, they're able to continue to pay their bills and meet it. So those are kind of the bookends that I would think about."

So we're certainly looking at a number of things, I'd say, existing businesses where we can leverage our scale to grow those businesses. I think Allegro Credit is a great example of that; Pets Best, a great example of that, where we're able to leverage our scale in CareCredit and health and wellness and buy those businesses and really growing well, which we shared a little bit at Investor Day around how we did that.

So it's not necessarily out of line with, I think, past years, if you look back a couple of years ago. So it should be in line with that.

And then just how does it play into the business model, like the revenues and expenses on a go-forward basis? Does the complexion of those revenues change? Or how should we think about it?"

One is very focused on products. And we spent a lot of time on this at Investor Day. We believe we have the most comprehensive product suite out there, whether it's private label, Dual, Co-Brand cards, buy now pay later, short- and long-term installment. 
And so we feel like that is obviously really important given the diversity of our partner set and what they want from us. The other really important part of the strategy is really around distribution of those financial products. So this is -- think about integration into the merchants and providers making it easier to apply for those products and really getting that scale. 
So it's one thing to have the products, but you've got to have the distribution channels as well. And so if you go back over time, we do a lot in terms of direct partner integration. So that's leveraging our APIs Synchrony plug-in, et cetera. But in some cases, we're looking to expand distribution through practice management systems like Epic.  Any time we can build a solution once and reach thousands of merchants, we absolutely want to do that. And that's really what Clover does for us.  With the development of a single app, we can reach thousands of merchants we can tap into their roughly $180 billion of GPV. 
So we think this is a big opportunity and allows us to do something once and get immediate scale. And so if they're -- we're looking -- we're actively looking at other opportunities to do that for our products. But this is really -- think about it as really a two-pronged approach, you got to have the product set, but then you got to have a distribution channel or a set of distribution channels that allow you to scale quickly and get those products made available to our merchants and their customers."

We offer those products in about 70,000 locations today. And I really think about it in 2 buckets. First, you've got what we call closed-end installment or buy now, pay later, that's growing really well for us. So that is just a closed-end loan, very simple, a number of different durations. 
And if you look over the past 3 years from 2017 to 2020, the purchase volume on those closed-end products have grown at about 46% a year. So we're definitely seeing really good traction there. We have buy now, pay later in market today with partners like Tulo, American Signature, Electronic Express, that's branded as SetPay. 
And then we talked at Investor Day that starting in October, we will have our Pay in 4 product available for partners. So we're in discussions with them right now and talking about integration plans and getting that in market. I will tell you, to your point, they are focused on exactly what you said, which is how does this product compete with the products that they currently offer. 
And at Investor Day, we talked a lot about the economic equation for our partners. And I can tell you that is something that -- I think 6 to 9 months ago, they weren't all that focused on, but right now, they're very focused on it. So they're looking at the trade-offs between traditional product where they might earn an RSA and how does that compare to a short- or long-term installment product of Pay in 4 where they're paying a merchant discount. 
And so I think the way this is going to play out is there's going to be a lot of kind of testing and learning and seeing how these products kind of work together, what the customer uptake is. And then at the end of the day, what the economic equation is back to the partner. So that's one big bucket of what we call installment, closed-end buy now, pay later. 
The other thing that we talked about is the buy now, pay later option or installment option that we offer on our cards, so on a revolving account. And this is where we continue to see a lot of really strong interest from our partners. And part of what they like about that is you can actually do multiple installment loans or buy now, pay later loans without an additional credit check or application process. 
It also gives the customer the ability to when they want to just make a regular purchase not on an installment basis and take advantage of the value prop so save 5%, for instance, at Amazon. And what we've seen is customers really like to have that optionality. So for some purchases, they want to put it on a 6-month or a 12-month equal pay, buy now, pay later product. In some cases, they want to take advantage of the value prop. And what's nice about that product is it allows you to do both and really gives the customer that choice at the end of the day. 
The partners on their side, they really like that because it allows them to do more life cycle marketing, right? So they can push out offers, promotions around holiday and things like that. So they like that life cycle relationship that they're able to maintain with the customer. So look, at the end of the day, I think every one of our partners is looking at this a little bit differently. They're looking at the interplay between these products or looking at the economic equation. 
I think the good news is if you take a step back and you see how we're positioned, we have a very comprehensive suite of products. We can sit down with a partner and they can basically choose from a menu in terms of what they want to offer. And we can lay out for them an economic equation what we think it's going to do to their sales, et cetera. So I feel like we're very well positioned. We've got the product suite. We've got the ability to integrate quickly with our partners. And we think over time, the multiproduct strategy is the winning one."

So Obviously, in the deck we showed you the elevated level that we saw in the third quarter, and as we move into the fourth quarter, again, that rate is going to continue to be elevated. I'd point you to a couple of things as we think about payment rate and the trends. We've done a lot of analysis to try to make sure that we -- as we look at it, that we believe it's going to revert back to the mean. And everything we have seen still leads us to that conclusion that there is a reversion back to the mean. There are a couple of, what I would call, underlying data points that I would try to point you to. 
Number one, as we look at the savings rates for consumers, they are drifting down to a more normalized level in pre-pandemic. And we look at that both as the big money center banks as well as the digitally oriented banks than what we see with regard to movement in our savings account. 
So one, savings is coming down -- savings rate is coming down, which, again, part of that's going to be the high purchase volume. The second, we start to look at cohorts inside of our portfolio. We do see very slight movements down. So for instance, if you looked at a product level, our Dual Card product sequentially second quarter to third quarter had a slight decline in the payment rate on a product level. 
That's a higher FICO customer that is beginning to migrate back down. When you look at it with regard to accounts that either pay full pay -- between full pay or statement balance in min pay and then statement balance or less than statement balances across all those categories, we've seen slight reduction in that payment rate. So if you think about the people who paid statement balances, that is slightly lower third quarter versus second.  
The people are paying between statement balance and min balance that is lower in the third quarter than the second quarter. And then the min pay is up slightly, third quarter versus second and then the people paying less than the min pay is up slightly. 
So I think as we start seeing it very slight movements, those are movements that would tell us that the payment rate is going to move back towards the mean that we experienced pre-pandemic or we're starting to see a little bit of signs there."

We have not been an active issuer in the market either in '19 -- I'm sorry, in '20 or '21. I would expect us to access the market. First, I think it's good for the liquidity of the company. So we would expect to see a little bit of activity because we have not replaced some of that expiring debt. 
But I would imagine that our deposit funding rate will remain elevated versus the 70% to 75% that we historically have guided to. I think also there's an opportunity with our PayPal savings product to continue to broaden the reach to customers in retail. So we're excited about that when it comes out in the coming months. 
So we're going to continue to focus on trying to optimize the cost, but we also want to maintain access to the deep markets where that's secured, unsecured. As we begin to get the capital stack in order, we would probably access additional preferreds to build out the capital stack of the company and get down to our target level. So we intend to be an active issuer over time and do it in a way that optimizes the cost."

The bulk of the reserve release will happen in the second quarter next year when we intend to convey that portfolio. So that will probably be included in our next capital plan. 
We have $1.2 billion remaining under the existing authorization that we have as we enter the quarter. So we're pleased with how we repurchase shares during the third quarter. As we said before, we'll be aggressive but prudent as we move forward here. 
And as always, we'll continue to run our internal stress test model, evaluate the performance of the business and the income profile. And to the extent that we believe it's prudent, we'll engage in discussions with our Board about potentially increasing the authorization. 
But right now, we have $1.2 billion ahead of us. And again, we want to be aggressive but prudent as we continue to reduce the capital level of the company towards closer to our long-term target."

Our first priority from Brian and Margaret and the Board is to continue to maintain the long-term investments that we have in the business and the strategic initiatives.

Around that, we've maintained a cost discipline. We've reduced a lot of costs. We're on target for our $210 million this year, but we've made some moves to invest back in certain aspects of our business. That includes going to $20 an hour for our nonexempt workforce and investing back into the business. 
I think as you look at the fourth quarter, there's going to be a slight increase as you think about some marketing and some things that are going to happen in the quarter. But again, we would expect, as you move forward, as revenue comes back in line, our progression back towards an efficiency level back in the low 30s and discipline, if you think about it on a dollar basis as we sequentially move through '22."
