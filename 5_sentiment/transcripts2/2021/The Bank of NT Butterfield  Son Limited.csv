On the call, I'm joined by Butterfield's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Michael Collins; and Chief Financial Officer, Michael Schrum. Following their prepared remarks, we will open the call up for a question-and-answer session. Yesterday afternoon, we issued a press release announcing our fourth quarter and year-end results.

I will begin our discussion with a look back at the full year and provide some observations on the bank experience in 2020 and then provide an update on COVID-19. I will then turn the call over to Michael Schrum, our CFO, to provide a detailed review of the fourth quarter financials. Turning now to Slide 4, as a whole for 2020, I am very proud of Butterfield's performance and the resilience of the business model. In a near 0 interest rate environment, we produced net income of $147 million or $2.90 per share and core net income of $155 million or $3.04 per share, which equates to a core return on average tangible common equity of 17.3%. NIM finished the year at 2.42% with an average cost of deposits of 21 basis points for the year. We continued with a $0.44 per share quarterly cash dividend and completed a $3.5 million share repurchase program with the most activity during the second and third quarters. We also improved our capital profile with $100 million, 5.25% qualifying subordinated debt offering in June. Butterfield's business model, which focuses on maximizing returns while closely managing credit and operational risk, proved successful during this period of uncertainty. The global pandemic tested us across all jurisdictions, and the bank continued to perform well. Our technology and collaborative culture allowed us to maintain safe and  uninterrupted services for our clients by decisively moving between the office and remote working environments as conditions required. Our conservative credit profile consists of 65% residential mortgages with relatively low LTVs, no out of market lending, a loan-to-deposit ratio of just 39% and an investment portfolio consisting of 97% U.S. government and federal agency securities. The historically low interest rates in 2020 also brought a renewed focus on improving efficiency. As a result, we implemented a bank-wide restructuring program to lower headcount as well as moving non client-facing positions to lower-cost service centers wherever possible. We were very pleased to complete the integration of ABN AMRO Channel Islands acquisition this year. The Channel Islands continue to represent a growth opportunity for us, both organic and through potential acquisitions. In 2021, we are launching retail lending products to complement our U.K. mortgages business and to activate a portion of our sterling deposits over time. We expect this business to be similar in underwriting standards and character to our loan portfolios in Bermuda and Cayman. We plan to develop the book organically and anticipate it could grow to around $500 million over the next 4 to 5 years. Finally, I would like to recognize the additions to our executive management team during 2020, which now benefits from fresh perspectives and deep experience to the roles in trust, compliance and operations, risk, communications and human resources. I am proud and confident in our management team and believe we have the right people in place to grow Butterfield and reach its potential. Turning now to Slide 5, here we have provided some context and an overview of our core markets and how the bank continues to manage through the pandemic. Bermuda, Cayman and the Channel Islands continue to have active domestic economic activity. However, much of the travel and tourism industry is operating well below historical norms. The vaccine rollout is progressing well and all jurisdictions have active government-sponsored vaccination programs. We expect that visitor numbers will continue to improve as we move through the summer and fall tourism seasons in 2021. As we discussed last quarter, following the mortgage assistance programs, we had implemented a calling program in Bermuda to better understand borrowers' status and ability to restore payments. I am pleased to say that the actual customer payment rates have exceeded the indications from the program. At this point, we are seeing short-term delinquency of less than 1% of the total residential loan book and continue to work closely with customers to determine the best way forward. While we are encouraged by these initial results, we recognize that the pandemic continues to impact customers and we'll maintain close monitoring of the mortgage books in Bermuda and Cayman. Our commercial lending book remains solid and has not been significantly impacted by COVID-19 related issues. Direct hotel and restaurant lending continues to be limited, well underwritten and performing loans. I will now turn the call over to Michael Schrum to provide a detailed review of the fourth quarter."

I'll begin on Slide 7, which provides some highlights from the fourth quarter. We ended 2020 with the most profitable quarter for the year, with net income of $42.1 million, core net income of $42.9 million or $0.86 per share and core return on average tangible common equity of 19%. The net interest margin was 2.25% for the quarter and the average cost of deposits improved to 12 basis points. Turning to Slide 8, net interest income continued to be impacted by lower market rates, and particularly the reinvestment book yields of securities are lower than maturities. Prepayment speeds in our investment portfolio moderated slightly in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. However, they were still elevated with $329 million of paydowns compared to $339 million in the prior quarter. Investment yields were down 15 basis points in the fourth quarter compared to the prior quarter. New money yields averaged 1.46% in the fourth quarter or 4.7 basis points higher than the prior quarter. During the fourth quarter, the blended rate for loan originations was 3.66% for $201 million of new loans, down from 3.93% for $156 million of originations in the prior quarter. On Slide 9, you can see that noninterest income was up 1.9% compared to the prior quarter due to improving economic activity across our jurisdictions and increases across asset management, banking, FX and trust business lines. The bank's contribution from fees continues to represent stable and capital-efficient earnings. For the fourth quarter, fees were 38% of total revenue. Slide 10 provides a summary of core noninterest expense, which improved by 2.6% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior quarter. Expenses fell as we started to experience the benefits of the cost restructuring program in the third quarter, which achieved the expected reduced run rate. In addition, lower technology costs and indirect taxes improved, which was partially offset by higher marketing spend that increased along with improving economic activity. We continue to target a through cycle cost income ratio of 60%, and we expect to remain in the mid-60s during this ultra-low part of the rate cycle. Slide 11 summarizes regulatory and leverage capital levels that continues to be in an excellent capital position with capital ratios well in excess of regulatory requirements. We have been pleased to note that our tangible book value per share has also increased 8.8% over the past calendar year. Capital management remains an important value driver for the bank. We continue to manage capital with an emphasis on protecting the sustainable quarterly cash dividend rate at $0.44 per common share. In addition, we maintain capital levels to support organic growth in our core markets as well as M&A opportunities. Share repurchases subject to market conditions, also continues to be part of the planned EPS growth, and the Board of Directors has authorized a new share repurchase program for up to 2 million shares for the coming 12-month period. Turning now to Slide 12, Butterfield continues to manage a strong, conservative and highly liquid balance sheet. At the end of the fourth quarter, the loan portfolio represented only about 35% of total assets, whereas liquid assets were just at over 60% of total assets. Deposit balances ballooned to $13.3 billion at the end of the fourth quarter from $11.9 billion at the end of the previous quarter. We do expect some of the increase will be temporary and that the deposit balances will normalize over the next few quarters. The bank has maintained a low-risk density with risk-weighted assets to total assets of 34.4%, down from 36.7% last quarter. On Slide 13 we show that Butterfield's asset quality remains exceptionally high with limited credit risk in its investment portfolio that is 99% comprised of AAA-rated U.S. government-guaranteed agency securities. Nonaccrual loans were down slightly versus the prior quarter at $72.5 million or 1.4% of gross loans. The net charge-off ratio ticked higher due to the secondary market sale of one commercial loan that crystallized the loss of provision previously recorded under the CECL model, and the overall NCL ratio remains very low. The implementation of the CECL accounting standard was well-managed for our bank and has resulted in improved credit quality overall. For Butterfield, the model has been responsive to portfolio performance and varying macroeconomic forecast as expected. On Slide 14 we discuss the average cash and securities balance sheet with a summary interest rate sensitivity analysis. Butterfield's weighted average life of around 4.1 years continues to offer some income protection against the impact of near to medium-term low interest rates. The unrealized mark-to-market gain on invested securities was $183.2 million at December 31, 2020. Similar to the past few quarters, Butterfield continues to expect a potential increase in net interest income in future periods in both up and down parallel rate scenarios. I will now turn the call back to Michael Collins."

So as you saw, we obviously measure both tangible as well as regulatory capital. So you're quite right that the regulatory capital benefited from a slight mix shift in terms of getting our subordinated debt issued midyear, which obviously made the efficacy at the existing capital stack a bit cheaper for us, but also allowed us to continue obviously with the buyback program that was fairly substantial last year, particularly executed in Q2 and Q3. The priorities are I think, as we stated a little bit earlier, is to protect the dividend rate that we have at the moment, which is we view as very sustainable. Payout ratio has been around 60% this year. But probably due to procyclicality of reserve builds from CECL and obviously rates being much lower than at the beginning of last year. Secondly, we obviously need to help the organic growth profile in our home markets, so that's Bermuda and Cayman, where we see opportunities and also account for any risk migrations in risk-weighted assets on the regulatory side that might come from experiencing additional credit issues, which so far we haven't. And then thirdly, obviously we look at M&A where that's accretive and the criteria are fairly strict. We really look just for banking assets in other markets where we can get some synergies and also obviously private trust companies that provide a stable capital-efficient fee income at reasonable multiples. And then fourthly, we look at share repurchases, and we're pleased to see that the Board has approved another repurchase program for the next 12 months at 2 million shares or up to 2 million shares. And so that will be executed, obviously, subject to market conditions. If you look at price-to-book at the moment, we're conscious, obviously, of potential book dilution relative to share repurchases, but we're still sitting at a fairly deep discount on P/E relative to peers. So I would say, look at the last couple of years of buybacks, and obviously, we'll execute that as and when. On the tangible, you saw it come down to sort of in the bottom to the middle of the range at 6.1. Obviously, ex-cash, it's a lot higher. And that was partly driven by OCI impact from post-retirement medical expenses having a material loss from the annual valuation cycle. So we're monitoring that as well as part of the overall capital strategy. So nothing has really changed, same priorities as last year. And obviously, we now have the firepower to exercise that as well. I'll let Michael just talk about M&A."

First, it provided us with a growth platform in a jurisdiction where we have very low market share. Obviously, Bermuda and Cayman, we've got sort of 35%, 40% market share, so it's harder to grow. Secondly, it reduced our concentration risk in Bermuda. And thirdly, it created relative balance sheet parity amongst our 3 banking jurisdictions. So strategically, that did a lot for us. Last year, obviously, conversations were pretty slow given the pandemic. We have a sense now that people are starting to get vaccines and starting of think about travel and starting to think about transactions more across our jurisdiction. So we are having some conversations, but we're always very cautious about thinking about whether they're going to come to fruition or the pricing is right or the AML is where we want it to be. So we are having conversations. The strategy is the same. So it's stressed companies across our existing jurisdictions as sort of overlap acquisitions. With a particular focus on Singapore, we'd like to build scale there. And secondly, overlap acquisitions in our existing jurisdictions, whether it be Bermuda, Cayman or more likely the Channel Islands. So we continue to have conversations, and we think this could be a good year to bring something to conclusion, but we're always cautious because we are very focused on due diligence and AML given where we operate. So we'll just continue having those discretions."

Obviously, there's a front book backlog. As you know, we amortize all of our loans on balance sheet. So they're manually underwritten, full recourse loans. So you see that loan yield kind of stabilizing, even though I gave a little bit of detail around the most recent loan originations, which was 3.66% in the last quarter, so down a little bit on the front book side, but relatively stable overall as we look at the whole -- at the loan book as a whole. We do expect some modest mix shift as we launch the residential lending opportunity in the Channel Islands. Those are sterling loans, which would be at a slightly lower rate. But again, that will take some time organically to come through there, and it would be activated out of our cash balances effectively. So that should be helpful to NIM. In terms of cash, pretty much floor there at 5 to 10 basis points. We're obviously watching the current discussions on sterling rates in terms of where they might go in the future. But that's probably reasonable there. That's been fully realized, if you will, at the short end of the curve. And then finally, on investments, prepayment speeds are obviously pretty elevated and have been pretty elevated throughout 2020. So we're seeing approximately 5% of the total investment book roll over a quarter, which is almost double what we saw in prior years, a combination there of a very flat forward yield curve. And then obviously, on the opposite side of that, we're deploying excess cash from the ABN AMRO into the securities book. So you see volume, a positive volume impact from that. So overall, I'm expecting some stabilization as long as there's a reasonable sort of 10-year and are a normal sloping yield curve that we've seen more recently. But obviously, the short end of the curve seems to be floor for a longer period of time. So medium-term stabilization around where we are, I would expect."

You can see on the average balance that it was pretty much towards the end of the quarter. Really a combination of retail deposits, but I would say, slightly unusual flows in the retail deposit base in that it was driven probably by the deferrals that we put on mortgages here where people were obviously keeping their payments and putting it into bank accounts. So again, over time, I would expect some of that to flow out in Cayman, mostly driven by allowable pension withdrawals, which is kind of a one-off fiscal stimulus that was provided there. Again, over time, that could migrate into either real assets, property or it could migrate back out, I think, to some retirement portfolios. So again, a little uncertain here, but they are retail deposits, which is obviously very helpful. And the other half roughly is related to sort of what I'd call hot money. So hedge funds flows in Cayman and capital insurance deposits in Bermuda, which typically follows sort of a premium claims cycle at the end of the quarter, and there's quite a lot of activity in the asset management space in -- towards the end of the fourth quarter. But again, I'm not -- we're not banking on those deposits. I think some of that will flow out over the next couple of quarters."

So over and above the maturities that we get from the investments, which obviously would keep rolling into lower rates, we're also deploying the extra at that sort of clip of $150 million, around that a quarter. So the strategy hasn't really changed. Obviously, as the deposit base has increased quite a lot, we'll just have to wait and see if that sticks around and what we can do with that.

Some of it will just depend on the reaction we get in the market and reception. So far, obviously, conversations are positive. There seems to be some pent-up demand there.

Jersey is a new market for us, but Guernsey, we've been there for decades. So we know the market very well. It is a market -- a corporate market very much like Bermuda and Cayman. So in so management companies, Bermuda is more captives and reinsurance companies; Caymans, obviously, hedge funds and captives and Guernsey and Jersey are both captives, but more funds and trust companies. But it's all the same sort of management company structure. So our systems and our RMs are geared to servicing that business. So we understand it well. And what we've done with ABN, as I said, is to -- we've gotten to the point where we've actually balanced our balance sheet, so to speak, our risk exposures across the 3 jurisdictions relatively evenly. It's not the same from an earnings perspective. So Cayman in 2020, made about 56% of our core net income, Bermuda 31% and the Channel Islands, 14%. And even though the balance sheet are similar size, so that's simply because the Channel Islands are much more competitive from a pricing perspective. So that all makes sense. So I think we're kind of where we need to be to allow the Channel Islands to grow organically. So our focus right now is much more on the fee businesses on the trust side to try to build scale across our jurisdictions, but particularly in Singapore. Now that's not to say there if was a decent-sized bank in Jersey that were to come up for sale, again, there are not a lot of natural buyers. So I think we would be interested. But I think we've kind of got the platform where the Channel Islands can grow organically now, and all 3 jurisdictions can grow together so that we actually have a balanced portfolio that we're not completely dependent on one island like Bermuda."

So that's been muted. There's a few smaller positive items in the banking fees in the fourth quarter as well. But I would say you're probably going to see that run rate is a decent run rate. It was a bit smaller under trust fees in terms of activity-based fees, there was some recovery in that, but probably a bit smaller than we would see on the run rate side. And you'll probably see a substitution from domestic activity in the merchant acquiring side to credit card tourism related within the banking fees once the borders open and we get the vaccine passports."

What's been attractive about both Guernsey and Jersey is we have a small market share, had, and still have a small market share in both jurisdictions. So we really can't grow organically or we can't as well as Bermuda and Cayman. So even after the ABN acquisition, we estimate our market share in Guernsey, and we're only on the corporate side and private banking and trust side, would be about 15%. So there's a lot more banks, obviously, in the Channel Islands than in Bermuda and Guernsey. So even at 15%, that gives us a platform where we can grow organically, but if we were to find an attractive acquisition, it would be nice to be 30%, 30%, 40%. But what we're saying is that 15% in Guernsey is a platform where at last we can grow organically, and we'll be opportunistic about whether there's an acquisition. Jersey is even more interesting in the sense that I think our market share we're guessing is about 1%. So there's about GBP 120 billion in deposits. So it's a huge banking market, and we only have a 1% market share. So I think Jersey would even be more interesting on the acquisition side. But I guess the point is across both Guernsey and Jersey, we have enough market share that we can grow product organically. But if there were a very attractively priced bank that were to come up for sale, we definitely would be interested.

There's good news on the domestic side, obviously, almost all borrowers resume normal payments in Q4. So that was great to see. Still obviously continuing to monitor that. We're still not out of the pandemic yet. So I think we should think about CECL as opposed to the backward-looking model more reflecting an improved sort of credit outlook and macro outlook. The actual release was, I would say, about half and half. So you see the tick up in NCO, which was the sale of the loan that crystallized a loss. It was a lower-rated corporate loan. And we also had a small sovereign legacy loan from when we used to have a Barbados operation. This is kind of cleanup exercise. So as you think about the reserve going forward, the objective of CECL is obviously to reflect the future GDP outlook, in particular, the U.S. GDP outlook as well as the experience on the portfolio that feeds back into the model. It's been quite a year in terms of macro GDP forecasts, which is causing more -- probably more volatility in the reserves, which was not the intent when CECL was implemented. So it's sort of hard to predict, but I think we feel that the reserving level adequately reflects the underlying credit conditions and the current macroeconomic outlook. To the extent that that becomes better, that would result in obviously some release. But generally speaking, if you look at the coverage ratio, et cetera, we feel very comfortable that it reflects the underlying conditions of the loan book today. I know that wasn't a direct question, but it's -- I'm sure it's a difficult thing to predict the future, obviously."

I mean it's been interesting to see as people start talking about negative rates and what potentially that impact could be in terms of us charging negative rates to customers and then now coming through. But I think, again, the strategy hasn't really changed. We keep laddering out what's maturing. The reason why the duration is pretty short and I think why we wanted to put weighted average life on there as well and the unrealized mark-to-market position, is that obviously we're fighting against the prepayment speeds, which are very materially elevated, I would say, partly fueled by refinancing rates and new originations in the U.S. market. So MBS prepayment speeds have just been very elevated, in addition also to the buyout options that have been offered into those securities. So we keep just laddering out what's maturing. And then I think the pace of laddering out the ABN has not changed and really should match the behavioral duration of the underlying deposits as we grow the data set around the ABN deposits. As we get into -- and again, we're not a mark-to-market shop. So we don't sort of speculate on the asset sensitivity. It just naturally it occurs because we have a very low loan asset to the deposit ratio and loan asset to total asset ratio, and that's just a function of the markets that we're in. But to the extent that we are starting to see some creeping up in a more normal yield curve, obviously, that does provide some opportunities for us to think a bit more tactically around the deployment. But for the time being and certainly over the last year, it's just been a case of moderating the impact on reinvestment rates and prepayment speeds through the re-laddering, and we'll continue to do that. But we obviously constantly review the book. We're also looking at tactical opportunities."

So there was a bit of spike up around December, but it's come right down. Again, the testing is really efficient and has worked really well. It's a small place and you're surrounded by miles of saltwater. So you tend to be able to control it. So COVID is in good shape. The public sector, the fiscal position in Bermuda is elevated, I would say, just in terms of national debt and deficit, some of it caused by COVID, but we came into the crisis with a reasonable amount of national debt. So there's less government flexibility in terms of spending. I would say, as Michael mentioned, the local market has been pretty active because people aren't traveling. So it's just like everywhere else, people are ordering out, going to restaurants outside, that sort of thing. So that's kind of masks I think some of the underlying pain of not having tourists here. So I think when tourism comes that will pick things up. Surprisingly, or maybe not surprisingly, housing is -- the market has done quite well. So it's -- whether you're in Vermont or Bermuda and Cayman, people are looking for places that are safe and clean and have very few COVID cases, not just now but for future pandemics. And so we've seen a lot of interest, both locally and internationally in Bermuda Real Estate and Cayman real estate. So I'd say we're holding our own in Bermuda, but the recovery is going to be pretty tough. Cayman is doing a bit better simply because they came into the crisis with no national debt and much lower deficits and their GDP has been growing more quickly than Bermuda. So I think they will come out of the crisis more easily. Same story in the housing market, housing in Cayman was doing really well even before the pandemic. So I think they continue to do well. They have about 35 active cases compared to Bermudas 10. Channel Islands has 400 active cases, so a bit more, obviously closer to the U.K., but they've also got 110,000 people in Jersey and 60,000 in Guernsey. So it's 3x the size of Bermuda and Cayman together. So a bit more cases, currency is a bit more shutdown right now. Economically, again, both Guernsey and Jersey are extremely well managed, both politically and economically, so no national debt and so came into the crisis well from a fiscal position. GDP has done well before. The fund sector continues to do well. So I think they're in great shape. So across the board, I think our jurisdictions have actually handled it pretty well. We do think it's a bit of a fake spring in the sense that because there's so much domestic activity that it's kind of masked some of the underlying issues that will come out as -- even as tourism sort of starts back up. But in some sense, we feel like we may have missed a bullet a bit. But each island is different in terms of where its fiscal situation is. So some can spend more than the others. Each island has borrowed money to handle the pandemic in terms of incentive spending and getting money out into the community, and we've been pretty much part of all those facilities, which has been great. So I would say looking back, I think in March last year, we thought -- I think we would have thought it would have been much worse than it's actually been."

I will then turn the call over to Michael Schrum, our CFO, to provide a detailed review of the fourth quarter financials. 
Turning now to Slide 4, as a whole for 2020, I am very proud of Butterfield's performance and the resilience of the business model. In a near 0 interest rate environment, we produced net income of $147 million or $2.90 per share and core net income of $155 million or $3.04 per share, which equates to a core return on average tangible common equity of 17.3%. NIM finished the year at 2.42% with an average cost of deposits of 21 basis points for the year. We continued with a $0.44 per share quarterly cash dividend and completed a $3.5 million share repurchase program with the most activity during the second and third quarters. We also improved our capital profile with $100 million, 5.25% qualifying subordinated debt offering in June. 
Butterfield's business model, which focuses on maximizing returns while closely managing credit and operational risk, proved successful during this period of uncertainty. The global pandemic tested us across all jurisdictions, and the bank continued to perform well. Our technology and collaborative culture allowed us to maintain safe and uninterrupted services for our clients by decisively moving between the office and remote working environments as conditions required. 
Our conservative credit profile consists of 65% residential mortgages with relatively low LTVs, no out of market lending, a loan-to-deposit ratio of just 39% and an investment portfolio consisting of 97% U.S. government and federal agency securities. The historically low interest rates in 2020 also brought a renewed focus on improving efficiency. As a result, we implemented a bank-wide restructuring program to lower headcount as well as moving nonclient-facing positions to lower-cost service centers wherever possible. 
We were very pleased to complete the integration of ABN AMRO Channel Islands acquisition this year. The Channel Islands continue to represent a growth opportunity for us, both organic and through potential acquisitions. In 2021, we are launching retail lending products to complement our U.K. mortgages business and to activate a portion of our sterling deposits over time. We expect this business to be similar in underwriting standards and character to our loan portfolios in Bermuda and Cayman. We plan to develop the book organically and anticipate it could grow to around $500 million over the next 4 to 5 years. Finally, I would like to recognize the additions to our executive management team during 2020, which now benefits from fresh perspectives and deep experience to the roles in trust, compliance and operations, risk, communications and human resources. I am proud and confident in our management team and believe we have the right people in place to grow Butterfield and reach its potential. 
Turning now to Slide 5, here we have provided some context and an overview of our core markets and how the bank continues to manage through the pandemic. Bermuda, Cayman and the Channel Islands continue to have active domestic economic activity. However, much of the travel and tourism industry is operating well below historical norms. The vaccine rollout is progressing well and all jurisdictions have active government-sponsored vaccination programs. We expect that visitor numbers will continue to improve as we move through the summer and fall tourism seasons in 2021. As we discussed last quarter, following the mortgage assistance programs, we had implemented a calling program in Bermuda to better understand borrowers' status and ability to restore payments. I am pleased to say that the actual customer payment rates have exceeded the indications from the program. At this point, we are seeing short-term delinquency of less than 1% of the total residential loan book and continue to work closely with customers to determine the best way forward. While we are encouraged by these initial results, we recognize that the pandemic continues to impact customers and we'll maintain close monitoring of the mortgage books in Bermuda and Cayman. 
Our commercial lending book remains solid and has not been significantly impacted by COVID-19 related issues. Direct hotel and restaurant lending continues to be limited, well underwritten and performing loans. I will now turn the call over to Michael Schrum to provide a detailed review of the fourth quarter."

I'll begin on Slide 7, which provides some highlights from the fourth quarter. We ended 2020 with the most profitable quarter for the year, with net income of $42.1 million, core net income of $42.9 million or $0.86 per share and core return on average tangible common equity of 19%. The net interest margin was 2.25% for the quarter and the average cost of deposits improved to 12 basis points. 
Turning to Slide 8, net interest income continued to be impacted by lower market rates, and particularly the reinvestment book yields of securities are lower than maturities. Prepayment speeds in our investment portfolio moderated slightly in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. However, they were still elevated with $329 million of paydowns compared to $339 million in the prior quarter. Investment yields were down 15 basis points in the fourth quarter compared to the prior quarter. New money yields averaged 1.46% in the fourth quarter or 4.7 basis points higher than the prior quarter. During the fourth quarter, the blended rate for loan originations was 3.66% for $201 million of new loans, down from 3.93% for $156 million of originations in the prior quarter. 
On Slide 9, you can see that noninterest income was up 1.9% compared to the prior quarter due to improving economic activity across our jurisdictions and increases across asset management, banking, FX and trust business lines. The bank's contribution from fees continues to represent stable and capital-efficient earnings. For the fourth quarter, fees were 38% of total revenue. 
Slide 10 provides a summary of core noninterest expense, which improved by 2.6% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior quarter. Expenses fell as we started to experience the benefits of the cost restructuring program in the third quarter, which achieved the expected reduced run rate. In addition, lower technology costs and indirect taxes improved, which was partially offset by higher marketing spend that increased along with improving economic activity. We continue to target a through cycle cost income ratio of 60%, and we expect to remain in the mid-60s during this ultra-low part of the rate cycle. 
Slide 11 summarizes regulatory and leverage capital levels that continues to be in an excellent capital position with capital ratios well in excess of regulatory requirements. We have been pleased to note that our tangible book value per share has also increased 8.8% over the past calendar year. Capital management remains an important value driver for the bank. We continue to manage capital with an emphasis on protecting the sustainable quarterly cash dividend rate at $0.44 per common share. In addition, we maintain capital levels to support organic growth in our core markets as well as M&A opportunities. Share repurchases subject to market conditions, also continues to be part of the planned EPS growth, and the Board of Directors has authorized a new share repurchase program for up to 2 million shares for the coming 12-month period. 
Turning now to Slide 12, Butterfield continues to manage a strong, conservative and highly liquid balance sheet. At the end of the fourth quarter, the loan portfolio represented only about 35% of total assets, whereas liquid assets were just at over 60% of total assets. Deposit balances ballooned to $13.3 billion at the end of the fourth quarter from $11.9 billion at the end of the previous quarter. We do expect some of the increase will be temporary and that the deposit balances will normalize over the next few quarters. The bank has maintained a low-risk density with risk-weighted assets to total assets of 34.4%, down from 36.7% last quarter. 
On Slide 13 we show that Butterfield's asset quality remains exceptionally high with limited credit risk in its investment portfolio that is 99% comprised of AAA-rated U.S. government-guaranteed agency securities. Nonaccrual loans were down slightly versus the prior quarter at $72.5 million or 1.4% of gross loans. The net charge-off ratio ticked higher due to the secondary market sale of one commercial loan that crystallized the loss of provision previously recorded under the CECL model, and the overall NCL ratio remains very low. The implementation of the CECL accounting standard was well-managed for our bank and has resulted in improved credit quality overall. For Butterfield, the model has been responsive to portfolio performance and varying macroeconomic forecast as expected. 
On Slide 14 we discuss the average cash and securities balance sheet with a summary interest rate sensitivity analysis. Butterfield's weighted average life of around 4.1 years continues to offer some income protection against the impact of near to medium-term low interest rates. The unrealized mark-to-market gain on invested securities was $183.2 million at December 31, 2020. Similar to the past few quarters, Butterfield continues to expect a potential increase in net interest income in future periods in both up and down parallel rate scenarios. I will now turn the call back to Michael Collins."

So as you saw, we obviously measure both tangible as well as regulatory capital. So you're quite right that the regulatory capital benefited from a slight mix shift in terms of getting our subordinated debt issued midyear, which obviously made the efficacy at the existing capital stack a bit cheaper for us, but also allowed us to continue obviously with the buyback program that was fairly substantial last year, particularly executed in Q2 and Q3. 
The priorities are I think, as we stated a little bit earlier, is to protect the dividend rate that we have at the moment, which is we view as very sustainable. Payout ratio has been around 60% this year. But probably due to procyclicality of reserve builds from CECL and obviously rates being much lower than at the beginning of last year. Secondly, we obviously need to help the organic growth profile in our home markets, so that's Bermuda and Cayman, where we see opportunities and also account for any risk migrations in risk-weighted assets on the regulatory side that might come from experiencing additional credit issues, which so far we haven't. And then thirdly, obviously we look at M&A where that's accretive and the criteria are fairly strict. We really look just for banking assets in other markets where we can get some synergies and also obviously private trust companies that provide a stable capital-efficient fee income at reasonable multiples. And then fourthly, we look at share repurchases, and we're pleased to see that the Board has approved another repurchase program for the next 12 months at 2 million shares or up to 2 million shares. And so that will be executed, obviously, subject to market conditions. 
If you look at price-to-book at the moment, we're conscious, obviously, of potential book dilution relative to share repurchases, but we're still sitting at a fairly deep discount on P/E relative to peers. So I would say, look at the last couple of years of buybacks, and obviously, we'll execute that as and when. On the tangible, you saw it come down to sort of in the bottom to the middle of the range at 6.1. Obviously, ex-cash, it's a lot higher. And that was partly driven by OCI impact from post-retirement medical expenses having a material loss from the annual valuation cycle. So we're monitoring that as well as part of the overall capital strategy. So nothing has really changed, same priorities as last year. And obviously, we now have the firepower to exercise that as well. I'll let Michael just talk about M&A."

Secondly, it reduced our concentration risk in Bermuda. And thirdly, it created relative balance sheet parity amongst our 3 banking jurisdictions. So strategically, that did a lot for us. Last year, obviously, conversations were pretty slow given the pandemic. We have a sense now that people are starting to get vaccines and starting of think about travel and starting to think about transactions more across our jurisdiction. So we are having some conversations, but we're always very cautious about thinking about whether they're going to come to fruition or the pricing is right or the AML is where we want it to be. 
So we are having conversations. The strategy is the same. So it's stressed companies across our existing jurisdictions as sort of overlap acquisitions. With a particular focus on Singapore, we'd like to build scale there. And secondly, overlap acquisitions in our existing jurisdictions, whether it be Bermuda, Cayman or more likely the Channel Islands. So we continue to have conversations, and we think this could be a good year to bring something to conclusion, but we're always cautious because we are very focused on due diligence and AML given where we operate. So we'll just continue having those discretions."

Obviously, there's a front book backlog. As you know, we amortize all of our loans on balance sheet. So they're manually underwritten, full recourse loans. So you see that loan yield kind of stabilizing, even though I gave a little bit of detail around the most recent loan originations, which was 3.66% in the last quarter, so down a little bit on the front book side, but relatively stable overall as we look at the whole -- at the loan book as a whole. We do expect some modest mix shift as we launch the residential lending opportunity in the Channel Islands. Those are sterling loans, which would be at a slightly lower rate. But again, that will take some time organically to come through there, and it would be activated out of our cash balances effectively. So that should be helpful to NIM. 
In terms of cash, pretty much floor there at 5 to 10 basis points. We're obviously watching the current discussions on sterling rates in terms of where they might go in the future. But that's probably reasonable there. That's been fully realized, if you will, at the short end of the curve. And then finally, on investments, prepayment speeds are obviously pretty elevated and have been pretty elevated throughout 2020. So we're seeing approximately 5% of the total investment book roll over a quarter, which is almost double what we saw in prior years, a combination there of a very flat forward yield curve. 
And then obviously, on the opposite side of that, we're deploying excess cash from the ABN AMRO into the securities book. So you see volume, a positive volume impact from that. So overall, I'm expecting some stabilization as long as there's a reasonable sort of 10-year and are a normal sloping yield curve that we've seen more recently. But obviously, the short end of the curve seems to be floor for a longer period of time. So medium-term stabilization around where we are, I would expect."

You can see on the average balance that it was pretty much towards the end of the quarter. Really a combination of retail deposits, but I would say, slightly unusual flows in the retail deposit base in that it was driven probably by the deferrals that we put on mortgages here where people were obviously keeping their payments and putting it into bank accounts. So again, over time, I would expect some of that to flow out in Cayman, mostly driven by allowable pension withdrawals, which is kind of a one-off fiscal stimulus that was provided there. Again, over time, that could migrate into either real assets, property or it could migrate back out, I think, to some retirement portfolios. So again, a little uncertain here, but they are retail deposits, which is obviously very helpful. 
And the other half roughly is related to sort of what I'd call hot money. So hedge funds flows in Cayman and capital insurance deposits in Bermuda, which typically follows sort of a premium claims cycle at the end of the quarter, and there's quite a lot of activity in the asset management space in -- towards the end of the fourth quarter. But again, I'm not -- we're not banking on those deposits. I think some of that will flow out over the next couple of quarters."

Obviously, it was very key to integrate our systems and get them onto one platform there. So you'll see that that's continued throughout the fourth quarter. So over and above the maturities that we get from the investments, which obviously would keep rolling into lower rates, we're also deploying the extra at that sort of clip of $150 million, around that a quarter. So the strategy hasn't really changed. Obviously, as the deposit base has increased quite a lot, we'll just have to wait and see if that sticks around and what we can do with that. It's been pleasing, obviously, to see 10-year a little bit higher lately. So that helps to slow down prepayment rates and also helps the reinvestment rates."

It's almost like -- and they're now talking about negative rates. So we're not paying up for sterling deposits, I would say. But obviously, there are overall client considerations following ABN. 
There are some of funds that we service, both in Guernsey and Jersey that have both sterling and dollar deposits, so it's more of a relationship-based pricing. But clearly, it's a challenging -- and I think it's a challenging environment in the secondary market. I think the residential lending program will definitely be accretive on the margin side.

Jersey is a new market for us, but Guernsey, we've been there for decades. So we know the market very well. It is a market -- a corporate market very much like Bermuda and Cayman. So in so management companies, Bermuda is more captives and reinsurance companies; Caymans, obviously, hedge funds and captives and Guernsey and Jersey are both captives, but more funds and trust companies. But it's all the same sort of management company structure. So our systems and our RMs are geared to servicing that business. So we understand it well. 
And what we've done with ABN, as I said, is to -- we've gotten to the point where we've actually balanced our balance sheet, so to speak, our risk exposures across the 3 jurisdictions relatively evenly. It's not the same from an earnings perspective. So Cayman in 2020, made about 56% of our core net income, Bermuda 31% and the Channel Islands, 14%. And even though the balance sheet are similar size, so that's simply because the Channel Islands are much more competitive from a pricing perspective. So that all makes sense. 
So I think we're kind of where we need to be to allow the Channel Islands to grow organically. So our focus right now is much more on the fee businesses on the trust side to try to build scale across our jurisdictions, but particularly in Singapore. Now that's not to say there if was a decent-sized bank in Jersey that were to come up for sale, again, there are not a lot of natural buyers. So I think we would be interested.

What's missing is obviously the tourism-related credit card fees that we normally get in the fourth quarter, particularly from Cayman. Airlift and capacity has been severely reduced during COVID. So that's been muted. 
There's a few smaller positive items in the banking fees in the fourth quarter as well. But I would say you're probably going to see that run rate is a decent run rate. It was a bit smaller under trust fees in terms of activity-based fees, there was some recovery in that, but probably a bit smaller than we would see on the run rate side. And you'll probably see a substitution from domestic activity in the merchant acquiring side to credit card tourism related within the banking fees once the borders open and we get the vaccine passports."

What's been attractive about both Guernsey and Jersey is we have a small market share, had, and still have a small market share in both jurisdictions. So we really can't grow organically or we can't as well as Bermuda and Cayman. So even after the ABN acquisition, we estimate our market share in Guernsey, and we're only on the corporate side and private banking and trust side, would be about 15%. 
So there's a lot more banks, obviously, in the Channel Islands than in Bermuda and Guernsey. So even at 15%, that gives us a platform where we can grow organically, but if we were to find an attractive acquisition, it would be nice to be 30%, 30%, 40%. But what we're saying is that 15% in Guernsey is a platform where at last we can grow organically, and we'll be opportunistic about whether there's an acquisition. Jersey is even more interesting in the sense that I think our market share we're guessing is about 1%. So there's about GBP 120 billion in deposits. 
So it's a huge banking market, and we only have a 1% market share. So I think Jersey would even be more interesting on the acquisition side.

There's good news on the domestic side, obviously, almost all borrowers resume normal payments in Q4. So that was great to see. Still obviously continuing to monitor that. We're still not out of the pandemic yet. 
So I think we should think about CECL as opposed to the backward-looking model more reflecting an improved sort of credit outlook and macro outlook. The actual release was, I would say, about half and half. So you see the tick up in NCO, which was the sale of the loan that crystallized a loss. It was a lower-rated corporate loan. And we also had a small sovereign legacy loan from when we used to have a Barbados operation. This is kind of cleanup exercise. So as you think about the reserve going forward, the objective of CECL is obviously to reflect the future GDP outlook, in particular, the U.S. GDP outlook as well as the experience on the portfolio that feeds back into the model. It's been quite a year in terms of macro GDP forecasts, which is causing more -- probably more volatility in the reserves, which was not the intent when CECL was implemented. 
So it's sort of hard to predict, but I think we feel that the reserving level adequately reflects the underlying credit conditions and the current macroeconomic outlook. To the extent that that becomes better, that would result in obviously some release. But generally speaking, if you look at the coverage ratio, et cetera, we feel very comfortable that it reflects the underlying conditions of the loan book today.

We do keep a sharp focus on expenses in this ultralow part of the cycle. And I think mid-60s efficiency during this part is -- of the rate cycle is probably where we're going to stay. But it is also worth remembering that as we're not subject to corporate income tax, we pay all of our taxes in the expense line, which has that kind of 4% to 5% dilutive effect on the cost-income ratio. But we keep a sharp focus on it. It was obviously difficult to execute a cost restructuring program, but I think it was the right thing following the health crisis."

I mean it's been interesting to see as people start talking about negative rates and what potentially that impact could be in terms of us charging negative rates to customers and then now coming through. But I think, again, the strategy hasn't really changed. We keep laddering out what's maturing. The reason why the duration is pretty short and I think why we wanted to put weighted average life on there as well and the unrealized mark-to-market position, is that obviously we're fighting against the prepayment speeds, which are very materially elevated, I would say, partly fueled by refinancing rates and new originations in the U.S. market. 
So MBS prepayment speeds have just been very elevated, in addition also to the buyout options that have been offered into those securities. So we keep just laddering out what's maturing. And then I think the pace of laddering out the ABN has not changed and really should match the behavioral duration of the underlying deposits as we grow the data set around the ABN deposits. As we get into -- and again, we're not a mark-to-market shop.
So we don't sort of speculate on the asset sensitivity. It just naturally it occurs because we have a very low loan asset to the deposit ratio and loan asset to total asset ratio, and that's just a function of the markets that we're in. But to the extent that we are starting to see some creeping up in a more normal yield curve, obviously, that does provide some opportunities for us to think a bit more tactically around the deployment. But for the time being and certainly over the last year, it's just been a case of moderating the impact on reinvestment rates and prepayment speeds through the re-laddering, and we'll continue to do that. But we obviously constantly review the book. We're also looking at tactical opportunities."

So there was a bit of spike up around December, but it's come right down. Again, the testing is really efficient and has worked really well. It's a small place and you're surrounded by miles of saltwater. So you tend to be able to control it. So COVID is in good shape. The public sector, the fiscal position in Bermuda is elevated, I would say, just in terms of national debt and deficit, some of it caused by COVID, but we came into the crisis with a reasonable amount of national debt. So there's less government flexibility in terms of spending. 
I would say, as Michael mentioned, the local market has been pretty active because people aren't traveling. So it's just like everywhere else, people are ordering out, going to restaurants outside, that sort of thing. So that's kind of masks I think some of the underlying pain of not having tourists here. So I think when tourism comes that will pick things up. Surprisingly, or maybe not surprisingly, housing is -- the market has done quite well. So it's -- whether you're in Vermont or Bermuda and Cayman, people are looking for places that are safe and clean and have very few COVID cases, not just now but for future pandemics. And so we've seen a lot of interest, both locally and internationally in Bermuda Real Estate and Cayman real estate. 
So I'd say we're holding our own in Bermuda, but the recovery is going to be pretty tough. Cayman is doing a bit better simply because they came into the crisis with no national debt and much lower deficits and their GDP has been growing more quickly than Bermuda. So I think they will come out of the crisis more easily. Same story in the housing market, housing in Cayman was doing really well even before the pandemic. So I think they continue to do well. They have about 35 active cases compared to Bermudas 10. Channel Islands has 400 active cases, so a bit more, obviously closer to the U.K., but they've also got 110,000 people in Jersey and 60,000 in Guernsey. So it's 3x the size of Bermuda and Cayman together. So a bit more cases, currency is a bit more shutdown right now. 
Economically, again, both Guernsey and Jersey are extremely well managed, both politically and economically, so no national debt and so came into the crisis well from a fiscal position. GDP has done well before. The fund sector continues to do well. So I think they're in great shape. So across the board, I think our jurisdictions have actually handled it pretty well. 
We do think it's a bit of a fake spring in the sense that because there's so much domestic activity that it's kind of masked some of the underlying issues that will come out as -- even as tourism sort of starts back up. But in some sense, we feel like we may have missed a bullet a bit. But each island is different in terms of where its fiscal situation is. So some can spend more than the others. Each island has borrowed money to handle the pandemic in terms of incentive spending and getting money out into the community, and we've been pretty much part of all those facilities, which has been great. So I would say looking back, I think in March last year, we thought -- I think we would have thought it would have been much worse than it's actually been."

I will then turn the call over to Michael Schrum, our CFO, to provide a detailed review of the fourth quarter financials. 
Turning now to Slide 4, as a whole for 2020, I am very proud of Butterfield's performance and the resilience of the business model. In a near 0 interest rate environment, we produced net income of $147 million or $2.90 per share and core net income of $155 million or $3.04 per share, which equates to a core return on average tangible common equity of 17.3%. NIM finished the year at 2.42% with an average cost of deposits of 21 basis points for the year. We continued with a $0.44 per share quarterly cash dividend and completed a $3.5 million share repurchase program with the most activity during the second and third quarters. We also improved our capital profile with $100 million, 5.25% qualifying subordinated debt offering in June. 
Butterfield's business model, which focuses on maximizing returns while closely managing credit and operational risk, proved successful during this period of uncertainty. The global pandemic tested us across all jurisdictions, and the bank continued to perform well. Our technology and collaborative culture allowed us to maintain safe and uninterrupted services for our clients by decisively moving between the office and remote working environments as conditions required. 
Our conservative credit profile consists of 65% residential mortgages with relatively low LTVs, no out of market lending, a loan-to-deposit ratio of just 39% and an investment portfolio consisting of 97% U.S. government and federal agency securities. The historically low interest rates in 2020 also brought a renewed focus on improving efficiency. As a result, we implemented a bank-wide restructuring program to lower headcount as well as moving nonclient-facing positions to lower-cost service centers wherever possible. 
We were very pleased to complete the integration of ABN AMRO Channel Islands acquisition this year. The Channel Islands continue to represent a growth opportunity for us, both organic and through potential acquisitions. In 2021, we are launching retail lending products to complement our U.K. mortgages business and to activate a portion of our sterling deposits over time. We expect this business to be similar in underwriting standards and character to our loan portfolios in Bermuda and Cayman. We plan to develop the book organically and anticipate it could grow to around $500 million over the next 4 to 5 years. Finally, I would like to recognize the additions to our executive management team during 2020, which now benefits from fresh perspectives and deep experience to the roles in trust, compliance and operations, risk, communications and human resources. I am proud and confident in our management team and believe we have the right people in place to grow Butterfield and reach its potential. 
Turning now to Slide 5, here we have provided some context and an overview of our core markets and how the bank continues to manage through the pandemic. Bermuda, Cayman and the Channel Islands continue to have active domestic economic activity. However, much of the travel and tourism industry is operating well below historical norms. The vaccine rollout is progressing well and all jurisdictions have active government-sponsored vaccination programs. We expect that visitor numbers will continue to improve as we move through the summer and fall tourism seasons in 2021. As we discussed last quarter, following the mortgage assistance programs, we had implemented a calling program in Bermuda to better understand borrowers' status and ability to restore payments. I am pleased to say that the actual customer payment rates have exceeded the indications from the program. At this point, we are seeing short-term delinquency of less than 1% of the total residential loan book and continue to work closely with customers to determine the best way forward. While we are encouraged by these initial results, we recognize that the pandemic continues to impact customers and we'll maintain close monitoring of the mortgage books in Bermuda and Cayman. 
Our commercial lending book remains solid and has not been significantly impacted by COVID-19 related issues. Direct hotel and restaurant lending continues to be limited, well underwritten and performing loans. I will now turn the call over to Michael Schrum to provide a detailed review of the fourth quarter."

I'll begin on Slide 7, which provides some highlights from the fourth quarter. We ended 2020 with the most profitable quarter for the year, with net income of $42.1 million, core net income of $42.9 million or $0.86 per share and core return on average tangible common equity of 19%. The net interest margin was 2.25% for the quarter and the average cost of deposits improved to 12 basis points. 
Turning to Slide 8, net interest income continued to be impacted by lower market rates, and particularly the reinvestment book yields of securities are lower than maturities. Prepayment speeds in our investment portfolio moderated slightly in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. However, they were still elevated with $329 million of paydowns compared to $339 million in the prior quarter. Investment yields were down 15 basis points in the fourth quarter compared to the prior quarter. New money yields averaged 1.46% in the fourth quarter or 4.7 basis points higher than the prior quarter. During the fourth quarter, the blended rate for loan originations was 3.66% for $201 million of new loans, down from 3.93% for $156 million of originations in the prior quarter. 
On Slide 9, you can see that noninterest income was up 1.9% compared to the prior quarter due to improving economic activity across our jurisdictions and increases across asset management, banking, FX and trust business lines. The bank's contribution from fees continues to represent stable and capital-efficient earnings. For the fourth quarter, fees were 38% of total revenue. 
Slide 10 provides a summary of core noninterest expense, which improved by 2.6% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior quarter. Expenses fell as we started to experience the benefits of the cost restructuring program in the third quarter, which achieved the expected reduced run rate. In addition, lower technology costs and indirect taxes improved, which was partially offset by higher marketing spend that increased along with improving economic activity. We continue to target a through cycle cost income ratio of 60%, and we expect to remain in the mid-60s during this ultra-low part of the rate cycle. 
Slide 11 summarizes regulatory and leverage capital levels that continues to be in an excellent capital position with capital ratios well in excess of regulatory requirements. We have been pleased to note that our tangible book value per share has also increased 8.8% over the past calendar year. Capital management remains an important value driver for the bank. We continue to manage capital with an emphasis on protecting the sustainable quarterly cash dividend rate at $0.44 per common share. In addition, we maintain capital levels to support organic growth in our core markets as well as M&A opportunities. Share repurchases subject to market conditions, also continues to be part of the planned EPS growth, and the Board of Directors has authorized a new share repurchase program for up to 2 million shares for the coming 12-month period. 
Turning now to Slide 12, Butterfield continues to manage a strong, conservative and highly liquid balance sheet. At the end of the fourth quarter, the loan portfolio represented only about 35% of total assets, whereas liquid assets were just at over 60% of total assets. Deposit balances ballooned to $13.3 billion at the end of the fourth quarter from $11.9 billion at the end of the previous quarter. We do expect some of the increase will be temporary and that the deposit balances will normalize over the next few quarters. The bank has maintained a low-risk density with risk-weighted assets to total assets of 34.4%, down from 36.7% last quarter. 
On Slide 13 we show that Butterfield's asset quality remains exceptionally high with limited credit risk in its investment portfolio that is 99% comprised of AAA-rated U.S. government-guaranteed agency securities. Nonaccrual loans were down slightly versus the prior quarter at $72.5 million or 1.4% of gross loans. The net charge-off ratio ticked higher due to the secondary market sale of one commercial loan that crystallized the loss of provision previously recorded under the CECL model, and the overall NCL ratio remains very low. The implementation of the CECL accounting standard was well-managed for our bank and has resulted in improved credit quality overall. For Butterfield, the model has been responsive to portfolio performance and varying macroeconomic forecast as expected. 
On Slide 14 we discuss the average cash and securities balance sheet with a summary interest rate sensitivity analysis. Butterfield's weighted average life of around 4.1 years continues to offer some income protection against the impact of near to medium-term low interest rates. The unrealized mark-to-market gain on invested securities was $183.2 million at December 31, 2020. Similar to the past few quarters, Butterfield continues to expect a potential increase in net interest income in future periods in both up and down parallel rate scenarios. I will now turn the call back to Michael Collins."

So as you saw, we obviously measure both tangible as well as regulatory capital. So you're quite right that the regulatory capital benefited from a slight mix shift in terms of getting our subordinated debt issued midyear, which obviously made the efficacy at the existing capital stack a bit cheaper for us, but also allowed us to continue obviously with the buyback program that was fairly substantial last year, particularly executed in Q2 and Q3. 
The priorities are I think, as we stated a little bit earlier, is to protect the dividend rate that we have at the moment, which is we view as very sustainable. Payout ratio has been around 60% this year. But probably due to procyclicality of reserve builds from CECL and obviously rates being much lower than at the beginning of last year. Secondly, we obviously need to help the organic growth profile in our home markets, so that's Bermuda and Cayman, where we see opportunities and also account for any risk migrations in risk-weighted assets on the regulatory side that might come from experiencing additional credit issues, which so far we haven't. And then thirdly, obviously we look at M&A where that's accretive and the criteria are fairly strict. We really look just for banking assets in other markets where we can get some synergies and also obviously private trust companies that provide a stable capital-efficient fee income at reasonable multiples. And then fourthly, we look at share repurchases, and we're pleased to see that the Board has approved another repurchase program for the next 12 months at 2 million shares or up to 2 million shares. And so that will be executed, obviously, subject to market conditions. 
If you look at price-to-book at the moment, we're conscious, obviously, of potential book dilution relative to share repurchases, but we're still sitting at a fairly deep discount on P/E relative to peers. So I would say, look at the last couple of years of buybacks, and obviously, we'll execute that as and when. On the tangible, you saw it come down to sort of in the bottom to the middle of the range at 6.1. Obviously, ex-cash, it's a lot higher. And that was partly driven by OCI impact from post-retirement medical expenses having a material loss from the annual valuation cycle. So we're monitoring that as well as part of the overall capital strategy. So nothing has really changed, same priorities as last year. And obviously, we now have the firepower to exercise that as well. I'll let Michael just talk about M&A."

First, it provided us with a growth platform in a jurisdiction where we have very low market share. Obviously, Bermuda and Cayman, we've got sort of 35%, 40% market share, so it's harder to grow. Secondly, it reduced our concentration risk in Bermuda. And thirdly, it created relative balance sheet parity amongst our 3 banking jurisdictions. So strategically, that did a lot for us. Last year, obviously, conversations were pretty slow given the pandemic. We have a sense now that people are starting to get vaccines and starting of think about travel and starting to think about transactions more across our jurisdiction. So we are having some conversations, but we're always very cautious about thinking about whether they're going to come to fruition or the pricing is right or the AML is where we want it to be. 
So we are having conversations. The strategy is the same. So it's stressed companies across our existing jurisdictions as sort of overlap acquisitions. With a particular focus on Singapore, we'd like to build scale there. And secondly, overlap acquisitions in our existing jurisdictions, whether it be Bermuda, Cayman or more likely the Channel Islands. So we continue to have conversations, and we think this could be a good year to bring something to conclusion, but we're always cautious because we are very focused on due diligence and AML given where we operate. So we'll just continue having those discretions."

Obviously, there's a front book backlog. As you know, we amortize all of our loans on balance sheet. So they're manually underwritten, full recourse loans. So you see that loan yield kind of stabilizing, even though I gave a little bit of detail around the most recent loan originations, which was 3.66% in the last quarter, so down a little bit on the front book side, but relatively stable overall as we look at the whole -- at the loan book as a whole. We do expect some modest mix shift as we launch the residential lending opportunity in the Channel Islands. Those are sterling loans, which would be at a slightly lower rate. But again, that will take some time organically to come through there, and it would be activated out of our cash balances effectively. So that should be helpful to NIM. 
In terms of cash, pretty much floor there at 5 to 10 basis points. We're obviously watching the current discussions on sterling rates in terms of where they might go in the future. But that's probably reasonable there. That's been fully realized, if you will, at the short end of the curve. And then finally, on investments, prepayment speeds are obviously pretty elevated and have been pretty elevated throughout 2020. So we're seeing approximately 5% of the total investment book roll over a quarter, which is almost double what we saw in prior years, a combination there of a very flat forward yield curve. 
And then obviously, on the opposite side of that, we're deploying excess cash from the ABN AMRO into the securities book. So you see volume, a positive volume impact from that. So overall, I'm expecting some stabilization as long as there's a reasonable sort of 10-year and are a normal sloping yield curve that we've seen more recently. But obviously, the short end of the curve seems to be floor for a longer period of time. So medium-term stabilization around where we are, I would expect."

You can see on the average balance that it was pretty much towards the end of the quarter. Really a combination of retail deposits, but I would say, slightly unusual flows in the retail deposit base in that it was driven probably by the deferrals that we put on mortgages here where people were obviously keeping their payments and putting it into bank accounts. So again, over time, I would expect some of that to flow out in Cayman, mostly driven by allowable pension withdrawals, which is kind of a one-off fiscal stimulus that was provided there. Again, over time, that could migrate into either real assets, property or it could migrate back out, I think, to some retirement portfolios. So again, a little uncertain here, but they are retail deposits, which is obviously very helpful. 
And the other half roughly is related to sort of what I'd call hot money. So hedge funds flows in Cayman and capital insurance deposits in Bermuda, which typically follows sort of a premium claims cycle at the end of the quarter, and there's quite a lot of activity in the asset management space in -- towards the end of the fourth quarter.

So over and above the maturities that we get from the investments, which obviously would keep rolling into lower rates, we're also deploying the extra at that sort of clip of $150 million, around that a quarter. So the strategy hasn't really changed. Obviously, as the deposit base has increased quite a lot, we'll just have to wait and see if that sticks around and what we can do with that.

There are some of funds that we service, both in Guernsey and Jersey that have both sterling and dollar deposits, so it's more of a relationship-based pricing. But clearly, it's a challenging -- and I think it's a challenging environment in the secondary market. I think the residential lending program will definitely be accretive on the margin side.

Jersey is a new market for us, but Guernsey, we've been there for decades. So we know the market very well. It is a market -- a corporate market very much like Bermuda and Cayman. So in so management companies, Bermuda is more captives and reinsurance companies; Caymans, obviously, hedge funds and captives and Guernsey and Jersey are both captives, but more funds and trust companies. But it's all the same sort of management company structure. So our systems and our RMs are geared to servicing that business. So we understand it well. 
And what we've done with ABN, as I said, is to -- we've gotten to the point where we've actually balanced our balance sheet, so to speak, our risk exposures across the 3 jurisdictions relatively evenly. It's not the same from an earnings perspective. So Cayman in 2020, made about 56% of our core net income, Bermuda 31% and the Channel Islands, 14%. And even though the balance sheet are similar size, so that's simply because the Channel Islands are much more competitive from a pricing perspective. So that all makes sense. 
So I think we're kind of where we need to be to allow the Channel Islands to grow organically. So our focus right now is much more on the fee businesses on the trust side to try to build scale across our jurisdictions, but particularly in Singapore. Now that's not to say there if was a decent-sized bank in Jersey that were to come up for sale, again, there are not a lot of natural buyers. So I think we would be interested.

There's a few smaller positive items in the banking fees in the fourth quarter as well. But I would say you're probably going to see that run rate is a decent run rate. It was a bit smaller under trust fees in terms of activity-based fees, there was some recovery in that, but probably a bit smaller than we would see on the run rate side.

What's been attractive about both Guernsey and Jersey is we have a small market share, had, and still have a small market share in both jurisdictions. So we really can't grow organically or we can't as well as Bermuda and Cayman. So even after the ABN acquisition, we estimate our market share in Guernsey, and we're only on the corporate side and private banking and trust side, would be about 15%. 
So there's a lot more banks, obviously, in the Channel Islands than in Bermuda and Guernsey. So even at 15%, that gives us a platform where we can grow organically, but if we were to find an attractive acquisition, it would be nice to be 30%, 30%, 40%. But what we're saying is that 15% in Guernsey is a platform where at last we can grow organically, and we'll be opportunistic about whether there's an acquisition. Jersey is even more interesting in the sense that I think our market share we're guessing is about 1%. So there's about GBP 120 billion in deposits. 
So it's a huge banking market, and we only have a 1% market share. So I think Jersey would even be more interesting on the acquisition side. But I guess the point is across both Guernsey and Jersey, we have enough market share that we can grow product organically. But if there were a very attractively priced bank that were to come up for sale, we definitely would be interested. So our point is, we don't need to do it, but if it happened, we would look at it opportunistically."

Most of the -- so the CECL model now reflects the improved, obviously, macro GDP outlook, which is sort of forecasting a V-shaped recovery in Q2. I think we're being a bit cautious and we'd like to see the vaccine programs, obviously, taking root and seeing what actually happens. There's good news on the domestic side, obviously, almost all borrowers resume normal payments in Q4. So that was great to see. Still obviously continuing to monitor that. We're still not out of the pandemic yet. 
So I think we should think about CECL as opposed to the backward-looking model more reflecting an improved sort of credit outlook and macro outlook. The actual release was, I would say, about half and half. So you see the tick up in NCO, which was the sale of the loan that crystallized a loss. It was a lower-rated corporate loan. And we also had a small sovereign legacy loan from when we used to have a Barbados operation. This is kind of cleanup exercise. So as you think about the reserve going forward, the objective of CECL is obviously to reflect the future GDP outlook, in particular, the U.S. GDP outlook as well as the experience on the portfolio that feeds back into the model. It's been quite a year in terms of macro GDP forecasts, which is causing more -- probably more volatility in the reserves, which was not the intent when CECL was implemented. 
So it's sort of hard to predict, but I think we feel that the reserving level adequately reflects the underlying credit conditions and the current macroeconomic outlook. To the extent that that becomes better, that would result in obviously some release. But generally speaking, if you look at the coverage ratio, et cetera, we feel very comfortable that it reflects the underlying conditions of the loan book today. I know that wasn't a direct question, but it's -- I'm sure it's a difficult thing to predict the future, obviously."

But it is also worth remembering that as we're not subject to corporate income tax, we pay all of our taxes in the expense line, which has that kind of 4% to 5% dilutive effect on the cost-income ratio.

I mean it's been interesting to see as people start talking about negative rates and what potentially that impact could be in terms of us charging negative rates to customers and then now coming through. But I think, again, the strategy hasn't really changed. We keep laddering out what's maturing. The reason why the duration is pretty short and I think why we wanted to put weighted average life on there as well and the unrealized mark-to-market position, is that obviously we're fighting against the prepayment speeds, which are very materially elevated, I would say, partly fueled by refinancing rates and new originations in the U.S. market. 
So MBS prepayment speeds have just been very elevated, in addition also to the buyout options that have been offered into those securities. So we keep just laddering out what's maturing. And then I think the pace of laddering out the ABN has not changed and really should match the behavioral duration of the underlying deposits as we grow the data set around the ABN deposits. As we get into -- and again, we're not a mark-to-market shop.
So we don't sort of speculate on the asset sensitivity. It just naturally it occurs because we have a very low loan asset to the deposit ratio and loan asset to total asset ratio, and that's just a function of the markets that we're in. But to the extent that we are starting to see some creeping up in a more normal yield curve, obviously, that does provide some opportunities for us to think a bit more tactically around the deployment. But for the time being and certainly over the last year, it's just been a case of moderating the impact on reinvestment rates and prepayment speeds through the re-laddering, and we'll continue to do that. But we obviously constantly review the book. We're also looking at tactical opportunities."

So there was a bit of spike up around December, but it's come right down. Again, the testing is really efficient and has worked really well. It's a small place and you're surrounded by miles of saltwater. So you tend to be able to control it. So COVID is in good shape. The public sector, the fiscal position in Bermuda is elevated, I would say, just in terms of national debt and deficit, some of it caused by COVID, but we came into the crisis with a reasonable amount of national debt. So there's less government flexibility in terms of spending. 
I would say, as Michael mentioned, the local market has been pretty active because people aren't traveling. So it's just like everywhere else, people are ordering out, going to restaurants outside, that sort of thing. So that's kind of masks I think some of the underlying pain of not having tourists here. So I think when tourism comes that will pick things up. Surprisingly, or maybe not surprisingly, housing is -- the market has done quite well. So it's -- whether you're in Vermont or Bermuda and Cayman, people are looking for places that are safe and clean and have very few COVID cases, not just now but for future pandemics. And so we've seen a lot of interest, both locally and internationally in Bermuda Real Estate and Cayman real estate. 
So I'd say we're holding our own in Bermuda, but the recovery is going to be pretty tough. Cayman is doing a bit better simply because they came into the crisis with no national debt and much lower deficits and their GDP has been growing more quickly than Bermuda. So I think they will come out of the crisis more easily. Same story in the housing market, housing in Cayman was doing really well even before the pandemic. So I think they continue to do well. They have about 35 active cases compared to Bermudas 10. Channel Islands has 400 active cases, so a bit more, obviously closer to the U.K., but they've also got 110,000 people in Jersey and 60,000 in Guernsey. So it's 3x the size of Bermuda and Cayman together. So a bit more cases, currency is a bit more shutdown right now. 
Economically, again, both Guernsey and Jersey are extremely well managed, both politically and economically, so no national debt and so came into the crisis well from a fiscal position. GDP has done well before. The fund sector continues to do well. So I think they're in great shape. So across the board, I think our jurisdictions have actually handled it pretty well. 
We do think it's a bit of a fake spring in the sense that because there's so much domestic activity that it's kind of masked some of the underlying issues that will come out as -- even as tourism sort of starts back up. But in some sense, we feel like we may have missed a bullet a bit. But each island is different in terms of where its fiscal situation is. So some can spend more than the others. Each island has borrowed money to handle the pandemic in terms of incentive spending and getting money out into the community, and we've been pretty much part of all those facilities, which has been great. So I would say looking back, I think in March last year, we thought -- I think we would have thought it would have been much worse than it's actually been."

During the first quarter of 2021, Butterfield continued to achieve strong operating results and delivered high returns with an actively managed low-risk profile. We provide market-leading financial products and services to clients seeking banking, wealth management, trust and custody services in our primary markets of Bermuda, Cayman and the Channel Islands, where we have long-standing, significant and stable market shares. We also delivered trust and wealth management services through our offices in Singapore, Switzerland and the Bahamas. In the United Kingdom, we offer mortgages to high net worth clients with properties in Prime Central London. 
As you will see on Slide 4, Butterfield continues to report strong results with net income and core net income of $41.6 million or $0.83 per share and a return on tangible common equity of 19.3%. We had stable net interest income and fees with improving expense trends. Based on an improved economic forecast and steady loan performance, we had a credit reserve release of $1.5 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to a recovery of $2.4 million in the prior quarter and a provision of $5.2 million in the first quarter of last year. 
We are encouraged by the improving economic and interest rate outlook across our operating jurisdictions as we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic. We will continue to work with a small number of borrowing customers to help them find solutions to any challenges they may face. So far, our credit portfolios have shown a high degree of resilience during a difficult operating environment. 
The Board of Directors again declared a $0.44 per share dividend, which is consistent with our capital management philosophy of supporting a sustainable quarterly cash dividend with consideration for both organic and inorganic growth as well as share repurchases. We continue to target a through-cycle dividend payout ratio of approximately 50% with flexibility around share buybacks depending on market conditions and potential M&A opportunities.

I'll start on Slide 6 with a summary of net interest income and NIM. 
In the first quarter, we reported NIM of 2.09%, which was 16 basis points lower than the prior quarter due to 3 primary contributing factors: Firstly, continued loan yields on the short end of the curve; secondly, elevated prepayment speeds and reinvestment yields that are below running book yields in the investment portfolio; and thirdly, the most important significant contributor was the level of customer deposits and cash balances, which remained at historic high levels throughout the first quarter. Loan yields were down 5 basis points due to a jurisdictional mix shift in the first quarter. 
During the quarter, Bermuda had a modest increase in commercial loans, while Cayman saw some residential loan growth, although growth was mostly offset by an early repayment of a sizable commercial facility in the Channel Islands. 
During the quarter, the net average balance in the investment portfolio increased approximately $500 million or 10% as we put new money to work in the U.S. agency MBS securities portfolio. New money yields averaged 1.62% in the first quarter of 2021 or 16 basis points higher than the 1.46% in the prior quarter. 
During the first quarter, the blended rate for loan originations improved to 4.15% for $212 million of new loans from 3.66% for $201 million of originations in the fourth quarter of 2020. 
Turning to Slide 7. Noninterest income was stable at just over $47.5 million. Transaction volumes and foreign exchange increase, which lifted foreign exchange commissions by $1.9 million in the quarter and asset management also benefited from increased valuation-based fees. These offset the seasonal decline in debit and credit card fees due to the fourth quarter holiday shopping spending volumes. The bank continued to benefit from diverse and capital-efficient fee business with a fee-to-income ratio of 38.4% in the first quarter of 2021. 
Slide 8 provides a summary of core noninterest expense, which improved by 1.8% to $80.9 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the prior quarter. The phase restructuring during the second half of last year has continued to improve run rates with salaries and benefit costs reduced 4.3% over the prior quarter. This was moderated by an increase in high indirect taxes, but the overall restructuring program savings run rate has now been achieved. The cost-to-income ratio improved sequentially by 80 basis points to 64.8%, which is approximately where we expect to be at this point in the business and rate cycle. 
Slide 9 summarizes regulatory and leverage capital levels. Butterfield continues to maintain capital levels conservatively above regulatory requirements. During the quarter, higher U.S. dollar long-term interest rates lowered OCI gains on the AFS investment portfolio by $67.2 million. And this resulted in a TCE to TA ratio temporarily below our targeted range of 6% to 6.5%. We expect this to build back with normalized deposit levels supported by normal organic capital build over the coming quarters. 
Turning now to Slide 10. Butterfield's balance sheet continues to be strong and conservatively managed with very high degree of liquidity. As discussed, we continue to see historically high deposit balances due to government stimulus, onetime pension withdrawals and varied commercial customer activity. We still expect that a portion of these deposits will be temporary in nature. 
On Slide 11, we show that Butterfield's asset quality remains exceptionally high with low credit risk in the investment portfolio, which continues to be 99% comprised of AAA-rated U.S. government-guaranteed agency securities. We remain comfortable with our lending book profile with 2/3 of loans comprised of manually underwritten full recourse residential mortgages in Bermuda, Cayman and the U.K. In the Channel Islands, we are continuing the marketing of the residential mortgage products that will be similar in structure and underwriting to our Bermuda and Cayman loans and will allow us to activate our storing deposits. The overall residential loan-to-value profile remains conservative at approximately 53% in Bermuda and Cayman. 
Our credit book continues to perform well with nonaccrual loans holding steady at 1.4% of gross loans. Following an increase in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to one commercial loan, the net charge-off ratio has settled back down to negligible levels. We continue to actively monitor credit with outbound calling programs and are working with any customers who may be experiencing difficulty. 
On Slide 12, we discuss the average cash and securities balance sheet with a summary interest rate sensitivity analysis. Butterfield's weighted average life in the AFS investment portfolio increased to 6.1 years from 4.2 years last quarter due to the expectation of slower MBS prepayment speeds as long-term rates continue to rise. As mentioned, we also added approximately net $500 million of new money to lock in some of the benefit from higher rates during the quarter. 
Consistent with prior quarters, Butterfield continues to expect a potential increase in net interest income in both the up and down rate scenarios. 
I will now turn the call back to Michael Collins."

I remain confident in Butterfield's strong operating position and the potential for continued organic growth as well as any possible acquisitions. We continue to examine potential acquisition targets and have seen an increase in the opportunity set that could be a good fit for Butterfield. Of particular interest are private trust companies within our geographic footprint. Pricing and due diligence will be key factors in progress on any possible deals with particular emphasis on customer documentation and evidence of robust compliance risk management. 
Butterfield remains committed to the successful strategy that we initially listed with on the New York Stock Exchange in 2016. We continue to generate ROEs in the mid- to high teens with the recurring fee income, low-cost deposits, a manually underwritten loan book with low LTVs, a capital-efficient investment portfolio with limited credit risk, strong risk management and a disciplined expense and capital management approach. We believe these attributes will continue to generate value for the bank and all of our stakeholders as we emerge into a post-pandemic 2021 and for the long term. 
Thank you. And with that, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?"

I'd say, going back to when we had the [ Neo Bill ], which really changed the way reinsurers were able to transfer risk from their U.S. entities to Bermuda, I think the fear was that would shut down the industry, and it really didn't. 
I think U.S. tax changes in terms of increasing the corporate tax, increasing once again, the tax that U.S. companies make on overseas earnings will have some impact, but nothing directly, I think. The biggest issue for us is we're watching very closely the discussion around a minimum global tax that Europe has talked about, Janet Yellen has talked about. We think, logistically, it's very difficult to -- it would be very difficult to get that sort of agreement across different countries, but it's something we need to keep an eye on. 
But I'd say, if you look at companies that did in versions like Ingersoll Rand, Google, a company in Bermuda, which looks like they may not have going forward, a lot of those big multinationals didn't really do a lot of business with the banks of Bermuda. I mean, they have intentionally incorporation and account, but not a huge impact. 
So there's been tax changes for the last 100 years and Bermuda and Cayman have been impacted by it. But so far, we've been able to to adapt. And companies are here for a lot more than tax. I mean, we've got a great regulatory environment. And we always talk about more than half of foreign capital in U.S. hedge funds is based in Cayman funds and the Bermuda reinsurance industry reinsures about 60% of catastrophes in the U.S., and that's not going to go away."

So the half of the deposit increase that relates to retail is, as a reminder, just is sort of onetime pension withdrawals, particularly in Cayman and Bermuda and general retail flows, some of which will stick around. 
On the commercial side, we're still expecting that to flow out over time, but it could be a couple of quarters. Honestly, I think we were probably not expecting those commercial deposits to be replaced by other temporary deposits in Q1, but that is what happened. Good problem to have.

And then, obviously, as we've talked about before, the Channel Islands sterling rates are in the gross rates at 350-ish. So again, below Bermuda and Cayman rates on mortgage originations. But over time, that will pressure the yield a little bit on the loan book. But I mean, it was a handful of basis points.

And as we are transferring their responsibilities either to Halifax or to replacements, there's a bit more relief coming on the expense side. 
I do expect that to be broadly picked up by additional T&E expenses in the second half this year. I mean, there are -- post-pandemic, there is a need for us to come out and see clients and go and see our colleagues in other jurisdictions. So I think the 80, 81 level is probably what we previously said, we were thinking it's going to end up, and that's probably still a good number."

So Bermuda, has the 4 banks, that's very high barriers to entry in this market and the banks are pretty -- HSBC and Butterfield have sort of equal market shares, and we don't see that changing. Cayman is a bit more competitive with 6 banks and some Canadian banks, but I don't think the competitive landscape has changed dramatically. And then the Channel Islands is much more competitive with all the U.K. banks and European banks. 
So no, I think everyone and particularly we feel proud that we're able to operate so efficiently from home, and we're still doing that to some extent, but no noticeable changes. But we've been really pleased in terms of how much local activity, as you can see in our fee income in the last year was a bit surprising in terms of how that held up, but no noticeable change in competition."

Yesterday afternoon, we issued a press release announcing our first quarter results. The press release and financial statements, along with a slide presentation that we will refer to during our remarks on this call, are available on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.butterfieldgroup.com.
Before I turn the call over to Michael Collins, I would like to remind everyone that today's discussions will refer to certain non-GAAP measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. Please note that in the first quarter of 2021, we did not record any non-core items. As a result, any references to prior period core results are comparable to U.S. GAAP results in the first quarter of 2021. For a reconciliation of any non-GAAP measures to U.S. GAAP, please refer to the earnings press release and slide presentation. 
Today's call and associated materials may also contain certain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements. On Slide 25 of the presentation, we've also included a list of potential factors relevant to the implications of COVID-19 for the bank. Additional information regarding these risks can be found in our SEC filings.

During the first quarter of 2021, Butterfield continued to achieve strong operating results and delivered high returns with an actively managed low-risk profile. We provide market-leading financial products and services to clients seeking banking, wealth management, trust and custody services in our primary markets of Bermuda, Cayman and the Channel Islands, where we have long-standing, significant and stable market shares. We also delivered trust and wealth management services through our offices in Singapore, Switzerland and the Bahamas. In the United Kingdom, we offer mortgages to high net worth clients with properties in prime Central London.
As you will see on Slide 4, Butterfield continues to report strong results with net income and core net income of $41.6 million or $0.83 per share and a return on tangible common equity of 19.3%. We had stable net interest income and fees with improving expense trend. Based on an improved economic forecast and steady loan performance, we had a credit reserve release of $1.5 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to a recovery of $2.4 million in the prior quarter and a provision of $5.2 million in the first quarter of last year.
We are encouraged by the improving economic and interest rate outlook across our operating jurisdictions as we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic. We will continue to work with a small number of borrowing customers to help them find solutions to any challenges they may face. So far, our credit portfolios have shown a high degree of resilience during a difficult operating environment.
The Board of Directors again declared a $0.44 per share dividend, which is consistent with our capital management philosophy of supporting a sustainable quarterly cash dividend with consideration for both organic and inorganic growth as well as share repurchases. We continue to target a through-cycle dividend payout ratio of approximately 50% with flexibility around share buybacks, depending on market conditions and potential M&A opportunities.
I will now turn the call over to Michael Schrum to provide more details on the first quarter."

Butterfield & Son Limited","Executives","Thank you, Michael. I'll start on Slide 6 with a summary of net interest income and NIM.In the first quarter, we reported NIM of 2.09%, which was 16 basis points lower than the prior quarter due to 3 primary contributing factors. Firstly, continued loan",834,"Thank you, Michael. I'll start on Slide 6 with a summary of net interest income and NIM.
In the first quarter, we reported NIM of 2.09%, which was 16 basis points lower than the prior quarter due to 3 primary contributing factors. Firstly, continued loan yields on the short end of the curve. Secondly, elevated prepayment speeds and reinvestment yields that are below running book yields in the investment portfolio. And thirdly, the most important significant contributor was the level of customer deposits and cash balances, which remained at historic high levels throughout the first quarter.
Loan yields were down 5 basis points due to a jurisdictional mix shift in the first quarter. During the quarter, Bermuda had a modest increase in commercial loans while Cayman saw some residential loan growth, although growth was mostly offset by an early repayment of a sizable commercial facility in the Channel Islands.
During the quarter, the net average balance in the investment portfolio increased approximately $500 million or 10% as we put new money to work in the U.S. agency, MBS securities portfolio. New money yields averaged 1.62% in the first quarter of 2021 or 16 basis points higher than the 1.46% in the prior quarter.
During the first quarter, the blended rate for loan originations improved to 4.15% for $212 million of new loans from 3.66% for $201 million of originations in the fourth quarter of 2020.
Turning to Slide 7. Noninterest income was stable at just over $47.5 million. Transaction volumes and foreign exchange increased, which lifted foreign exchange commissions, by $1.9 million in the quarter, and asset management also benefited from increased valuation-based fees. These offset the seasonal decline in debit and credit card fees due to the fourth quarter holiday shopping spending volumes. The bank continued to benefit from diverse and capital-efficient fee business with a fee-to-income ratio of 38.4% in the first quarter of 2021.
Slide 8 provides a summary of core noninterest expense, which improved by 1.8% to $80.9 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the prior quarter. The phase restructuring during the second half of last year has continued to improve run rates with salaries and benefit costs reduced 4.3% over the prior quarter. This was moderated by an increase in high indirect taxes, but the overall restructuring program savings run rate has now been achieved. The cost-to-income ratio improved sequentially by 80 basis points to 64.8%, which is approximately where we expect to be at this point in the business and rate cycle.
Slide 9 summarizes regulatory and leverage capital levels. Butterfield continues to maintain capital levels conservatively above regulatory requirements. During the quarter, higher U.S. dollar long-term interest rates lowered OCI gains on the AFS investment portfolio by $67.2 million, and this resulted in a TCE/TA ratio temporarily below our targeted range of 6% to 6.5%. We expect this to build back with normalized deposit levels supported by normal organic capital build over the coming quarters.
Turning now to Slide 10. Butterfield's balance sheet continues to be strong and conservatively managed with very high degree of liquidity. As discussed, we continue to see historically high deposit balances due to government stimulus, onetime pension withdrawals and varied commercial customer activity. We still expect that a portion of these deposits will be temporary in nature.
On Slide 11, we show that Butterfield's asset quality remains exceptionally high with low credit risk in the investment portfolio, which continues to be 99% comprised of AAA-rated U.S. government-guaranteed agency securities. We remain comfortable with our lending book profile with 2/3 of loans comprised of manually underwritten full recourse residential mortgages in Bermuda, Cayman and the U.K. 
In the Channel Islands, we are continuing the marketing of the residential mortgage products that will be similar in structure and underwriting to our Bermuda and Cayman loans and will allow us to activate our sterling deposits. The overall residential loan-to-value profile remains conservative at approximately 53% in Bermuda and Cayman.
Our credit book continues to perform well with nonaccrual loans holding steady at 1.4% of gross loans. Following an increase in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to one commercial loan, the net charge-off ratio has settled back down to negligible levels. We continue to actively monitor credit with outbound calling programs and are working with any customers who may be experiencing difficulty.
On Slide 12, we discussed the average cash and securities balance sheet with a summary interest rate sensitivity analysis. Butterfield's weighted average life in the AFS investment portfolio increased to 6.1 years from 4.2 years last quarter due to the expectation of slower MBS prepayment speeds as long-term rates continue to rise. As mentioned, we also added approximately net $500 million of new money to lock in some of the benefit from higher rates during the quarter.
Consistent with prior quarters, Butterfield continues to expect a potential increase in net interest income in both the up and down rate scenarios.
I will now turn the call back to Michael Collins."

Of particular interest are private trust companies within our geographic footprint. Pricing and due diligence will be key factors in progress on any possible deals with particular emphasis on customer documentation and evidence of robust compliance risk management.
Butterfield remains committed to the successful strategy that we initially listed with on the New York Stock Exchange in 2016. We continue to generate ROEs in the mid- to high-teens with the recurring fee income, low-cost deposits, a manually underwritten loan book with low LTVs, a capital-efficient investment portfolio with limited credit risk, strong risk management and a disciplined expense and capital management approach. We believe these attributes will continue to generate value for the bank and all of our stakeholders as we emerge into a post-pandemic 2021 and for the long term."

So we support dividend rate that we currently have and have announced again, plus organic growth in our home markets. So obviously, then, we look for accretive acquisitions. There's clearly been a bit more dialogue in that space. And then, thirdly, obviously, buybacks subject to market conditions. 
But as we saw the long-term rates starting to increase and deposit levels continuing in the first quarter at the sort of elevated level, we looked at the impact on leverage capital ratios and throttle back a bit on the repurchase activity. Share repurchases remain an important part of the overall capital return priorities, but it's just being a bit more conservative as the M&A dialogue is picking up as well.
So I don't -- I wouldn't put a hard limit on it. We're still active in the market. I think on a PE basis, we're still good value in the market. So our price support clearly has seen a bit of a pickup, but we're just being a bit more conservative given the TCE and given the M&A dialogue. So it's still part of the overall capital deployment."

I mean, any U.S. tax changes actually would have some impact on Bermuda, Cayman and even the Channel Islands. I'd say, going back to when we had the new bill, which really changed the way reinsurers were able to transfer risk from their U.S. entities to Bermuda, I think the fear was that would shut down the industry, and it really didn't. 
I think U.S. tax changes in terms of increasing the corporate tax, increasing once again the tax that U.S. companies make on overseas earnings will have some impact, but nothing directly, I think. The biggest issue for us is we're watching very closely the discussion around a minimum global tax that Europe has talked about, Janet Yellen has talked about. We think, logistically, it's very difficult to -- it would be very difficult to get that sort of agreement across different countries, but it's something we need to keep an eye on. 
But I'd say, if you look at companies that did inversions like Ingersoll Rand, Google added a company in Bermuda, which looks like they may not have going forward, a lot of those big multinationals didn't really do a lot of business with the banks of Bermuda. I mean, they have intentionally in corporation and account, but not a huge impact. 
So there's been tax changes for the last 100 years, and Bermuda and Cayman have been impacted by it. But so far, we've been able to adapt. And companies are here for a lot more than tax. I mean, we've got a great regulatory environment. And we always talk about more than half of foreign capital. And U.S. hedge funds is based in Cayman funds and the Bermuda reinsurance industry reinsures about 60% of catastrophes in the U.S., and that's not going to go away."

I mean, I think we've talked about $500 million worth of residential mortgages in the Channel Islands over 5 years, and we're on pace to achieve that."

Great question. Difficult to say, really. I mean, as we sat here, I think, after Q4, we definitely had some visibility around outflows coming into Q1, which actually did happen but were replaced by other commercial activities, such as premiums cycle on -- as you know, the insurance market is hardening quite significantly, so premiums are going up. And we have more premium inflows for captive insurance companies, the beginning of the quarter, and that's really kind of stuck around. So the half of the deposit increase that relates to retail is, as a reminder, just is sort of onetime pension withdrawals, particularly in Cayman and Bermuda and general retail flows, some of which will stick around. 
On the commercial side, we're still expecting that to flow out over time, but it could be a couple of quarters. Honestly, I think we were probably not expecting those commercial deposits to be replaced by other temporary deposits in Q1, but that is what happened. Good problem to have. But obviously, that means a little bit more conservative management and clearly an impact on NIM from average deposits in the quarter as well."

And then, obviously, as we've talked about before, the Channel Islands, sterling rates are in the gross rates of 350-ish. So again, below Bermuda and Cayman rates on mortgage originations. So -- but over time, that will pressure the yield a little bit on the loan book. But I mean, it was a handful of basis points. 
There's still a large back book. And so although amortization continues both in the Bermuda and Cayman book, it shouldn't -- it's not too much of an impact, if that makes sense."

So that was, I would say, a onetime shot, but we can't replicate it every year. 
What we are doing though is continuing to focus on our Halifax service center. So we're continuing to automate as much as we can in Bermuda and Cayman and then transfer those roles and functions to Halifax. We've got about 150 people up there now. So we finally have sort of a scale and critical mass where the teams are kind of supporting each other. So we continue to see that growing. And that will have a gradual impact on expenses over time. Basically, the cost is about 50% [ per se ] compared to Bermuda and Cayman. But then you also have currency fluctuations as well.

I do expect that to be broadly picked up by additional T&E expenses in the second half this year. I mean, there are -- post-pandemic, there is a need for us to come out and see clients and go and see our colleagues in other jurisdictions. So I think the 80, 81 level is probably what we previously said, we were thinking it's going to end up, and that's probably still a good number."

Cayman is a bit more competitive with 6 banks and some Canadian banks, but I don't think the competitive landscape has changed dramatically. And then the Channel Islands is much more competitive with all the U.K. banks and European banks.

Butterfield continues to produce strong financial results during the second quarter of 2021 with profitable and long-standing core banking and wealth management businesses in Bermuda, the Cayman Islands and the Channel Islands, as well as Singapore, the U.K., the Bahamas and Switzerland, where we offer a variety of specialized financial services and products. 
All of our operating jurisdictions fared reasonably well during the pandemic, despite the closure of airports and sea borders, which is a testament to the resilience and strong domestic economies of the small island nations where we operate. International businesses in our jurisdictions were largely unaffected due to the success of remote working models. This backdrop has aided us in our efforts to keep banking services open and available and to continue to produce long-term growth. 
I will now turn to Slide 4 where we provide a summary of second quarter highlights. Butterfield reported net income for the second quarter of $39.6 million or $0.79 per diluted common share and core net income of $40.1 million or $0.80 per diluted common share. This resulted in a core return on average tangible common equity of 18.7%, despite a sustained low interest rate environment. 
Our credit portfolio has performed well. And in the second quarter, we had a credit provision release of $1 million, primarily due to an improved economic forecast. The Board of Directors again declared the $0.44 per share dividend which is in line with our target through a cycle dividend payout ratio of approximately 50% with flexibility around share buybacks depending on market conditions and potential M&A opportunities. 
We continue to evaluate potential acquisition targets in private trust, wealth management and banking. As we have stated previously, from the point of initial discussions, these deals can take 9 months to a year before they are announced. I cannot offer a specific time line at the moment, but can say that M&A growth remains a priority for us, and we are committed to pursuing deals that meet our strategic and financial goals. 
I will now turn the call over to Michael Schrum to provide more details in the second quarter."

In the second quarter, we reported net interest income of $74.7 million, which was in line with the prior quarter as higher volumes mostly offset lower yields. NIM",778,"Thank you, Michael. I will start on Slide 6 with a summary of net interest income and NIM. In the second quarter, we reported net interest income of $74.7 million, which was in line with the prior quarter as higher volumes mostly offset lower yields. NIM of 2.01% was 8 basis points lower than the prior quarter due to continued deposit growth and elevated MBS paydowns that were similar to the prior quarter at around $350 million, which in turn resulted in redeployment of assets at market rates below the current book yield. 
Lower deposit costs helped offset some of the NIM decline. Loan yields were down 9 basis points in the second quarter due to jurisdictional mix shift, while portfolio balances were stable. 
During the second quarter, the blended rate for loan originations was 3.57% for $234 million of new loans, down from 4.15% for $212 million of originations in the first quarter of 2021. 
During the quarter, the net average balance in the investment portfolio increased $307 million as we continue to put new money to work in U.S. agency MBS securities and U.S. treasuries. New money yields averaged 1.66% in the second quarter of 2021 or 4 basis points higher than the 1.62% in the prior quarter. 
Turning to Slide 7. Noninterest income increased $1.3 million to $48.8 million compared to the prior quarter. Higher credit card volumes and higher credit facility fees drove the growth in banking revenues as the first quarter tends to see less transaction activity. The bank's higher noninterest income resulted in an increased fee income ratio of 39.4% in the second quarter of 2021. 
Slide 8 provides a summary of core noninterest expense, which increased $83.4 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the prior quarter. The increase in core expenses was a result of a number of factors, some of which are not expected to repeat in future periods. 
We had a onetime voluntary opportunity for our colleagues to receive payment for a portion of unused holidays during the pandemic. In competitive business locations, market salary adjustments were also implemented for retention purposes. We saw some insurance renewal cost increase as well as increased client engagement and consulting costs due to return to more normal business activity levels. 
As we continue to work our way out of the pandemic period, we expect core noninterest expense to settle back into the $82 million to $83 million range per quarter. 
Slide 9 summarizes regulatory and leverage capital levels. Butterfield continues to maintain conservative capital levels that continue to exceed regulatory requirements. The continued growth in deposit levels kept our TCE-to-TA ratio below our targeted range of 6% to 6.5%. We expect this to build back over the coming quarters. 
Turning now to Slide 10. Butterfield's balance sheet continues to be strong and conservatively managed with a very high degree of liquidity. Deposit levels have continued to grow this quarter, and we will monitor the duration of these deposits and offer complementary off-balance sheet investment products for transitory flows. As deposits season, we continue to deploy liquidity in the second quarter through growth in the investment portfolio. 
On Slide 11, we show that Butterfield's asset quality remains exceptionally high with low credit risk in the investment portfolio, which continues to be 99% comprised of AAA-rated U.S. government-guaranteed agency securities. We've been pleased with the performance of the loan portfolio so far despite the challenges presented to borrowers over the past 18 months. 
As a reminder, 2/3 of our loans consist of manually underwritten full recourse residential mortgages in Bermuda, Cayman and the U.K. We are also seeing increased demand for our residential mortgage products in the Channel Islands. The underwriting in those markets is similar to those of Bermuda and Cayman, and that will allow us to activate our sterling deposits. We continue to expect that book to grow to as much as $500 million over the next 4 to 5 years. 
Nonaccrual loans have improved marginally, down to 1.3% of gross loans from 1.4% in the prior quarter. We continue to actively monitor credit with outbound calling programs and are working with any customers who may experience difficulty. 
On Slide 12, we discuss the average cash and securities balance sheet with a summary interest rate sensitivity analysis. Butterfield's weighted average life in the AFS investment portfolio declined to 5.0 years from 6.1 years last quarter due to lower market yields, which increased prepayment speeds in the portfolio. Consistent with prior quarters, Butterfield continues to expect a potential increase to net interest income in both up and down rate scenarios. 
I will now turn the call back to Michael Collins."

Under Pillar 2, there is a proposed global corporate income tax with a minimum rate of 15%. 
After much speculation, it is helpful to now understand the initial framework, which has an ambitious time line for implementation with an expected effective date of 2023 and with significant further work and negotiation to come. All of Butterfield's key operating jurisdictions have joined the agreement and are actively participating in discussions highlighting their important role in global capital flows for insurance and reinsurance as well as the international hedge fund industry.

In summary, I am proud of Butterfield's financial and operational performance and the proven resilience of our business model through a very challenging environment. We have consistently produced high returns even through the pandemic with a business model characterized by low credit risk, substantial liquidity and capital, strong fee income and favorable competitive dynamics. 
We have been able to generate a consistent 15% to 25% core return on average tangible common equity throughout the interest rate cycle, while only lending in our home markets and investing excess deposits in U.S. government treasuries and agencies. As our economy is fully open in the second half of 2021 into 2022, I have confidence in Butterfield's long-term value proposition and growth prospects, and I look forward to updating you in the coming quarters. Thank you. 
And with that, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?"

And you're right, Alex, we've seen a significant amount of deposit inflows over the last couple of quarters really starting in Q4. So the balance sheet's really kind of ballooned with some of the surge deposits. About 50% of the deposits are retail between Bermuda and Cayman, and it's driven by some of the fiscal stimulus in those 2 jurisdictions, which is really consistent on pension withdrawals, that's put on to our balance sheet. As well as in Bermuda, in particular, there was a transaction whereby the local electricity company was sold, and there was all local investors, and they've put that into -- onto our balance sheet. 
The other half really is quite transitory. What we would term surge deposits, they're very temporary. They're transaction related. And they come from the fund businesses in Cayman and some of the legal intermediaries that we're dealing with in Cayman, as well as some of the captives in Bermuda. And so we see those coming in and out, but they seem to always be replaced with more deposits coming in. So that's really in those 2 categories. And in the Channel Islands, we also see some deposit flows, particularly from PE funds around quarter end, but they tend to be very transitory in nature. 
In terms of the money fund, we are obviously talking to clients about not parking large sums of deposits onto our balance sheet when they want to clean up their own balance sheets. And so talking to clients about the availability of the money fund on a selective basis to ensure that they have access to the money fund as well as on balance sheet products. Where we see clients sort of repeatedly parking money on our balance sheet, we try and encourage them very strongly to fill in application forms and help us manage our balance sheet and their balance sheet as well. Neither of which is -- neither is very accretive, I would say, for the client at the moment. But obviously, we also want to be careful that we keep our core clients happy during this period. And I think it's really something that everybody is seeing across the industry. And we did see further deposit growth this quarter, but it wasn't at the pace that we saw in Q4 and Q1."

And so maybe you can sort of tackle both sides of that question. One, the sort of the balance sheet size. And then two, is that going to be prohibitive to stock repurchases and other capital actions later this year?"

But I think how long is temporary is the question really that we're facing at the moment. Certainly, in Q4, we were expecting the transactional flows to kind of not necessarily repeat in Q1, but actually, we had stronger flows coming into Q1. And so to the extent that we can avail ourselves or the clients can avail themselves of our money fund. Obviously, that's going to alleviate some of the pressure. That is an ongoing discussion. 
I would say we've seen some stabilization in deposit levels more recently. But it's just hard to say how long it's going to be around fall because the -- it seems like the market is flushed with liquidity and everybody's searching for a place to put them. So I think it's good to have the tools in the toolbox. 
I also agree with you that if we're below the target range, although it's very explainable and it's directly associated with deposit growth, it is hard to contemplate other capital actions. So -- but we are building back about $400 million of organic capital to support deposit growth per quarter as well. So I don't think it's going to continue for a lot longer in terms of growing it, so we should be catching up. But it's just hard to say really."

I mean there were probably -- there was just a bunch of -- or a combination of some smaller individual items. We, I think, called out in a noncore severance cost in our Mauritius office as we transfer the remaining banking operations functions to Guernsey and Halifax, and so that was the $1.4 million of noncore expenses there. 
And then we had some contractor costs that were associated with the transfer of those businesses. Obviously, we wouldn't expect those to repeat. Correct. The [indiscernible] buyback, I think, was a good engagement driver for us, and we're really trying to avoid a problem later on in the year where we've had people working on shifts and teams and they've accrued vacation haven't been able to travel, trying to avoid a problem around Christmas, where we don't have adequate coverage, et cetera. And so this was an opportunity really for them to sell back a portion of that. I think the total cost was probably in the $0.5 million range. Some of that was obviously accrued and carried forward from prior year, and some of it was this year's vacation days. 
And then we have some consultant costs for a couple of smaller projects in Guernsey and Cayman, which are now wrapping up. So again, we're not expecting that to repeat. And then we had the adjustments to staff incentive accruals for 2021. Obviously, that will continue through the year. Market salary adjustments, a few offices where we've seen increased turnover. So that's more of a permanent thing. 
So I think, overall, we should be getting back in the 82, 83 range for the remainder of -- our quarterly range for the remainder of 2021. But I sort of hopefully gives you some color around the items and a sense of why we believe some of those are actually not repeatable."

I would say the experience in Halifax has been fantastic. It's a great workforce. All young, coming out of university, thrilled to be working for Butterfield. It's gotten a little more difficult because it's a really hot market. So post pandemic, a lot of Canadian companies have moved operational processing centers there. So there is a bit of competition and wage pressure for these students coming out of universities.

But as you look at future rate potential, current asset sensitivity profile, is it making you reconsider what you're doing with some of the on-balance sheet cash?

If you think about the underlying business that we're in, it's retail and mid-market corporate banking. We're in jurisdictions where GDP is probably, on average, growing 2% to 3%, Bermuda; 4% to 5%, Cayman. So that's kind of what we would expect from loan balances and deposit balances. So it leads me to think that what we're seeing at the moment is probably the same trend that we're seeing for most of the other markets in that central banks are printing money, and it's sitting on our balance sheet, and part of it is fiscal stimulus, et cetera. But I think at some point, pension balances have to go back into pensions. And so then that means we won't necessarily count that cash and ladder it out. 
So I think, as we sit here today, we're kind of comfortable where we are with the reinvestment rates are pretty close to our AFS portfolio running book at the moment. We'll just keep pace and continue to be conservative. And obviously, if there is an opportunity where the tenure goes back to the 175, 190 level, we'll grab that opportunity and bank some of that."

Butterfield continues to produce strong financial results during the second quarter of 2021 with profitable and long-standing core banking and wealth management businesses in Bermuda, the Cayman Islands and the Channel Islands, as well as Singapore, the U.K., the Bahamas and Switzerland, where we offer a variety of specialized financial services and products.
All of our operating jurisdictions fared reasonably well during the pandemic despite the closure of airports and sea borders, which is a testament to the resilience and strong domestic economies of the small island nations where we operate. International businesses in our jurisdictions were largely unaffected due to the success of remote working models. This backdrop has aided us in our efforts to keep banking services open and available and to continue to produce long-term growth.
I will now turn to Slide 4 where we provide a summary of second quarter highlights. Butterfield reported net income for the second quarter of $39.6 million or $0.79 per diluted common share and core net income of $40.1 million or $0.80 per diluted common share. This resulted in a core return on average tangible common equity of 18.7% despite a sustained low interest rate environment. Our credit portfolio has performed well. And in the second quarter, we had a credit provision release of $1 million, primarily due to an improved economic forecast. The Board of Directors again declared the $0.44 per share dividend which is in line with our target through-cycle dividend payout ratio of approximately 50% with flexibility around share buybacks depending on market conditions and potential M&A opportunities.
We continue to evaluate potential acquisition targets in private trust, wealth management and banking. As we have stated previously, from the point of initial discussions, these deals can take 9 months to a year before they are announced. I cannot offer a specific time line at the moment but can say that M&A growth remains a priority for us, and we are committed to pursuing deals that meet our strategic and financial goals.

NIM of 2.01% was 8 basis points lower than the prior quarter due to continued deposit growth and elevated MBS paydowns that were similar to the prior quarter at around $350 million, which, in turn, resulted in redeployment of assets at market rates below the current book yield. 
Lower deposit costs helped offset some of the NIM decline. Loan yields were down 9 basis points in the second quarter due to jurisdictional mix shift, while portfolio balances were stable. 
During the second quarter, the blended rate for loan originations was 3.57% for $234 million of new loans, down from 4.15% for $212 million of originations in the first quarter of 2021. 
During the quarter, the net average balance in the investment portfolio increased $307 million as we continue to put new money to work in U.S. agency MBS securities and U.S. treasuries. New money yields averaged 1.66% in the second quarter of 2021 or 4 basis points higher than the 1.62% in the prior quarter.
Turning to Slide 7. Noninterest income increased $1.3 million to $48.8 million compared to the prior quarter. Higher credit card volumes and higher credit facility fees drove the growth in banking revenues as the first quarter tends to see less transaction activity. The bank's higher noninterest income resulted in an increased fee income ratio of 39.4% in the second quarter of 2021.
Slide 8 provides a summary of core noninterest expense, which increased $83.4 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the prior quarter. The increase in core expenses was a result of a number of factors, some of which are not expected to repeat in future periods. We had a onetime voluntary opportunity for our colleagues to receive payment for a portion of unused holidays during the pandemic. In competitive business locations, market salary adjustments were also implemented for retention purposes. We saw some insurance renewal cost increase as well as increased client engagement and consulting costs due to return to more normal business activity levels. As we continue to work our way out of the pandemic period, we expect core noninterest expense to settle back into the $82 million to $83 million range per quarter.  
Slide 9 summarizes regulatory and leverage capital levels. Butterfield continues to maintain conservative capital levels that continue to exceed regulatory requirements. The continued growth in deposit levels kept our TCE-to-TA ratio below our targeted range of 6% to 6.5%. We expect this to build back over the coming quarters.
Turning now to Slide 10. Butterfield's balance sheet continues to be strong and conservatively managed with a very high degree of liquidity. Deposit levels have continued to grow this quarter, and we will monitor the duration of these deposits and offer complementary off-balance sheet investment products for transitory flows. As deposits season, we continue to deploy liquidity in the second quarter through growth in the investment portfolio.  
On Slide 11, we show that Butterfield's asset quality remains exceptionally high with low credit risk in the investment portfolio, which continues to be 99% comprised of AAA-rated U.S. government-guaranteed agency securities. We've been pleased with the performance of the loan portfolio so far despite the challenges presented to borrowers over the past 18 months.
As a reminder, 2/3 of our loans consist of manually underwritten full recourse residential mortgages in Bermuda, Cayman and the U.K. We are also seeing increased demand for our residential mortgage products in the Channel Islands. The underwriting in those markets is similar to those of Bermuda and Cayman, and that will allow us to activate our sterling deposits. We continue to expect that book to grow to as much as $500 million over the next 4 to 5 years.
Nonaccrual loans have improved marginally, down to 1.3% of gross loans from 1.4% in the prior quarter. We continue to actively monitor credit with outbound calling programs and are working with any customers who may experience difficulty.  
On Slide 12, we discuss the average cash and securities balance sheet with a summary interest rate sensitivity analysis. Butterfield's weighted average life in the AFS investment portfolio declined to 5.0 years from 6.1 years last quarter due to lower market yields which increased prepayment speeds in the portfolio. Consistent with prior quarters, Butterfield continues to expect a potential increase to net interest income in both up and down rate scenarios.  
I will now turn the call back to Michael Collins."

On July 1, 132 countries and jurisdictions agreed to join a new 2-pillar plan to reform international tax rules. Under Pillar 1, taxing rights of more than $100 billion of profit are expected to be reallocated to market jurisdictions each year, excluding regulated financial services and extractive industries, such as mining, oil and gas. Under Pillar 2, there is a proposed global corporate income tax with a minimum rate of 15%.
After much speculation, it is helpful to now understand the initial framework, which has an ambitious time line for implementation with an expected effective date of 2023 and with significant further work and negotiation to come. All of Butterfield's key operating jurisdictions have joined the agreement and are actively participating in discussions, highlighting their important role in global capital flows for insurance and reinsurance as well as the international hedge fund industry. All of our locations are blue-chip financial centers with track records of transparency and adapting to new regulatory requirements.
In summary, I am proud of Butterfield's financial and operational performance and the proven resilience of our business model through a very challenging environment. We have consistently produced high returns, even through the pandemic, with a business model characterized by low credit risk, substantial liquidity and capital, strong fee income and favorable competitive dynamics. We have been able to generate a consistent 15% to 25% core return on average tangible common equity throughout the interest rate cycle while only lending in our home markets and investing excess deposits in U.S. government treasuries and agencies. 
As our economy is fully open in the second half of 2021 into 2022, I have confidence in Butterfield's long-term value proposition and growth prospects, and I look forward to updating you in the coming quarters. 
Thank you.And with that, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?"

And you're right, Alex, we've seen a significant amount of deposit inflows over the last couple of quarters, really starting in Q4. So the balance sheet's really kind of ballooned with some of the surge deposits. About 50% of the deposits are retail between Bermuda and Cayman, and it's driven by some of the fiscal stimulus in those 2 jurisdictions, which is really consistent on pension withdrawals that's put on to our balance sheet. As well as in Bermuda, in particular, there was a transaction whereby the local electricity company was sold, and that was all local investors, and they've put that into -- onto our balance sheet. 
The other half really is quite transitory, what we would term surge deposits, they're very temporary. They're transaction related, and they come from the fund businesses in Cayman and some of the legal intermediaries that we're dealing with in Cayman as well as some of the captives in Bermuda. And so we see those coming in and out, but they seem to always be replaced with more deposits coming in. So that's really in those 2 categories. And in the Channel Islands, we also see some deposit flows, particularly from PE funds around quarter end, but they tend to be very transitory in nature.
In terms of the money fund, we are obviously talking to clients about not parking large sums of deposits onto our balance sheet when they want to clean up their own balance sheets. And so talking to clients about the availability of the money fund on a selective basis to ensure that they have access to the money fund as well as on balance sheet products. Where we see clients sort of repeatedly parking money on our balance sheet, we try and encourage them very strongly to fill in application forms and help us manage our balance sheet and their balance sheet as well, neither of which is -- neither is very accretive, I would say, for the client at the moment. But obviously, we also want to be careful that we keep our core clients happy during this period. And I think it's really something that everybody is seeing across the industry. And we did see further deposit growth this quarter, but it wasn't at the pace that we saw in Q4 and Q1."

And really what I'm getting at is that if deposits keep growing, that TCE ratio, it's going to be hard to get that above 6%, which is going to, I would think, limit your desire, your appetite to do things like buybacks. And so maybe you can sort of tackle both sides of that question, one, the sort of the balance sheet size. And then, two, is that going to be prohibitive to stock repurchases and other capital actions later this year?"

I mean I think we've said we expect those deposits to be temporary in nature, but I think how long is temporary is the question really that we're facing at the moment. Certainly, in Q4, we were expecting the transactional flows to kind of not necessarily repeat in Q1, but actually, we had stronger flows coming into Q1. And so to the extent that we can avail ourselves or the clients can avail themselves of our money fund, obviously, that's going to alleviate some of the pressure. That is an ongoing discussion. 
I would say we've seen some stabilization in deposit levels more recently, but it's just hard to say how long it's going to be around for because the -- it seems like the market is flushed with liquidity, and everybody's searching for a place to put them. So I think it's good to have the tools in the toolbox. 
I also agree with you that if we're below the target range, although it's very explainable and is directly associated with deposit growth, it is hard to contemplate other capital actions. So -- but we are building back about $400 million of organic capital to support deposit growth per quarter as well. So I don't think it's going to continue for a lot longer in terms of growing it, so we should be catching up. But it's just hard to say, really."

I mean there were probably -- there was just a bunch of -- or a combination of some smaller individual items. We, I think, called out in noncore severance cost in our Mauritius office as we transfer the remaining banking operations functions to Guernsey and Halifax, and so that was the $1.4 million of noncore expenses there. And then we had some contractor costs that were associated with the transfer of those businesses. Obviously, we wouldn't expect those to repeat. 
Correct, the vacation buyback, I think, was a good engagement driver for us, and we're really trying to avoid a problem later on in the year where we've had people working on shifts and teams and have accrued vacation, haven't been able to travel, trying to avoid a problem around Christmas, where we don't have adequate coverage, et cetera. And so this was an opportunity really for them to sell back a portion of that. I think the total cost was probably in the $0.5 million range. Some of that was obviously accrued and carried forward from prior year, and some of it was this year's vacation days. 
And then we have some consultant costs for a couple of smaller projects in Guernsey and Cayman, which are now wrapping up. So again, we're not expecting that to repeat. And then we had the adjustments to staff incentive accruals for 2021. Obviously, that will continue through the year. Market salary adjustments, a few offices, where we've seen increased turnover. So that's more of a permanent thing. 
So I think, overall, we should be getting back in the $82 million, $83 million range for the remainder of -- quarterly range for the remainder of 2021. But that sort of hopefully gives you some color around the items and a sense of why we believe some of those are actually not repeatable."

I would say the experience in Halifax has been fantastic. It's a great workforce, all young, coming out of university, thrilled to be working for Butterfield. It's gotten a little more difficult because it's a really hot market. So post pandemic, a lot of Canadian companies have moved operational processing centers there.

If you think about the underlying business that we're in, it's retail and mid-market corporate banking. We're in jurisdictions where GDP is probably, on average, growing 2% to 3%, Bermuda; 4% to 5%, Cayman. So that's kind of what we would expect from loan balances and deposit balances, so it leads me to think that what we're seeing at the moment is probably the same trend that we're seeing for most of the other markets in that central banks are printing money, and it's sitting on our balance sheet, and part of it is fiscal stimulus, et cetera. But I think at some point, pension balances have to go back into pensions, and so then that means we won't necessarily count that cash and ladder it out. 
So I think, as we sit here today, we're kind of comfortable where we are with -- the reinvestment rates are pretty close to our AFS portfolio running book yields at the moment. We'll just keep pace and continue to be conservative.

On the call, I'm joined by Butterfield's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Michael Collins; and Chief Financial Officer, Michael Schrum. Following their prepared remarks, we will open the call up for a question-and-answer session.
Yesterday afternoon, we issued a press release announcing our third quarter results. The press release and financial statements, along with a slide presentation that we will refer to during our remarks on this call are available on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.butterfieldgroup.com.
Before I turn the call over to Michael Collins, I would like to remind everyone that today's discussions will refer to certain non-GAAP measures, which we believe are important in evaluating the company's performance. For a reconciliation of these measures to U.S. GAAP, please refer to the earnings press release and slide presentation. Today's call and associated materials may also contain certain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by these statements.

Butterfield's results in the third quarter of 2021 continued to demonstrate the bank's earnings power and resilience in an ultra-low interest rate environment and health and credit uncertainty in most of our markets. So far in 2021, Butterfield has performed really well through a difficult period in our small and wealthy island market. During the recent fourth COVID wave, people and businesses were better prepared and have learned to live with it. We anticipate this to continue and sense our local economies taking on more of a business as usual approach without the need for further economy-wide lockdowns.
I will turn now to Slide 4, where we provide a summary of third quarter highlights. Butterfield reported net income for the third quarter of $39.8 million or $0.80 per diluted common share, and core net income of $40 million or $0.80 per diluted common share. This represented a core return on average tangible common equity of 17.9%. The Board of Directors maintained a $0.44 per share dividend rate, which reflects the stability of our earnings and targets a through-cycle dividend payout ratio of approximately 50%. In addition to the quarterly cash dividend, we continue to evaluate share repurchases and utilize our share buyback authorization as part of our broader capital management program. Opportunities for organic growth such as the Channel Islands mortgage product and M&A pipeline also remain important factors. During the third quarter, the bank reached a resolution with United States Department of Justice concerning the inquiry into Butterfield's legacy business with U.S. clients that was first reported in November 2013. The resolution is in the form of a non-prosecution agreement with a 3-year term. The bank paid $5.6 million in respect of forfeiture and tax restitution amounts, which were in line with the provision that was included in the bank's financial statements as recorded in 2015 and 2016. While we are required to comply with obligations under the non-prosecution agreement, we are pleased to have this investigation resolved.
I will now turn the call over to Michael Schrum to provide more details on the third quarter."

I'll begin with Slide 6, which provides a summary of net interest income and margin. In the third quarter, we reported net interest income of $75.7 million, an increase of $1 million as we were able to increase the volume of interest-earning assets in the investment portfolio, which saw average balances increased by $342.3 million or 2.3% compared to the prior quarter. Net interest margin of 1.97% was 4 basis points lower than the 2.01% in the prior quarter due to lower-yielding interest-earning assets. Loan yields were down 6 basis points in the third quarter due to lower yields on new loan originations due in part to lower-yielding production volumes in the Channel Islands.
During the third quarter, the blended rate for loan originations was 3.42% for $278 million of new loans, down from 3.57% for $234 million of originations in the second quarter of 2021 in U.S. treasuries and agency securities. New money yields averaged 1.13% in the third quarter of 2021 or 53 basis points lower than the 1.66% in the prior quarter as we added around $400 million of 2- and 3-year treasuries. As we expect longer-term rates to rise over the medium term, we made a decision to invest in shorter-term treasuries to retain some flexibility and add some protection from unrealized marks in the available for sale portfolio.
Turning to Slide 7. Noninterest income continued to show stability with a modest increase to $49 million compared to $48.8 million in the prior quarter. Banking fees and foreign exchange revenues grew during the quarter as we continue to see improved economic activity. The bank's higher non-interest income resulted in a fee income ratio of 39.3% in the third quarter of 2021, which continues to represent a stable and capital-efficient revenue stream for the bank.
Slide 8 provides a summary of core non-interest expense, which increased to $84.2 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared to $83.4 million in the prior quarter. The slight increase in core expenses was made up of a relative -- relatively small value items. In particular, there was an increase in technology and communications cost as we have upgraded our desktop access platform during the quarter. In addition, we saw increased professional and outside services fees, supporting some longer-term strategic initiatives, including some spend on our broader ESG strategy. Finally, there continues to be some additional cost associated with the 3-year non-prosecution agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice as we continue to meet the ongoing terms of the agreement. We do expect core non-interest expense to settle back in the $82 million to $83 million range per quarter over the next few quarters, which is already evident from the exit run rate this quarter.
Pipeline summarizes regulatory and leverage capital levels. Butterfield maintains conservative regulatory capital levels that continue to be well above statutory requirements. The bank's elevated deposit levels kept our TCE to TA ratio at 5.8%, slightly below our targeted range of 6% to 6.5%. We continue to expect this to build back over the coming few quarters.
Turning now to Slide 10. Butterfield's balance sheet continues to be strong and conservatively managed with a high degree of liquidity. Deposit levels have stabilized with a slight reduction to $13.9 billion this quarter from $14.2 billion in the second quarter. We were able to continue to deploy excess liquidity during the third quarter into the investment portfolio.
On Slide 11, we show that Butterfield's asset quality remains exceptionally high with low credit risk in the investment portfolio, which continues to be 99% comprised of AAA-rated U.S. government-guaranteed agency securities. Consistent underwriting continues to result in 2/3 of the loan assets in full recourse residential mortgages in Bermuda, Cayman and the U.K. We've also made a great start in our first year of our residential mortgage offering in the Channel Islands and expect that book to continue to build to around $500 million over the next 4 to 5 years.
Nonaccrual loans have improved further and are now down to 1.2% of gross loans. We remain vigilant and continue with outbound calling programs and are actively working with any borrowers who may experience difficulty.
On Slide 12, we discuss average cash and securities balance sheet with a summary interest rate sensitivity analysis. Butterfield's weighted average life in the AFS investment portfolio increased to 5.3 years from 5.0 years last quarter due to a moderately slower prepayment speed. Consistent with prior quarters, Butterfield continues to expect a potential increase to net interest income in both up and down grade scenarios.
I will now turn the call back to Michael Collins."

This September marked the fifth anniversary of Butterfield's IPO and listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Since our listing, we have been clear about our strategy to be a leading independent onshore bank and trust company with limited credit exposure, consistent non-interest income generation, prudent expense management and high risk-adjusted returns. We have achieved growth organically and through acquisitions, including the 2016 purchase of HSBC's trust and asset management operations in Bermuda.
In 2018, we successfully acquired Deutsche Bank's Global Trust Solutions business, which helped us establish a licensed trust operation in Singapore as well as a mid-market corporate banking business in Jersey.
In 2019, we completed the acquisition of ABN AMRO Channel Islands, which expanded scale to banking operations in Guernsey and Jersey. We have grown significantly since the IPO in September of 2016 with a compounded annual growth rate of 7% for deposits and 6% for customer loans. During this time, we have managed through varied economic and interest rate conditions, while maintaining quarterly core returns on tangible common equity in the range of 15% to 25%. We have also improved tangible book value per share by compounded annual growth rate of 6% and created significant shareholder value, paying out over $400 million in cash dividends and repurchasing a total of 7.3 million shares, representing approximately a 14% concentration in share count.
Butterfield is well positioned to continue to grow and remain on this path. Our success is anchored in the strong balance sheet, capital-efficient fee businesses, prudent expense control, balanced capital management, low credit risk, relevant products and excellent customer service, which yields consistent return and long-term growth. We greatly appreciate the support of our shareholders, the Board of Directors, customers, colleagues and all the stakeholders who have helped contribute to the bank's journey thus far. Thank you.
And with that, we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator?"

So just starting with the loan yields. As you know, we saw a modest growth in period end balances, but most of the new originations shifted from -- actually from Bermuda, where we saw more pay downs and more new originations came on in the Channel Islands. So the Channel Islands is a lower-yielding activation of deposits in the sort of 3.25, 3.50 range. And it comes really from our new mortgage products that we've launched this year in the Channel Islands. So that sort of mix shift between dollars and Sterling and jurisdictional mix shift kind of caused that modest compression in the NIM on the loan side. In terms of the investment yields, as you know, they continue to decline. We've had elevated, obviously, prepay speeds there. And I think we moderated the -- well, they moderated somewhat during the quarter. So the repayments actually came down to about $300 million in the quarter. And so we took a look and said where rates are right now, let's go into a little bit shorter duration to give us some flexibility while we wait for sort of clear indications of where and when longer-term rates are coming out. This will give us some more flexibility to redeploy or re-ladder over the next year or so. And then finally, on the deposit cost, they sort of remained stable at 12 basis points, while interest-bearing demand deposits were actually negative 3 basis points. We've obviously taken a look at our longer-term fixed deposit offerings there. But I think we're sort of broadly in line with market, where we operate with slightly higher deposit costs in the Channel Islands and Bermuda and Cayman. But bearing in mind that we're sort of a growing bank in the Channel Islands, we want to remain somewhat competitive there. So I think they probably won't have much further to go than the 12 basis points, which is still a relatively cheap source of funding for us."

And we are obviously continuing to dialogue with customers about how long are these deposits staying? Are you interested in term deposits or off-balance sheet items. But yes, I mean, the outflow was really the search deposit outflow. And I think we should expect some of that to continue, and that will obviously alleviate pressure on the TCE ratio."

And then you lose 1% or 2% as sellers move on and the money is distributed down to the beneficiary. So it really is a flat business. It doesn't grow much on its own. So it will be through acquisition. We're still having constructive discussions. As we've said in the past, it takes a long time, and probably the most important gating factor is really our own risk appetite from an AML perspective. So we are really stringent about what we will take on, and that often results in having to structure the trust acquisitions in various ways, which can be complex and time consuming. So still having constructive discussions. But as I said, it's a long lead time."

It's been consistent that our existing banks and particularly Bermuda and Cayman, produce a lot of capital, which -- and we have slow-growing markets, obviously. So it's very difficult to invest back into Bermuda and Cayman. So the strategy has been to use that capital generation to do 2 things. One is to acquire private trust companies, which we've shown we can do in the past to increase the size of that business, usually in our existing jurisdictions. And then the second part of the strategy is opportunistically to acquire banks in the Channel Islands, either Guernsey or Jersey. There really isn't much overlap acquisition possibilities in Bermuda and Cayman. So that's where we would grow. I would say one of the strategies was to try to balance our exposures and our risk profile across the 3 jurisdictions, which we have substantially achieved at this point from a balance sheet perspective. So we feel like we're more diversified. But those are the 2 pieces of the strategy, trust acquisitions and banks in the channel islands."

There are a number of -- as we come out of COVID, the discussions with some of the larger facilities that we put in place for particularly the Cayman government and the Jersey commitment that we made to the states of Jersey, have turned out to be not utilized. And so they're obviously evaluating, do they need the fiscal stimulus capacity that they had originally -- that we had signed up for at the beginning of the pandemic, and I think some of them are just reevaluating and reducing the exposure. But I think we should hopefully, see more activity in Central London in terms of transactions and refinancing. The pipeline is quite good there, and Channel Islands is well underway. Bermuda continues to be a lot of cash buyers. And so there's not much leverage put in and demand is relatively sluggish. I would say, Cayman is growing very fast, and we're just taking our time, making sure we stick with our risk appetite there. So I think what you've seen in the last couple of quarters, maybe a slightly better growth outlook than we had during the pandemic, certainly."

Obviously, we continue to be very sensitive. And as a reminder, just 2/3 of that sensitivity is sitting at the front end of the curve. And 1/3 is kind of at the back end of that curve. So we have seen a slightly more constructive 10-year recently, certainly. And I think we're just being -- we're just saying that's that's a little staging here in the 2- to 3-year. It does cause NIM compression, but running book yield. So it's a good trade-off from our perspective to just kind of keep that $75 million level on net interest income. And I think the NIM will be dictated by the potential reduction in deposits or normalization of deposits. And that really is coming -- sort of giving us a trajectory out of there without incurring a huge mark on the investment portfolio. So just adding that flexibility."

Butterfield's results in the third quarter of 2021 continued to demonstrate the bank's earnings power and resilience in an ultra-low interest rate environment and health and credit uncertainty in most of our markets. So far in 2021, Butterfield has performed really well through a difficult period in our small and wealthy island market. During the recent fourth COVID wave, people and businesses were better prepared and have learned to live with it. We anticipate this to continue and sense our local economies taking on more of a business as usual approach without the need for further economy-wide lockdowns.
I will turn now to Slide 4, where we provide a summary of third quarter highlights. Butterfield reported net income for the third quarter of $39.8 million or $0.80 per diluted common share, and core net income of $40 million or $0.80 per diluted common share. This represented a core return on average tangible common equity of 17.9%. The Board of Directors maintained a $0.44 per share dividend rate, which reflects the stability of our earnings and targets a through-cycle dividend payout ratio of approximately 50%. In addition to the quarterly cash dividend, we continue to evaluate share repurchases and utilize our share buyback authorization as part of our broader capital management program. Opportunities for organic growth such as the Channel Islands mortgage product and M&A pipeline also remain important factors. During the third quarter, the bank reached a resolution with United States Department of Justice concerning the inquiry into Butterfield's legacy business with U.S. clients that was first reported in November 2013. The resolution is in the form of a non-prosecution agreement with a 3-year term. The bank paid $5.6 million in respect of forfeiture and tax restitution amounts, which were in line with the provision that was included in the bank's financial statements as recorded in 2015 and 2016. While we are required to comply with obligations under the non-prosecution agreement, we are pleased to have this investigation resolved.
I will now turn the call over to Michael Schrum to provide more details on the third quarter."

I'll begin with Slide 6, which provides a summary of net interest income and margin. In the third quarter, we reported net interest income of $75.7 million, an increase of $1 million as we were able to increase the volume of interest-earning assets in the investment portfolio, which saw average balances increased by $342.3 million or 2.3% compared to the prior quarter. Net interest margin of 1.97% was 4 basis points lower than the 2.01% in the prior quarter due to lower-yielding interest-earning assets. Loan yields were down 6 basis points in the third quarter due to lower yields on new loan originations due in part to lower-yielding production volumes in the Channel Islands.
During the third quarter, the blended rate for loan originations was 3.42% for $278 million of new loans, down from 3.57% for $234 million of originations in the second quarter of 2021 in U.S. treasuries and agency securities. New money yields averaged 1.13% in the third quarter of 2021 or 53 basis points lower than the 1.66% in the prior quarter as we added around $400 million of 2- and 3-year treasuries. As we expect longer-term rates to rise over the medium term, we made a decision to invest in shorter-term treasuries to retain some flexibility and add some protection from unrealized marks in the available for sale portfolio.
Turning to Slide 7. Noninterest income continued to show stability with a modest increase to $49 million compared to $48.8 million in the prior quarter. Banking fees and foreign exchange revenues grew during the quarter as we continue to see improved economic activity. The bank's higher non-interest income resulted in a fee income ratio of 39.3% in the third quarter of 2021, which continues to represent a stable and capital-efficient revenue stream for the bank.
Slide 8 provides a summary of core non-interest expense, which increased to $84.2 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared to $83.4 million in the prior quarter. The slight increase in core expenses was made up of a relative -- relatively small value items. In particular, there was an increase in technology and communications cost as we have upgraded our desktop access platform during the quarter. In addition, we saw increased professional and outside services fees, supporting some longer-term strategic initiatives, including some spend on our broader ESG strategy. Finally, there continues to be some additional cost associated with the 3-year non-prosecution agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice as we continue to meet the ongoing terms of the agreement. We do expect core non-interest expense to settle back in the $82 million to $83 million range per quarter over the next few quarters, which is already evident from the exit run rate this quarter.
Pipeline summarizes regulatory and leverage capital levels. Butterfield maintains conservative regulatory capital levels that continue to be well above statutory requirements. The bank's elevated deposit levels kept our TCE to TA ratio at 5.8%, slightly below our targeted range of 6% to 6.5%. We continue to expect this to build back over the coming few quarters.
Turning now to Slide 10. Butterfield's balance sheet continues to be strong and conservatively managed with a high degree of liquidity. Deposit levels have stabilized with a slight reduction to $13.9 billion this quarter from $14.2 billion in the second quarter. We were able to continue to deploy excess liquidity during the third quarter into the investment portfolio.
On Slide 11, we show that Butterfield's asset quality remains exceptionally high with low credit risk in the investment portfolio, which continues to be 99% comprised of AAA-rated U.S. government-guaranteed agency securities. Consistent underwriting continues to result in 2/3 of the loan assets in full recourse residential mortgages in Bermuda, Cayman and the U.K. We've also made a great start in our first year of our residential mortgage offering in the Channel Islands and expect that book to continue to build to around $500 million over the next 4 to 5 years.
Nonaccrual loans have improved further and are now down to 1.2% of gross loans. We remain vigilant and continue with outbound calling programs and are actively working with any borrowers who may experience difficulty.
On Slide 12, we discuss average cash and securities balance sheet with a summary interest rate sensitivity analysis. Butterfield's weighted average life in the AFS investment portfolio increased to 5.3 years from 5.0 years last quarter due to a moderately slower prepayment speed. Consistent with prior quarters, Butterfield continues to expect a potential increase to net interest income in both up and down grade scenarios.
I will now turn the call back to Michael Collins."

This September marked the fifth anniversary of Butterfield's IPO and listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Since our listing, we have been clear about our strategy to be a leading independent onshore bank and trust company with limited credit exposure, consistent non-interest income generation, prudent expense management and high risk-adjusted returns. We have achieved growth organically and through acquisitions, including the 2016 purchase of HSBC's trust and asset management operations in Bermuda.
In 2018, we successfully acquired Deutsche Bank's Global Trust Solutions business, which helped us establish a licensed trust operation in Singapore as well as a mid-market corporate banking business in Jersey.
In 2019, we completed the acquisition of ABN AMRO Channel Islands, which expanded scale to banking operations in Guernsey and Jersey. We have grown significantly since the IPO in September of 2016 with a compounded annual growth rate of 7% for deposits and 6% for customer loans. During this time, we have managed through varied economic and interest rate conditions, while maintaining quarterly core returns on tangible common equity in the range of 15% to 25%. We have also improved tangible book value per share by compounded annual growth rate of 6% and created significant shareholder value, paying out over $400 million in cash dividends and repurchasing a total of 7.3 million shares, representing approximately a 14% concentration in share count.
Butterfield is well positioned to continue to grow and remain on this path. Our success is anchored in the strong balance sheet, capital-efficient fee businesses, prudent expense control, balanced capital management, low credit risk, relevant products and excellent customer service, which yields consistent return and long-term growth. We greatly appreciate the support of our shareholders, the Board of Directors, customers, colleagues and all the stakeholders who have helped contribute to the bank's journey thus far. Thank you.

So just starting with the loan yields. As you know, we saw a modest growth in period end balances, but most of the new originations shifted from -- actually from Bermuda, where we saw more pay downs and more new originations came on in the Channel Islands. So the Channel Islands is a lower-yielding activation of deposits in the sort of 3.25, 3.50 range. And it comes really from our new mortgage products that we've launched this year in the Channel Islands. So that sort of mix shift between dollars and Sterling and jurisdictional mix shift kind of caused that modest compression in the NIM on the loan side. In terms of the investment yields, as you know, they continue to decline. We've had elevated, obviously, prepay speeds there. And I think we moderated the -- well, they moderated somewhat during the quarter. So the repayments actually came down to about $300 million in the quarter. And so we took a look and said where rates are right now, let's go into a little bit shorter duration to give us some flexibility while we wait for sort of clear indications of where and when longer-term rates are coming out. This will give us some more flexibility to redeploy or re-ladder over the next year or so. And then finally, on the deposit cost, they sort of remained stable at 12 basis points, while interest-bearing demand deposits were actually negative 3 basis points. We've obviously taken a look at our longer-term fixed deposit offerings there. But I think we're sort of broadly in line with market, where we operate with slightly higher deposit costs in the Channel Islands and Bermuda and Cayman. But bearing in mind that we're sort of a growing bank in the Channel Islands, we want to remain somewhat competitive there. So I think they probably won't have much further to go than the 12 basis points, which is still a relatively cheap source of funding for us."

And we are obviously continuing to dialogue with customers about how long are these deposits staying? Are you interested in term deposits or off-balance sheet items.

And then you lose 1% or 2% as sellers move on and the money is distributed down to the beneficiary. So it really is a flat business. It doesn't grow much on its own. So it will be through acquisition. We're still having constructive discussions. As we've said in the past, it takes a long time, and probably the most important gating factor is really our own risk appetite from an AML perspective. So we are really stringent about what we will take on, and that often results in having to structure the trust acquisitions in various ways, which can be complex and time consuming. So still having constructive discussions. But as I said, it's a long lead time."

It's been consistent that our existing banks and particularly Bermuda and Cayman, produce a lot of capital, which -- and we have slow-growing markets, obviously. So it's very difficult to invest back into Bermuda and Cayman. So the strategy has been to use that capital generation to do 2 things. One is to acquire private trust companies, which we've shown we can do in the past to increase the size of that business, usually in our existing jurisdictions. And then the second part of the strategy is opportunistically to acquire banks in the Channel Islands, either Guernsey or Jersey. There really isn't much overlap acquisition possibilities in Bermuda and Cayman. So that's where we would grow. I would say one of the strategies was to try to balance our exposures and our risk profile across the 3 jurisdictions, which we have substantially achieved at this point from a balance sheet perspective. So we feel like we're more diversified. But those are the 2 pieces of the strategy, trust acquisitions and banks in the channel islands."

And so they're obviously evaluating, do they need the fiscal stimulus capacity that they had originally -- that we had signed up for at the beginning of the pandemic, and I think some of them are just reevaluating and reducing the exposure. But I think we should hopefully, see more activity in Central London in terms of transactions and refinancing. The pipeline is quite good there, and Channel Islands is well underway. Bermuda continues to be a lot of cash buyers. And so there's not much leverage put in and demand is relatively sluggish. I would say, Cayman is growing very fast, and we're just taking our time, making sure we stick with our risk appetite there. So I think what you've seen in the last couple of quarters, maybe a slightly better growth outlook than we had during the pandemic, certainly."

Obviously, we continue to be very sensitive. And as a reminder, just 2/3 of that sensitivity is sitting at the front end of the curve. And 1/3 is kind of at the back end of that curve. So we have seen a slightly more constructive 10-year recently, certainly. And I think we're just being -- we're just saying that's that's a little staging here in the 2- to 3-year. It does cause NIM compression, but running book yield. So it's a good trade-off from our perspective to just kind of keep that $75 million level on net interest income.
