At our Investor Update in November, I talked about the start of something new for McDonald's.

At our Investor Update in November, I talked about the start of something new for McDonald's. It was a moment in which we proudly embrace both what we were going to do to write the next chapter of McDonald's growth and how we were going to do it. We shared our new growth strategy, Accelerating the Arches, and articulated a clear vision of where we intend to make a difference in a world in need of community and connection. 
We also acknowledge that between a once-in-a-century pandemic, a record economic downturn and profound societal challenges, it was the most difficult year McDonald's has seen. While a new year brings new hope, the issues and uncertainty that emerged last year persist. 
If I reflect on all that has happened even since November, I'd come back to something Ray Crop once said. Adversity can strengthen you if you have the will to grind it out. Through all the adversity of the last year, we have seen and done important things that reinforce why we are on the right path. 
We have seen the incredible courage and resilience of our McFamily. We know how to run great restaurants. Our long legacy of execution prowess comes from the talent of our teams. From franchisees to supply chain partners and employees, I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that 2020 will be remembered as one of the most challenging yet inspiring moment in the long history of this great brand. 
By making safety and service a priority, by implementing the largest and fastest rollout of new safety protocols in McDonald's history and partnering with the Mayo Clinic to review and refine our approach, by maintaining supply without interruption, by simplifying our menu and by continuing to put our customers and people first, all 3 legs of our stool embodied our values in the best possible way by living them every day. 
And our customers have noticed. Global brand scores for consumer confidence in eating at McDonald's have risen significantly since the start of the pandemic. We've seen the love people have for McDonald's and our food. 
Even while the pandemic forced lockdowns and prevented customers from dining in most of our restaurants, we achieved over $90 billion of system-wide sales last year. Tens of millions of people every day continue to choose McDonald's for our drive-thru, contactless delivery, takeaway and curbside pickup with more and more customers using our app. 
And that commitment showed. Despite resurgences of the virus and restrictions on restaurants in the fourth quarter, we continue to see sequential improvement as we delivered our strongest quarter of the year, recovering nearly 99% of 2019 global comp sales. Global comp sales for the full year were down 7.7%. While there were challenges across markets, some of our larger markets achieved positive comp sales for the full year, including the U.S., Japan and Australia, and that was on top of strong momentum coming into 2020. 
U.S. delivered its sixth consecutive year of positive comps. Average U.S. franchisee restaurant operating cash flow reached an all-time high in 2020, up nearly $40,000 over 2019 and up about $100,000 over the last 3 years. Japan has achieved 5 consecutive years of positive comp sales, and Australia posted its seventh consecutive year of positive comps. 
We have seen the ability that McDonald's has to survive hard times and to do so while consistently investing to support both the short and long term. One thing I admire most about our system is that no matter how difficult times get, we never stop thinking about what's next. 
The impacts of COVID on our industry have been significant. It's been tough. We were sober and realistic from early on, while remaining committed to helping every operator and partner survive this crisis. 
We took prudent, quick action designed to prevent not a single owner-operator from failing due to the pandemic, while we bolstered our cash position early in the year to provide nearly $1 billion in financial liquidity to support franchisees. We also maintained our view on the long term as we invested $1.6 billion of CapEx to open nearly 1,000 new restaurants globally and modernize another 900 in the U.S., provided $200 million in incremental marketing support to accelerate the recovery. And together with our franchisees, we invested over $1 billion in technology and digital initiatives, all of which will help drive our next chapter of growth. 
We've also seen our commitment to feed and foster communities take on new meaning this past year. There are so many incredible stories about how the McDonald's system has stepped up to be there for our neighbors and communities this past year. 
To name a few, together with our franchisees, we provided more than 12 million thank you meals to first responders and health care workers in the U.S. We donated extra food within our supply chain to communities in need around the world. We gave millions of surgical masks to communities to help protect first responders. And in November, we announced our commitment to donate $100 million over 5 years to help families with sick children through Ronald McDonald House Charities. 
We were on the ground working to help local communities solve problems while also looking for ways to use our size and scale to make an even bigger impact. It was an important reminder that brands like ours can help provide stability and even hope during difficult times. 
Today, brands are working through many societal issues that directly impact our businesses and the economy, and we have a unique role to play in ensuring these issues get addressed. That's true of COVID. Hard to imagine that was just a year ago last week that the first case of the coronavirus was confirmed in the U.S. 
Even while we celebrate a vaccine created in record time, we know that COVID is at its worst right now in many parts of the world, that so many of the communities we serve are experiencing record high infection rates. We all must play a role as part of the solution. 
There is a lot of uncertainty ahead for us as individuals and for this industry, and neither may change for some time. We look forward to joining with other business leaders and working with the Biden administration and congressional leadership as we have with every U.S. President throughout our 66-year history to address the challenges the country faces. 
As we work to hopefully return to some version of normal, the needs of our customers have changed. They're dining in less and taking out more, visiting less in the morning and much more for lunch and dinner and interacting with other people and brands less in person and more through digital. 
Just as the investments and choices we've made have driven broad-based strength, Accelerating the Arches will enable us to grow even more sustainably with a bottom-up approach to our growth pillars, our MCD. M stands for maximizing our marketing, so our significant marketing investment remains a true growth driver. We're improving creative effectiveness and leaning into social and digital to drive customer engagement. Teams remain focused on the right balance of sales activation with brand building as we work to optimize marketing returns. 
We made an immediate impression in the closing weeks of 2020 with the launch of our Serving Here campaign in the U.S., celebrating the myriad ways we feed in foster communities. At the same time, many markets drove performance in the fourth quarter with successful sales building promotions like 30 deals in 30 days in Australia and Monopoly in Australia, France and Canada, featuring customers' core favorites. These are great examples of using our marketing muscle to drive sales without adding complexity to our kitchens. 
C stands for our commitment to the core menu. Our delicious core is something people rely on and return to again and again. Our core classics comprise roughly 70% of our food sales across our top markets. They drive growth and profitability, and we saw that this past year. 
Developing a reputation for great chicken represents one of our highest ambitions. That's why markets are activating multi-tiered strategy and holistic approaches that integrate great products, strong and sustained marketing and operations excellence. 
We're building on the strength of core equities like Chicken McNuggets and McChicken Sandwiches, which have seen significant growth as we continue to focus on improving our large chicken sandwich offerings around the world. In the U.S., we're excited about the return of Spicy Chicken McNuggets and the launch of the new Crispy Chicken Sandwich at the end of February. Markets are also making our delicious and popular 100% all-beef burgers even better with improved cooking procedures and new buns. Russia was the latest major market to roll out these changes in Q4, driving meaningful lift in hamburgers sold. 
We've also continued to create menu excitement that keeps customers engaged by bringing back limited-time promotions like McRib and introducing new items like our bakery line in the U.S. and the premium McBaguette and signature recipe in France. What's important is that our approach to our menu is thoughtful and judicious. We've seen significant benefits with our streamlined menus and reduced complexity. New items must earn their place on the menu. 
Lastly, D stands for doubling down on digital, delivery and drive-thru. They were the difference-maker when the pandemic hit and are at the heart of our combined efforts to create a faster, easier, better customer experience. 
Digital sales exceeded $10 billion or nearly 20% of systemwide sales in 2020 across our top 6 markets. We're moving aggressively to bring My McDonald's with mobile ordering, payment, delivery, rewards and fun promotions like digital calendars to our customers as soon as possible. We're on track to have elements of My McDonald's across our top 6 markets by the end of 2021, featuring loyalty programs in several of those markets, including a U.S. loyalty launch later in 2021. 
We have big ambitions. We've already shown we know how to meet big goals as we've proven with delivery. The past 4 years, McDonald's has expanded the number of restaurants offering delivery to nearly 30,000, and COVID has underscored how meaningful our efforts have been to our customers. Many markets, including Australia, Canada and the U.S., have doubled their delivery sales mix over the past year. 
We continue to build out our delivery advantage, much like we're expanding our competitive advantage on drive-thru. With over 25,000 drive-thrus around the world, we've made smart investments to bolster foundational elements like staffing, positioning and order assembly. We've reduced service times each of the past 2 years, even as a greater percentage of customers went through our drive-thrus during 2020. 
While each pillar will further extend our leadership, what's especially powerful is the exponential impact when all 3 pillars come together. Famous orders platform in the U.S. is a prime example. In the fourth quarter, we featured favorite menu items of Latin music icon, J Balvin, and classic holiday characters, including Santa Claus and the Grinch. 
With exclusive deals on our app, customers rediscovered iconic core menu items like Big Macs and Egg McMuffins and tried new items like cinnamon rolls. And we drove digital adoption, including significant lifts, NAP registrations and use. That's our sweet spot. That's how M, C and D come together to drive demand, sales and growth without creating additional complexity. 
Our ability to navigate the past year would not have been possible without the incredible commitment of our franchisees, our supply chain and agency partners and our employees who have continued to focus and execute during this extraordinary past year. When I think about everything our restaurant teams around the world have done to provide an essential service at the front lines, serving our customers safely every step of the way, I can't help but believe that this amazing system is proving every day this isn't just a job. To them and to us, it's something bigger. It's our chance to make a difference for our customers and our communities. 
I'll now turn it over to Kevin to talk in more detail about our financial results. Kevin?"

So let me spend a few minutes talking about the quarter. 
Global comparable sales were down 1.3% in Q4. Comp sales were positive in October as I mentioned on our Q3 call, but they returned negative in November and December as a result of the widespread resurgences and the return of government restrictions particularly across the international operating markets. In the U.S., comp sales increased 5.5% for the quarter, ending the year with 6 consecutive months of positive comps. 
Sales grew in all major dayparts, including breakfast, and this is on top of prior year growth across these dayparts. Our strategic investments, including incremental marketing spend, fueled our momentum with strong national promotions like McRib, Buy 1 Get 1 for $1, our new bakery line and 2 separate offerings of famous orders. Dinner continued to be our leading daypart with strong sales of core items as customers keep coming back for familiar favorites. 
In the IOM segment, comp sales were down 7.4% in Q4. And while performance varied across the countries, nearly all of our major markets grew traffic share. Strong positive comps in Australia and the U.K. were more than offset by negative double-digit comps in France, Germany, Italy and Spain. 
Beginning at the end of October, additional government restrictions went into effect across many of our markets, including limited sales channels, reduced operating hours and dining room closures. Australia benefited from strong menu and marketing news in the quarter, including the successful launch of a new chicken line with McSpicy at its center, another example of great ideas and products traveling across our markets as McSpicy has been a customer favorite in China and several other markets in Asia for a while. 
Since the start of the pandemic, Australia has also doubled their delivery sales. The U.K. has achieved comp sales growth every month since August despite increased restrictions reintroduced in early November. The quarter benefited from a focus on core menu as well as phenomenal growth in delivery. 
And finally, comp sales in the International Developmental License segment were down 3.6% for the quarter, reflecting significant improvement for most markets over Q3. Japan once again delivered strong positive comp sales for the quarter and for the year as Chris mentioned. The market is meeting customers' changing needs, growing delivery in mobile ordering along with running successful LTO promotions, all while further strengthening trust in our brand. 
And in China, results have improved quarter-over-quarter since Q1. Recovery continued on a steady pace with a marketing plan focused on delivery and digital along with new chicken offerings. And despite the challenging year, nearly 500 new restaurants were opened across the market in 2020. 
Turning to January trends. In the U.S., sales comps continue to be strong and are expected to be up high single digits with continued growth across all dayparts and assisted by consumers receiving government stimulus checks. IOM comp sales are projected to be down low double digits, given the government restrictions that remain in place in most markets. 
Continued momentum in Australia is being more than offset by double-digit negative comps in France, Germany, Italy and Spain. And we expect this trend to likely continue until dine-in resumes. 
Adjusted earnings per share in Q4 was $1.70 after excluding gains on the sale of an additional 3% of our ownership in McDonald's Japan. While global restaurant margins were down as a result of the pressure on sales, the U.S. grew both franchised and company-operated margins, up over $70 million for the quarter. Consistent with the guidance we gave in our third quarter remarks, G&A increases for Q4 were primarily driven by some onetime investments we made in renewed brand activity, including the launch of our Serving Here campaign and our commitment to donate $100 million to Ronald McDonald House Charities as Chris mentioned earlier. 
Turning to our outlook for 2021. As Chris talked about, there's still a lot of uncertainty, both today and as we look ahead. We're confident in our ability to manage through this uncertainty and that our Accelerating the Arches strategy will continue to drive growth in the business. 
We expect 2021 systemwide sales growth of low double digits in constant currencies versus 2020, with new unit expansion contributing about 1%. This reiterates the mid-single-digit growth rate off of 2019 that we mentioned in November. 
We ultimately measure overall financial efficiency by our operating margin as it serves as the most comprehensive gauge of our operating performance. We expect our operating margin percent to be in the low to mid-40s for 2021. 
In the U.S., we expect higher depreciation expense of about $60 million versus 2020 in franchised margins related to our modernization efforts. Depreciation will continue to be a P&L headwind for the next few years even though it will have no impact on future cash flows. 
In the IOM segment, while we expect improvement in our company operating margin percent over the course of the year, we don't expect to get back to pre-COVID levels in 2021 as a result of near-term sales and cost pressures. 
Turning to G&A. As we become more efficient with G&A required to run the business, we're able to make strategic investments in areas like digital and technology to drive growth. Looking ahead, we expect 2021 G&A to decrease about 2% to 4% in constant currencies over 2020, which reiterates our expectation that G&A will be about 2.3% of system-wide sales. 
Looking at other operating income and expense. We expect our equity pickup to be slightly higher for 2021 due to improved results versus 2020, partially offset by our reduced ownership in Japan. Gains on restaurant sales last year were suppressed due to COVID so we expect gains this year to be about double that of 2020. 
And finally, in 2020, we had some onetime items included in the asset dispositions line related to store closings and bad debts. For 2021, we expect that line to get back to a more normal level of expense of roughly $100 million. We're projecting our 2021 effective tax rate in the range of 21% to 23%. 
And finally, turning to FX. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency translation would benefit EPS by about $0.06 to $0.08 in the first quarter and $0.27 to $0.29 for the full year. As usual, this is directional guidance only as rates will likely change as we move throughout the year. 
Moving to capital expenditures. As we indicated in November, we expect to spend roughly $2.3 billion of capital in 2021. New restaurant development is an important driver of our growth as we see significant expansion opportunity, especially in the IOM segment. These markets have driven strong growth over the past several years and deliver strong returns on new restaurants. 
This year, we plan to open over 1,300 new restaurants globally. Of the $2.3 billion of capital, we'll spend roughly half of that to open nearly 500 restaurants in the U.S. and IOM segments. The remaining 800-plus new restaurant openings are across the IDL markets, including nearly 500 in China. As a reminder, our strategic partners in these markets provide the capital for restaurant openings. 
The remaining half of CapEx spend will go towards reinvestment back into our U.S. and IOM restaurants, including about $500 million to modernize approximately 1,200 restaurants in the U.S. We're nearing completion of our U.S. modernization efforts and expect over 90% of projects to be complete by the end of the year. 
And finally, I want to conclude with our free cash flow profile. With the improvements made to our business operating model over the last several years and the consistent strength of our global business, our free cash flow grew significantly through 2019. 
In 2020, even with significant disruption, we generated free cash flow of over $4.5 billion. And free cash flow conversion, which measures our ability to convert bottom line earnings to free cash flow, was nearly 100%. In 2021, we expect to convert more than 90% of our net earnings to free cash flow and to generate free cash flow near 2019 levels or about $5.5 billion to $6 billion. 
Our capital allocation priorities remain the same. First, investing in the business to drive growth. This includes both capital expenditures as well as investments in technology and digital. Second, prioritizing dividends to our shareholders. After that, most of our remaining free cash flow for 2021 will go towards paying down debt to get back to pre-COVID leverage ratios by the end of the year. As we start the new year, I'm confident that the plans we have in place will position us to continue to deliver sustained long-term profitable growth for our system and shareholders. 
Now I'll turn it back to Chris to close."

McDonald's is well positioned to emerge from this moment with competitive strength. And we're confident we can keep capturing market share as we look to the future. 
We're confident because we were growing share in most markets before COVID. We're confident because we've continued growing market share during COVID. And we're especially confident because we've gained important insights, which will bolster the strategic vision we set with Accelerating the Arches. 
This claritive purpose and strategy is the reason that in October, we increased our annual dividend to shareholders. Not only did it mark 40-plus consecutive years of increases, it reinforced to our shareholders our confidence in the long-term strategy. 
It's also the reason we continue directing investments where they make the most strategic sense and build on our strengths. We'll uphold McDonald's commitment and legacy as a responsible and reliable choice for trusted delicious food. And we'll do so while feeding and fostering community and continuing to create delicious feel-good moments for everyone.

And in the IOM market, as you know, it is -- those markets tend to be more of a dine-in business. And so the biggest thing that we're doing with many of these markets having dine-in closed is we are trying to do as much as we can to drive our drive-thru delivery, our digital businesses. And we're having good success with that. 
Some of it though is, frankly, limited because in many markets, there are hour -- operating hour restrictions, 6 p.m., 8 p.m., et cetera. So I think part of what we are trying to do is our franchisees, so long as we are dealing with government restrictions around what you can open, how long you can be open, it's about supporting the franchisees. As we said in the opening remarks here, making sure that all of our franchisees have the liquidity that they need to get through it. 
As you come through, though, I think the plan that we laid out, which is focused on driving core menu in the 3Ds, that's the way that we really come out of this, I think, in a very strong position. And we've seen, as we've gone through this, one of the things for us we've discovered capacity that we didn't even realize we've had. We -- I think in the last year, we've moved something like 300 million additional cars through our drive-thrus. And you had asked me a few years ago, I was thinking that we were pretty maxed out on drive-thru. 
So I think our guys are set up well to get after this. But as we're continuing to deal with some of the short-term restrictions, it is challenging."

The other thing I would point out is this is nothing structural. This is a temporary issue. And the reason I think we're confident in saying that is if we look back at even as recently as October, we were relatively flat in IOM in October. But as the new restrictions come back, that's when we see kind of comps going down again. So as soon as the markets start opening up again and easing restrictions, I think we're pretty confident customers come back pretty quickly, and we'll be set up well."

But Australia, which seems to be a strong performer as of late, it might be one area where it seems like consumers are closer to normal relative to the rest of the world. So if you could speak to how the traffic ticket dynamics have evolved in that country, perhaps that might give us some clues about how you might perform in some other countries post-vaccine rollout?"

In Australia, as you know, it has been one of the few markets in the world that has, say, relatively unscaled by coronavirus as they've done a very nice job of containing the virus. And that market is performing very strongly. Our franchisees in Australia are going to have record cash flow in 2020. The business is doing high single-digit performance. 
So I think it is, for us, a good indication of what this -- the post COVID opportunity for us can look like. I think what we are expecting though is and what we've seen is we've gone through COVID and the resurgence of COVID recovery is that channels like digital, like delivery, like drive-thru, they do remain elevated. We think that, that is going to be kind of one of the more enduring parts of it. It doesn't mean that there still is going to be a sizable dine-in business, but I think the takeaway business is going to remain elevated post-COVID, including delivery with that. 
And those channels, when you look at whether it's delivery or digital, drive-thru, those tend to be higher order sizes. And so as the mix moves to that, I think this idea of elevated check, we're expecting that, that's going to continue albeit not at the levels that you're seeing now.

Well, as you know, I know the U.S. market well, having run that for 3 years. And I'd say there are a few things that I just learned during my time in the U.S. 
The first is we have 2,000 owner-operators in the U.S., and it is very difficult to generalize sort of what is the overall sentiment in that market. You have 2,000 CEOs and presidents of their own businesses with a lot of different opinions and perspectives. So I would just caution to make any generalizations about the market. 
The other thing that I would say is the business is a very decentralized, federated type of model. All the action happens at the restaurant level. And at the restaurant level, the U.S. interaction between the company and franchisees remain strong. And I think the evidence of that is just the operating performance that you're seeing out of our restaurants in the U.S. as we're putting up pretty strong comps, which if you look at it on a 2-year stack basis, it was, I think, a 10 1 in Q4 on a 2-year stack. 
So the business is performing, I think, at a very high level. We're seeing service times improve. But there is absolutely noise, and there absolutely is -- are some disagreements that happen right now between the national operator leadership and our U.S. team. I dealt with those when I was in the U.S. They flare-up from time to time. We're certainly in one of those moments now. 
But I'm confident that Joe Erlinger and the U.S. team, along with Mark, who leads the operator group at the national level, we always find our way to work through these. And I fully expect that, that will be the case in the U.S."

Just wondering how you're thinking about those international operating markets after the vaccine. These markets had most of their sales pre-COVID from on-premise ordering and some are even city center locations, perhaps more than the U.S. where you have a lot of suburban drive-thrus. So obviously, more painful today, but I wonder if you're thinking that market share gains could be even greater because your competition, which is often local, lacks McDonald's unit economics and the drive-thrus that you have that are obviously helping your profitability during the pandemic. So could you talk about the outlook for market share gains? And if there's any sort of difference in the recovery that you foresee in these markets broadly than what we would expect in the U.S."

I'll take a shot at it, and Chris can certainly chime in. As you mentioned, certainly, our percentage of restaurants with drive-thru in the International Operated markets is a little bit less than what we have in the U.S. In Australia",313,"Yes. Thanks, David. I'll take a shot at it, and Chris can certainly chime in. As you mentioned, certainly, our percentage of restaurants with drive-thru in the International Operated markets is a little bit less than what we have in the U.S. In Australia and Canada, it's more around 80%, 90%. But in France, Germany, U.K., it's roughly 2/3 of their restaurants or so that have drive-thrus. 
So the percent of sales that run through the drive-thrus pre-COVID in those International Operated markets was less. We're certainly seeing during the pandemic a higher percentage of sales run through the drive-thru as well as elevated digital and delivery sales. 
But I think to your point, I think we believe we're well set up post pandemic because while the percentage of drive-thrus is less than the U.S., it's substantially higher than just about any competitor in most of those markets. And so the fact that we're well set up with drive-thrus, we'll continue to open up more drive-thrus. 
To your point, there are some city center tourist travel locations right now that are kind of getting hit harder than certainly most of our U.S. restaurants because of the pandemic. But there's nothing structural in the business that gives us concern that once the market start opening up post pandemic, we feel like we should be in good shape to be able to pick up market share. 
There are still a substantial number of restaurants in many of those markets that are closed. The unknown -- not McDonald's restaurants, I'm just saying in the industry. The unknown certainly is how many of those are temporary versus what's permanent. But we think we're pretty well set up to be able to continue gaining market share, which we have done both in 2019 and in 2020 during the pandemic in those IOM markets to keep gaining market share."

How should we think about the company lapping the spend in 2021, meaning are you anticipating that franchisee sales recovery will fill the void and therefore, your presence and dollar spend will be similar year-over-year?

I think the bigger thing that I think about and the bigger benefit is this is a momentum business. And when you have momentum in the business, everything seems to work better, including on your marketing side. So our expectation, part of why we put the $200 million in 2020, was to make sure that we could generate some strong momentum coming out of this. And when you've got that momentum, you get an outsized effect from what would be even a normalized marketing level. So that's the bet that we're making and why we're confident on the back half of the year."

And it is a competitive market in the U.S., probably one of the most competitive markets, if not the most competitive market in the world. Back in November, when we had our Investor Day, part of the M within MCD was that we needed to make sure we had a strong focus on affordability. And you're seeing, just as we've entered into 2021, you've seen some of the value deals that are out there from our competitors. We've also had some programs that I think have performed well for us. And that's going to be a trend that continues all through 2021. 
Our expectation is that you're absolutely going to need to remain competitive on value. I think we've been able to -- back to the momentum point, we've been able to put ourselves through the investments we've made in modernizing our estate, upgrading our brand attributes, I think we're in a better position than we were maybe 4 or 5 years ago in terms of just the consumer demand for our brands. So I think that, for us, gives me confidence that this isn't going to be something that gets -- that we're going to have to chase down the rabbit hole, so to speak. 
On your question about breakfast, our breakfast business is performing well. In Q4, our breakfast business grew. We saw strong performance out of the bakery line. So our expectation is, going forward, that breakfast, the daypart we've been pleased with how we weathered through 2020 on that even with the introduction of one of our competitors didn't have a significant impact on our breakfast business. And as we look to 2021, our expectation, we're set up that breakfast for us should be a good performing daypart as people get back to, hopefully, returning to work and kind of a more regular routine, which certainly benefits traffic in the morning."

Because of the level of stimulus, certainly, it is helping right now in the short term. I think the industry, we're a beneficiary of that. But the stimulus is going to roll off. And I don't think that we yet fully understand or have visibility to as the stimulus rolls off sort of what is the underlying health of the consumer.

I think the discussion about the minimum wage and what that means in terms of cost of labor, while it's picked up with the change in the administration at the federal level, I would say that it's been going on at the state level for the last several years. And you've seen a number of states, I forget if it's 24, 25 states, have passed some degree of minimum wage legislation. Florida was the most recent one in this past election, where I think they've introduced a $15 an hour, a glide path to a $15 an hour. 
So we've -- as this has been rolling into the states, we have seen and developed quite a bit of experience with how this works out. I think the positive for us has been so long as it's done in a staged way and so long as it is done equitably across the entire market without sort of any carve-outs or special exemptions for people then we do just fine. And we're able to balance between judicious pricing on the menu as well as just thinking about productivity savings that we can manage through this. 
I'll give you another example that gives us confidence. There was a significant increase in the minimum wage that was passed in Canada a couple of years back. And that team, working with the franchisees, did a spectacular job of working that through on to the menu, through pricing, through productivity. 
So I think our view is the minimum wage is most likely going to be increasing, whether that's federally or at the state level as I referenced. And so long as it's done, like I said, in a staged way and in a way that is equitable for everybody, McDonald's will do just fine through that."

One is menu simplification and the more limited menu that you indicate, but also just a big focus on operations around the world, which includes some nonsexy stuff like staffing and positioning of our crew, some certain technology that we put in the restaurants to help the crew monitor the times. And so there's just some basic kind of running the -- operating the restaurants efficiently that goes along with the right menu and menu boards. 
And so there continues to be a big focus on drive-thru operations, especially because we've seen drive-thru continue to be a bigger percentage of our business.

So I think we do see some of the U.S. margins probably moderating over the next year. 
Conversely, in the IOM, I think they've been hit harder at store-level margins because they haven't had the sales levels that we need in order to maintain high margins. So I think IOM over time will get back to where they were prepandemic. U.S. is probably a little bit higher in the last couple of quarters than we should expect ongoing for 2021 at least."

At our Investor Update in November, I talked about the start of something new for McDonald's. It was a moment in which we proudly embraced both what we were going to do to write the next chapter of McDonald's grow",2037,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. At our Investor Update in November, I talked about the start of something new for McDonald's. It was a moment in which we proudly embraced both what we were going to do to write the next chapter of McDonald's growth and how we were going to do it. We shared our new growth strategy, Accelerating the Arches, and articulated a clear vision of where we intend to make a difference in a world in need of community and connection.  
We also acknowledged that between a once in a century pandemic, a record economic downturn and profound societal challenges, it was the most difficult year McDonald's has seen. While a new year brings new hope, the issues and uncertainty that emerged last year persist. If I reflect on all that has happened, even since November, I come back to something Ray Kroc once said: Adversity can strengthen you if you have the will to grind it out. Through all the adversity of the last year, we have seen and done important things that reinforce why we are on the right path.  
We have seen the incredible courage and resilience of our McFamily. We know how to run great restaurants. Our long legacy of execution prowess comes from the talent of our teams, from franchisees to supply chain partners and employees. I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that 2020 will be remembered as one of the most challenging yet inspiring moment in the long history of this great brand.  
By making safety and service a priority, by implementing the largest and fastest rollout of new safety protocols in McDonald's history and partnering with the Mayo Clinic to review and refine our approach, by maintaining supply without interruption, by simplifying our menu and by continuing to put our customers and people first, all 3 legs of our stool embodied our values in the best possible way by living them every day, and our customers have noticed. Global brand scores for consumer confidence in eating at McDonald's have risen significantly since the start of the pandemic. 
We've seen the love people have for McDonald's and our food. Even while the pandemic forced lockdowns and prevented customers from dining in most of our restaurants, we achieved over $90 billion of system-wide sales last year. Tens of millions of people every day continue to choose McDonald's for our drive-thru, contactless delivery, takeaway and curbside pickup with more and more customers using our app. And that commitment showed. Despite resurgences of the virus and restrictions on restaurants in the fourth quarter, we continue to see sequential improvement as we delivered our strongest quarter of the year, recovering nearly 99% of 2019 global comp sales. 
Global comp sales for the full year were down 7.7%. While there were challenges across markets, some of our larger markets achieved positive comp sales for the full year, including the U.S., Japan and Australia, and that was on top of strong momentum coming into 2020. U.S. delivered its sixth consecutive year of positive comps. The average U.S. franchisee restaurant operating cash flow reached an all-time high in 2020, up nearly $40,000 over 2019 and up about $100,000 over the last 3 years. Japan has achieved 5 consecutive years of positive comp sales. And Australia posted its seventh consecutive year of positive comps.  
We have seen the ability that McDonald's has to survive hard times and to do so while consistently investing to support both the short and long term. One thing I admire most about our system is that no matter how difficult times get, we never stop thinking about what's next. The impacts of COVID on our industry have been significant. It's been tough. We were sober and realistic from early on while remaining committed to helping every operator and partner survive this crisis.  
We took prudent, quick action designed to prevent not a single owner-operator from failing due to the pandemic, while we bolstered our cash position early in the year to provide nearly $1 billion in financial liquidity to support franchisees. We also maintained our view on the long term as we invested $1.6 billion of CapEx to open nearly 1,000 new restaurants globally and modernize another 900 in the U.S., provided $200 million in incremental marketing support to accelerate the recovery. And together with our franchisees, we invested over $1 billion in technology and digital initiatives, all of which will help drive our next chapter of growth.  
We've also seen our commitment to feed and foster communities take on new meaning this past year. There are so many incredible stories about how the McDonald's system has stepped up to be there for our neighbors and communities this past year. To name a few: Together with our franchisees; we provided more than 12 million Thank You Meals to first responders and health care workers in the U.S.; we donated extra food within our supply chain to communities in need around the world; we gave millions of surgical masks to communities to help protect first responders; and in November, we announced our commitment to donate $100 million over 5 years to help families with sick children through Ronald McDonald House charities.  
We were on the ground working to help local communities solve problems while also looking for ways to use our size and scale to make an even bigger impact. It was an important reminder that brands like ours can help provide stability and even hope during difficult times. Today, brands are working through many societal issues that directly impact our businesses and the economy, and we have a unique role to play in ensuring these issues get addressed. 
That's true of COVID. Hard to imagine that was just a year ago last week that the first case of the coronavirus was confirmed in the U.S. Even while we celebrate a vaccine created in record time, we know that COVID is at its worst right now in many parts of the world, that so many of the communities we serve are experiencing record-high infection rates. We all must play a role as part of the solution. There is a lot of uncertainty ahead for us as individuals and for this industry, and neither may change for some time. We look forward to joining with other business leaders and working with the Biden administration and congressional leadership, as we have with every U.S. President throughout our 66-year history, to address the challenges the country faces. 
As we work to hopefully return to some version of normal, the needs of our customers have changed. They're dining in less and taking out more, visiting less in the morning and much more for lunch and dinner and interacting with other people and brands less in person and more through digital. Just as the investments and choices we've made have driven broad-based strength, Accelerating the Arches will enable us to grow even more sustainably with a bottom-up approach to our growth pillars, our MCDs. 
M stands for maximizing our marketing, so our significant marketing investment remains a true growth driver. We're improving creative effectiveness and leaning into social and digital to drive customer engagement. Teams remain focused on the right balance of sales activation with brand building as we work to optimize marketing returns. 
We made an immediate impression in the closing weeks of 2020 with the launch of our Serving Here campaign in the U.S., celebrating the myriad ways we feed and foster communities. At the same time, many markets drove performance in the fourth quarter with successful sales-building promotions like 30 deals in 30 days in Australia and Monopoly in Australia, France and Canada, featuring customers' core favorites. These are great examples of using our marketing muscle to drive sales without adding complexity to our kitchens. 
C stands for our commitment to the core menu. Our delicious core is something people rely on and return to again and again. Our core classics comprise roughly 70% of our food sales across our top markets. They drive growth and profitability, and we saw that this past year. Developing a reputation for great chicken represents one of our highest ambitions. That's why markets are activating multi-tiered strategy and holistic approaches that integrate great products, strong and sustained marketing and operations excellence. 
We're building on the strength of core equities like Chicken McNuggets and McChicken sandwiches, which have seen significant growth, as we continue to focus on improving our large chicken sandwich offerings around the world. In the U.S., we're excited about the return of Spicy Chicken McNuggets and the launch of the new Crispy Chicken Sandwich at the end of February. 
Markets are also making our delicious and popular 100% all-beef burgers even better with improved cooking procedures and new buns. Russia was the latest major market to roll out these changes in Q4, driving meaningful lifts in hamburgers sold. 
We've also continued to create menu excitement that keeps customers engaged by bringing back limited-time promotions like McRib and introducing new items like our bakery line in the U.S. and the premium McBaguette and signature recipe in France. What's important is that our approach to our menu is thoughtful and judicious. We've seen significant benefits with our streamlined menus and reduced complexity. New items must earn their place on the menu. 
Lastly, D stands for doubling down on digital, delivery and drive-thru. They were the difference-maker when the pandemic hit and are at the heart of our combined efforts to create a faster, easier, better customer experience. Digital sales exceeded $10 billion, or nearly 20% of systemwide sales, in 2020 across our top 6 markets. We're moving aggressively to bring My McDonald's with mobile ordering; payment; delivery; rewards; and fun promotions, like digital calendars, to our customers as soon as possible. We're on track to have elements of My McDonald's across our top 6 markets by the end of 2021, featuring loyalty programs in several of those markets, including a U.S. loyalty launch later in 2021. 
We have big ambitions. We've already shown we know how to meet big goals, as we've proven with delivery. The past 4 years, McDonald's has expanded the number of restaurants offering delivery to nearly 30,000. And COVID has underscored how meaningful our efforts have been to our customers. Many markets, including Australia, Canada and the U.S., have doubled their delivery sales mix over the past year. 
We continue to build out our delivery advantage, much like we're expanding our competitive advantage, on drive-thru. With over 25,000 drive-thrus around the world, we've made smart investments to bolster foundational elements like staffing, positioning and order assembly. We've reduced service times each of the past 2 years, even as a greater percentage of customers went through our drive-thrus during 2020. 
While each pillar will further extend our leadership, what's especially powerful is the exponential impact when all 3 pillars come together. Famous Orders platform in the U.S. is a prime example. In the fourth quarter, we featured favorite menu items of Latin music icon, J Balvin; and classic holiday characters, including Santa Claus and The Grinch. With exclusive deals on our app, customers rediscovered iconic core menu items, like Big Macs and Egg McMuffins, and tried new items like cinnamon rolls. And we drove digital adoption, including significant lifts, app registrations and use. That's our sweet spot. That's how M, C and D come together to drive demand, sales and growth without creating additional complexity. 
Our ability to navigate the past year would not have been possible without the incredible commitment of our franchisees, our supply chain and agency partners and our employees who have continued to focus and execute during this extraordinary past year. When I think about everything our restaurant teams around the world have done to provide an essential service at the front lines, serving our customers safely every step of the way, I can't help but believe that this amazing system is proving every day this isn't just a job. To them and to us, it's something bigger. It's our chance to make a difference for our customers and our communities. 
I'll now turn it over to Kevin to talk in more detail about our financial results. Kevin?"

Chris talked a bit about our full year results, so let me spend a few minutes talking about the quarter. Global comparable sales were down 1.3% in Q4. Comp sales were positive in October as I mentioned on our Q3 call, but they returned negative in November and December as a result of the widespread resurgences and the return of government restrictions, particularly across the International Operated Markets. 
In the U.S., comp sales increased 5.5% for the quarter, ending the year with 6 consecutive months of positive comps. Sales grew in all major dayparts, including breakfast, and this is on top of prior year growth across these dayparts. Our strategic investments, including incremental marketing spend, fueled our momentum with strong national promotions like McRib, Buy One, Get One for $1, our new bakery line and 2 separate offerings of Famous Orders. Dinner continued to be our leading daypart with strong sales of core items as customers keep coming back for familiar favorites. 
In the IOM segment, comp sales were down 7.4% in Q4. And while performance varied across the countries, nearly all of our major markets grew traffic share. Strong positive comps in Australia and the U.K. were more than offset by negative double-digit comps in France, Germany, Italy and Spain. Beginning at the end of October, additional government restrictions went into effect across many of our markets, including limited sales channels, reduced operating hours and dining room closures. 
Australia benefited from strong menu and marketing news in the quarter, including the successful launch of a new chicken line with McSpicy at its center, another example of great ideas and products traveling across our markets as McSpicy has been a customer favorite in China and several other markets in Asia for a while. Since the start of the pandemic, Australia has also doubled their delivery sales. 
The U.K. has achieved comp sales growth every month since August despite increased restrictions reintroduced in early November. The quarter benefited from a focus on core menu as well as phenomenal growth in delivery. 
And finally, comp sales in the International Developmental Licensed segment were down 3.6% for the quarter, reflecting significant improvement for most markets over Q3. Japan once again delivered strong positive comp sales for the quarter and for the year, as Chris mentioned. The market is meeting customers' changing needs, growing delivery and mobile ordering along with running successful LTO promotions, all while further strengthening trust in our brand. 
And in China, results have improved quarter-over-quarter since Q1. Recovery continued on a steady pace with a marketing plan focused on delivery and digital along with new chicken offerings. And despite the challenging year, nearly 500 new restaurants were opened across the market in 2020. 
Turning to January trends. In the U.S., sales comps continue to be strong and are expected to be up high single digits with continued growth across all dayparts and assisted by consumers receiving government stimulus checks. IOM comp sales are projected to be down low double digits, given the government restrictions that remain in place in most markets. Continued momentum in Australia is being more than offset by double-digit negative comps in France, Germany, Italy and Spain. And we expect this trend to likely continue until dine-in resumes. 
Adjusted earnings per share in Q4 was $1.70 after excluding gains on the sale of an additional 3% of our ownership in McDonald's Japan. While global restaurant margins were down as a result of the pressure on sales, the U.S. grew both franchised and company-operated margins up over $70 million for the quarter. 
Consistent with the guidance we gave in our third quarter remarks, G&A increases for Q4 were primarily driven by some onetime investments we made in renewed brand activity, including the launch of our Serving Here campaign and our commitment to donate $100 million to Ronald McDonald House Charities, as Chris mentioned earlier. 
Turning to our outlook for 2021. As Chris talked about, there's still a lot of uncertainty, both today and as we look ahead. We're confident in our ability to manage through this uncertainty and that our Accelerating the Arches strategy will continue to drive growth in the business. We expect 2021 systemwide sales growth of low double digits in constant currencies versus 2020, with new unit expansion contributing about 1%. This reiterates the mid-single-digit growth rate off of 2019 that we mentioned in November. 
We ultimately measure overall financial efficiency by our operating margin as it serves as the most comprehensive gauge of our operating performance. We expect our operating margin percent to be in the low to mid-40s for 2021. In the U.S., we expect higher depreciation expense of about $60 million versus 2020 in franchised margins related to our modernization efforts. Depreciation will continue to be a P&L headwind for the next few years even though it will have no impact on future cash flows. In the IOM segment, while we expect improvement in our company-operated margin percent over the course of the year, we don't expect to get back to pre-COVID levels in 2021 as a result of near-term sales and cost pressures. 
Turning to G&A. As we become more efficient with G&A required to run the business, we're able to make strategic investments in areas like digital and technology to drive growth. Looking ahead, we expect 2021 G&A to decrease about 2% to 4% in constant currencies over 2020, which reiterates our expectation that G&A will be about 2.3% of system-wide sales. 
Looking at other operating income and expense. We expect our equity pickup to be slightly higher for 2021 due to improved results versus 2020, partially offset by our reduced ownership in Japan. Gains on restaurant sales last year were suppressed due to COVID so we expect gains this year to be about double that of 2020. And finally, in 2020, we had some onetime items included in the asset dispositions line related to store closings and bad debts. For 2021, we expect that line to get back to a more normal level of expense of roughly $100 million. We're projecting our 2021 effective tax rate in the range of 21% to 23%. 
And finally, turning to FX. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency translation would benefit EPS by about $0.06 to $0.08 in the first quarter and $0.27 to $0.29 for the full year. As usual, this is directional guidance only as rates will likely change as we move throughout the year. 
Moving to capital expenditures. As we indicated in November, we expect to spend roughly $2.3 billion of capital in 2021. New restaurant development is an important driver of our growth as we see significant expansion opportunity, especially in the IOM segment. These markets have driven strong growth over the past several years and deliver strong returns on new restaurants. 
This year, we plan to open over 1,300 new restaurants globally. Of the $2.3 billion of capital, we'll spend roughly half of that to open nearly 500 restaurants in the U.S. and IOM segments. The remaining 800-plus new restaurant openings are across the IDL markets, including nearly 500 in China. As a reminder, our strategic partners in these markets provide the capital for restaurant openings. 
The remaining half of CapEx spend will go towards reinvestment back into our U.S. and IOM restaurants, including about $500 million to modernize approximately 1,200 restaurants in the U.S. We're nearing completion of our U.S. modernization efforts and expect over 90% of projects to be complete by the end of the year. 
And finally, I want to conclude with our free cash flow profile. With the improvements made to our business operating model over the last several years and the consistent strength of our global business, our free cash flow grew significantly through 2019. In 2020, even with significant disruption, we generated free cash flow of over $4.5 billion. And free cash flow conversion, which measures our ability to convert bottom line earnings to free cash flow, was nearly 100%. In 2021, we expect to convert more than 90% of our net earnings to free cash flow and to generate free cash flow near 2019 levels or about $5.5 billion to $6 billion. 
Our capital allocation priorities remain the same. First, investing in the business to drive growth. This includes both capital expenditures as well as investments in technology and digital. Second, prioritizing dividends to our shareholders. After that, most of our remaining free cash flow for 2021 will go towards paying down debt to get back to pre-COVID leverage ratios by the end of the year. As we start the new year, I'm confident that the plans we have in place will position us to continue to deliver sustained long-term profitable growth for our system and shareholders. 
Now I'll turn it back to Chris to close."

Despite the uncertainties we continue to face, one thing is clear: McDonald's is well positioned to emerge from this moment with competitive strength. And we're confident we can keep capturing market share as we look to the future. We're confident because we were growing share in most markets before COVID. We're confident because we've continued growing market share during COVID. And we're especially confident because we've gained important insights which will bolster the strategic vision we set with Accelerating the Arches. 
This clarity of purpose and strategy is the reason that, in October, we increased our annual dividend to shareholders. Not only did it mark 40-plus consecutive years of increases, it reinforced to our shareholders our confidence in the long-term strategy. It's also the reason we continue directing investments where they make the most strategic sense and build on our strengths. 
We'll uphold McDonald's commitment and legacy as a responsible and reliable choice for trusted, delicious food.

And in the IOM market, as you know, it is -- those markets tend to be more of a dine-in business. And so the biggest thing that we're doing with many of these markets having dine-in closed is we are trying to do as much as we can to drive our drive-thru delivery, our digital businesses. And we're having good success with that. 
Some of it though is, frankly, limited. Because in many markets, there are hour -- or operating hour restrictions, 6 p.m., 8 p.m., et cetera. So I think part of what we are trying to do is, with our franchisees, so long as we are dealing with government restrictions around what you can open, how long you can be open, it's about supporting the franchisees. As we said in the opening remarks here, making sure that all of our franchisees have the liquidity that they need to get through it. As you come through, though, I think the plan that we laid out, which is focused on driving core menu and the 3Ds, that's the way that we really come out of this, I think, in a very strong position. 
And we've seen, as we've gone through this, one of the things for us, we've discovered capacity that we didn't even realize we've had. We -- think in the last year, we've moved something like 300 million additional cars through our drive-thrus. And if you had asked me a few years ago, I was thinking that we were pretty maxed out on drive-thru. So I think our guys are set up well to get after this. But as we're continuing to deal with some of the short-term restrictions, it is challenging."

In the U.K., for example, over 20% of their sales in Q4 were delivery sales. So we are seeing some significant growth, both in delivery and digital. 
The other thing I would point out is this is nothing structural. This is a temporary issue. And the reason I think we're confident in saying that is, if we look back at even as recently as October, we were relatively flat in IOM in October. But as the new restrictions come back, that's when we see kind of comps going down again. So as soon as the markets start opening up again and easing restrictions, I think we're pretty confident customers come back pretty quickly, and we'll be set up well."

But Australia, which seems to be a strong performer as of late, it might be one area where it seems like consumers are closer to normal relative to the rest of the world.

In Australia, as you note, it has been one of the few markets in the world that has, let's say, relatively unscaled by coronavirus as they've done a very nice job of containing the virus. And that market is performing very strongly. Our franchisees in Australia are going to have record cash flow in 2020. The business is doing high single-digit performance. 
So I think it is, for us, a good indication of what this -- the post-COVID opportunity for us can look like. I think what we are expecting though is, and what we've seen is we've gone through COVID and the resurgence of COVID's recovery, is that channels like digital, like delivery, like drive-thru, they do remain elevated. We think that, that is going to be kind of one of the more enduring parts of it. It doesn't mean that there still isn't going to be a sizable dine-in business, but I think the takeaway business is going to remain elevated post-COVID, including delivery with that. 
And those channels, when you look at whether it's delivery or digital, drive-thru, those tend to be higher order sizes. And so as the mix moves to that, I think this idea of elevated check, we're expecting that, that's going to continue albeit not at the levels that you're seeing now. But I think it just -- there's going to be a channel mix shift that is going to continue to give benefit to average check going forward is our expectation."

Well, as you know, I know the U.S. market well, having run that for 3 years. And I'd say there are a few things that I just learned during my time in the U.S. 
The first is we have 2,000 owner-operators in the U.S., and it is very difficult to generalize sort of what is the overall sentiment in that market. You have 2,000 CEOs and presidents of their own businesses with a lot of different opinions and perspectives. So I would just caution to make any generalizations about the market. 
The other thing that I would say is the business is a very decentralized, federated type of model. All the action happens at the restaurant level. And at the restaurant level, the U.S. interaction between the company and franchisees remain strong. And I think the evidence of that is just the operating performance that you're seeing out of our restaurants in the U.S. as we're putting up pretty strong comps, which if you look at it on a 2-year stack basis, it was, I think, a 10.1% in Q4 on a 2-year stack. 
So the business is performing, I think, at a very high level. We're seeing service times improve. But there is absolutely noise, and there absolutely is -- are some disagreements that happen right now between the national operator leadership and our U.S. team. I dealt with those when I was in the U.S. They flare up from time to time. We're certainly in one of those moments now. But I'm confident that Joe Erlinger and the U.S. team, along with Mark Salebra, who leads the operator group at the national level, we always find our way to work through these.

These markets had most of their sales pre-COVID from on-premise ordering. And some are even city center locations, perhaps more than the U.S., where you have a lot of suburban drive-thru. So obviously, more painful today. 
But I wonder if you're thinking that market share gains could be even greater because your competition, which is often local, lacks McDonald's unit economics and the drive-thrus that you have that are obviously helping your profitability during the pandemic. So could you talk about the outlook for market share gains? And if there's any sort of difference in the recovery that you foresee in these markets broadly than what we would expect in the U.S."

Thanks, David. I'll take a shot at it, and Chris can certainly chime in. As you mentioned, certainly, our percentage of restaurants with drive-thru in the International Operated Markets is a little bit less than what we have in the U.S. In Australia and Canada, it's more around 80%, 90%. But in France, Germany, U.K., it's roughly 2/3 of their restaurants or so that have drive-thrus. So the percent of sales that run through the drive-thrus pre-COVID in those International Operated Markets was less. We're certainly seeing, during the pandemic, a higher percentage of sales run through the drive-thru as well as elevated digital and delivery sales. 
But I think to your point, I think we believe we're well set up post pandemic, because while the percentage of drive-thrus is less than the U.S., it's substantially higher than just about any competitor in most of those markets. And so the fact that we're well set up with drive-thrus, we'll continue to open up more drive-thrus. 
To your point, there are some city center tourist travel locations right now that are kind of getting hit harder than certainly most of our U.S. restaurants because of the pandemic. But there's nothing structural in the business that gives us concern that once the markets start opening up post pandemic, we feel like we should be in good shape to be able to pick up market share. 
There are still a substantial number of restaurants in many of those markets that are closed. The unknown -- not McDonald's restaurants, I'm just saying in the industry. The unknown certainly is how many of those are temporary versus what's permanent. But we think we're pretty well set up to be able to continue gaining market share, which we have done both in 2019 and in 2020 during the pandemic in those IOM markets, to keep gaining market share."

I think the bigger thing that I think about and the bigger benefit is this is a momentum business. And when you have momentum in the business, everything seems to work better, including on your marketing side. So our expectation, part of why we put the $200 million in, in 2020, was to make sure that we could generate some strong momentum coming out of this. And when you've got that momentum, you get an outsized effect from what would be even a normalized marketing level.

And it is a competitive market in the U.S., probably one of the most competitive markets, if not the most competitive market in the world. Back in November, when we had our Investor Day, part of the M within MCD was that we needed to make sure we had a strong focus on affordability. And you're seeing, just as we've entered into 2021, you've seen some of the value deals that are out there from our competitors. We've also had some programs that I think have performed well for us. And that's going to be a trend that continues all through 2021. Our expectation is that you're absolutely going to need to remain competitive on value. 
I think we've been able to -- back to the momentum point, we've been able to put ourselves through the investments we've made in modernizing our estate, upgrading our brand attributes, I think we're in a better position than we were maybe 4 or 5 years ago in terms of just the consumer demand for our brands. So I think that, for us, gives me confidence that this isn't going to be something that gets -- that we're going to have to chase down the rabbit hole, so to speak. 
On your question about breakfast. Our breakfast business is performing well. In Q4, our breakfast business grew. We saw strong performance out of the bakery line. So our expectation is, going forward, that breakfast, the daypart, we've been pleased with how we weathered through 2020 on that. Even with the introduction of one of our competitors, didn't have a significant impact on our breakfast business.

Because of the level of stimulus, certainly, it is helping right now in the short term. I think the industry, we're a beneficiary of that. But the stimulus is going to roll off. And I don't think that we yet fully understand or have visibility to, as the stimulus rolls off, sort of what is the underlying health of the consumer. Many people have talked about a K-shaped recovery, the divergence between the stock market and the rest of the ""real economy."" I think that's real.

So I think you might see, versus maybe what we had prepandemic levels, a little bit more moderate pace of LTOs because of this focus on core menu."

Many of us have traveled to these countries with you over the years, Canada, Australia, France, Germany, U.K., so we do have a fine appreciation of, as you define, the informal eating out market that you directly compete against in many of these areas and I guess many of the high streets, if you will, in particular.

But how much of that capacity do you think has come out permanently?

John, as you know and you mentioned, obviously, each country is a little different, both in terms of demographic, consumer demographics as well as competitive environment. I think, so things like high streets in the U.K., I think, right now is a challenge, certainly much broader than our business. But there's a question of when and even if the high street in the U.K. completely returns to kind of prepandemic levels. 
I think in general, as I mentioned, right now, there's a lot of outlets closed in many of the markets. The unknown is how many of those are temporary versus permanent. I do think, certainly, in many of those countries, where someone has 1, maybe 2 outlets, that's a bigger challenge, and I don't think we'd be surprised to see several of those outlets permanently closed. 
We're seeing that in several of the countries right now, where it looks like many of those outlets will not be returning. So that I think overall supply in general will shrink a little bit, which certainly is an opportunity for us to continue gaining market share. That's our expectation. That's what we're going after. And I think we believe that we're well positioned to gain a lot of that share."

It seems like there's a lot of opposing forces, at least for franchisees, where you have the national minimum wage potentially going up. But on the flip side, unemployment high, which would historically imply ample labor. 
So maybe with that as kind of a backdrop, would love your outlook on labor cost and perhaps labor availability. And whether you think the franchisees can offset that pressure, whether it's through cost saves, technology, pricing. How are those conversations going with franchisees regarding dealing with upcoming ongoing labor cost pressures?"

Thanks, Jeff. I think the discussion about the minimum wage and what that means in terms of cost of labor, while it's picked up with the change in the administration at the federal level, I would say that it's been going on at the state level for the last several years. And you've seen a number of states, I forget if it's 24, 25 states, have passed some degree of minimum wage legislation. Florida was the most recent one in this past election, where I think they've introduced a $15 an hour -- a glide path to a $15 an hour. 
So we've -- as this has been rolling into the states, we have seen and developed quite a bit of experience with how this works out. I think the positive for us has been, so long as it's done in a staged way and so long as it is done equitably across the entire market without sort of any carve-outs or special exemptions for people, then we do just fine. And we're able to balance between judicious pricing on the menu as well as just thinking about productivity savings that we can manage through this. 
I'll give you another example that gives us confidence. There was a significant increase in the minimum wage that was passed in Canada a couple of years back. And that team, working with the franchisees, did a spectacular job of working that through on to the menu, through pricing, through productivity. 
So I think our view is the minimum wage is most likely going to be increasing, whether that's federally or at the state level, as I referenced. And so long as it's done, like I said, in a staged way and in a way that is equitable for everybody, McDonald's will do just fine through that."

One is menu simplification and the more limited menu that you indicate, but also just a big focus on operations around the world, which includes some non-sexy stuff like staffing and positioning of our crew, some certain technology that we put in the restaurants to help the crew monitor the times. And so there's just some basic kind of running the -- operating the restaurants efficiently that goes along with the right menu and menu boards. 
And so there continues to be a big focus on drive-thru operations, especially because we've seen drive-thru continue to be a bigger percentage of our business.

It was a year ago this week that we had our first earnings call of the COVID-19 pandemic. We had just begun to experience the closings, openings and constantly changing regulations that would come to define the past year. I said then that in the face of such enormous challenges, I was immensely proud of the entire McDonald's system. Franchisees, crew members, suppliers and company employees banded together and continued to feed in foster communities amidst unprecedented change and disruption. My pride has only grown since then. Through the pandemic, we've seen the power of the McDonald's system and our franchise model at work. We are one of the world's most global corporation, but also one of the most local, serving tens of millions of customers each day across almost 40,000 local restaurants. That's our secret sauce. And it's hard to imagine how we would have adapted to the constantly changing circumstances of the past year if we were not a locally owned, locally managed system, rooted in the communities where we operate. 
That ability to adapt enabled us to build a system playbook that tapped into our operating prowess and synthesized learnings from individual markets. We put our customers and people first, and found ways to ensure their safety and security amidst a global health crisis. We leaned into our historical strengths like our core menu and drive-thru to continue serving our communities, creating feel-good moments that were more welcome and needed than ever. 
At the same time, we kept innovating in areas like digital and delivery, to offer customers new ways to safely connect with our brand and deepen our ability to meet their personalized needs. And we used our marketing muscle to keep the golden arches shining brightly, reminding people of their enduring trust in our brand and our purpose to feed and foster communities. Importantly, we did it all with a commitment to transparency. Every step of the way, we gave our stakeholders a clear sense of what we were doing and why we were doing it. That communication was made easier by our refreshed values that captured the essence of the McDonald's system and how we operate. No matter where you are in the world, our McDonald's values serve as the glue that unites us and guides our every decision. We put our people and customers first. We open our doors to everyone. We do the right thing. We're good neighbors, and we get better together. 
Five simple statements that capture the essence of the company, Ray Kroc founded over 65 years ago. Our renewed focus on these values has kicked off a virtuous cycle, energizing our workforce and attracting new leaders who embody these qualities and are inspired by our purpose. That includes Desire Ras Morrison, who joined the team earlier this week as our new General Counsel. 
Turning to our business performance. Despite resurgences in continued operating restrictions in many parts of the world, I'm pleased to share that in the first quarter, global comp sales and revenues have already surpassed Q1 2019 levels. Not surprisingly, we expect McDonald's to deliver strong global comp sales and revenue growth against 2019 levels for the full year, reflecting the strength of our business and the pent-up customer demand we're seeing as markets reopen. Specifically in Q1, global comp sales for the quarter were up 7.5%, with each of our segments achieved positive comp sales. As we will hear in a moment from our U.S. segment President, Joe Erlinger, That improvement was largely driven by the U.S. with comp sales up 13.6% for the quarter. 
In Europe, we continue to face a tough operating environment, which is impacting recovery across some of our top markets in the IOM segment. Kevin will talk about our international performance in a minute. We remain laser-focused on achieving the sustainable growth plan laid out and accelerating the arches. Likewise, our 3 growth pillars, M, C and D continue to serve as both a guide and an engine for our path forward. We are maximizing our marketing to stay relevant and find those connection points with customers that will pay off in a big way. We're also committing to our core menu, making the chicken, burgers and coffee our customers love even more delicious. 
In a moment, Joe will talk about the successful launch of the new Crispy Chicken Sandwich. Finally, we're doubling down on digital, delivery and drive-thru. We're creating a faster, easier, better customer experience. However, our customers want to interact with us, whether at the counter, through drive-through window or on the app, dining in the restaurant or having that meal delivered to them. We will offer experiences they love and that we believe will keep them coming back. Over the past 4 years, we went from just over 3,000 restaurants offering delivery to now more than 30,000 restaurants for 75% of our global footprint. We're excited about our success with multiple 3PL partners, and we continue to innovate. That includes testing self-delivery models in select markets and identifying ways to improve restaurant operations for delivery so that customer experience will get better and better. 
Drive-thru made McDonald's what it is today. The drive-thrus in 25,000 of our restaurants worldwide are a huge part of who we are and why we've been able to continue safely serving millions of customers each day this past year. And since the pandemic began, We've leaned into this competitive advantage by continuing to improve drive-thru service times by putting more emphasis on operations and reducing menu complexity. We also see digital as an important channel to improve speed and convenience, provide customers with more personalization and offer even better value. We have 40 million active app users in just our top 6 markets and millions more around the world. Our goal is to make sure that no matter how customers interact with us, they have a seamless and consistently enjoyable experience. One key lever in reaching our digital ambition is loyalty. 
In addition to France and a few other markets, which already have loyalty, We are currently piloting our new loyalty program, My McDonald's Rewards in the U.S. and Germany, with plan to deploy later this year. What inspires me the most about our digital transformation is that we constantly have the opportunity and ability to become even more relevant in our customers' everyday routines. The power of our growth pillars come to life, not in isolation but in combination. The success of our famous orders program is a great example of how the 3 pillars, our M, C and D, are deeply interconnected reinforcing and bolstering one another. And last week's announcement that we're partnering with super group, BTS, from South Korea to offer fans in nearly 50 countries their favorite McDonald's order shines a powerful light on a simple truth: in every country where we operate from every walk of life and in almost every stage of life, you have your go-to McDonald's order. 
This is much more than your traditional promotional partnership. For one, it will harness the scale of McDonald's and the relevance of authentic fans like BTS. I think it's fair to say that few other brands have the cultural relevance and global appeal to pull off this kind of partnership. That's the power of brand McDonald's. Famous orders takes that universal insight of everyone's unique go-to McDonald's order, celebrates our fans love of the core menu and brings it to life through digital activations. The BTS Army will soon experience the M, the C and the D of our plan in a way that authentically taps into their love of these 2 global icons. 
And it doesn't stop there. Whether it's through successful traffic-generating promotions like digital calendars in Australia or Germany, building on the strength of core equities with line extensions like Katsu Curry Chicken McNuggets and Grand Big Mac in the U.K., we're piloting the My McDonald's Reward loyalty program. We continue to deepen our connection with customers and create a consistent and enjoyable experience. Let's turn it over to Joe to tell us what that experience is looking like in the U.S. Joe?"

Our U.S. business ended 2020 in a position of strength and that carried into the first quarter, delivering a 13.6% comp sales increase with double-digit positive comps across all dayparts. We exited Q1 with historically high average daily sales volumes and the record high operating cash flow our franchisees experienced in 2020 continued in Q1. While we have seen some benefit from consumers receiving government stimulus checks during the first quarter, our results are truly a testament to the hard work happening each day in our restaurants. I've recently been in our restaurants in Maine and Massachusetts, and you can feel the energy and excitement. Our franchisees and importantly, their restaurant teams are focused on keeping our crew and customers safe. In addition, they are delivering gold standard execution, especially around chicken and the 3Ds, and this has led to higher customer satisfaction scores. 
I want to give a special thank you to our owner operators and restaurant teams for all they've done during extremely challenging times. Our growth plans in the U.S. are rooted in the accelerating the arches strategy and focused on the MCD framework. As for our results, the quarterly performance is a product of the accumulation of what we've done over the past 12 months and not because of any 1 action we took during a quarter or a 4-week marketing window. The values and brand-based decisions we've made, along with simplifying our menus, strengthening our digital business and recommitting to our core are having a multiplier effect. I've seen this recipe for success in several markets during my time overseas, and I'm confident that the right pieces are in place for our U.S. business to sustain results. 
Let me pull back the lens and give you some examples. Driving customer visits begins with committing to the core menu. Early in the pandemic, the U.S. business removed dozens of menu items. As a result of this focus, our drive-thrus got faster, margins grew and customer satisfaction improved. Put simply, our restaurants became easier to run and more profitable. Reducing complexity set the stage for the right investments in the core beginning last fall with Spicy Chicken McNuggets, which we brought back for a limited time in February. They drove customer excitement and comp sales growth during the quarter. Then in late February, we introduced our Crispy Chicken sandwich line of 3 delicious new sandwiches, the beginning of our multiyear chicken journey. 
While the category is very competitive, we are so far exceeding our projections. We are selling substantially more chicken sandwiches compared to our previous chicken sandwich line and seeing strong unit movement, especially after 4:00 p.m. Our success is a demonstration of McDonald's at its best, with all 3 legs of the stool working together. First, we developed the platform and built the supply chain. We then align the system around the opportunity. And finally, we created engaging and exciting marketing, PR and social media plans nationally and across our 10 field offices. Today, we're learning from each other and working to transfer the success we're seeing in our top restaurants to all restaurants. We expect to refresh and sustain this platform and do so in a very culturally relevant way throughout the rest of 2021. 
At the same time, we doubled down on the 3Ds: digital, delivery and drive-thru. With COVID as the catalyst for a consumer behavior shift, we experienced an absolute surge in off-premise dining. We drove our digital sales mix and app usage. In the first quarter, we had nearly $1.5 billion in digital sales, which includes app, kiosks and delivery. And we now have over 20 million active app users with loyalty yet to come. We grew delivery to an all-time high in dollars and sales mix, and we continue to reduce overall experience times, especially impressive given the increased volume of business we'd experienced through the drive-thru. 
Chris mentioned the Famous orders platform earlier. Nothing had a greater impact on our digital business than the introduction of this program last year. We've retained many of the digital customers acquired during those famous order promotions, and the U.S. business is very excited about the upcoming BTS meal, which continues to maximize our digital investments without adding any restaurant complexity. And with that foundation, we are well positioned heading into our loyalty program launch later this summer. When we built My McDonald's Rewards, our goal was to create a platform that elevated our brand, excited our customers and engaged our crew, and we did just that. In our 2 test and learn markets, Phoenix and New England, we're encouraged by the initial results. User adoption as measured by guests ordering through the app are up significantly since the test began. Frequency has increased. In fact, our loyalty customers are far more likely to return in the next 30 days compared to nonloyalty customers. 
And customer satisfaction is up. Customers love the personalized experience of being greeted by their first name. We've received overwhelmingly positive feedback from restaurant crew, not only on the program itself, but the ways in which we've trained them, for example, using digital simulations. Of course, as in any test, we've captured many learnings around training, operations and deployment that will help us maximize the impact when we launch this nationally. 
As I close, I want to reiterate that there is not one single reason for our success. The accumulation of our decisions grounded in our values, returned the U.S. business to a place of brand relevancy for our customers and meaning for our people and has provided us a strong foundation towards sustained business growth. And now I'll turn it over to Kevin to talk about our international performance and our financial results."

As Chris mentioned earlier, global comp sales and revenues for the quarter surpassed Q1 2019 prepandemic levels, largely driven by the U.S. For the quarter, global comp sales increased 7.5% with growth across all segments, and comps were up significantly in March as we started to lap the impact of COVID-19. 
In the IOM segment, comp sales were up 60 basis points in Q1. With widespread resurgences and ongoing government restrictions across Europe, including dining room closures and reduced operating hours The segment has not fully recovered to pre-COVID levels. As a result of the restrictions, we saw varied performance across the markets. Strong results continued in Australia as customer mobility has mostly recovered and the country remains nearly COVID-free. The market benefited from sales of their new chicken line along with successful LTL line extensions on core burgers. And average check has continued to hold up with sustained growth in delivery and drive-through sales and a shift into more core and premium menu items. 
Comp sales were positive for the U.K. and Canada for the quarter and surpassed 2019 prepandemic levels. Despite U.K.'s national stay-at-home order for nearly all of Q1 and in Canada's recent surge in COVID infections, both markets have successfully leveraged the competitive advantages of our 3Ds to grow sales. And in France and Germany, comps were negative for the quarter, as dining rooms were closed and curfews were in place. Government restrictions are expected to ease somewhat in Q2, but we don't expect these markets to recover to pre-COVID sales levels until later in the year. 
Comp sales in the IDL segment were up 6.4% for the quarter, with growth across nearly all geographies. Performance was largely driven by positive results in China and Japan. In China, comps were up significantly for the quarter as we comped over COVID impacts from February and March last year. By leveraging their large digital members base, China ran compelling digital offers contributing to results for the quarter as they continue on the path to recovery. In addition, China opened 150 new restaurants in Q1, keeping on pace to open nearly 500 new restaurants this year. Japan maintained momentum in Q1 with comps up 9%, and that's on top of over 5% growth last year as a strong balance of core value and family-related promotions resonated with customers. 
Looking ahead to Q2, we expect the U.S. to continue to outpace 2019 and with 2-year comp sales growth relatively in line with Q1. In the IOM segment, we expect the 2-year growth rate to improve over Q1, and But the segment will likely continue to lag 2019 until the second half of the year. Given our strong start to the year, we now expect full year system-wide sales growth in the mid-teens in constant currencies. But we continue to see pandemic-related stops and starts in markets around the world, impacting customer behavior and our business. So there's still some uncertainty. 
Turning to earnings. Adjusted earnings per share in Q1 was $1.92, up 27% in constant currencies. And adjusted operating margin was 41.9%, reflecting improved sales performance, higher other operating income and lower G&A costs compared to last year. Total restaurant margin dollars increased 10% in constant currencies, with improvement in both franchise and company-operated restaurant margins. Franchise margin dollars grew by over $170 million in constant currencies, mostly from the strong sales performance in the U.S. and company-operated margins in the U.S. were strong, as we continue to see top line growth driven from higher average check. As I mentioned last quarter, we expect U.S. margins to moderate somewhat as check growth tempers and we reopen dining rooms. 
In the IOM segment, company-operated margins improved in Q1. With the ongoing impact of COVID on the segment, we don't expect to get back to full year pre-COVID margin levels this year. This is a result of near-term sales and cost pressures, but there's nothing structural to prevent us from returning to pre-COVID margins longer term. 
Turning to G&A. Chris and Joe both talked about the contributions from digital on our results, and we continue to invest in this important area to fuel growth. For the quarter, G&A was down 6% in constant currencies due to some onetime costs we incurred in the first quarter last year. As a result of our strong start to the year, we're now expecting higher incentive-based compensation. So for the full year, we expect G&A to be about 2.4% of system-wide sales. Because this increase to incentive-based comp just relates to current year performance, It will only impact this year's G&A. 
Our effective tax rate was 21.3% for the quarter, and we're still projecting a full year rate in the range of 21% to 23%, with some fluctuation across the quarters. And finally, foreign currency translation benefited Q1 results by $0.06 per share. Based on current exchange rates, we expect FX to benefit EPS by about $0.10 for Q2 with an estimated full year tailwind of $0.24 to $0.26. As usual, this is directional guidance only as rates will likely change as we move through the year. I'm pleased with our global recovery to date, even as we face resurgences and restricted operations around the world. And I'm confident that our Accelerating the Arches strategy will continue to drive growth in the business. Now I'll turn it back to Chris."

I want to close by saying once again how proud I am of everything our system has accomplished and continues to do amidst such difficult circumstances. If last year was about defining who we are, what we stand for and where we're going, this year is about execution and how we're going to get there. 
Every year, we check in with our staff to get their feedback on the work that's happening. In our latest survey results received last week, almost 90% of employees expressed strong confidence in our business. And just as importantly, they agreed that we were abiding by each of our core values. And just a few weeks ago, we held our Annual Leadership Summit, virtually bringing together our top 50 field and corporate leaders. Across each of our markets and amongst this leadership group, there was strong alignment against our Accelerating the Arches 
[Audio Gap] 
Consumer brand like McDonald's, unless the corporation's actions give evidence to those attributes. That's why in February, we set 5- and 10-year goals for increasing diversity and leadership across our corporation. Research has shown that businesses that prioritize DEI recruit and retain stronger talent, unlock greater innovative potential and bolster financial performance, and we're committed to making measurable progress in disclosing representation data to hold ourselves accountable for results by tying a portion of executive composition to making progress in this area. 
Earlier this month, we also shared global brand standards designed to reinforce a culture of safety and inclusion. We want employees and customers to feel safe and protected. And it's critically important to be clear that violence, harassment and discrimination of any kind is not tolerated. All 39,000 McDonald's restaurants across the globe, including company-owned and franchised locations will be required to uphold these standards. We're continuing to put resources and tools in place to help restaurants implement these changes and ensure these standards are met. 
Beginning in January 2022, Restaurants will be assessed in accordance with the applicable McDonald's market business evaluation processes. We understand that the way we show up in our communities and for stakeholders impacts the way customers see us and their trust in us. We have to make sure our values are the lived experience of everyone who interacts with our brand. We've seen powerful examples of service and dedication on display across the McDonald's system during the most difficult year we've ever experienced. Around the world, our people have embodied the belief that we must all pitch in and help one another. They take pride in that, and they should. 
While we all remain hopeful that this will be a year when life begins to return to some version of normal, we know the operating environment remains volatile. We expect that there will be stops and starts that impact results. But as we see, even during the most difficult moments last year, delicious feel-good moments for McDonald's remain high in demand. We will continue to lean forward and make bold bets in our future. I believe more strongly than ever, as I said in November, that this is the start of something new for McDonald's. As we continue to accelerate the arches, lead with our values and serve our customers and communities, I look forward to seeing what the McFamily can accomplish in the months ahead. And I look forward to seeing our global system come together in person next April in Orlando for our Global 2022 Worldwide Convention. And with that, we'll begin Q&A."

I think you have to break it into kind of the -- each of the big markets there. And it varies. In the case of the U.K., we're seeing the U.K. consumer is quite strong. That business is performing well. Markets that are heavily tourist dependent, however, like Spain, Italy, France, those markets are struggling. And so I think for us, part of what we believe is that this summer, We do think that many of the European markets are going to start opening up. There's been some commentary about perhaps a vaccine passport that allows for travel within the European market. That, I think, will have a big impact and help on stimulating those markets that maybe have had a little bit more of a headwind. And then I think for us, the key is about also getting the dining rooms open. Our dining rooms are closed in about 50% of our restaurants in Europe. As you know, dining rooms or dine-in is a big part of our European business. And so getting those open, I think, will be another important step for us in getting momentum back into the European business. But from a consumer standpoint, in terms of just the outlook, I think it's probably best described as being concerned about and anxious about many of the things that are coming with COVID. But I think also there's pent-up demand that we've seen when we do -- when we are able to get a market open or even last year when we had some reopenings that then resulted in closures, not too long thereafter as the second and third wave came about that there's nothing that gives us any concern that as we reopen that we're going to see the same pent-up demand come back and get the European business moving forward."

And that's exactly obviously what we've done. Beyond that though, obviously, we've made some great investments in chicken, great investments in the core that have begun to really set us up well for the future. And we continue to have our prowess around value. 
As you begin to look forward, we think there's no question that the consumer is going to want to come back into dining rooms. Chris has already mentioned it in Europe, but we think it's the case in the U.S. as well. And so we will continue to open our dining rooms, but we want to do it in a way that really drive sales and make it an event almost as we reopen our dining rooms because with 90% plus of our business being through the drive-thru. If we can sustain that and return our dining rooms and takeaway to the levels that they were prepandemic, we've set ourselves up for a very good run here. 
In terms of parallels between the U.S. business and other successful markets overseas, it's never one lever, Dennis. It's always a combination of things that are put together in concert, such that you're not dependent upon the next promotion or the next deal that you do.

And it's the order-taking time that's slightly up, but we  will be seeing benefits in the cash taking time as a result of this as we become a more digitally penetrated system. I think that the momentum in the system is going to build in the coming months as we set up for our launch later this summer."

Relative to market share, especially on traffic, it's proven very challenging to read exactly what's going on within the industry because you're seeing shifts of all kind that was early in the pandemic, the shift away from the breakfast daypart and toward the dinner day part. You've also seen, obviously, a substantial increase in average check as you have more people per transaction who are actually eating off of that transaction. We feel very good about our competitive position and where we are relative to our key competitors. And when we look at our own 2-year comp stack and the fact that we're putting up the kind of growth numbers we are versus 2019, we feel good about our position. 
And I'll let Kevin talk specifically about some of the tech investments. But when you think about McDonald's U.S.A. having digital sales of 1.5 -- almost $1.5 billion in the first quarter. And the fact that we've got 20 million active app users, I think we feel really good about the way we've set up in the U.S. ourselves to really benefit from these investments and to make these multiyear gains that I've talked about."

The markets that are at pre-COVID levels and have been able to continue growing sales are able to continue growing margins similar to how they were pre-COVID. So to us, it is, as I say, a matter of time to a certain extent. We expect, as restrictions ease, as curfews go away, and we're able to reopen dining rooms. Those are the biggest things that need to happen specifically in a few of our large markets like France and Germany, for example. But there isn't anything structural that is preventing us from getting back to our historic levels of company-operated margins in those.

So to the degree that You see delivery remain an elevated part of the ticket to the degree that you see drive-thru continue to perform. Those are going to have a positive impact on ticket and a somewhat negative impact on traffic just because of the bundled nature of those channels. So I think it's difficult to say broadly how that's going to play out. But we are seeing overall that some of the changes that happened with consumers through this pandemic like doing more delivery, like going through drive-thru that those we expect are going to be enduring.

It was a year ago this week that we had our first earnings call of the COVID-19 pandemic. We had just begun to experience the closings, openings and constantly changing regulations that would come to define the",1366,"Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. 
It was a year ago this week that we had our first earnings call of the COVID-19 pandemic. We had just begun to experience the closings, openings and constantly changing regulations that would come to define the past year. I said then that in the face of such enormous challenges, I was immensely proud of the entire McDonald's system. Franchisees, crew members, suppliers and company employees banded together and continued to feed in foster communities amidst unprecedented change and disruption. My pride has only grown since then. 
Through the pandemic, we've seen the power of the McDonald's system and our franchise model at work. We are one of the world's most global corporation, but also one of the most local, serving tens of millions of customers each day across almost 40,000 local restaurants. That's our secret sauce. And it's hard to imagine how we would have adapted to the constantly changing circumstances of the past year if we were not a locally owned, locally managed system, rooted in the communities where we operate.  
That ability to adapt enabled us to build a system playbook that tapped into our operating prowess and synthesized learnings from individual markets. We put our customers and people first, and found ways to ensure their safety and security amidst a global health crisis. We leaned into our historical strengths like our core menu and drive-thru to continue serving our communities, creating feel-good moments that were more welcome and needed than ever.  
At the same time, we kept innovating in areas like digital and delivery to offer customers new ways to safely connect with our brand and deepen our ability to meet their personalized needs. And we used our marketing muscle to keep the golden arches shining brightly, reminding people of their enduring trust in our brand and our purpose to feed and foster communities. 
Importantly, we did it all with a commitment to transparency. Every step of the way, we gave our stakeholders a clear sense of what we were doing and why we were doing it. That communication was made easier by our refreshed values that captured the essence of the McDonald's system and how we operate. No matter where you are in the world, our McDonald's values serve as the glue that unites us and guides our every decision. We put our people and customers first. We open our doors to everyone. We do the right thing. We're good neighbors, and we get better together. Five simple statements that capture the essence of the company Ray Kroc founded over 65 years ago. 
Our renewed focus on these values has kicked off a virtuous cycle, energizing our workforce and attracting new leaders who embody these qualities and are inspired by our purpose. That includes Desiree Ralls-Morrison, who joined the team earlier this week as our new General Counsel.  
Turning to our business performance. Despite resurgences and continued operating restrictions in many parts of the world, I'm pleased to share that in the first quarter, global comp sales and revenues have already surpassed Q1 2019 levels. Not surprisingly, we expect McDonald's to deliver strong global comp sales and revenue growth against 2019 levels for the full year, reflecting the strength of our business and the pent-up customer demand we're seeing as markets reopen. 
Specifically in Q1, global comp sales for the quarter were up 7.5%, with each of our segments achieving positive comp sales. As we will hear in a moment from our U.S. segment President, Joe Erlinger, That improvement was largely driven by the U.S., with comp sales up 13.6% for the quarter.  
In Europe, we continue to face a tough operating environment, which is impacting recovery across some of our top markets in the IOM segment. Kevin will talk about our international performance in a minute. 
We remain laser-focused on achieving the sustainable growth plan laid out in Accelerating the Arches. Likewise, our 3 growth pillars, M, C and D, continue to serve as both a guide and an engine for our path forward. We are maximizing our marketing to stay relevant and find those connection points with customers that will pay off in a big way. We're also committing to our core menu, making the chicken, burgers and coffee our customers love even more delicious.  In a moment, Joe will talk about the successful launch of the new Crispy Chicken Sandwich. 
Finally, we're doubling down on digital, delivery and drive-thru. We're creating a faster, easier, better customer experience. However, our customers want to interact with us, whether at the counter, through drive-thru window or on the app, dining in the restaurant or having that meal delivered to them. We will offer experiences they love and that we believe will keep them coming back. 
Over the past 4 years, we went from just over 3,000 restaurants offering delivery to now more than 30,000 restaurants for 75% of our global footprint. We're excited about our success with multiple 3PL partners, and we continue to innovate. That includes testing self-delivery models in select markets and identifying ways to improve restaurant operations for delivery so that the customer experience will get better and better.  
Drive-thru made McDonald's what it is today. The drive-thrus in 25,000 of our restaurants worldwide are a huge part of who we are and why we've been able to continue safely serving millions of customers each day this past year. And since the pandemic began, We've leaned into this competitive advantage by continuing to improve drive-thru service times by putting more emphasis on operations and reducing menu complexity. We also see digital as an important channel to improve speed and convenience, provide customers with more personalization and offer even better value. We have 40 million active app users in just our top 6 markets and millions more around the world. Our goal is to make sure that no matter how customers interact with us, they have a seamless and consistently enjoyable experience. 
One key lever in reaching our digital ambition is loyalty.  In addition to France and a few other markets, which already have loyalty, we are currently piloting our new loyalty program, My McDonald's Rewards, in the U.S. and Germany, with plan to deploy later this year. What inspires me the most about our digital transformation is that we constantly have the opportunity and ability to become even more relevant in our customers' everyday routines. 
The power of our growth pillars come to life, not in isolation but in combination. The success of our famous orders program is a great example of how the 3 pillars, our M, C and D, are deeply interconnected, reinforcing and bolstering one another. And last week's announcement that we're partnering with super group, BTS, from South Korea to offer fans in nearly 50 countries their favorite McDonald's order, shines a powerful light on a simple truth: in every country where we operate from every walk of life and in almost every stage of life, you have your go-to McDonald's order.  
This is much more than your traditional promotional partnership. For one, it will harness the scale of McDonald's and the relevance of authentic fans like BTS. I think it's fair to say that few other brands have the cultural relevance and global appeal to pull off this kind of partnership. That's the power of brand McDonald's. Famous Orders takes that universal insight of everyone's unique go-to McDonald's order, celebrates our fans love of the core menu and brings it to life through digital activations. The BTS ARMY will soon experience the M, the C and the D of our plan in a way that authentically taps into their love of these 2 global icons.  
And it doesn't stop there. Whether it's through successful traffic-generating promotions like digital calendars in Australia or Germany, building on the strength of core equities with line extensions like Katsu Curry Chicken McNuggets and Grand Big Mac in the U.K., we're piloting the My McDonald's Reward loyalty program. We continue to deepen our connection with customers and create a consistent and enjoyable experience. 
Let's turn it over to Joe to tell us what that experience is looking like in the U.S. Joe?"

Our U.S. business ended 2020 in a position of strength and that carried into the first quarter, delivering a 13.6% comp sales increase with double-digit positive comps across all dayparts. We exited Q1 with historically high average daily sales volumes and the record high operating cash flow our franchisees experienced in 2020 continued in Q1. While we have seen some benefit from consumers receiving government stimulus checks during the first quarter, our results are truly a testament to the hard work happening each day in our restaurants. 
I've recently been in our restaurants in Maine and Massachusetts, and you can feel the energy and excitement. Our franchisees and importantly, their restaurant teams are focused on keeping our crew and customers safe. In addition, they are delivering gold standard execution, especially around chicken and the 3Ds, and this has led to higher customer satisfaction scores. I want to give a special thank you to our owner operators and restaurant teams for all they've done during extremely challenging times. 
Our growth plans in the U.S. are rooted in the Accelerating the Arches strategy and focused on the MCD framework. As for our results, the quarterly performance is a product of the accumulation of what we've done over the past 12 months and not because of any one action we took during a quarter or a 4-week marketing window. The values and brand-based decisions we've made, along with simplifying our menus, strengthening our digital business and recommitting to our core are having a multiplier effect. I've seen this recipe for success in several markets during my time overseas, and I'm confident that the right pieces are in place for our U.S. business to sustain results.  
Let me pull back the lens and give you some examples. Driving customer visits begins with committing to the core menu. Early in the pandemic, the U.S. business removed dozens of menu items. As a result of this focus, our drive-thrus got faster, margins grew and customer satisfaction improved. Put simply, our restaurants became easier to run and more profitable. Reducing complexity set the stage for the right investments in the core beginning last fall with Spicy Chicken McNuggets, which we brought back for a limited time in February. They drove customer excitement and comp sales growth during the quarter. Then in late February, we introduced our Crispy Chicken Sandwich line of 3 delicious new sandwiches, the beginning of our multiyear chicken journey.  
While the category is very competitive, we are so far exceeding our projections. We are selling substantially more chicken sandwiches compared to our previous chicken sandwich line and seeing strong unit movement, especially after 4:00 p.m. Our success is a demonstration of McDonald's at its best, with all 3 legs of the stool working together. First, we developed the platform and built the supply chain. We then align the system around the opportunity. And finally, we created engaging and exciting marketing, PR and social media plans nationally and across our 10 field offices. Today, we're learning from each other and working to transfer the success we're seeing in our top restaurants to all restaurants. We expect to refresh and sustain this platform and do so in a very culturally relevant way throughout the rest of 2021.  
At the same time, we doubled down on the 3Ds: digital, delivery and drive-thru. With COVID as the catalyst for a consumer behavior shift, we experienced an absolute surge in off-premise dining. We drove our digital sales mix and app usage. In the first quarter, we had nearly $1.5 billion in digital sales, which includes app, kiosks and delivery. And we now have over 20 million active app users with loyalty yet to come. We grew delivery to an all-time high in dollars and sales mix, and we continued to reduce overall experience times, especially impressive given the increased volume of business we'd experienced through the drive-thru.  
Chris mentioned the Famous Orders platform earlier. Nothing had a greater impact on our digital business than the introduction of this program last year. We've retained many of the digital customers acquired during those famous order promotions, and the U.S. business is very excited about the upcoming BTS meal, which continues to maximize our digital investments without adding any restaurant complexity. And with that foundation, we are well positioned heading into our loyalty program launch later this summer. 
When we built My McDonald's Rewards, our goal was to create a platform that elevated our brand, excited our customers and engaged our crew, and we did just that. In our 2 test-and-learn markets, Phoenix and New England, we're encouraged by the initial results. User adoption, as measured by guests ordering through the app, are up significantly since the test began. Frequency has increased. In fact, our loyalty customers are far more likely to return in the next 30 days compared to nonloyalty customers.  
And customer satisfaction is up. Customers love the personalized experience of being greeted by their first name. We've received overwhelmingly positive feedback from restaurant crew, not only on the program itself, but the ways in which we've trained them, for example, using digital simulations. Of course, as in any test, we've captured many learnings around training, operations and deployment that will help us maximize the impact when we launch this nationally.  
As I close, I want to reiterate that there is not one single reason for our success. The accumulation of our decisions, grounded in our values, returned the U.S. business to a place of brand relevancy for our customers and meaning for our people and has provided us a strong foundation towards sustained business growth. 
And now I'll turn it over to Kevin to talk about our international performance and our financial results."
139488,710028585,2262711,"McDonald's Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 29, 2021",2021-04-29,"Earnings Calls","McDonald's Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Joe.

As Chris mentioned earlier, global comp sales and revenues for the quarter surpassed Q1 2019 pre-pandemic levels, largely driven by the U.S. For the quarter, global comp sales increased 7.5% with growth across all segments, and comps were up significantly in March as we started to lap the impact of COVID-19.  
In the IOM segment, comp sales were up 60 basis points in Q1. With widespread resurgences and ongoing government restrictions across Europe, including dining room closures and reduced operating hours, the segment has not fully recovered to pre-COVID levels. As a result of the restrictions, we saw varied performance across the markets. 
Strong results continued in Australia as customer mobility has mostly recovered and the country remains nearly COVID-free. The market benefited from sales of their new chicken line along with successful LTO line extensions on core burgers. And average check has continued to hold up with sustained growth in delivery and drive-thru sales and a shift into more core and premium menu items.  
Comp sales were positive for the U.K. and Canada for the quarter and surpassed 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Despite U.K.'s national stay-at-home order for nearly all of Q1 and Canada's recent surge in COVID infections, both markets have successfully leveraged the competitive advantages of our 3Ds to grow sales. 
And in France and Germany, comps were negative for the quarter, as dining rooms were closed and curfews were in place. Government restrictions are expected to ease somewhat in Q2, but we don't expect these markets to recover to pre-COVID sales levels until later in the year.  
Comp sales in the IDL segment were up 6.4% for the quarter, with growth across nearly all geographies. Performance was largely driven by positive results in China and Japan. In China, comps were up significantly for the quarter as we comped over COVID impacts from February and March last year. By leveraging their large digital members base, China ran compelling digital offers, contributing to results for the quarter as they continue on the path to recovery. In addition, China opened 150 new restaurants in Q1, keeping on pace to open nearly 500 new restaurants this year. Japan maintained momentum in Q1 with comps up 9%, and that's on top of over 5% growth last year as a strong balance of core, value and family-related promotions resonated with customers.  
Looking ahead to Q2, we expect the U.S. to continue to outpace 2019 with 2-year comp sales growth relatively in line with Q1. 
In the IOM segment, we expect the 2-year growth rate to improve over Q1, but the segment will likely continue to lag 2019 until the second half of the year. Given our strong start to the year, we now expect full year system-wide sales growth in the mid-teens in constant currencies. But we continue to see pandemic-related stops and starts in markets around the world, impacting customer behavior and our business. So there's still some uncertainty.  
Turning to earnings. Adjusted earnings per share in Q1 was $1.92, up 27% in constant currencies. And adjusted operating margin was 41.9%, reflecting improved sales performance, higher other operating income and lower G&A costs compared to last year. 
Total restaurant margin dollars increased 10% in constant currencies, with improvement in both franchise and company-operated restaurant margins. Franchise margin dollars grew by over $170 million in constant currencies, mostly from the strong sales performance in the U.S. And company-operated margins in the U.S. were strong, as we continue to see top line growth driven from higher average check. As I mentioned last quarter, we expect the U.S. margins to moderate somewhat as check growth tempers and we reopen dining rooms.  
In the IOM segment, company-operated margins improved in Q1. With the ongoing impact of COVID on the segment, we don't expect to get back to full year pre-COVID margin levels this year. This is a result of near-term sales and cost pressures, but there's nothing structural to prevent us from returning to pre-COVID margins longer term.  
Turning to G&A. Chris and Joe both talked about the contributions from digital on our results, and we continue to invest in this important area to fuel growth. For the quarter, G&A was down 6% in constant currencies due to some onetime costs we incurred in the first quarter last year. As a result of our strong start to the year, we're now expecting higher incentive-based compensation. So for the full year, we expect G&A to be about 2.4% of system-wide sales. Because this increase to incentive-based comp just relates to current year performance, It will only impact this year's G&A.  
Our effective tax rate was 21.3% for the quarter, and we're still projecting a full year rate in the range of 21% to 23%, with some fluctuation across the quarters. 
And finally, foreign currency translation benefited Q1 results by $0.06 per share. Based on current exchange rates, we expect FX to benefit EPS by about $0.10 for Q2 with an estimated full year tailwind of $0.24 to $0.26. As usual, this is directional guidance only as rates will likely change as we move through the year. 
I'm pleased with our global recovery to date, even as we face resurgence of restricted operations around the world. And I'm confident that our Accelerating the Arches strategy will continue to drive growth in the business. 
Now I'll turn it back to Chris."

I want to close by saying once again how proud I am of everything our system has accomplished and continues to do amidst such difficult circumstances. If last year was about defining who we are, what we stand for and where we're going, this year is about execution and how we're going to get there.  
Every year, we check in with our staff to get their feedback on the work that's happening. In our latest survey results received last week, almost 90% of employees expressed strong confidence in our business. And just as importantly, they agreed that we were abiding by each of our core values. And just a few weeks ago, we held our Annual Leadership Summit, virtually bringing together our top 50 field and corporate leaders. Across each of our markets and amongst this leadership group, there was strong alignment against our Accelerating the Arches strategy and univesal recognition that our continues success depends on great execution.  
Back in November at our Investor Day, I said that distinctions between the corporate brand and the consumer brand are blurring. They are now two sides of the same coin, and you can't build an inclusive, family-focused global consumer brand like McDonald's unless the corporation's actions give evidence to those attributes. That's why in February, we set 5- and 10-year goals for increasing diversity and leadership across our corporation. 
Research has shown that businesses that prioritize DEI recruit and retain stronger talent, unlock greater innovative potential and bolster financial performance. And we're committed to making measurable progress in disclosing representation data to hold ourselves accountable for results by tying a portion of executive compensation to making progress in this area.  
Earlier this month, we also shared global brand standards designed to reinforce a culture of safety and inclusion. We want employees and customers to feel safe and protected. And it's critically important to be clear that violence, harassment and discrimination of any kind is not tolerated. All 39,000 McDonald's restaurants across the globe, including company-owned and franchised locations will be required to uphold these standards. We're continuing to put resources and tools in place to help restaurants implement these changes and ensure these standards are met. Beginning in January 2022, restaurants will be assessed in accordance with the applicable McDonald's market business evaluation processes. 
We understand that the way we show up in our communities and four stakeholders impacts the way customers see us and their trust in us. We have to make sure our values are the lived experience of everyone who interacts with our brand. We've seen powerful examples of service and dedication on display across the McDonald's system during the most difficult year we've ever experienced. Around the world, our people have embodied the belief that we must all pitch in and help one another. They take pride in that, and they should.  
While we all remain hopeful that this will be a year when life begins to return to some version of normal, we know the operating environment remains volatile. We expect that there will be stops and starts that impact results. But as we see, even during the most difficult moments last year, delicious feel-good moments from McDonald's remain high in demand. 
We will continue to lean forward and make bold bets in our future. I believe more strongly than ever, as I said in November, that this is the start of something new for McDonald's. As we continue to accelerate the arches, lead with our values and serve our customers and communities, I look forward to seeing what the McFamily can accomplish in the months ahead. And I look forward to seeing our global system come together in person next April in Orlando for our Global 2022 Worldwide Convention. 
And with that, we'll begin Q&A."

I think you have to break it into kind of the -- each of the big markets there. And it varies. 
In the case of the U.K., we're seeing the U.K. consumer is quite strong. That business is performing well. Markets that are heavily tourist dependent, however, like Spain, Italy, France, those markets are struggling. And so I think for us, part of what we believe is that this summer, we do think that many of the European markets are going to start opening up. There's been some commentary about perhaps a vaccine passport that allows for travel within the European market. That, I think, will have a big impact and help on stimulating those markets that maybe have had a little bit more of a headwind. 
And then I think for us, the key is about also getting the dining rooms open. Our dining rooms are closed in about 50% of our restaurants in Europe. As you know, dining rooms or dine-in is a big part of our European business. And so getting those open, I think, will be another important step for us in getting momentum back into the European business. 
But from a consumer standpoint, in terms of just the outlook, I think it's probably best described as being concerned about and anxious about many of the things that are coming with COVID. But I think, also, there's pent-up demand that we've seen when we do -- when we are able to get a market open or even last year when we had some reopenings that then resulted in closures not too long thereafter as the second and third wave came about that there's nothing that gives us any concern that as we reopen that we're going to see the same pent-up demand come back and get the European business moving forward."

And just kind of building on that. Just Joe, you kind of talked, I think, about the U.S. relative maybe to some other really strong countries internationally. Just wondering if you could draw some parallels there for the potential for kind of multiyear period of outperformance in this U.S. business maybe the way you have with some of the other really strong countries outside of the U.S. historically?"

I mean there's no question that as you think back to the initial onset of the pandemic, there was the surge in off-premise dining. And we were set up incredibly well given the investments that we've made historically in digital delivery and drive-thru within the U.S. business to succeed in that environment. And that's exactly obviously what we've done. Beyond that though, obviously, we've made some great investments in chicken, great investments in the core that have begun to really set us up well for the future. And we continue to have our prowess around value. 
As you begin to look forward, we think there's no question that the consumer is going to want to come back into dining rooms. Chris has already mentioned it in Europe, but we think it's the case in the U.S. as well. And so we will continue to open our dining rooms, but we want to do it in a way that really drive sales and make it an event almost as we reopen our dining rooms. Because with 90% plus of our business being through the drive-thru, if we can sustain that and return our dining rooms and take-away to the levels that they were pre pandemic, we've set ourselves up for a very good run here. 
In terms of parallels between the U.S. business and other successful markets overseas, it's never one lever, Dennis. It's always a combination of things that are put together in concert, such that you're not dependent upon the next promotion or the next deal that you do. And this is this idea of underlying baseline momentum. And so we're feeling the benefits of that underlying baseline momentum in the U.S. that I saw in many international markets as they set themselves up for multiyear runs. And I think that's where we are."

And that's always been one of the hallmarks of our system, when we can take a best practice from one restaurant and try to get it to all restaurants, it yields real benefits. 
Interestingly, we are faring a bit better in our company-owned restaurants, as Chris mentioned. We have higher crew sizes overall than the average franchisee. We recognize that we need to continue to stay a little bit ahead of things on this topic.

And when you think about the impact that this could have on the U.S. business where 85% plus of the U.S. population actually comes to McDonald's at least one time a year. And so if loyalty can build frequency, given the base that we have of customers in the U.S., this is just a tremendous unlock for us. 
Relative to the operations -- operational impact. There -- -- it is having a modest impact in our drive-thrus. We've trained our people really well. The training that's actually happening is really around the customer side. And it's the order-taking time that's slightly up, but we will be seeing benefits in the cash taking time as a result of this as we become a more digitally penetrated system.

So it wasn't all a lap of the pandemic negatives at the breakfast daypart. And obviously, part of that is because of our historical strength in this daypart. Part of that is because the importance of drive-thru speed, especially at breakfast, is important. And part of that is some of the menu item moves that we've made around offering McCafé bakery I think have also set us up well for the breakfast daypart. 
We're acutely focused on this daypart because we believe that certainly, as some consumer habits return to pre-pandemic -- to pre-pandemic ways of life that the breakfast daypart will continue to come back. And similar to the way that it was a real market share gain -- market share battle pre pandemic, we think that market share battle will absolutely continue, and we're ready and prepared for that."

And I was wondering if that could be applied to the U.S. as well. In other words, when traffic recovery, I guess at this point is an inevitability, can you maintain that average ticket, which I think has been the primary driver of comps over the past 12 months is the first question. 
And then second, and I think related to that, is related to that. What's different about the Chicken Sandwich this time? Obviously, we've seen over the last 20 years, a number of different core and premium your chicken sandwiches strips, what have you that have kind of come gone from the McDonald's menu. What gives you the confidence this time that it becomes not only something that you can sustain that you can grow upon?"

I think on the ticket, we have seen it in a number of markets that have been able to kind of weather the pandemic with Australia being one that has done particularly well through that, but Japan, another one, that ticket levels do stay elevated. I think a big function of this becomes to what degree does the channel mix revert back to what we saw pre pandemic or stay elevated? 
So to the degree that you see delivery remain an elevated part of the ticket, to the degree that you see drive-thru continue to perform. Those are going to have a positive impact on ticket and a somewhat negative impact on traffic just because of the bundled nature of those channels. 
So I think it's difficult to say broadly how that's going to play out. But we are seeing overall that some of the changes that happened with consumers through this pandemic, like doing more delivery, like going through drive-thru, that those, we expect, are going to be enduring. So I think it's probably fair to say that ticket is going to be a driver for us coming out of the pandemic.

I know and I absolutely acknowledge, John, that we've had many ins and outs of chicken sandwiches over the years. But I think we did our research.

I also think that we've done a good job of tapping more significantly into trends with our spicy offering as part of the chicken line. And I think our increasing focus on multicultural youth also is contributing to our success here. 
Whenever you launch a product at McDonald's, you launch and then you have a decay curve. And I feel very confident about this because the decay curve on our Chicken Sandwich is dramatically different than what we've seen in past years. We're 2 months past the initial launch of late February. And we still feel really good about the volume and unit movement that we're seeing."

And so one of the things that Joe and the team did, I think, went really well in the U.S. is leveraging the other aspects of our chicken portfolio. We had nuggets that ran in front of then the Chicken Sandwich launch. And using sort of everything in our arsenal there to drive chicken is going to be one of the things that I think is different this time.

Well, so I think one of the things that we were delighted to see with our first Famous Order and Travis Scott was just the huge digital uptake that, that drove on the business. Joe might know the exact number of downloads that we saw in the U.S. But I mean, it was a phenomenal driver of digital engagement for us in the platform. 
And going forward, I think, for us, that's continuing to use Famous Orders as a way to drive digital engagement. The consumer that was drawn to these sorts of celebrities is inherently a digital-first consumer. And so it's natural that they're going to want to interface and interact with our brand in a digital-first manner. So that going forward is going to be a key part of our strategy. 
On social media, I think you've seen -- we have gotten, I think, a little bit more nimble and consumer-centric in our social media approach. It doesn't read anymore like a corporate website that's being populated maybe by the CEO. It's actually being written by people with a sense of humor and that are fun to listen to, which is what our brand is about. I mean, our brand is meant to be an engaging, fun, youthful brand. And so having voices that are running our social media campaign on a day-to-day basis, I think you're seeing the benefit of that. 
And I think for us, it's about making sure though that we also do it in a way that feels authentic to McDonald's. I think some of the others out there maybe like to veer a little bit more into the snarky territory. We try to be a brand that leads with a really positive message and is one focused on McDonald's, and we're seeing great engagement from that. So I appreciate you mentioning that, and I promise I will stay off social media with the corporate website."

At the heart of McDonald's is the experience we offer. And for 65 years, we've created iconic experiences for billions of people around the world.

And for 65 years, we've created iconic experiences for billions of people around the world. Along the way, we've always focused on following our customers' needs, finding the most convenient and engaging ways for them to enjoy McDonald's. 
At our founding, the restaurant experience was relatively simple. Customers would walk up to the front counter; place their orders; and get hot, delicious fresh food served to them quickly. In the early 1970s, McDonald's pioneered the drive-thru as a new service channel for customers. And in the last few years, we've added even more service channels with delivery, curbside pickup, kiosks and table service. At the heart of each of these innovations was our global mobile app, which has evolved our customer experience from the physical world to the digital world. As this evolution continues, our digital offerings will become even more important to serving, interacting with and delighting our customers around the world, and the insights generated from these platforms will help us further improve their experience. Our marketing power and scale will continue to be critical throughout this journey, turning the various customer touch points into a holistic and compelling brand experience. But our aspirations are even higher. And to reach these goals, we need to create a more frictionless customer experience across all our service channels. Our customers should be able to move seamlessly between the in-store, takeaway and delivery service channels so that we offer even more convenience and better personalization. 
That's why we were excited to announce earlier this week the creation of a team that has oversight for the end-to-end customer experience under the leadership of our first Chief Customer Officer of McDonald's history, Manu Starjard. Manu will oversee everything from the physical restaurants that we design and build to the digital experiences that we embed along each step of the customer journey. As we finished the global rollout of EOTF, Manu and his team will now be focused on what's next to drive a new layer of sustained growth for our system that leverages the foundations that we've built. 
For the past 18 months, our digital customer engagement, global marketing, data analytics and restaurant solutions teams have worked to standardize our infrastructure and align the system against some common frameworks. These efforts ultimately pave the way for My McDonald's Reward, our first global digital offering that we are now deploying across our largest markets. My McDonald's Reward is just a first example of how we will lead as a digital innovator by leveraging our scale and engaging with our customers in a truly integrated way. Manu is the ideal choice to integrate these teams and take their work to the next level, with an intense focus on driving incomparable customer-centric innovation. He's been an important part of the McDonald's system for more than 20 years at every level. Manu knows these teams well and has an incredibly deep understanding of the needs of our customers. [ One Rudin ] his early experience as a crew member in his parent's McDonald's franchise in his native, Belgium. 
We believe that connecting these teams will enable us to deliver the seamless omnichannel experience that our customers want and only McDonald's can provide, transforming the way customers connect with, interact with and experience our brand. 
Further strengthening our ways of working to better serve our customers is one of many ways we're working to accelerate the arches today. This complements the work underway to accelerate the arches with investments in customer-centric creative marketing that only McDonald's can offer so fully. That marketing made a measurable impact in the second quarter with the global debut of our incredibly successful Famous Orders marketing platform. I'll have more to say about that a bit later. 
We're accelerating the arches by committing to our core menu. We're tapping into customer demand for the familiar and making the chicken, burgers and coffee our customers love even more delicious. We're borrowing from what has worked well in other markets like the growing success of the McSpicy Chicken Sandwich. McSpicy launched in China over 20 years ago, and customers can now enjoy this great-tasting sandwich in multiple markets around the world. 
Late last year, we launched McSpicy in Australia as part of their new chicken sandwich lineup. And earlier this month, it debuted in the U.K. to great fanfare. 
We also continue to leverage our familiar favorites and create new ones to make our menu even more craveable. In the U.S., the momentum from the successful launch of our Crispy Chicken Sandwich continued into the second quarter as we supported the platform with culturally relevant advertising, just one more way that our beloved core menu continues to drive growth while anchoring a customer experience that is second to none. 
We also know that the customer experience today reaches beyond the physical walls of our restaurants. And that's why we're accelerating the arches to better serve our digitally connected customers. To give you a sense of the growing digital connection we have to our customers, we have the most downloaded QSR app in the United States. And earlier this month, we were proud to launch our new loyalty program, My McDonald's Rewards in the U.S. The loyalty of every McDonald's fans has been unmatched for 65 years. And with these new digital connections, we're able to do an even better job of rewarding them for it. We already have over 22 million active My McDonald's users in the U.S., with over 12 million enrolled in our new loyalty program, My McDonald's Rewards. And that's before national advertising for loyalty, which began earlier this week. Well, it is a good example of how our core menu and personalized marketing come together through digital channels to build a stronger relationship with our customers. 
Our digital system-wide sales across our top 6 markets were nearly $8 billion in the first half of 2021, a 70% increase versus last year. And that's why we're moving aggressively to bring My McDonald's Rewards to our top 6 markets. We currently have loyalty programs in place in France and the U.S. Germany and Canada plan to launch My McDonald's Rewards before the end of this year, followed by the U.K. and Australia in 2022. 
We're just as excited about our drive-thrus through which much of our business has come from this year and about delivery. Over 80% of our restaurants across 100 markets globally now offer delivery. We're excited about our success with multiple 3PO partners. And as I said last quarter, we continue to innovate. 
Overall, our recent successes show that our M, C and D growth pillars working in concert can deliver unmatchable experiences for our customers and drive growth unlike anything else in customer retail. Of course, our work to accelerate the arches is built on the foundation of the very core of McDonald's success: running great restaurants. As we open our dining rooms, return to regular hours and get back to full staffing, we know that world-class execution will be more important than ever. 
While the Delta variant has brought more stops and starts to the COVID story around the world, people are venturing out and establishing new routines. That includes a return to in-person dining. Today, about 70% of our dining rooms in the U.S. are open. By Labor Day, barring resurgences, it will be nearly 100%. Internationally, the majority of our restaurants are now operating all channels, including dine-in, but many continue to operate with limited hours or restricted capacity. We're working hard to get back to normal. When our customers are ready to come back to dining in our restaurants, we will be more than ready and eager to welcome them. Not only are we more resilient today than we were heading into the pandemic, as Kevin will tell you, we are building from a position of strength. Kevin?"

I'm pleased to share that global comp sales were up 40% in the second quarter or 7% on a 2-year basis. Our performance is continued demonstration of the broad-based strength and resiliency of our business. We've surpassed 2019 sales levels for the second consecutive quarter and now at an accelerated rate. 
Turning to the segment performance for the quarter. We grew comp sales across all segments versus 2019 levels as business recovery progresses at varying degrees around the world. In the U.S., our momentum continued with Q2 comp sales up 26% or 15% on a 2-year basis, our strongest quarterly 2-year growth in over 15 years. And we saw double-digit positive comps across all dayparts on a 2-year basis, while at the same time, franchisees continue to achieve record high operating cash flow. 
Our performance in the U.S. is the result of an accumulation of decisions that we've made over the last 18 months. This includes bold marketing initiatives, investing in the core menu and strengthening our digital offerings with an underlying focus on running great restaurants. As customers in the U.S. began to venture out more during the second quarter, we continued to see strong average check growth driven by larger order sizes and menu price increases. That's been bolstered by growth in delivery and digital platforms as well as robust menu and marketing programs. This includes an advertising re-hit of our Crispy Chicken Sandwich, which continues to perform at an elevated level and the success of our BTS meal. Both initiatives attracted customers and drove incremental sales in the quarter. 
In our International Operated Markets segment, which has been historically strong, recovery is taking hold. Comp sales were up 75% in the quarter or nearly 3% on a 2-year basis as we lapped the peak in 2020 restaurant closures. Remember, in some cases, full country operations were shut down in Q2 last year due to the pandemic. Although we're continuing to monitor recent resurgences of COVID in countries around the world, Western Europe began to reopen during the quarter, allowing us to bring back indoor dining, still with some restrictions in place. 
IOM segment comp sales began exceeding 2019 levels in May. Strong performance continued in Australia. The market benefited from continued growth in delivery and successful marketing and core menu news, including the BTS Famous Orders and 50th Birthday Big Mac promotion. While Australia produced strong results for the quarter, outbreaks of the COVID-19 Delta variant throughout the country have led to recent lockdowns and reduced customer mobility. Momentum accelerated in both the U.K. and Canada in Q2. In the U.K., the national lockdown ended, and the market reopened dining rooms in mid-May. The market saw record digital engagement with a significant portion of sales coming through digital channels, where customers place delivery orders and [ new ] sell order kiosks as dining rooms reopened. 
Canada benefited from strong marketing activity featuring our core menu, including the BTS Famous Orders meal. In France and Germany, comp sales were still below 2019 levels for the quarter. While some restrictions are still in place, indoor dining reopened for both markets in June, and we've seen steady improvement since then. 
As we look ahead to Q3, we expect comps to surpass pre-pandemic levels across all of our big 5 international markets. The past year has shown us that when markets reopen, customer demand for McDonald's returns quickly. 
Comp sales in the International Developmental Licensed segment were up 32% for the quarter or relatively flat on a 2-year basis. Performance was largely driven by positive results in Brazil, Japan and China. Japan maintained momentum in Q2 with comps up nearly 10%, achieving an impressive 23 consecutive quarters of comp sales growth. The market's performance was driven by strong menu and marketing promotions, delivery growth and our ability to continue serving customers their favorites safely and conveniently throughout state of emergency waves across the country. 
In China, comps were strong for the quarter, but have yet to return to 2019 levels due to COVID resurgences in Southern China, resulting in operating restrictions. The market continues to build its digital member base with a successful My McDonald's app launch and focused delivery expansion in the breakfast and evening dayparts. In addition, China surpassed the [ 4,000 ] restaurant mark in June and is now on pace to open over 500 new restaurants this year. 
Given our slightly quicker recovery, and continued momentum around the world, we now expect full year system-wide sales growth in the mid- to high teens in constant currencies. However, there's still some uncertainty as we continue to see pandemic-related stops and starts in markets around the world, especially now with the Delta variant. 
Now I'll turn it back to Chris."

As we look ahead to the rest of 2021, we're finding ways to capitalize on our strengths. As we've seen, the growth pillars of accelerating the arches are deeply interconnected, reinforcing and in bolstering one another. It is at the intersection of our MCDs that we continue to deepen our connection with customers and create a consistent and enjoyable experience, proving that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, which brings us back to our Famous Orders platform. 
When it launched in the U.S. last year, our goal was to create an ambitious marketing campaign, one that would leverage our customers' favored core menu items, speak to a new generation in authentic ways and increase digital engagement without adding any restaurant complexity, all while positioning us for the longer term. 
The Famous Orders platform was based on a simple idea, but unites all our customers, including famous celebrities, is everyone has their go-to McDonald's order. The Travis Scott, then J. Balvin Famous Orders broke records in the U.S. This quarter, the BTS Famous Order took that ambition global, connecting our marketing, core menu and digital strategies in 50 markets.And it was our first famous order with custom packaging and app exclusive content. It has been to borrow a BTS lyric, Dynamite. We saw significant lifts in McNugget sales and record-breaking levels of social engagement. McDonald's customers and BTS fans all over the globe downloaded our app, ordered Chicken McNuggets with delicious sweet, chile and cajun dipping sauces and posted about it on social media, leading McDonald's to trend #2 on Twitter globally and #1 in the U.S. 
And then the BTS ARMY took it a step further and memorialized the partnership, creating shoes, accessories and frame memorabilia from our packaging. They were so appreciative of the meal that the BTS ARMY went out of their way to prepare snacks for our crew and managers in Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam to support them on launch day. The Famous Order platform is the M, C and D in action. 
Both Famous Orders and My McDonald's Rewards are also reminders of the unrivaled convening power of McDonald's. And this is just the beginning of the digital customer journey at McDonald's. As we create more personal and seamless McDonald's experiences and make it easier for our crew to connect with our customers, we're giving customers multiple reasons to continue to come back to McDonald's. By using digital, we'll also leverage our advantages in value and convenience, daypart and menu breadth and our biggest advantage, our size and scale. 
Now for more on the financial performance in Q2, I'll pass it back to Kevin."

Company operating margins in the U.S. were strong as we continue to see top line growth driven by higher average check. 
In the IOM segment, company operating margins improved significantly in Q2 as sales have recovered to pre-pandemic levels. G&A decreased 1% in constant currencies for the quarter, primarily due to lapping our $160 million incremental marketing investment last year, offset by higher incentive-based compensation and increased spend in restaurant technology. 
Our adjusted effective tax rate was 21.7% for the quarter, and we're projecting the tax rate for the back half of 2021 in the range of 21% to 23%. And finally, foreign currency translation benefited Q2 results by $0.13 per share. Based on current exchange rates, we expect FX to benefit EPS by about $0.03 to $0.05 for Q3, with an estimated full year tailwind of $0.20 to $0.22. As usual, this is directional guidance only as rates will likely change as we move through the year.

It's a remarkable testament to the resiliency of the McDonald's system. But as we turn our focus to the incredible opportunities that lie ahead of us, it's also remind us of where we must go. 
For 65 years, the one unassailable truth about McDonald's is that we get better together. There's a reason why it's one of our core values. Continually finding ways to better ourselves and our system is how we keep our business relevant not just for this generation, but the next. 
How do we get better together today? We get better together by focusing on our people. In this highly competitive market for talent, successful employee recruitment and retention is fundamental to drive growth. That's why in May, we announced a 10% increase in the average hourly wage at our company-owned restaurants in the U.S., with the goal to get to a $15 an hour wage by 2024. 
We get better together through diversity, equity and inclusion. Today, 23% of our U.S.-based suppliers come from diverse backgrounds, more than double the industry average. We have set a goal to increase purchases of goods and services from diverse-owned suppliers by 10% over the next 4 years. That will put us in a position where 1/4 of our U.S. spend is with diverse-owned suppliers by 2025. And we've committed to doubling our national advertising spend with diverse owned media here in the United States between 2021 and 2024. 
We get better together by serving our customers, but also serving a larger purpose in communities across the world. As part of our ongoing efforts to support communities through the pandemic, we recently partnered with the Biden administration to make access to information on vaccines easier for the millions of customers who enjoy McDonald's in the U.S. Our part in the national We Can Do This campaign continues this month with McDonald's Hot McCafe cups, make delivery seal stickers, both of which lead customers to vaccines.gov. 
In Canada, we're doing something similar around This Is Our Shot. It's a national campaign through which McDonald's will supply information in restaurant and drive-thru orders, while supporting a digital campaign to replace vaccine hesitancy with confidence. 
Finally, we get better together through our commitment to our plan. In May of 2014, we were one of the first major corporations of our size to publicly commit to a sustainability framework. We promised that we would report on our progress against our 2020 sustainability goals by the fall of this year. As we prepare to release our impact report, I've never been prouder of the difference we are making in the world. We are working closely with partners across the globe today to source food locally and responsibly to expand our use of sustainable packaging and to power our restaurants with renewable energy sources. It's the ultimate example of our 3-legged tool in action, where owner operators, suppliers and employees each play a critical role in our efforts to protect the planet. We're working every day to set ambitious goals and to hold ourselves accountable to be known not just for what we do as a company, but how we do it  as part of our broader commitment to transparency, and to following clear science-based guidelines from the experts. We know we still have much work to do, but our internal strategy and the external landscape are converging to create a moment unlike any other. 
We are aware of our unique role in the world. We are inspired by all the opportunities that lie ahead. Over the back half of this year, I'm looking forward to getting back into the restaurants around the world and spending more face time with our people. I'm amazed with everything that our system has accomplished over the past 18 months, and we can't wait to write the next great chapter of the McDonald's story together. 
With that, we'll begin Q&A."

When we announced earlier this week the creation of the Chief Customer Officer job, it was with the idea that as we are introducing more service channels, we have an opportunity to design in such a way that it feels like these things all happen at the same time as opposed to, in reality, how they happened, which was kind of one came after the other. So Manu's charter is about making this so that the customer feels that this is a completely seamless experience in the restaurant. 
I think the point that you're raising about a print A is related to it, but it's not central to it. I think we announced, maybe it was about a month or 2 ago, that we were seeing good progress with Apprente. It's in 10 restaurants. But that is going to be a significant effort that takes us a number of years before we're able to deploy that in the U.S. So I wouldn't read or interpret anything around Manu's announcement as related to accelerating Apprente. There is still a lot of heavy lifting associated with getting Apprente ready for deployment across the U.S. and eventually the globe."

It's certainly still a challenging staffing environment, not just in the U.S. We're also seeing in Europe where staffing is challenging, in part because of some of the limitations of movement of people across borders. 
But if you focus on the U.S., while it is a challenge, it's getting better. I don't want to declare by any means that it's easy, but we're certainly seeing some improvement. We're seeing applications have increased pretty significantly. Applications in states that have ended early, the federal stimulus, those have tended to do even better. So I do think that there's evidence that as the federal stimulus rolls off, that you'll see an improvement in the application rate. And I think you're seeing wages go up as well. 
I mean, we have made our announcement. I think broadly, we're seeing wages going up about 5% or so in our U.S. restaurants. And that is also helping improve the situation. 
I would just point out for us in our Macosko restaurants, after we made our announcement back in April, we're getting close to full staffing levels or what we would deem to be kind of our full staffing levels in our McOpCo restaurant. So it is possible the situation is improving. I think the tools and some of the ideas that you're seeing our franchisees out there deploying, whether it's things like free childcare, sign-on bonuses, et cetera, that's the power of the McDonald's system at work and the power of our sort of local franchisees innovating and coming up with ways to ensure that they can staff the restaurants. 
In the short term right now, there is -- there has been a negative impact on staffing and service times. As you may remember, we've improved service times over the last few years by about 30 seconds. More recently, we've seen service times decrease about 3 seconds. So we don't love that. But a big part of it is certainly associated with the staffing challenges in the restaurant, but also the demand that we're seeing in the restaurant. So I'm constructive and positive on the staffing outlook in the back half. I think we're going to continue to make progress, but it certainly is a challenge."

So I think the strategy that we've laid out, the Accelerating the Arches strategy, had 3 growth pillars that for us were going to be multiyear drivers of this. It was going to be the M, which was marketing; the C, which was core menu; and the 3 Ds, digital, delivery and drive-thru. So I don't think you're going to see a deviation from those 3 pillars as being what drives sort of the next layers of growth. I do expect what you will see is that we will see us continuing to find ways within those to move the business forward. 
So starting with the M, famous orders has been a nice idea for us. My challenge to our marketing team here at McDonald's is what's the next great idea. And we think there's certainly more we can do with Famous Orders, but we've got to keep coming up with new ideas from a marketing standpoint. So I think that's going to be something that's on us to deliver. 
With core menu, we are rolling out in a number of markets. We've been rolling out a new way to cook our [ 10-to-1 ] patties. That is delivering hotter and fresher burgers. We're seeing nice lifts in Canada and Australia when we've done that. We call it rapid turnover. We're going to deploy that to the rest of the market as well. I think that's another thing for us. And we're seeing in chicken, certainly, we've had a lot of success with the Chicken Sandwich in the U.S. so far. McSpicy, as I referenced in my opening remarks, that's something that we're taking out. So moving there. 
And then lastly, we're in the early, early stages on digital. And I'm incredibly encouraged by what I'm seeing so far with the loyalty rollout. We're seeing very good customer adoption for us to be at 12 million loyalty users. Before we've even turned on, the advertising is, I think, a great start there and just a testament to customers sort of pent-up demand for this type of offering for us. So there's not any one thing that I would point to, the strategy is still very much intact, and we're going to execute. And you're just going to see us continue to come out with ideas within that, that are going to continue the momentum. Kevin, I don't know if you want to give any kind of outlook about sort of how we think about Q3 and beyond."

So yes, left in the first quarter, I think I said that we expected not to get back to flat yet for the IOM on a 2-year basis. And obviously, to your point, we did better than that. 
Certainly, at the time, one of the things that we're guessing or we're guessing is when each of the markets would reopen based on regulations going on at the time with no end dates or knowing exactly when they'd allow markets to reopen. So some of the markets were able to reopen a little bit earlier than we had originally anticipated, whether that's certain channels or all channels. 
And the other thing that we are seeing is that when we do reopen, business comes back quickly. And so there's certainly a pent-up demand in some of those markets that had shutdowns again primarily in Europe. And so we are seeing when those markets reopen, there's significant demand that's waiting to come back, whether that's through the drive-thru, whether that's in store. 
And as you know, we have a higher percentage of in-restaurant or in-store business in Europe than we do in the U.S. So it was really important to get the dining rooms reopen throughout Europe. And so that demand and reopening plans, I'd say, have gone a little bit better than we were first anticipating in the first quarter. And now our expectation is as long as we don't go backwards on lockdowns again, which obviously is still a little bit of a risk, but assuming that none of the markets go back through lockdowns, we feel good about continuing the momentum than in all of those markets."

And so I think from a G&A standpoint, we're very much, I think, on track with G&A. I do think that there is probably a balance toward maybe getting a little bit more that we outsource versus in-source on that. And it's about, for us, ultimately giving the best customer experience. So it's not for us driven by trying to hit a number per se, but it's about delivering the best customer experience. I think when you can pick best-of-breed suppliers from out there in the industry. Our experience has been that, that does tend to work a little bit better. 
We referenced previously, we do think we'll probably be on the higher end of capital spend from the guidance standpoint just because of a unit growth opportunity out there. And -- but I don't think you're going to see anything that's dramatically different from what we talked about last year.

So none of that has changed really. And then I think as we talked about in the Investor event, we would expect to get leverage certainly on G&A as a percent of sales longer term because what we're seeing on the technology spend is I don't think spend -- the actual spend levels will go down, but I don't expect it to go significantly up either. So we -- as sales grow, certainly, we should get more leverage as a percent of sales. But I think the technology will require a significant amount of ongoing spend going forward, which is why we believe we've got an advantage just from the size and scale aspect."

We typically have that number that we start talking about with franchisees in October. And we certainly hear and recognize some of the challenges that are out there from an inflation standpoint. 
But we also have, as you mentioned in your question, things to our advantage around our size and some of the relationships that we have with our suppliers that we think that there are going to be ways that we can perhaps offset some of that. So I think it's right now a little bit premature to say necessarily that we're going to be in a significant inflationary environment next year. I'm hopeful that we're going to be able to manage that to something that is a little bit more in line with kind of our historical range that we've seen on that. 
We are seeing challenges related to some of the supply chain issues, but it's on the equipment side, particularly. So it's equipment, getting equipment manufactured in Asia, getting that over into markets that maybe have bigger unit growth aspirations. 
We're also seeing the chip shortage as something that's rippling through a little bit on the equipment side. So we are closely monitoring what's happening with equipment and just making sure that we've got the plans in place there because that tends to be a longer lead item on things 
From a pricing standpoint, I would lastly just say the pricing that we've taken this year, roughly around 6% or so, I think, in the U.S., that is about in line, maybe a little bit ahead of where the overall inflation is when you add in the labor inflation with food inflation. So I think our system is being disciplined, and they certainly recognize that we can't get ahead of where the customer is, And we've got to make sure that we stay competitive on pricing."

On margins, I guess, let me start with company margins because I think you guys maybe use those as a proxy for how the franchisees are doing. Certainly, we had very strong company margins in the second quarter here. Some of that being driven by the higher average check. I think as we progress, we expect that to moderate a little bit, one, from the higher wages that just began in the second quarter and will continue, obviously. And two, we think there may be some moderation on the average check, although we haven't seen that yet, but I think we're anticipating average check potentially to come down a little bit. 
From the franchisee side, as I mentioned, they're still -- they still have record operating cash flow through May of this year. They're up over $100,000 in their cash flow over last year. So they certainly have the financial strength to be able to continue to reinvest in the business. And I think in general, on pricing, both we and our franchisees take a more consumer research-based approach than we would have several years ago. And so it's based on consumer research. It looks at local prevailing market conditions. It looks at the competitive set within each area, and then franchisees and the company obviously each make our own pricing decisions after that. But I think overall, we feel pretty good about the margins, but I would expect the U.S. to moderate a little bit from where we were in the second quarter."

And so our ability to actually have the app connect through the drive-thru to be able to have loyalty be embedded in part of the drive-thru experience. 
I think all of these things are part of the vision of these different service channels, different ways of accessing McDonald's, they all have to work kind of seamlessly together on that. And we're seeing good uptick. I mean we had targets around where we wanted to see digital guest counts in restaurants, not just in the U.S. but around the globe. And we are either meeting or exceeding the growth that we're looking for in our digital guest count. 
So the customer is responding. The customer is excited about having a digital relationship with McDonald's, and they see the power of what the app can do for personalizing their experience. So that's what gives me confidence. It's just the numbers that we're seeing as a part of this.

I think what we've shown, though, through the last 18 months is the ability of our system when they're having to deal with different things at the local level for our ability to respond to the system. And I think that's just again goes back to being a franchise business, having local owner operators that are able to kind of make these adjustments and pivots there. 
So again, I'd hate to hazard sort of what's going to happen, where and when and how that impacts us. I think I would just point out again that we've done a pretty good job, I think, of navigating a whole bunch of changes over the last 18 months, and that certainly gives me confidence as we look forward on sort of what the next phase of this looks like. 
From a standpoint of the things that we're talking about and way to deliver value to the franchisees, I think for us, we're certainly not looking at any of these things from the -- through the lens of who gets -- who pays for what and an opportunity to maybe go after anything on the revenue side there from a franchise standpoint because, frankly, we're too far away from any of that. So in Apprente earlier, Apprente is still going to require significant work to go from 10 restaurants to what ends up being hopefully 10,000 restaurants in the U.S. And as you get a better sense of what that might deliver is labor savings, what the cost of that all those things, we need to learn a lot more before we would ever contemplate what that means between the profit split with us and franchisees.

So I'm wondering if you could maybe speak to that and if your experience that improves in the test markets, as you get through a launch phase, that would be helpful as well. And then with regard to McOpCo, your 70% or so of your McOpCo stores are in the IOM. And clearly, that's a market that's just getting going.

The opportunity for us is, as you may remember, at the end of last year, David, when we had our Investor Day, we set an aspiration of getting another 20 seconds or so of speed, improved service time through the drive-thru, and the staffing challenges have slowed some of the trajectory of improvement that we're seeing there. But I certainly expect that we're going to be able to get back on continuing the whittle way at service times. I know that's what all the markets, including the U.S., are focused on.

I don't know that we will get back to pre-COVID margins yet for this year, just because, obviously, first quarter was still obviously pretty low as a lot of them -- a lot of the restaurants were still -- had some restrictions, whether completely shut down or not. 
I do think going forward, there is opportunity to continue growing those international margins, at least back to historical levels and potentially even a little higher because of some of the efficiencies you've talked about as well as average check is still a little bit elevated. And those 2 things combined are helping both the U.S. and our IOM McOpCo. So I do think there's opportunity to potentially, on a global basis, exceed our historical high margins."

And for 65 years, we've created iconic experiences for billions of people around the world. Along the way, we've always focused on following our customers' needs, finding the most convenient and engaging ways for them to enjoy McDonald's.
At our founding, the restaurant experience was relatively simple: Customers would walk up to the front counter, place their orders and get hot, delicious fresh food served to them quickly. In the early 1970s, McDonald's pioneered the drive-thru as a new service channel for customers. And in the last few years, we've added even more service channels with delivery, curbside pickup, kiosks and table service. 
At the heart of each of these innovations was our global mobile app, which has evolved our customer experience from the physical world to the digital world. As this evolution continues, our digital offerings will become even more important to serving, interacting with and delighting our customers around the world, and the insights generated from these platforms will help us further improve their experience. Our marketing power and scale will continue to be critical throughout this journey, turning the various customer touch points into a holistic and compelling brand experience. 
But our aspirations are even higher. And to reach these goals, we need to create a more frictionless customer experience across all our service channels. Our customers should be able to move seamlessly between the in-store, takeaway and delivery service channels so that we offer even more convenience and better personalization. 
That's why we were excited to announce earlier this week the creation of a team that has oversight for the end-to-end customer experience under the leadership of our first Chief Customer Officer in McDonald's history, Manu Steijaert. Manu will oversee everything from the physical restaurants that we design and build to the digital experiences that we embed along each step of the customer journey. As we finished the global rollout of EOTF, Manu and his team will now be focused on what's next to drive a new layer of sustained growth for our system that leverages the foundations that we've built. 
For the past 18 months, our digital customer engagement, global marketing, data analytics and restaurant solutions teams have worked to standardize our infrastructure and align the system against some common frameworks. These efforts ultimately paved the way for MyMcDonald's Rewards, our first global digital offering that we are now deploying across our largest markets. MyMcDonald's Rewards is just the first example of how we will lead as a digital innovator by leveraging our scale and engaging with our customers in a truly integrated way. 
Manu is the ideal choice to integrate these teams and take their work to the next level, with an intense focus on driving incomparable customer-centric innovation. He's been an important part of the McDonald's system for more than 20 years at every level. Manu knows these teams well and has an incredibly deep understanding of the needs of our customers, one rooted in his early experience as a crew member in his parent's McDonald's franchise in his native Belgium. 
We believe that connecting these teams will enable us to deliver the seamless omnichannel experience that our customers want and only McDonald's can provide, transforming the way customers connect with, interact with and experience our brand. 
Further strengthening our ways of working to better serve our customers is one of many ways we're working to accelerate the Arches today. This complements the work underway to accelerate the Arches with investments in customer-centric creative marketing that only McDonald's can offer so fully. That marketing made a measurable impact in the second quarter with the global debut of our incredibly successful Famous Orders marketing platform. I'll have more to say about that a bit later. 
We're accelerating the Arches by committing to our core menu. We're tapping into customer demand for the familiar and making the chicken, burgers and coffee our customers love even more delicious. We're borrowing from what has worked well in other markets like the growing success of the McSpicy Chicken Sandwich. McSpicy launched in China over 20 years ago, and customers can now enjoy this great-tasting sandwich in multiple markets around the world. 
Late last year, we launched McSpicy in Australia as part of their new chicken sandwich lineup. And earlier this month, it debuted in the U.K. to great fanfare. 
We also continue to leverage our familiar favorites and create new ones to make our menu even more craveable. In the U.S., the momentum from the successful launch of our Crispy Chicken Sandwich continued into the second quarter as we supported the platform with culturally relevant advertising, just one more way that our beloved core menu continues to drive growth while anchoring a customer experience that is second to none. 
We also know that the customer experience today reaches beyond the physical walls of our restaurants. And that's why we're accelerating the Arches to better serve our digitally connected customers. To give you a sense of the growing digital connection we have to our customers, we have the most downloaded QSR app in the United States. And earlier this month, we were proud to launch our new loyalty program, MyMcDonald's Rewards, in the U.S. 
The loyalty of every McDonald's fans has been unmatched for 65 years. And with these new digital connections, we're able to do an even better job of rewarding them for it. We already have over 22 million active MyMcDonald's users in the U.S., with over 12 million enrolled in our new loyalty program, MyMcDonald's Rewards. And that's before national advertising for loyalty, which began earlier this week. 
Well, it is a good example of how our core menu and personalized marketing come together through digital channels to build a stronger relationship with our customers. Our digital system-wide sales across our top 6 markets were nearly $8 billion in the first half of 2021, a 70% increase versus last year. And that's why we're moving aggressively to bring MyMcDonald's Rewards to our top 6 markets. 
We currently have loyalty programs in place in France and the U.S. Germany and Canada plan to launch MyMcDonald's Rewards before the end of this year, followed by the U.K. and Australia in 2022. 
We're just as excited about our drive-thrus through which much of our business has come from this year and about delivery. Over 80% of our restaurants across 100 markets globally now offer delivery. We're excited about our success with multiple 3PO partners. And as I said last quarter, we continue to innovate. 
Overall, our recent successes show that our M, C and D growth pillars working in concert can deliver unmatchable experiences for our customers and drive growth unlike anything else in customer retail. 
Of course, our work to accelerate the Arches is built on the foundation of the very core of McDonald's success: running great restaurants. As we open our dining rooms, return to regular hours and get back to full staffing, we know that world-class execution will be more important than ever. 
While the Delta variant has brought more stops and starts to the COVID story around the world, people are venturing out and establishing new routines. That includes a return to in-person dining. Today, about 70% of our dining rooms in the U.S. are open. By Labor Day, barring resurgences, it will be nearly 100%. Internationally, the majority of our restaurants are now operating all channels, including dine-in, but many continue to operate with limited hours or restricted capacity. 
We're working hard to get back to normal. When our customers are ready to come back to dining in our restaurants, we will be more than ready and eager to welcome them. Not only are we more resilient today than we were heading into the pandemic. As Kevin will tell you, we are building from a position of strength. Kevin?"

I'm pleased to share that global comp sales were up 40% in the second quarter or 7% on a 2-year basis. Our performance has continued demonstration of the broad-based strength and resiliency of our business. We've surpassed 2019 sales levels",785,"Thanks, Chris. I'm pleased to share that global comp sales were up 40% in the second quarter or 7% on a 2-year basis. Our performance has continued demonstration of the broad-based strength and resiliency of our business. We've surpassed 2019 sales levels for the second consecutive quarter and now at an accelerated rate. 
Turning to the segment performance for the quarter. We grew comp sales across all segments versus 2019 levels as business recovery progresses at varying degrees around the world. In the U.S. our momentum continued with Q2 comp sales up 26% or 15% on a 2-year basis, our strongest quarterly 2-year growth in over 15 years. And we saw double-digit positive comps across all dayparts on a 2-year basis, while at the same time, franchisees continue to achieve record-high operating cash flow. 
Our performance in the U.S. is the result of an accumulation of decisions that we've made over the last 18 months. This includes bold marketing initiatives, investing in the core menu and strengthening our digital offerings with an underlying focus on running great restaurants. 
As customers in the U.S. began to venture out more during the second quarter, we continued to see strong average check growth driven by larger order sizes and menu price increases. That's been bolstered by growth in delivery and digital platforms as well as robust menu and marketing programs. This includes an advertising re-hit of our Crispy Chicken Sandwich, which continues to perform at an elevated level and the success of our BTS meal. Both initiatives attracted customers and drove incremental sales in the quarter. 
In our International Operated Markets segment, which has been historically strong, recovery is taking hold. Comp sales were up 75% in the quarter or nearly 3% on a 2-year basis as we lapped the peak in 2020 restaurant closures. Remember, in some cases, full country operations were shut down in Q2 last year due to the pandemic. Although we're continuing to monitor recent resurgences of COVID in countries around the world, Western Europe began to reopen during the quarter, allowing us to bring back indoor dining, still with some restrictions in place. IOM segment comp sales began exceeding 2019 levels in May. 
Strong performance continued in Australia. The market benefited from continued growth in delivery and successful marketing and core menu news, including the BTS Famous Orders and 50th Birthday Big Mac promotion. While Australia produced strong results for the quarter, outbreaks of the COVID-19 Delta variant throughout the country have led to recent lockdowns and reduced customer mobility. 
Momentum accelerated in both the U.K. and Canada in Q2. In the U.K., the national lockdown ended, and the market reopened dining rooms in mid-May. The market saw record digital engagement with a significant portion of sales coming through digital channels, where customers place delivery orders and used self-order kiosks as dining rooms reopened. Canada benefited from strong marketing activity featuring our core menu, including the BTS Famous Orders meal. 
In France and Germany, comp sales were still below 2019 levels for the quarter. While some restrictions are still in place, indoor dining reopened for both markets in June, and we've seen steady improvement since then. 
As we look ahead to Q3, we expect comps to surpass pre-pandemic levels across all of our big 5 international markets. The past year has shown us that when markets reopen, customer demand for McDonald's returns quickly. 
Comp sales in the International Developmental Licensed segment were up 32% for the quarter or relatively flat on a 2-year basis. Performance was largely driven by positive results in Brazil, Japan and China. Japan maintained momentum in Q2 with comps up nearly 10%, achieving an impressive 23 consecutive quarters of comp sales growth. The market's performance was driven by strong menu and marketing promotions, delivery growth and our ability to continue serving customers their favorites safely and conveniently throughout state of emergency waves across the country. 
In China, comps were strong for the quarter but have yet to return to 2019 levels due to COVID resurgences in Southern China, resulting in operating restrictions. The market continues to build its digital member base with a successful MyMcDonald's app launch and focused delivery expansion in the breakfast and evening dayparts. In addition, China surpassed the 4,000-restaurant mark in June and is now on pace to open over 500 new restaurants this year. 
Given our slightly quicker recovery and continued momentum around the world, we now expect full year system-wide sales growth in the mid- to high teens in constant currencies. However, there's still some uncertainty as we continue to see pandemic-related stops and starts in markets around the world, especially now with the Delta variant. 
Now I'll turn it back to Chris."

As we look ahead to the rest of 2021, we're finding ways to capitalize on our strengths. As we've seen, the growth pillars of accelerating the Arches are deeply interconnected, reinforcing and bolstering one another. It is at the intersection of our MCD that we continue to deepen our connection with customers and create a consistent and enjoyable experience, proving that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, which brings us back to our Famous Orders platform. 
When it launched in the U.S. last year, our goal was to create an ambitious marketing campaign, one that would leverage our customers' favored core menu items, speak to a new generation in authentic ways and increase digital engagement without adding any restaurant complexity, all while positioning us for the longer term. 
The Famous Orders platform was based on a simple idea but unites all our customers, including famous celebrities, is everyone has their go-to McDonald's order. The Travis Scott then J Balvin Famous Orders broke records in the U.S. This quarter, the BTS Famous Order took that ambition global, connecting our marketing, core menu and digital strategies in 50 markets. And it was our first Famous Order with custom packaging and app-exclusive content. It has been, to borrow a BTS lyric, Dynamite. 
We saw significant lifts in McNuggets sales and record-breaking levels of social engagement. McDonald's customers and BTS fans all over the globe downloaded our app, ordered Chicken McNuggets with delicious sweet chili and cajun dipping sauces and posted about it on social media, leading McDonald's to trend #2 on Twitter globally and #1 in the U.S. 
And then the BTS ARMY took it a step further and memorialized the partnership, creating shoes, accessories and frame memorabilia from our packaging. They were so appreciative of the meal that the BTS ARMY went out of their way to prepare snacks for our crew and managers in Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam to support them on launch day. The Famous Order platform is the M, C and D in action. 
Both Famous Orders and MyMcDonald's Rewards are also reminders of the unrivaled convening power of McDonald's. And this is just the beginning of the digital customer journey at McDonald's. As we create more personal and seamless McDonald's experiences and make it easier for our crew to connect with our customers, we're giving customers multiple reasons to continue to come back to McDonald's. By using digital, we'll also leverage our advantages in value and convenience, daypart and menu breadth and our biggest advantage, our size and scale. 
Now for more on the financial performance in Q2, I'll pass it back to Kevin."

Adjusted earnings per share in Q2 was $2.37, which excludes a gain on the further sale of some of our ownership in McDonald's Japan and a onetime income tax benefit in the U.K. In year-to-date, adjusted operating margin was 43%, reflecting improved sales performance across all segments and higher other operating income compared to last year. 
Total restaurant margin dollars grew $1.3 billion in constant currencies with improvement in both franchised and company-operated restaurant margins, mostly driven by higher comp sales as a result of COVID-19 impact last year. 
Company operating margins in the U.S. were strong as we continue to see top line growth driven by higher average check. In the IOM segment, company operating margins improved significantly in Q2 as sales have recovered to pre-pandemic levels. 
G&A decreased 1% in constant currencies for the quarter, primarily due to lapping our $160 million incremental marketing investment last year, offset by higher incentive-based compensation and increased spend in restaurant technology. 
Our adjusted effective tax rate was 21.7% for the quarter. And we're projecting the tax rate for the back half of 2021 in the range of 21% to 23%. 
And finally, foreign currency translation benefited Q2 results by $0.13 per share. Based on current exchange rates, we expect FX to benefit EPS by about $0.03 to $0.05 for Q3, with an estimated full year tailwind of $0.20 to $0.22. As usual, this is directional guidance only as rates will likely change as we move through the year.

It's a remarkable testament to the resiliency of the McDonald's system. But as we turn our focus to the incredible opportunities that lie ahead of us, it's also reminded us of where we must go. 
For 65 years, the one unassailable truth about McDonald's is that we get better together. There's a reason why it's one of our core values. Continually finding ways to better ourselves and our system is how we keep our business relevant, not just for this generation but the next. 
How do we get better together today? We get better together by focusing on our people. In this highly competitive market for talent, successful employee recruitment and retention is fundamental to drive growth. That's why in May, we announced a 10% increase in the average hourly wage at our company-owned restaurants in the U.S., with the goal to get to a $15 an hour wage by 2024. 
We get better together through diversity, equity and inclusion. Today, 23% of our U.S.-based suppliers come from diverse backgrounds, more than double the industry average. We have set a goal to increase purchases of goods and services from diverse-owned suppliers by 10% over the next 4 years. That will put us in a position where 1/4 of our U.S. spend is with diverse-owned suppliers by 2025. And we've committed to doubling our national advertising spend with diverse-owned media here in the United States between 2021 and 2024. 
We get better together by serving our customers but also serving a larger purpose in communities across the world. As part of our ongoing efforts to support communities through the pandemic, we recently partnered with the Biden administration to make access to information on vaccines easier for the millions of customers who enjoy McDonald's in the U.S. Our part in the national We Can Do This campaign continues this month with McDonald's hot McCafé cups and McDelivery seal stickers, both of which lead customers to vaccines.gov. 
In Canada, we're doing something similar around This Is Our Shot. It's a national campaign through which McDonald's will supply information in restaurant and drive-thru orders, while supporting a digital campaign to replace vaccine hesitancy with confidence. 
Finally, we get better together through our commitment to our planet. In May of 2014, we were one of the first major corporations of our size to publicly commit to a sustainability framework. We promised that we would report on our progress against our 2020 sustainability goals by the fall of this year. 
As we prepare to release our impact report, I've never been prouder of the difference we are making in the world. We are working closely with partners across the globe today to source food locally and responsibly, to expand our use of sustainable packaging and to power our restaurants with renewable energy sources. It's the ultimate example of our 3-legged stool in action, where owner-operators, suppliers and employees each play a critical role in our efforts to protect the planet. 
We're working every day to set ambitious goals and to hold ourselves accountable, to be known not just for what we do as a company but how we do it. It's part of our broader commitment to transparency and to following clear science-based guidelines from the experts. We know we still have much work to do, but our internal strategy and the external landscape are converging to create a moment unlike any other. 
We are aware of our unique role in the world. We are inspired by all the opportunities that lie ahead. Over the back half of this year, I'm looking forward to getting back into the restaurants around the world and spending more face time with our people. I'm amazed with everything that our system has accomplished over the past 18 months, and we can't wait to write the next great chapter of the McDonald's story together. 
With that, we'll begin Q&A."

When we announced earlier this week the creation of the Chief Customer Officer job, it was with the idea that as we are introducing more service channels, we have an opportunity to design in such a way that it feels like these things all happen at the same time as opposed to, in reality, how they happened, which was kind of one came after the other. So Manu's charter is about making this so that the customer feels that this is a completely seamless experience in the restaurant. 
I think the point that you're raising about Apprente is related to it, but it's not central to it. I think we announced, maybe it was about a month or 2 ago, that we were seeing good progress with Apprente. It's in 10 restaurants. But that is going to be a significant effort that takes us a number of years before we're able to deploy that in the U.S. So I wouldn't read or interpret anything around Manu's announcement as related to accelerating Apprente. There is still a lot of heavy lifting associated with getting Apprente ready for deployment across the U.S. and eventually the globe."

It's certainly still a challenging staffing environment, not just in the U.S. We're also seeing in Europe where staffing is challenging, in part because of some of the limitations of movement of people across borders. 
But if you focus on the U.S., while it is a challenge, it's getting better. I don't want to declare by any means that it's easy, but we're certainly seeing some improvement. We're seeing applications have increased pretty significantly. Applications in states that have ended early, the federal stimulus, those have tended to do even better. So I do think that there's evidence that as the federal stimulus rolls off, that you'll see an improvement in the application rate. 
And I think you're seeing wages go up as well. I mean we have made our announcement. I think broadly, we're seeing wages going up about 5% or so in our U.S. restaurants. And that is also helping improve the situation. 
I would just point out for us in our McOpCo restaurant, after we made our announcement back in April, we're getting close to full staffing levels or what we would deem to be kind of our full staffing levels in our McOpCo restaurant. 
So it is possible the situation is improving. I think the tools and some of the ideas that you're seeing our franchisees out there deploying, whether it's things like free childcare, sign-on bonuses, et cetera, that's the power of the McDonald's system at work and the power of our sort of local franchisees innovating and coming up with ways to ensure that they can staff the restaurants. 
In the short term right now, there is -- there has been a negative impact on staffing and service times. As you may remember, we've improved service times over the last few years by about 30 seconds. More recently, we've seen service times decrease about 3 seconds. So we don't love that. But a big part of it is certainly associated with the staffing challenges in the restaurant but also the demand that we're seeing in the restaurant. 
So I'm constructive and positive on the staffing outlook in the back half. I think we're going to continue to make progress, but it certainly is a challenge."

So I think the strategy that we've laid out, the Accelerating the Arches strategy, had 3 growth pillars that for us were going to be multiyear drivers of this. It was going to be the M, which was marketing; the C, which was core menu; and the 3 Ds, digital, delivery and drive-thru. So I don't think you're going to see a deviation from those 3 pillars as being what drives sort of the next layers of growth. I do expect what you will see is that we will see us continuing to find ways within those to move the business forward. 
So starting with the M, Famous Orders has been a nice idea for us. My challenge to our marketing team here at McDonald's is what's the next great idea. And we think there's certainly more we can do with Famous Orders, but we've got to keep coming up with new ideas from a marketing standpoint. So I think that's going to be something that's on us to deliver.
With core menu, we are rolling out in a number of markets. We've been rolling out a new way to cook our 10:1 patties. That is delivering hotter and fresher burgers. We're seeing nice lifts in Canada and Australia when we've done that. We call it rapid turnover. We're going to deploy that to the rest of the market as well. I think that's another thing for us. And we're seeing in chicken, certainly, we've had a lot of success with the Chicken Sandwich in the U.S. so far. McSpicy, as I referenced in my opening remarks, that's something that we're taking out. So moving there. 
And then lastly, we're in the early, early stages on digital. And I'm incredibly encouraged by what I'm seeing so far with the loyalty rollout. We're seeing very good customer adoption for us to be at 12 million loyalty users before we've even turned on. The advertising is, I think, a great start there and just a testament to customers' sort of pent-up demand for this type of offering for us. 
So there's not any one thing that I would point to. The strategy is still very much intact, and we're going to execute. And you're just going to see us continue to come out with ideas within that, that are going to continue the momentum.

So yes, last -- in the first quarter, I think I said that we expected not to get back to flat yet for the IOM on a 2-year basis. And obviously, to your point, we did better than that. 
Certainly, at the time, one of the things that we were guessing -- or we're guessing is when each of the markets would reopen based on regulations going on at the time with no end dates or knowing exactly when they'd allow markets to reopen. So some of the markets were able to reopen a little bit earlier than we had originally anticipated, whether that's certain channels or all channels. 
And the other thing that we are seeing is that when we do reopen, business comes back quickly. And so there's certainly a pent-up demand in some of those markets that had shutdowns again primarily in Europe. And so we are seeing when those markets reopen, there's significant demand that's waiting to come back, whether that's through the drive-thru, whether that's in store. And as you know, we have a higher percentage of in-restaurant or in-store business in Europe than we do in the U.S. So it was really important to get the dining rooms reopen throughout Europe. 
And so that demand and reopening plans, I'd say, have gone a little bit better than we were first anticipating in the first quarter. And now our expectation is as long as we don't go backwards on lockdowns again, which obviously is still a little bit of a risk, but assuming that none of the markets go back through lockdowns, we feel good about continuing the momentum then in all of those markets."

And so I think from a G&A standpoint, we're very much, I think, on track with G&A. I do think that there is probably a balance toward maybe getting a little bit more that we outsource versus in-source on that. And it's about, for us, ultimately giving the best customer experience. 
So it's not, for us, driven by trying to hit a number per se, but it's about delivering the best customer experience. I think when you can pick best-of-breed suppliers from out there in the industry, our experience has been that, that does tend to work a little bit better.
We referenced previously, we do think we'll probably be on the higher end of capital spend from the guidance standpoint just because of a unit growth opportunity out there. And -- but I don't think you're going to see anything that's dramatically different from what we talked about last year.

So none of that has changed really. And then I think as we talked about in the investor event, we would expect to get leverage certainly on G&A as a percent of sales longer term because what we're seeing on the technology spend is -- I don't think spend -- the actual spend levels will go down, but I don't expect it to go significantly up either. 
So we -- as sales grow, certainly, we should get more leverage as a percent of sales. But I think the technology will require a significant amount of ongoing spend going forward, which is why we believe we've got an advantage just from the size and scale aspect."

Now we're hedged in a lot of our categories there. So we're benefiting from that. It's probably a little too early for us to give an outlook to what 2022 looks like. We typically have that number that we start talking about with franchisees in October. And we certainly hear and recognize some of the challenges that are out there from an inflation standpoint.
But we also have, as you mentioned in your question, things to our advantage around our size and some of the relationships that we have with our suppliers that we think that there are going to be ways that we can perhaps offset some of that. 
So I think it's right now a little bit premature to say necessarily that we're going to be in a significant inflationary environment next year. I'm hopeful that we're going to be able to manage that to something that is a little bit more in line with kind of our historical range that we've seen on that.
We are seeing challenges related to some of the supply chain issues, but it's on the equipment side, particularly. So it's equipment, getting equipment manufactured in Asia, getting that over into markets that maybe have bigger unit growth aspirations. We're also seeing the chip shortage as something that's rippling through a little bit on the equipment side. So we are closely monitoring what's happening with equipment and just making sure that we've got the plans in place there because that tends to be a longer lead item on things.
From a pricing standpoint, I would lastly just say the pricing that we've taken this year, roughly around 6% or so, I think, in the U.S., that is about in line, maybe a little bit ahead of where the overall inflation is when you add in the labor inflation with food inflation. So I think our system is being disciplined. And they certainly recognize that we can't get ahead of where the customer is. And we've got to make sure that we stay competitive on pricing."

Let me start with company margins because I think you guys maybe use those as a proxy for how the franchisees are doing. 
Certainly, we had very strong company margins in the second quarter here. Some of that being driven by the higher average check. I think as we progress, we expect that to moderate a little bit, one, from the higher wages that just began in the second quarter and will continue, obviously. And two, we think there may be some moderation on the average check, although we haven't seen that yet, but I think we're anticipating average check potentially to come down a little bit.
From the franchisee side, as I mentioned, they're still -- they still have record operating cash flow through May of this year. They're up over $100,000 in their cash flow over last year. So they certainly have the financial strength to be able to continue to reinvest in the business. And I think in general, on pricing, both we and our franchisees take a more consumer research-based approach than we would have several years ago. 
And so it's based on consumer research. It looks at local prevailing market conditions. It looks at the competitive set within each area. And then franchisees and the company obviously each make our own pricing decisions after that. But I think overall, we feel pretty good about the margins, but I would expect the U.S. to moderate a little bit from where we were in the second quarter."

I think I would just point out again that we've done a pretty good job, I think, of navigating a whole bunch of changes over the last 18 months, and that certainly gives me confidence as we look forward on sort of what the next phase of this looks like.
From the standpoint of the things that we're talking about and ways to deliver value to the franchisees, I think for us, we're certainly not looking at any of these things from the -- through the lens of who gets -- who pays for what and an opportunity to maybe go after anything on the revenue side there from a franchise standpoint because, frankly, we're too far away from any of that. So Apprente earlier, Apprente is still going to require significant work to go from 10 restaurants to what ends up being hopefully 10,000 restaurants in the U.S.

Are there productivity reasons for this beyond what's just going in terms of like the dining rooms being temporarily closed? And I'll stop there."

The opportunity for us is, as you may remember, at the end of last year, David, when we had our Investor Day, we set an aspiration of getting another 20 seconds or so of speed, improved service time through the drive-thru. And the staffing challenges have slowed some of the trajectory of improvement that we're seeing there. But I certainly expect that we're going to be able to get back on continuing to whittle away at service times. I know that's what all the markets, including the U.S., are focused on. 
So it's more of just a slowing down of the improvement. There's certainly no meaningful going backward on this thing. And it's just the games were too hard fought. Nobody's going to be willing to give up on service times. Kevin?"

I don't know that we will get back to pre-COVID margins yet for this year just because, obviously, first quarter was still obviously pretty low as a lot of them -- a lot of the restaurants were still -- had some restrictions, whether completely shut down or not.
I do think going forward, there is opportunity to continue growing those international margins, at least back to historical levels and potentially even a little higher because of some of the efficiencies you've talked about as well as average check is still a little bit elevated. And those 2 things combined are helping both the U.S. and our IOM McOpCo. So I do think there's opportunity to potentially, on a global basis, exceed our historical high margins."

So we've always got things that the markets are kind of experimenting with from a format standpoint, but part of Manu's mandate is going to be to take a look at all of that to understand the customer experience we want to provide and if new formats needs to be a part of that to be able to introduce that. I do think if we do anything on new format, it's going to be smaller footprint, lower cost than what we have today.

As the largest restaurant business in the world, our size and scale are a competitive advantage that we've built and nurtured for over 6 decades.

As the largest restaurant business in the world, our size and scale are a competitive advantage that we've built and nurtured for over 6 decades. Our 40,000 restaurants in over 100 countries are predominantly run by local owner operators, connecting the business to the 40,000 communities in which we operate. These local connections embed a level of agility that complements our size and scale, enabling local teams to adapt and adjust to operating conditions that vary by country, community and even restaurant in real time. It's what makes McDonald's special. It's also how we're able to use scale and agility, how we can be both big and nimble to achieve something truly unique. 
And thanks to the resilience across all 3 legs of our stool: franchisees, suppliers and the company, and the scale and agility that we deploy collectively, I'm confident in our ability to meet whatever challenges may confront us. From restrictions driven by new COVID variants, to supply chain pressures and labor shortages across industries, to any other unknown unknowns. 
We're approaching the 1-year anniversary of Accelerating the Arches, which took shape in response to changing customer needs early in the pandemic. Rooted in the inherent strengths of the McDonald's System and brand, it's proving to be the right strategy with the right focus at the right time. We're evolving the customer experience in ways, both large and small, to meet changing customer needs and maintain our market leadership. Our 3 growth pillars known as our MCDs, marketing, core menu and the 3Ds of digital delivery and drive-thru, guide our business. This includes amplifying contactless channels like delivery and drive-thru and creating digital experiences that are seamless, personalized and easy to use. We've continued to make excellent progress this past quarter, and I want to thank the McDonald's people all over the world who are performing under trying conditions. 
Let me turn it over to Kevin to walk through our top line results."
139488,1683568458,2413950,"McDonald's Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2021",2021-10-27,"Earnings Calls","McDonald's Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Chris. Our third quarter top line results represent a continuation of our broad-based business momentum around the world, with global comp sales up nearly 13% or 10% on a 2-year basis. Our International Operated Markets have continued to recover,",905,"Thanks, Chris. Our third quarter top line results represent a continuation of our broad-based business momentum around the world, with global comp sales up nearly 13% or 10% on a 2-year basis. Our International Operated Markets have continued to recover, accelerating 2-year comp trends in the third quarter to nearly 9%, as most markets operated with fewer government restrictions. There's still varied performance across the big 5 markets within the IOM segment, ranging from strong double-digit 2-year growth in the U.K. and Canada to low single-digit 2-year growth in Australia, Germany and France, as those countries have been slower to recover from the pandemic. 
The U.K. continued to lead the segment in the third quarter, driven by growth in delivery and digital channels as well as strong menu and marketing promotions like Monopoly. In Canada, the strong 2-year comp momentum was driven by successful marketing activity, including core extensions like the Grand Mac and Spicy Nuggets and growth in the 3 Ds of drive-through, delivery and digital, even as dine-in restrictions have lifted. 
In France and Germany, comp sales exceeded 2019 levels for the first time in the third quarter. Germany's positive performance was supported by expanded deployment of delivery; the national launch of our loyalty program, MyMcDonald's Rewards; and a taste of McDonald's promotion featuring value offerings like McChicken. France benefited from continued strength in delivery and strong menu and marketing promotions with a focus on family. Market conditions are challenging with the adoption of vaccine pass restrictions for both customers and crew in France and several other countries. 
Performance in Australia was impacted by significant stay-at-home restrictions, affecting over half of the restaurants for nearly the entire quarter. While comp sales were relatively flat for the quarter, the market was positive on a 2-year basis and continued to grow its delivery channel, achieving record delivery sales for the quarter. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect the IOM segment to maintain a relatively similar 2-year comp trend as Q3.  
In the U.S., we maintained our momentum with Q3 comp sales up nearly 10% or 14.6% on a 2-year basis. We continued to see positive comps across all dayparts on a 2-year basis with sustained double-digit comps at dinner and breakfast. At the same time, franchisees continue to achieve record-high restaurant cash flow. Our U.S. franchisees have never been better positioned to weather the labor and inflation pressures while still investing in growth. Performance in the U.S. remains driven by strong average check growth, reflecting larger order sizes and menu price increases. 
The big bets we've made during the pandemic are paying dividends across the business and enabling us to maintain our QSR leadership. Menu and marketing efforts with products like the Crispy Chicken Sandwich and successful Famous Orders like the Sweety Meal, have elevated our brand and helped drive underlying sales growth across the business. The launch of our loyalty program in the U.S. has exceeded expectations and is driving increased digital adoption. In just a few short months, we already have over 21 million members enrolled, with over 15 million active loyalty members earning rewards, and we expect that number to continue to grow. Chris will share more loyalty headlines in a few minutes. 
We've reopened nearly 80% of our dining rooms in the U.S. Roughly 3,000 dining rooms remain closed in high-risk COVID areas as we continue to prioritize the health and safety of our customers and crew. In restaurants where we have reopened dining rooms, front-counter and kiosk sales remain below pre-pandemic levels, but we're seeing that even modest increases in these channels helped to relieve operational pressure in the drive-thru. The strong performance in the U.S. has continued into October. We're currently seeing low double-digit comps on a 2-year basis, and we expect that to continue through the rest of the fourth quarter. 
Turning to the International Developmental License segment. Comp sales were up nearly 17% for the quarter or about 5% on a 2-year basis. Profit was largely driven by positive results in Japan and Latin America, partly offset by negative comps in China. Japan maintained momentum in Q3 with comps up 13%, achieving an impressive 6 consecutive years of quarterly comp sales growth despite restaurants operating with government restrictions. The market's performance is being driven by a continued commitment to serve customers safely and conveniently through our drive-thru and digital channels as well as strong marketing and limited time promotions. 
China continues to be impacted by both COVID resurgences, which restarted in June and lasted throughout the quarter, and a softening economy. While comps for the quarter were negative, the market continues to build its digital presence as they now have over 100 million active digital members. In addition, we've accelerated new restaurant growth in China. With over 500 new restaurants already opened this year, we now expect to open roughly 650 restaurants for the year, exceeding our original plan. China remains a critically important market for us and one where we have confidence in the long-term opportunity. So we plan to get even more aggressive in opening new restaurants in this market. 
With our strong overall sales performance for the first 3 quarters of the year, we now expect system-wide sales to be up in the high teens in constant currencies for the full year. 
Now I'll turn it back to Chris to talk more about MCD growth pillars driving our global business."

Our results are a testament to the focus of our teams on driving growth through our M, C and Ds. And we're confident that momentum will continue.

Our results are a testament to the focus of our teams on driving growth through our M, C and Ds. And we're confident that momentum will continue. After playing a pivotal role in building out our Fan Truth strategy in the U.S., Morgan Flatley is transitioning into the role of Global Chief Marketing Officer. Following the instantly iconic global campaign Morgan developed with BTS, Famous Orders again crossed borders with both Russia and Spain launching successful campaigns with local celebrities in the third quarter. These markets leaned into the idea that truly, no matter how big or famous you are or where you are in the world, everyone has their go-to McDonald's order. As Morgan elevates to the global role, we're excited to welcome [ Tara Hassan ] to the McFamily as Chief Marketing and Digital Customer Experience Officer for McDonald's U.S.A. I've known Tarek for many years that I'm confident Tarek will maintain our marketing momentum in the U.S. 
Behind our marketing success is McDonald's Craveable core menu. In the U.S., Crispy Chicken Sandwich sales continue to exceed expectations. This translated into significant growth in QSR chicken market share as we continue to support the Crispy Chicken Sandwich platform with culturally relevant marketing. 
In the U.K., we launched our McSpicy Sandwich, which generated the market's best chicken promotional results on record. And in Canada, our Spicy McNuggets promotion had a halo effect on McNuggets sales. 
This quarter, we introduced the McPlant Wich in Austria and the Netherlands as a limited time offer and both the U.K. and Ireland launched the McPlant in a limited number of restaurants, with a goal to roll out nationwide in January.  McPlant is available for other markets to pull down based on customer demand. As always, we'll do what McDonald's does best, listen to our customers. When people are ready for the McPlant, we'll be ready for them. 
Being customer-driven is about more than just menu items. It's also about delivering feel-good experiences when and where our customers want McDonald's. So we can bring the Golden Arches to as many customers as possible. That means continuing to increase our engagement across drive-thru, digital and delivery. As we do that, we're seeing an increase in sales mix across these channels. In our top 6 markets, over 20% of sales, or about $13 billion, year-to-date came through digital channels, whether it was through our app, kiosk in our restaurants or delivery. Our loyalty program has been an instant fan favorite and delivers great value to our most loyal customers. It also creates another touch point to increase engagement and take our relationship with customers to more responsive, more personalized places. 
We're already seeing increased customer satisfaction and higher frequency among digital customers compared to nondigital. In September, we launched our loyalty program in Germany, quickly amassing millions of active rewards to customers. And we're on track to bringing MyMcDonald's Rewards to Canada by the end of the year, and the U.K. and Australia in the first half of 2022, which means that by mid-2022, loyalty programs will be in our top 6 markets, inclusive of France, which has had a strong loyalty program for many years. 
Delivery is another bet we made long before COVID and one that we believe will continue to be a staple for consumers for years to come. Over the past 5 years, our delivery footprint has grown from just 3,000 of our restaurants to more than 32,000 restaurants across 100 countries. As the needs of our customers have continued to change, delivery has enabled us to increase our reach and grow sales around the world. We're actively engaged in discussions with our largest delivery providers to support the extraordinary growth in our delivery business. We look forward to sharing more information on these global partnerships soon, but this is yet another example of where our scale confers upon us, competitive advantages. 
Lastly, our drive-thrus. With the drive-thru presence that is second to none, our drive-thru sales across our top 6 markets continue to stay elevated versus pre-pandemic levels even as dining rooms reopen. We've previously shared that we have been testing automated order taking in the drive-thru at several restaurants in the U.S. This was enabled by our acquisition of Apprente, now known as MCD Tech Labs in 2019. These tests have shown substantial benefits to customers and the crew experience. 
To enable development and scale deployment of this program, McDonald's has now entered into a strategic relationship with IBM. In my mind, IBM is the ideal partner for McDonald's, given their expertise in building AI-powered customer care solutions and voice recognition. IBM will now acquire MCD Tech Labs to further accelerate the development of automated order taking. 
We're in a strong position today, focused on executing our plan, running great restaurants and taking advantage of our unique size and scale to feed and foster communities. For more on our Q3 financials and our outlook moving forward, I'll turn it back over to Kevin."

Our strong performance for the quarter resulted in adjusted earnings per share of $2.76, which excludes a gain as we completed the partial divestiture of our ownership in McDonald's Japan. Our strong sales generated an increase in restaurant margins of about $500 million for the quarter. 
G&A increased about 20% in constant currencies for the quarter, driven by higher incentive-based compensation expense as a result of company performance exceeding our plan this year. We still expect G&A to be about 2.4% of system-wide sales for the full year. 
Year-to-date adjusted operating margin was 44.3%, reflecting the improved restaurant margins across all segments and higher other operating income compared to last year. Foreign currency translation benefited Q3 results by $0.04 per share. Based on current exchange rates, we expect currency to have a minimal impact on fourth quarter EPS with an estimated full year benefit of $0.21 to $0.23. As usual, this is directional guidance only as rates will likely change as we move through the rest of the year. 
And finally, in September, our Board of Directors approved a 7% dividend increase to the equivalent of $5.52 annually. This marked 45 years of increasing our dividend for shareholders, further reinforcing our confidence in accelerating the Arches. We also announced the resumption of our share repurchase program. As a reminder, we have suspended share buybacks at the beginning of the pandemic as we took on additional debt to provide liquidity support to the McDonald's system. Since then, we've been focused on returning to pre-COVID debt ratios that support our strong investment-grade credit rating. Going forward, we're confident that our operating performance will continue to fuel growth in our already-strong free cash flow profile. As a result, we're committed to our historical capital allocation priorities. First, to invest in new restaurants, existing restaurants and opportunities to grow the business. Then we expect to return all free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases over time. 
Now I'll turn it back to Chris to close."

And even though the pandemic has greatly altered so much in our business and our world, it hasn't changed the simple fact that we're better together than we are apart. 
For a long time, we had to bridge physical separation with technology and new ways of working. But as vaccines have reached critical mass of people in the U.S. in some places around the world, we're beginning to see a different future taking shape. Finally, we're coming together again in our communities, and cities around the world are beginning to open up and get back to a new normal. 
The same is true for our global McFamily. After being closed for over 1.5 years, the McDonald's headquarters reopened on October 11, and it was inspiring to see teams collaborating again in person. To protect the health and safety of our staff, we required all U.S.-based corporate employees to get vaccinated, and we're continuing to monitor local data and seek guidance from public health officials. Even though we've only been back for a few short weeks, we have found that working in the office together spurs a level of collaboration, creativity and connectedness that simply could not be replicated from behind our screens. And we're going to be doing the same thing with our global system soon. 
Next April, in Orlando, franchisees, suppliers and employees will convene for our worldwide convention in person for the first time in 4 years. It's already shaping up to be an experience unlike any other. Together, we'll showcase McDonald's bright future. We'll demonstrate the power of technology for our restaurants, learn how innovation is enhancing the customer experience and discuss plans in the pipeline to drive our Accelerating the Arches growth plan. 
As I've said before, it's not only important that we grow, it's equally important that we grow sustainably and in ways that positively impact the communities we serve. Driving climate action has been a centerpiece of our long-term strategy for a while now, and our focus has sharpened. In fact, in 2014, we established public commitments intended to make our entire system more sustainable by 2020. Among our goals were to sustainably source 100% of key ingredients, including coffee and beef. 
Looking back, this was just the beginning of what would become a much bolder agenda that we are pursuing with urgency. As the threats to our planet have grown, we are responding with a more ambitious plan for ourselves and for the entire industry. We achieved many of our 2020 goals ahead of schedule, and we built upon that momentum to set new ambitious targets. Just this past September, we announced that we would reduce the use of conventional virgin plastics in Happy Meal Toys by 90% by 2025. We recently announced our ambition to achieve net-zero emissions across global operations by 2050, and we joined the UN race to zero. And I look forward to sharing more of our sustainability story with climate delegates at the United Nations Climate Change Conference, known as COP26 in Glasgow next week. 
We believe we have both a privilege and a responsibility to help lead on issues that matter most in communities, and there is no issue more globally important and locally impactful than protecting our planet for generations to come. This is why I continue to remain optimistic about what lies ahead for McDonald's. Accelerating the Arches, fortified by our purpose and guided by our values, makes me confident not just in the future successes of our business, but also for the future of the communities that we serve. With that, we'll begin Q&A."

I'll start and then let Kevin fill in any other points on this. But certainly, it's a very challenging staffing environment in the U.S., a little bit less so in Europe, but still challenging in Europe. 
In the U.S., for us, we are seeing, as I've mentioned a few calls ago, that there is wage inflation. Our franchisees are increasing wages. They're over wage inflation year-to-date that we're seeing in our McOpCo restaurants. We're up over 15% on wages. And that is having some helpful benefit. Certainly, the higher wages that you pay, it allows you to stay competitive. But we're also seeing that it's just -- it's very challenging right now in the market to find the level of talent that you need. And so for us, it is putting some pressure on things like operating hours, where we might be dialing back late night, for example, from what we would ordinarily be doing. It's also putting some pressure around speed of service, where we are down a little bit on speed of service over the last kind of year-to-date and [ even ] in the last quarter. That's also a function of not being able to have the restaurants fully staffed. 
But I would just -- I would tell you that it's not unsolvable either. And we're seeing in our McOpCo restaurants that a really strong focus on the shift manager and providing the training to the shift managers to keep engaged with the crew to keep the crew motivated that, that can make a difference. But certainly, I was hoping and expecting that we were going to see the situation improve maybe a little bit more quickly than what's materialized. And I think it is going to continue to be a difficult environment for the next several quarters. 
Kevin, I don't know if you have anything you want to add."

A couple of things there, I guess, I'd say. One would be I think we're pretty pleased to see 2-year comps in low double digits. That's certainly higher than our historical levels. And if we're able to sustain that for a long period of time, I think we'd be pretty happy with that. Certainly, there have been some changes that have gone on related to more of the full-service restaurants reopening, stimulus benefits, unemployment benefits rolling off. And so we weren't sure how much that would impact our results and are pretty pleased that we're still able to achieve the double-digit comps.

Last quarter, I think I talked about how we were seeing roughly a 6% increase year-over-year in the U.S.",394,"Yes. Thanks for the question, Eric. Certainly, pricing and cost pressures are a bigger focus over the last few quarters than they had been previously. Last quarter, I think I talked about how we were seeing roughly a 6% increase year-over-year in the U.S. We are still seeing that, and that's pretty much the level we expect for the full year 2021 over 2020, right around that 6%. And that's really to cover both labor cost pressures and commodity cost pressures that we're seeing. 
If we step back for a second, obviously, we're all seeing the environment out there on a global basis, which is some pressure on commodities, certainly some pressure on labor availability, in cost supply chain disruptions, et cetera, that are all putting some pressure. We haven't seen, I'll say, any more resistant to our price increases than we've seen historically. So that has been pretty well received by customers. We do certainly have a very big focus to make sure that we are balancing cost pressures and being able to cover those, with making sure that our value perception by customers continue to be favorable. And we are continuing to see those surveys and scores, from a value favorability perspective, still positive from customers. So we'll continue to keep an eye on it. 
From a commodity perspective, commodities were up roughly 2% or so through the first 9 months, but we expect for the full year for those to be up roughly 3.5% to 4%, which will put a little bit of additional pressure on the fourth quarter, obviously. And then going into next year from a food and paper cost perspective, we would expect our cost to be up relatively in line with the industry. Right now, that expectation is roughly mid-single digits. And so we will continue to keep an eye both on the cost side and the pricing side. 
Both we and our franchisees, over the last couple of years, have been using a third party for pricing advisory services, if you will, using a pretty deep consumer-based research approach. And so we have, I think, more science built into our pricing decisions that take into account market conditions, competitive factors, et cetera. So like I said, we'll keep a close eye on cost and pricing. But right now, so far, it's been received okay by customers."

Thanks, sir, for the question. I'll take that. I think it is fair to say, again, just thinking about the global environment, there are certainly supply chain challenges across the world on various things related to kitchen equipment; technology equipment; I'll say, pandemic-related disruptions; slower permitting times. All the things that you mentioned are making it a bigger challenge, I'll say, to get restaurants open than historically. 
For this year, we still expect roughly, in our IOM and U.S. markets, it's down a little bit from where we were previously. There will be a few that will spill over now into 2022. That's more of a timing issue than anything else. And so because of things taking a little bit longer, some of the openings that we thought we may be able to get done this year will spill into beginning of 2022. 
Going forward, I think we're still bullish on openings. We still expect our openings to increase, both in our wholly-owned markets as well as our developmental license markets next year. The increase that you saw right now for 2021 is being primarily driven by China and a few other developmental license markets. So that's why the overall openings is up this year. 
But I'd say overall, it's a bigger challenge than it has been, but our supply chain does a phenomenal job of kind of just managing the whole process, making sure that we've got contingency plans. We're in touch extremely frequently with all of our suppliers. And I feel pretty good about where we are compared to where others may be just because of the strength of our supply chain. But I think it is fair to say that it's a bigger challenge than it's been historically."

The markets that you mentioned, like in Australia, like in France, they have certainly had to navigate a more restrictive COVID environment. We did get a peak earlier in the year when things appear to be getting better before the Delta variant that those markets were poised to spring back. 
So from our expectation, as soon as the conditions in those markets start to become more favorable in terms of being able to return to normal operating conditions, we expect those markets are going to perform in a very healthy way because that's how they were performing pre-pandemic.

So we are -- the more we learn about loyalty, the more optimistic that we get about loyalty. I think for us, in terms of what that means for the business long term, certainly, the benefits you get with the loyalty program is the ability to increase frequency. And in the markets where we operate, roughly 80% of the population visits a McDonald's once a year. 
So it's not that we have a reach opportunity, it's about driving frequency in this business. And we've seen in the places that where we have deployed loyalty that it absolutely does increase customer frequency. So for us, that's really encouraging. 
I think to the broader point of what do you do with the data, we had set out earlier an aspiration where we wanted to have 40% of our customers be known customers. Today, that number is probably only about 5% of the customers where we actually know who is the customer, what do they buy, what have they bought previously. And then you can imagine all sorts of things that you're able to learn about customers and their preferences when you're able to get more and more of your transactions where you know who the customer is. And loyalty is certainly the way that you get that customer to engage and share information with you. 
So for us, I think we're just getting started on it, but very optimistic about what loyal -- loyalty can do in this business. And by mid next year, we're going to have loyalty in our top 6 markets. So I think the ability to give you a better idea of what exactly it's doing for the business, I think once we have that kind of scale and roll out, we'll be able to talk with even more specificity about it."

Well, I think a shout-out to the U.S. team and our owner operators for doing a great job of sustaining that momentum, as you mentioned, through what continues to be a challenging environment for all the reasons that have come up on this call, labor challenges, commodity inflation, et cetera. I think the momentum that we're seeing in the U.S. business is not something that just came about in the last couple of years. This was something that started several years ago with the foundation that we've put in place in the U.S. And the foundation was around modernizing our estate, improving the food, making investments in digital and delivery. And I think the fact that we were able to get all those things sort of embedded in the business back in, call it, 2017, 2018 set us up really well for what none of us could have predicted, which is what we've now experienced through COVID. 
So I think for us, what I feel good about with the U.S. is we've got sort of the foundational elements in place for this business to outperform or perform quite well for an extended period of time. As to how you do that, it's going to be back to the strategy that we have with Accelerating the Arches. It's a focus on great marketing, driving core menu and outperforming on the 3 Ds, delivery, drive-thru and digital. 
And so for us, message that I'm talking about to the teams internally is we have the right strategy. It's all about execution. And we've got to execute at a really high level. If we do that, on those 3 dimensions, then I'm confident. But we also can't get complacent. And I think there's a good healthy level of dialogue going on in the U.S. right now about just keeping that hunger, keeping that momentum going. And once you've got it, you don't want to give it up, and that's the mindset right now."

I think it's fair to share over the last several years. And we're continuing to see, even as markets reopen and things start to get back to normal in places where they're able to get the dining room, et cetera, back open, delivery remains elevated. And so for us, I think what has become apparent is delivery was meeting a customer need that I don't think any of us fully appreciated even maybe a few years ago. So it's here to stay. 
What we're trying to do with our partners, the way that we had approached some of our delivery conversations previously with our 3PO partners, in many cases, those were discussions that were happening at the market level. And when you are a company the size and scale of McDonald's, we certainly have, we believe, a great proposition for 3PO partners on a global basis. 
And so what we're trying to do through these conversations is leverage the fact that we are the largest restaurant company in the world, that we have an ability to drive traffic onto 3PO apps that we think is second to none. And that, that should be reflected in the rates that we're paying with our 3PO partners. So those conversations are proceeding, but I'd say there is a good recognition on both sides that we need each other. And I'm optimistic that we'll be able to get to a good resolution on that in the next couple of months."

I'll try, and I'll let Chris add on to this one. It's a good question, because you're right. I think early on in the pandemic, I think we believe that the average check would decline quicker than it certainly has. And I think the reason right now at least is because the channels that much of our sales are going through, which continue to be things like drive-thru, delivery, digital, as you mentioned, people are still going through and ordering for several people. If you're getting delivery, you're getting it for your family or for at least a couple of people, if a lot of the folks going through drive-thru are getting orders for several people. And so we are seeing those larger order sizes continue. And I think at least some of that will be stickier than we originally may have thought. So we don't anticipate, certainly in the near term, average check returning back to the level that was at pre-pandemic. 
I think -- I lost my train of thought, but I do think we will continue to see the check continue to grow and those channels continue to grow. And like I said, we're not seeing any degradation of that check at this point."

We're still selling more sandwiches. We're still selling more fries. And so from a unit standpoint, while we certainly are looking at traffic, the absolute volume of what we're selling is continuing to grow. And for me, that's a really good barometer about the health of this business. 
I think, as to whether that's sustained, whether these larger parties, larger order sizes sustain, we're going to follow the customer to whichever way they want to go. If the customer starts to come back and split the ticket and we have smaller check, I think so long as we continue to focus on the execution, we'll be just fine on that. But certainly, I think what you're seeing right now, and what we're expecting is that some of the benefits that we're seeing around larger check and the mix, the channel mix that goes with that, we're expecting that to continue."

Now there are other markets that are further along. The U.K. is in 250 restaurants, and they're going to be planning on doing a full national rollout in the U.K. in Q1. In that situation, I think we have more evidence that it is filling an unmet need that certainly existed in the U.K. on their menus. So early results in the U.K. are very encouraging. A couple of other markets as well in Europe have seen success with McPlant and the rollout on that. 
So I think this is one where we've said all along, we're going to let the markets decide when is the best time to pull it down based on what the customer acceptance or interest is in this concept. I think certainly, I can say at this point, there are definitely a couple of European markets where there is customer acceptance for it. Whether that is a broad-based acceptance in the U.S., I think we'll learn that over the next several quarters."

I think to be fair, we had started thinking about accelerating some of the openings internationally, even pre-pandemic. Certainly, nothing that's happened in the pandemic has changed our thinking at all related to that and, if anything, I think, just reinforces our opportunity to continue growing in many of those international operated markets. 
As far as any constraints, I think the constraints really are -- from a market perspective, there is kind of a sweet spot of what they can open in terms of building a pipeline, having the right real estate representatives, opening in a way that isn't disruptive to the rest of the market. So we do have a lot of tools that we use to determine kind of what the appropriate opening level is for the markets. 
I think we do have opportunity to open quicker in many of those markets than we have been. And I think our expectation is that we will continue to grow in many of those International Operated Markets where we still believe there's a lot of opportunity. We're just in the midst of going through our plans right now for 2022. So I don't have specifics yet for 2022. But I think it is fair to say that we would expect our openings next year to be higher than they are in 2021 and continue to kind of increase that level for a little while where we will. 
We've talked about unit growth being about 1.5% to 2% contribution to sales growth. Right now, we're at the lower end of that, more [ of the ] 1.5%, and likely not a lot above that for '22 because it really relates to '21 openings.

And so thinking about what is going to be the consumer acceptance on a sustaining basis for dine-in coming out of this and then what are the implications of that, I would add, we have a lot of play places in our restaurants. What is the implication for the play pay space. 
So we are just now starting to think about that and think about potential scenarios for how you might reuse the space, if dine-in doesn't come back to the level that it was pre-pandemic. But I think right now, it's still a little bit preliminary just because there's still noise in the dine-in numbers that I don't want to do anything hasty here until we just get a better beat on what does dine-in sustain at.

So where McDonald's should own the technology or really has specific expertise and maybe customer-facing or UI versus some of the sort of behind-the-scenes capabilities?

And I think this is one where I'd go back to the conversation you and I had, I don't know, it's probably several quarters ago now on this topic of how do we think about technology, what's in-sourced, what's outsourced. And my thinking then is the same as my thinking now, which is there are certain times where it may make sense for us to go acquire a technology so that we can accelerate the development of that, make sure that it is bespoke to McDonald's needs. But at some point, that technology reaches a level of development where I think getting it to a partner who can then blow it out and scale it globally makes more sense. And so I think what we did with Apprente is very much consistent with that philosophy, which is we've had it for a couple of years. I've been really pleased with how the team has progressed, the development of that. We're seeing some very encouraging results in the restaurants that we have it. But there's still a lot of work that needs to go into introducing other languages, being able to do it across 14,000 restaurants with all the various menu permutations, et cetera. And that work is beyond the scale of our core competencies, if you will. 
And so I think in this case, IBM is a natural partner for us. I think going forward, it's going to be very much on a case-by-case basis as to when we just -- we go from day 1 with a partner versus where we might bring something in-house for a period of time. But the nice thing about being McDonald's is where everybody's first call when it comes to a partner in the restaurant industry. And so we have a really good visibility to the various partners out there. And certainly, our -- I think our overall view is we are best on a long-term sustaining basis to use others externally partnering. But again, there may be time to time where there's benefit for us from being able to accelerate and learn to have it in for a period of time."

Well, I think not just in our industry but across, I'd say, most consumer industries, the youth and the preferences and desires of the youth drive consumer demand, whether it's in apparel, beverages, restaurant, et cetera. And so it becomes a very natural demographic target. That 18 to 35 target is, you know from a media standpoint, probably the most coveted, the most expensive demographic to reach, because of the brand preferences that get formed at an early age and that sustained over the lifetime value of that customer. 
So I think you're absolutely spot on in observing that we have made a more demonstrable push against that demographic. And I expect that that's going to continue. And it's one that we believe at McDonald's that we have a brand that can be part of culture. And we probably have not -- in my view, we haven't done enough to lean into the stature of our brand and culture and how we can connect to that. And so I think finding properties, finding a message that resonate with youth but also resonate more broadly in culture for us is a big upside opportunity. 
And we're seeing other markets. The U.S. started some of this, but we're seeing other markets like Russia, like Spain pick up on the Famous Orders concept and getting very similar results on that. And just to me, it speaks to our -- the ability of this brand and what we can do with it. 
I think in terms of how is that changing the mix, it's still early days on this. So I think we are seeing certainly the brand sentiment improving, but we're also having to move a pretty big boat here. And so we're not yet seeing it show up in terms of a big demographic shift within the business. But frankly, nor did we. This is something that I think for us is going to sustain over several years. And it's -- again, it's about making sure that our brand is 1 that is as powerful in the future as it has been in the past."

For the third quarter at least, both the U.S. and IOM, comps were a little bit higher in -- with franchisees than they were with company operated. That's not dramatically different than historical, I'll say. So for a while, that's generally been the trend. Some of that is driven certainly in the U.S., depending on the location of where our company-operated stores are versus others. But in general, franchisees are running a little bit ahead of company-operated on a comp basis. And that is what we saw both in the third quarter and on a year-to-date basis, I'll say, this year. 
Related to free cash flow, we've said we expect our free cash flow coverage to conversion to be greater than 90%, both for this year and going forward. I don't want to surmise of when or if it could get to over 100%. For now, we're going to stay with that over 90%. I think we are seeing that we have a pretty healthy flow-through that -- in our P&L that converts to free cash flow. 
The big question right now -- and again, as I mentioned a couple of times, we're still in our planning phase to look at capital requirements and what that means related to some of the opening opportunities that I mentioned earlier, et cetera. So we've got to take all those pieces into account to figure out what the free cash flow profile looks for several years. We do expect free cash flow dollars to continue to grow.

As the largest restaurant business in the world, our size and scale are a competitive advantage that we've built and nurtured for over 6 decades.

These local connections embed a level of agility that complements our size and scale, enabling local teams to adapt and adjust to operating conditions that vary by country, community and even restaurant in real time. It's what makes McDonald's special. It's also how we're able to use scale and agility, how we can be both big and nimble to achieve something truly unique.

From restrictions driven by new COVID variants, to supply chain pressures and labor shortages across industries, to any other unknown unknowns.  
We're approaching the 1-year anniversary of Accelerating the Arches, which took shape in response to changing customer needs early in the pandemic.

We're evolving the customer experience in ways, both large and small, to meet changing customer needs and maintain our market leadership. Our 3 growth pillars known as our MCDs, marketing, core menu; and the 3Ds of digital, delivery and drive-thru, guide our business. This includes amplifying contactless channels like delivery and drive-thru and creating digital experiences that are seamless, personalized and easy to use. We've continued to make excellent progress this past quarter, and I want to thank the McDonald's people all over the world who are performing under trying conditions.

There's still varied performance across the big 5 markets within the IOM segment, ranging from strong double-digit 2-year growth in the U.K. and Canada to low single-digit 2-year growth in Australia, Germany and France, as those countries have been slower to recover from the pandemic.  
The U.K. continued to lead the segment in the third quarter, driven by growth in delivery and digital channels as well as strong menu and marketing promotions like Monopoly. In Canada, the strong 2-year comp momentum was driven by successful marketing activity, including core extensions like the Grand Mac and Spicy Nuggets and growth in the 3Ds of drive-thru, delivery and digital, even as dine-in restrictions have lifted.  
In France and Germany, comp sales exceeded 2019 levels for the first time in the third quarter. Germany's positive performance was supported by expanded deployment of delivery; the national launch of our loyalty program, MyMcDonald's Rewards; and a taste of McDonald's promotion featuring value offerings like McChicken. France benefited from continued strength in delivery and strong menu and marketing promotions with a focus on family.  
Market conditions are challenging with the adoption of vaccine pass restrictions for both customers and crew in France and several other countries.  
Performance in Australia was impacted by significant stay-at-home restrictions, affecting over half of the restaurants for nearly the entire quarter. While comp sales were relatively flat for the quarter, the market was positive on a 2-year basis and continued to grow its delivery channel, achieving record delivery sales for the quarter. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect the IOM segment to maintain a relatively similar 2-year comp trend as Q3.   
In the U.S., we maintained our momentum with Q3 comp sales up nearly 10% or 14.6% on a 2-year basis. We continued to see positive comps across all dayparts on a 2-year basis with sustained double-digit comps at dinner and breakfast. At the same time, franchisees continue to achieve record-high restaurant cash flow. Our U.S. franchisees have never been better positioned to weather the labor and inflation pressures while still investing in growth. Performance in the U.S. remains driven by strong average-check growth, reflecting larger order sizes and menu price increases.  
The big bets we've made during the pandemic are paying dividends across the business and enabling us to maintain our QSR leadership. Menu and marketing efforts with products like the Crispy Chicken Sandwich and successful Famous Orders like the Saweetie Meal have elevated our brand and helped drive underlying sales growth across the business. The launch of our loyalty program in the U.S. has exceeded expectations and is driving increased digital adoption. In just a few short months, we already have over 21 million members enrolled, with over 15 million active loyalty members earning rewards, and we expect that number to continue to grow. Chris will share more loyalty headlines in a few minutes.  
We've reopened nearly 80% of our dining rooms in the U.S. Roughly 3,000 dining rooms remain closed in high-risk COVID areas as we continue to prioritize the health and safety of our customers and crew. In restaurants where we have reopened dining rooms, front-counter and kiosk sales remain below pre-pandemic levels, but we're seeing that even modest increases in these channels helped to relieve operational pressure in the drive-thru.  
The strong performance in the U.S. has continued into October. We're currently seeing low double-digit comps on a 2-year basis, and we expect that to continue through the rest of the fourth quarter.  
Turning to the International Developmental Licensed segment. Comp sales were up nearly 17% for the quarter or about 5% on a 2-year basis. Performance was largely driven by positive results in Japan and Latin America, partly offset by negative comps in China. Japan maintained momentum in Q3 with comps up 13%, achieving an impressive 6 consecutive years of quarterly comp sales growth despite restaurants operating with government restrictions. The market's performance is being driven by a continued commitment to serve customers safely and conveniently through our drive-thru and digital channels as well as strong marketing and limited time promotions.  
China continues to be impacted by both COVID resurgences, which restarted in June and lasted throughout the quarter; and a softening economy. While comps for the quarter were negative, the market continues to build its digital presence as they now have over 100 million active digital members. In addition, we've accelerated new restaurant growth in China. With over 500 new restaurants already opened this year, we now expect to open roughly 650 restaurants for the year, exceeding our original plan. China remains a critically important market for us and one where we have confidence in the long-term opportunity. So we plan to get even more aggressive in opening new restaurants in this market.  
With our strong overall sales performance for the first 3 quarters of the year, we now expect system-wide sales to be up in the high teens in constant currencies for the full year.  
Now I'll turn it back to Chris to talk more about MCD growth pillars driving our global business."

Our results are a testament to the focus of our teams on driving growth through our M, C and Ds. And we're confident that momentum will continue. After playing a pivotal role in building out our [ Fan Truth ] strategy in the U.S., Morgan Flatley is transitioning into the role of Global Chief Marketing Officer. Following the instantly iconic global campaign Morgan developed with BTS, Famous Orders again crossed borders with both Russia and Spain launching successful campaigns with local celebrities in the third quarter. These markets leaned into the idea that truly, no matter how big or famous you are or where you are in the world, everyone has their go-to McDonald's order. As Morgan elevates to the global role, we're excited to welcome Tariq Hassan to the McFamily as Chief Marketing and Digital Customer Experience Officer for McDonald's U.S.A. I've known Tariq for many years that I'm confident Tariq will maintain our marketing momentum in the U.S.  
Behind our marketing success is McDonald's craveable core menu. In the U.S., Crispy Chicken Sandwich sales continue to exceed expectations. This translated into significant growth in QSR chicken market share as we continue to support the Crispy Chicken Sandwich platform with culturally relevant marketing.  
In the U.K., we launched our McSpicy Sandwich, which generated the market's best chicken promotional results on record. And in Canada, our Spicy McNuggets promotion had a halo effect on McNuggets sales.  
This quarter, we introduced the McPlant Sandwich in Austria and the Netherlands as a limited time offer, and both the U.K. and Ireland launched the McPlant in a limited number of restaurants, with a goal to roll out nationwide in January.  McPlant is available for other markets to pull down based on customer demand. As always, we'll do what McDonald's does best: listen to our customers. When people are ready for the McPlant, we'll be ready for them.  
Being customer-driven is about more than just menu items. It's also about delivering feel-good experiences when and where our customers want McDonald's. So we can bring the Golden Arches to as many customers as possible. That means continuing to increase our engagement across drive-thru, digital and delivery. As we do that, we're seeing an increase in sales mix across these channels. In our top 6 markets, over 20% of sales, or about $13 billion, year-to-date came through digital channels, whether it was through our app, kiosk in our restaurants or delivery. Our loyalty program has been an instant fan favorite and delivers great value to our most loyal customers. It also creates another touch point to increase engagement and take our relationship with customers to more responsive, more personalized places.  
We're already seeing increased customer satisfaction and higher frequency among digital customers compared to nondigital. In September, we launched our loyalty program in Germany, quickly amassing millions of active rewards to customers. And we're on track to bring MyMcDonald's Rewards to Canada by the end of the year, and the U.K. and Australia in the first half of 2022, which means that by mid-2022, loyalty programs will be in our top 6 markets, inclusive of France, which has had a strong loyalty program for many years.  
Delivery is another bet we made long before COVID and one that we believe will continue to be a staple for consumers for years to come. Over the past 5 years, our delivery footprint has grown from just 3,000 of our restaurants to more than 32,000 restaurants across 100 countries. As the needs of our customers have continued to change, delivery has enabled us to increase our reach and grow sales around the world. We're actively engaged in discussions with our largest delivery providers to support the extraordinary growth in our delivery business. We look forward to sharing more information on these global partnerships soon, but this is yet another example of where our scale confers upon us, competitive advantages.  
Lastly, our drive-thrus. With the drive-thru presence that is second to none, our drive-thru sales across our top 6 markets continue to stay elevated versus pre-pandemic levels even as dining rooms reopen. We've previously shared that we have been testing automated order taking in the drive-thru at several restaurants in the U.S. This was enabled by our acquisition of Apprente, now known as McD Tech Labs in 2019. These tests have shown substantial benefits to customers and the crew experience.  
To enable development and scale deployment of this program, McDonald's has now entered into a strategic relationship with IBM. In my mind, IBM is the ideal partner for McDonald's, given their expertise in building AI-powered customer care solutions and voice recognition. IBM will now acquire McD Tech Labs to further accelerate the development of automated order taking.  
We're in a strong position today, focused on executing our plan, running great restaurants and taking advantage of our unique size and scale to feed and foster communities. For more on our Q3 financials and our outlook moving forward, I'll turn it back over to Kevin."

Our strong performance for the quarter resulted in adjusted earnings per share of $2.76, which excludes a gain as we completed the partial divestiture of our ownership in McDonald's Japan. Our strong sales generated an increase in restaurant margins of about $500 million for the quarter.  
G&A increased about 20% in constant currencies for the quarter, driven by higher incentive-based compensation expense as a result of company performance exceeding our plan this year. We still expect G&A to be about 2.4% of system-wide sales for the full year.  
Year-to-date adjusted operating margin was 44.3%, reflecting the improved restaurant margins across all segments and higher other operating income compared to last year. Foreign currency translation benefited Q3 results by $0.04 per share. Based on current exchange rates, we expect currency to have a minimal impact on fourth quarter EPS with an estimated full year benefit of $0.21 to $0.23. As usual, this is directional guidance only as rates will likely change as we move through the rest of the year.  
And finally, in September, our Board of Directors approved a 7% dividend increase to the equivalent of $5.52 annually. This marked 45 years of increasing our dividend for shareholders, further reinforcing our confidence in accelerating the Arches. We also announced the resumption of our share repurchase program. As a reminder, we have suspended share buybacks at the beginning of the pandemic as we took on additional debt to provide liquidity support to the McDonald's system. Since then, we've been focused on returning to pre-COVID debt ratios that support our strong investment-grade credit rating. Going forward, we're confident that our operating performance will continue to fuel growth in our already-strong free cash flow profile. As a result, we're committed to our historical capital allocation priorities. First, to invest in new restaurants, existing restaurants and opportunities to grow the business. Then we expect to return all free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases over time.  
Now I'll turn it back to Chris to close."

And even though the pandemic has greatly altered so much in our business and our world, it hasn't changed the simple fact that we're better together than we are apart.  
For a long time, we had to bridge physical separation with technology and new ways of working. But as vaccines have reached critical mass of people in the U.S. and some places around the world, we're beginning to see a different future taking shape. Finally, we're coming together again in our communities, and cities around the world are beginning to open up and get back to a new normal.  
The same is true for our global McFamily. After being closed for over 1.5 years, the McDonald's headquarters reopened on October 11, and it was inspiring to see teams collaborating again in person. To protect the health and safety of our staff, we required all U.S.-based corporate employees to get vaccinated, and we're continuing to monitor local data and seek guidance from public health officials. Even though we've only been back for a few short weeks, we have found that working in the office together spurs a level of collaboration, creativity and connectedness that simply could not be replicated from behind our screens. And we're going to be doing the same thing with our global system soon.  
Next April, in Orlando, franchisees, suppliers and employees will convene for our worldwide convention in person for the first time in 4 years. It's already shaping up to be an experience unlike any other. Together, we'll showcase McDonald's bright future. We'll demonstrate the power of technology for our restaurants, learn how innovation is enhancing the customer experience and discuss plans in the pipeline to drive our Accelerating the Arches growth plan.  
As I've said before, it's not only important that we grow, it's equally important that we grow sustainably and in ways that positively impact the communities we serve. Driving climate action has been a centerpiece of our long-term strategy for a while now, and our focus has sharpened. In fact, in 2014, we established public commitments intended to make our entire system more sustainable by 2020. Among our goals were to sustainably source 100% of key ingredients, including coffee and beef.  
Looking back, this was just the beginning of what would become a much bolder agenda that we are pursuing with urgency. As the threats to our planet have grown, we are responding with a more ambitious plan for ourselves and for the entire industry. We achieved many of our 2020 goals ahead of schedule, and we built upon that momentum to set new ambitious targets. Just this past September, we announced that we would reduce the use of conventional virgin plastics in Happy Meal toys by 90% by 2025. We recently announced our ambition to achieve net 0 emissions across global operations by 2050, and we joined the UN race to 0. And I look forward to sharing more of our sustainability story with climate delegates at the United Nations Climate Change Conference, known as COP 26 in Glasgow next week.  
We believe we have both a privilege and a responsibility to help lead on issues that matter most in communities, and there is no issue more globally important and locally impactful than protecting our planet for generations to come. This is why I continue to remain optimistic about what lies ahead for McDonald's. Accelerating the Arches, fortified by our purpose and guided by our values, makes me confident not just in the future successes of our business, but also for the future of the communities that we serve. With that, we'll begin Q&A."

You're obviously very strong, but does just a bit of a deceleration from the very strong sales you saw in the quarter.

I'll start and then let Kevin fill in any other points on this. But certainly, it's a very challenging staffing environment in the U.S., a little bit less so in Europe, but still challenging in Europe.  
In the U.S., for us, we are seeing, as I've mentioned a few calls ago, that there is wage inflation. Our franchisees are increasing wages. They're over 10% wage inflation year-to-date that we're seeing in our McOpCo restaurants. We're up over 15% on wages. And that is having some helpful benefit. Certainly, the higher wages that you pay, it allows you to stay competitive. But we're also seeing that it's just -- it's very challenging right now in the market to find the level of talent that you need. And so for us, it is putting some pressure on things like operating hours, where we might be dialing back late night, for example, from what we would ordinarily be doing. It's also putting some pressure around speed of service, where we are down a little bit on speed of service over the last kind of year-to-date and even in the last quarter. That's also a function of not being able to have the restaurants fully staffed.  
But I would just -- I would tell you that it's not unsolvable either. And we're seeing in our McOpCo restaurants that a really strong focus on the shift manager and providing the training to the shift managers to keep engaged with the crew to keep the crew motivated that, that can make a difference. But certainly, I was hoping and expecting that we were going to see the situation improve maybe a little bit more quickly than what's materialized. And I think it is going to continue to be a difficult environment for the next several quarters.

And if we're able to sustain that for a long period of time, I think we'd be pretty happy with that. Certainly, there have been some changes that have gone on related to more of the full-service restaurants reopening, stimulus benefits, unemployment benefits rolling off.

Certainly, pricing and cost pressures are a bigger focus over the last few quarters than they had been previously. Last quarter, I think I talked about how we were seeing roughly a 6% increase year-over-year in the U.S. We are still seeing that, and that's pretty much the level we expect for the full year 2021 over 2020, right around that 6%. And that's really to cover both labor cost pressures and commodity cost pressures that we're seeing.  
If we step back for a second, obviously, we're all seeing the environment out there on a global basis, which is some pressure on commodities, certainly some pressure on labor availability and cost supply chain disruptions, et cetera, that are all putting some pressure. We haven't seen, I'll say, any more resistant to our price increases than we've seen historically. So that -- the 6% has been pretty well received by customers. We do certainly have a very big focus to make sure that we are balancing cost pressures and being able to cover those, with making sure that our value perception by customers continue to be favorable. And we are continuing to see those surveys and scores, from a value favorability perspective, still positive from customers. So we'll continue to keep an eye on it.  
From a commodity perspective, commodities were up roughly 2% or so through the first 9 months, but we expect for the full year for those to be up roughly 3.5% to 4%, which will put a little bit of additional pressure on the fourth quarter, obviously. And then going into next year from a food and paper cost perspective, we would expect our cost to be up relatively in line with the industry. Right now, that expectation is roughly mid-single digits. And so we will continue to keep an eye both on the cost side and the pricing side.  
Both we and our franchisees, over the last couple of years, have been using a third party for pricing advisory services, if you will, using a pretty deep consumer-based research approach. And so we have, I think, more science built into our pricing decisions that take into account market conditions, competitive factors, et cetera. So like I said, we'll keep a close eye on cost and pricing. But right now, so far, it's been received okay by customers."

Thanks, Jared, for the question. I'll take that. I think it is fair to say, again, just thinking about the global environment, there are certainly supply chain challenges across the world on various things related to kitchen equipment; technology equipment; I'll say, pandemic-related disruptions; slower permitting times. All the things that you mentioned are making it a bigger challenge, I'll say, to get restaurants open than historically.  
For this year, we still expect roughly, in our IOM and U.S. markets, it's down a little bit from where we were previously. There will be a few that will spill over now into 2022. That's more of a timing issue than anything else. And so because of things taking a little bit longer, some of the openings that we thought we may be able to get done this year will spill into beginning of 2022.  
Going forward, I think we're still bullish on openings. We still expect our openings to increase, both in our wholly-owned markets as well as our developmental licensed markets next year. The increase that you saw right now for 2021 is being primarily driven by China and a few other developmental licensed markets. So that's why the overall openings is up this year.  
But I'd say overall, it's a bigger challenge than it has been, but our supply chain does a phenomenal job of kind of just managing the whole process, making sure that we've got contingency plans. We're in touch extremely frequently with all of our suppliers. And I feel pretty good about where we are compared to where others may be just because of the strength of our supply chain. But I think it is fair to say that it's a bigger challenge than it's been historically."

But I think overall, we remain very optimistic about our international portfolio in the markets where we're seeing restrictions relaxed. Those businesses are bouncing back and bouncing back in a very healthy way.  
The markets that you mentioned, like in Australia, like in France, they have certainly had to navigate a more restrictive COVID environment. We did get a peak earlier in the year when things appear to be getting better before the Delta variant that those markets were poised to spring back.  
So from our expectation, as soon as the conditions in those markets start to become more favorable in terms of being able to return to normal operating conditions, we expect those markets are going to perform in a very healthy way because that's how they were performing pre-pandemic. So there's nothing structural that would make us concerned about their ability to bounce back."

Well, we're really pleased with how loyalty is starting off in the U.S. We're seeing a similar very nice start to it in Germany and Canada. So we are -- the more we learn about loyalty, the more optimistic that we get about loyalty. I think for us, in terms of what that means for the business long term, certainly that the benefits you get with the loyalty program is the ability to increase frequency. And in the markets where we operate, roughly 80% of the population visits a McDonald's once a year.  
So it's not that we have a reach opportunity, it's about driving frequency in this business. And we've seen in the places that where we have deployed loyalty that it absolutely does increase customer frequency. So for us, that's really encouraging.  
I think to the broader point of what do you do with the data, we had set out earlier an aspiration where we wanted to have 40% of our customers be known customers. Today, that number is probably only about 5% of the customers where we actually know who is the customer, what do they buy, what have they bought previously. And then you can imagine all sorts of things that you're able to learn about customers and their preferences when you're able to get more and more of your transactions where you know who the customer is. And loyalty is certainly the way that you get that customer to engage and share information with you.  
So for us, I think we're just getting started on it, but very optimistic about what loyal -- loyalty can do in this business. And by mid next year, we're going to have loyalty in our top 6 markets. So I think the ability to give you a better idea of what exactly it's doing for the business, I think once we have that kind of scale and roll out, we'll be able to talk with even more specificity about it."

Well, I think a shout-out to the U.S. team and our owner operators for doing a great job of sustaining that momentum, as you mentioned, through what continues to be a challenging environment for all the reasons that have come up on this call, labor challenges, commodity inflation, et cetera. I think the momentum that we're seeing in the U.S. business is not something that just came about in the last couple of years. This was something that started several years ago with the foundation that we've put in place in the U.S. And the foundation was around modernizing our estate, improving the food, making investments in digital and delivery. And I think the fact that we were able to get all those things sort of embedded in the business back in, call it, 2017, 2018 set us up really well for what none of us could have predicted, which is what we've now experienced through COVID.  
So I think for us, what I feel good about with the U.S. is we've got sort of the foundational elements in place for this business to outperform or perform quite well for an extended period of time. As to how you do that, it's going to be back to the strategy that we have with Accelerating the Arches. It's a focus on great marketing, driving core menu and outperforming on the 3Ds: delivery, drive-thru and digital.  
And so for us, message that I'm talking about to the teams internally is we have the right strategy. It's all about execution. And we've got to execute at a really high level. If we do that, on those 3 dimensions, then I'm confident. But we also can't get complacent. And I think there's a good healthy level of dialogue going on in the U.S. right now about just keeping that hunger, keeping that momentum going. And once you've got it, you don't want to give it up, and that's the mindset right now."

I'll do the delivery question while Kevin is going through his notes, the other parts of this. But -- so we don't share a specific breakout on delivery, but suffice to say, delivery for us continues to be a really important driver for us. The business has grown by billions and billions. I think it's fair to share over the last several years. And we're continuing to see, even as markets reopen and things start to get back to normal in places where they're able to get the dining room, et cetera, back open, delivery remains elevated. And so for us, I think what has become apparent is delivery was meeting a customer need that I don't think any of us fully appreciated even maybe a few years ago. So it's here to stay.  
What we're trying to do with our partners, the way that we had approached some of our delivery conversations previously with our 3 [ PO ] partners, in many cases, those were discussions that were happening at the market level. And when you are a company the size and scale of McDonald's, we certainly have, we believe, a great proposition for 3 [ PO ] partners on a global basis.  
And so what we're trying to do through these conversations is leverage the fact that we are the largest restaurant company in the world, that we have an ability to drive traffic onto 3 [ PO ] apps that we think is second to none. And that, that should be reflected in the rates that we're paying with our 3 [ PO ] partners. So those conversations are proceeding, but I'd say there is a good recognition on both sides that we need each other. And I'm optimistic that we'll be able to get to a good resolution on that in the next couple of months."

If you're getting delivery, you're getting it for your family or for at least a couple of people. If a lot of the folks going through drive-thru are getting orders for several people.

And for me, that's a really good barometer about the health of this business.  
I think, as to whether that's sustained, whether these larger parties, larger order sizes sustain, we're going to follow the customer to whichever way they want to go. If the customer starts to come back and split the ticket and we have smaller check, I think so long as we continue to focus on the execution, we'll be just fine on that.

I think to be fair, we had started thinking about accelerating some of the openings internationally, even pre-pandemic. Certainly, nothing that's happened in the pandemic has changed our thinking at all related to that and, if anything, I think, just reinforces our opportunity to continue growing in many of those international operated markets.  
As far as any constraints, I think the constraints really are -- from a market perspective, there is kind of a sweet spot of what they can open in terms of building a pipeline, having the right real estate representatives, opening in a way that isn't disruptive to the rest of the market. So we do have a lot of tools that we use to determine kind of what the appropriate opening level is for the markets.  
I think we do have opportunity to open quicker in many of those markets than we have been. And I think our expectation is that we will continue to grow in many of those International Operated Markets where we still believe there's a lot of opportunity. We're just in the midst of going through our plans right now for 2022. So I don't have specifics yet for 2022. But I think it is fair to say that we would expect our openings next year to be higher than they are in 2021 and continue to kind of increase that level for a little while where we will.
We've talked about unit growth being about 1.5% to 2% contribution to sales growth. Right now, we're at the lower end of that, more of the 1.5%, and likely not a lot above that for '22 because it really relates to '21 openings.

I know you're partnering with IBM because they have expertise. But as I think about loyalty, one of the things that, I think, has emerged is that's really about it's not just the data is what you do with it. Are there opportunities to partner, whether it's IBM or other tech companies, within loyalty or maybe more broadly that you see where outside expertise would be useful? And maybe more specifically, is this a signal as to how you're thinking about technology in-sourcing versus outsourcing? So where McDonald's should own the technology or really has specific expertise and maybe customer-facing or UI versus some of the sort of behind-the-scenes capabilities? So just anything you can signal about that. And longer term, as we think about your technology budget, does this change over time, not just a bit front but more broadly."

And I think this is one where I'd go back to the conversation you and I had, I don't know, it's probably several quarters ago now on this topic of how do we think about technology, what's in-sourced, what's outsourced. And my thinking then is the same as my thinking now, which is there are certain times where it may make sense for us to go acquire a technology so that we can accelerate the development of that, make sure that it is bespoke to McDonald's needs. But at some point, that technology reaches a level of development where I think getting it to a partner who can then blow it out and scale it globally makes more sense. 
And so I think what we did with Apprente is very much consistent with that philosophy, which is we've had it for a couple of years. I've been really pleased with how the team has progressed, the development of that. We're seeing some very encouraging results in the restaurants that we have it. But there's still a lot of work that needs to go into introducing other languages, being able to do it across 14,000 restaurants with all the various menu permutations, et cetera. And that work is beyond the scale of our core competencies, if you will.  
And so I think in this case, IBM is a natural partner for us. I think going forward, it's going to be very much on a case-by-case basis as to when we just -- we go from day 1 with a partner versus where we might bring something in-house for a period of time. But the nice thing about being McDonald's is where everybody's first call when it comes to a partner in the restaurant industry. And so we have a really good visibility to the various partners out there. And certainly, our -- I think our overall view is we are best on a long-term sustaining basis to use others externally partnering. But again, there may be time to time where there's benefit for us from being able to accelerate and learn to have it in for a period of time."

I was wondering if you could get into how your customer demographics may be shifting in the U.S.? And specifically, it seems like either through product innovation, obviously, new mediums in terms of ordering or even in marketing, you're talking to a younger customer than you've been talking to for years.

Well, I think not just in our industry but across, I'd say, most consumer industries, the youth and the preferences and desires of the youth drive consumer demand, whether it's in apparel, beverages, restaurant, et cetera. And so it becomes a very natural demographic target. That 18 to 35 target is, you know from a media standpoint, probably the most coveted, the most expensive demographic to reach, because of the brand preferences that get formed at an early age and that sustained over the lifetime value of that customer.  
So I think you're absolutely spot-on in observing that we have made a more demonstrable push against that demographic. And I expect that, that's going to continue. And it's one that we believe at McDonald's that we have a brand that can be part of culture. And we probably have not -- in my view, we haven't done enough to lean into the stature of our brand and culture and how we can connect to that. And so I think finding properties, finding a message that resonate with youth but also resonate more broadly in culture for us is a big upside opportunity.  
And we're seeing other markets. The U.S. started some of this, but we're seeing other markets like Russia, like Spain pick up on the Famous Orders concept and getting very similar results on that. And just to me, it speaks to our -- the ability of this brand and what we can do with it.  
I think in terms of how is that changing the mix, it's still early days on this. So I think we are seeing certainly the brand sentiment improving, but we're also having to move a pretty big boat here. And so we're not yet seeing it show up in terms of a big demographic shift within the business. But frankly, nor did we. This is something that I think for us is going to sustain over several years. And it's -- again, it's about making sure that our brand is 1 that is as powerful in the future as it has been in the past."

But my bigger picture question was on free cash flow. Do you anticipate the free cash flow yield moving up over time? I would imagine that over 100% would be achievable given the gap between depreciation and maintenance CapEx on the owned real estate franchise restaurants?

For the third quarter at least, both the U.S. and IOM, comps were a little bit higher in -- with franchisees than they were with company operated. That's not dramatically different than historical, I'll say. So for a while, that's generally been the trend. Some of that is driven certainly in the U.S., depending on what the location of where our company-operated stores are versus others. But in general, franchisees are running a little bit ahead of company-operated on a comp basis. And that is what we saw both in the third quarter and on a year-to-date basis, I'll say, this year.  
Related to free cash flow, we've said we expect our free cash flow coverage to conversion to be greater than 90%, both for this year and going forward. I don't want to surmise of when or if it could get to over 100%. For now, we're going to stay with that over 90%. I think we are seeing that we have a pretty healthy flow-through that -- in our P&L that converts to free cash flow.  
The big question right now, and again, as I mentioned a couple of times, we're still in our planning phase to look at capital requirements and what that means related to some of the opening opportunities that I mentioned earlier, et cetera. So we've got to take all those pieces into account to figure out what the free cash flow profile looks for several years. We do expect free cash flow dollars to continue to grow. And I would expect that free cash flow conversion certainly to stay at high levels."

As the largest restaurant business in the world, our size and scale are a competitive advantage that we've built and nurtured for over 6 decades. Our 40,000 restaurants in over 100 countries are predominantly run by local owner operators, connecting the business to the 40,000 communities in which we operate. These local connections embed a level of agility that complements our size and scale, enabling local teams to adapt and adjust to operating conditions that vary by country, community and even restaurant in real time. It's what makes McDonald's special. It's also how we're able to use scale and agility, how we can be both big and nimble to achieve something truly unique.  
And thanks to the resilience across all 3 legs of our stool: franchisees, suppliers and the company, and the scale and agility that we deploy collectively, I'm confident in our ability to meet whatever challenges may confront us. From restrictions driven by new COVID variants, to supply chain pressures and labor shortages across industries, to any other unknown unknowns.  
We're approaching the 1-year anniversary of Accelerating the Arches, which took shape in response to changing customer needs early in the pandemic. Rooted in the inherent strengths of the McDonald's System and brand, it's proving to be the right strategy with the right focus at the right time. We're evolving the customer experience in ways, both large and small, to meet changing customer needs and maintain our market leadership. Our 3 growth pillars known as our MCDs, marketing, core menu; and the 3Ds of digital, delivery and drive-thru, guide our business. This includes amplifying contactless channels like delivery and drive-thru and creating digital experiences that are seamless, personalized and easy to use. We've continued to make excellent progress this past quarter, and I want to thank the McDonald's people all over the world who are performing under trying conditions.  
Let me turn it over to Kevin to walk through our top line results."
139488,1683568458,2438786,"McDonald's Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2021",2021-10-27,"Earnings Calls","McDonald's Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Chris. Our third quarter top line results represent a continuation of our broad-based business momentum around the world, with global comp sales up nearly 13% or 10% on a 2-year basis. Our International Operated Markets have continued to recover,",903,"Thanks, Chris. Our third quarter top line results represent a continuation of our broad-based business momentum around the world, with global comp sales up nearly 13% or 10% on a 2-year basis. Our International Operated Markets have continued to recover, accelerating 2-year comp trends in the third quarter to nearly 9%, as most markets operated with fewer government restrictions. There's still varied performance across the big 5 markets within the IOM segment, ranging from strong double-digit 2-year growth in the U.K. and Canada to low single-digit 2-year growth in Australia, Germany and France, as those countries have been slower to recover from the pandemic.  
The U.K. continued to lead the segment in the third quarter, driven by growth in delivery and digital channels as well as strong menu and marketing promotions like Monopoly. In Canada, the strong 2-year comp momentum was driven by successful marketing activity, including core extensions like the Grand Mac and Spicy Nuggets and growth in the 3Ds of drive-thru, delivery and digital, even as dine-in restrictions have lifted.  
In France and Germany, comp sales exceeded 2019 levels for the first time in the third quarter. Germany's positive performance was supported by expanded deployment of delivery; the national launch of our loyalty program, MyMcDonald's Rewards; and a taste of McDonald's promotion featuring value offerings like McChicken. France benefited from continued strength in delivery and strong menu and marketing promotions with a focus on Family. Market conditions are challenging with the adoption of vaccine pass restrictions for both customers and crew in France and several other countries.  
Performance in Australia was impacted by significant stay-at-home restrictions, affecting over half of the restaurants for nearly the entire quarter. While comp sales were relatively flat for the quarter, the market was positive on a 2-year basis and continued to grow its delivery channel, achieving record delivery sales for the quarter. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect the IOM segment to maintain a relatively similar 2-year comp trend as Q3.   
In the U.S., we maintained our momentum with Q3 comp sales up nearly 10% or 14.6% on a 2-year basis. We continued to see positive comps across all dayparts on a 2-year basis with sustained double-digit comps at dinner and breakfast. At the same time, franchisees continue to achieve record-high restaurant cash flow. Our U.S. franchisees have never been better positioned to weather the labor and inflation pressures while still investing in growth. Performance in the U.S. remains driven by strong average-check growth, reflecting larger order sizes and menu price increases.  
The big bets we've made during the pandemic are paying dividends across the business and enabling us to maintain our QSR leadership. Menu and marketing efforts with products like the Crispy Chicken Sandwich and successful Famous Orders like the Saweetie Meal have elevated our brand and helped drive underlying sales growth across the business. The launch of our loyalty program in the U.S. has exceeded expectations and is driving increased digital adoption. In just a few short months, we already have over 21 million members enrolled, with over 15 million active loyalty members earning rewards, and we expect that number to continue to grow. Chris will share more loyalty headlines in a few minutes.  
We've reopened nearly 80% of our dining rooms in the U.S. Roughly 3,000 dining rooms remain closed in high-risk COVID areas as we continue to prioritize the health and safety of our customers and crew. In restaurants where we have reopened dining rooms, front-counter and kiosk sales remain below pre-pandemic levels, but we're seeing that even modest increases in these channels helped to relieve operational pressure in the drive-thru. The strong performance in the U.S. has continued into October. We're currently seeing low double-digit comps on a 2-year basis, and we expect that to continue through the rest of the fourth quarter.  
Turning to the International Developmental Licensed segment. Comp sales were up nearly 17% for the quarter or about 5% on a 2-year basis. Performance was largely driven by positive results in Japan and Latin America, partly offset by negative comps in China. Japan maintained momentum in Q3 with comps up 13%, achieving an impressive 6 consecutive years of quarterly comp sales growth despite restaurants operating with government restrictions. The market's performance is being driven by a continued commitment to serve customers safely and conveniently through our drive-thru and digital channels as well as strong marketing and limited time promotions.  
China continues to be impacted by both COVID resurgences, which restarted in June and lasted throughout the quarter, and a softening economy. While comps for the quarter were negative, the market continues to build its digital presence as they now have over 100 million active digital members. In addition, we've accelerated new restaurant growth in China. With over 500 new restaurants already opened this year, we now expect to open roughly 650 restaurants for the year, exceeding our original plan. China remains a critically important market for us and one where we have confidence in the long-term opportunity. So we plan to get even more aggressive in opening new restaurants in this market.  
With our strong overall sales performance for the first 3 quarters of the year, we now expect system-wide sales to be up in the high teens in constant currencies for the full year.  
Now I'll turn it back to Chris to talk more about MCD growth pillars driving our global business."

Our results are a testament to the focus of our teams on driving growth through our M, C and Ds. And we're confident that momentum will continue. After playing a pivotal role in building out our [ Fan Truth ] strategy in the U.S., Morgan Flatley is transitioning into the role of Global Chief Marketing Officer. Following the instantly iconic global campaign Morgan developed with BTS, Famous Orders again crossed borders with both Russia and Spain launching successful campaigns with local celebrities in the third quarter. These markets leaned into the idea that truly, no matter how big or famous you are or where you are in the world, everyone has their go-to McDonald's order. As Morgan elevates to the global role, we're excited to welcome Tariq Hassan to the McFamily as Chief Marketing and Digital Customer Experience Officer for McDonald's U.S.A. I've known Tariq for many years and I'm confident Tariq will maintain our marketing momentum in the U.S.  
Behind our marketing success is McDonald's craveable core menu. In the U.S., Crispy Chicken Sandwich sales continue to exceed expectations. This translated into significant growth in QSR chicken market share as we continue to support the Crispy Chicken Sandwich platform with culturally relevant marketing.  
In the U.K., we launched our McSpicy Sandwich, which generated the market's best chicken promotional results on record. And in Canada, our Spicy McNuggets promotion had a halo effect on McNuggets sales.  
This quarter, we introduced the McPlant Sandwich in Austria and the Netherlands as a limited time offer, and both the U.K. and Ireland launched the McPlant in a limited number of restaurants, with a goal to roll out nationwide in January.  McPlant is available for other markets to pull down based on customer demand. As always, we'll do what McDonald's does best: listen to our customers. When people are ready for the McPlant, we'll be ready for them.  
Being customer-driven is about more than just menu items. It's also about delivering feel-good experiences when and where our customers want McDonald's. So we can bring the Golden Arches to as many customers as possible. That means continuing to increase our engagement across drive-thru, digital and delivery. As we do that, we're seeing an increase in sales mix across these channels. In our top 6 markets, over 20% of sales, or about $13 billion, year-to-date came through digital channels, whether it was through our app, kiosk in our restaurants or delivery. Our loyalty program has been an instant fan favorite and delivers great value to our most loyal customers. It also creates another touch point to increase engagement and take our relationship with customers to more responsive, more personalized places.  
We're already seeing increased customer satisfaction and higher frequency among digital customers compared to nondigital. In September, we launched our loyalty program in Germany, quickly amassing millions of active rewards to customers. And we're on track to bring MyMcDonald's Rewards to Canada by the end of the year, and the U.K. and Australia in the first half of 2022, which means that by mid-2022, loyalty programs will be in our top 6 markets, inclusive of France, which has had a strong loyalty program for many years.  
Delivery is another bet we made long before COVID and one that we believe will continue to be a staple for consumers for years to come. Over the past 5 years, our delivery footprint has grown from just 3,000 of our restaurants to more than 32,000 restaurants across 100 countries. As the needs of our customers have continued to change, delivery has enabled us to increase our reach and grow sales around the world. We're actively engaged in discussions with our largest delivery providers to support the extraordinary growth in our delivery business. We look forward to sharing more information on these global partnerships soon, but this is yet another example of where our scale confers upon us, competitive advantages.  
Lastly, our drive-thrus. With the drive-thru presence that is second to none, our drive-thru sales across our top 6 markets continue to stay elevated versus pre-pandemic levels even as dining rooms reopen. We've previously shared that we have been testing automated order taking in the drive-thru at several restaurants in the U.S. This was enabled by our acquisition of Apprente, now known as McD Tech Labs in 2019. These tests have shown substantial benefits to customers and the crew experience.  
To enable development and scale deployment of this program, McDonald's has now entered into a strategic relationship with IBM. In my mind, IBM is the ideal partner for McDonald's, given their expertise in building AI-powered customer care solutions and voice recognition. IBM will now acquire McD Tech Labs to further accelerate the development of automated order taking.  
We're in a strong position today, focused on executing our plan, running great restaurants and taking advantage of our unique size and scale to feed and foster communities. For more on our Q3 financials and our outlook moving forward, I'll turn it back over to Kevin."

Our strong performance for the quarter resulted in adjusted earnings per share of $2.76, which excludes a gain as we completed the partial divestiture of our ownership in McDonald's Japan. Our strong sales generated an increase in restaurant margins of about $500 million for the quarter.  
G&A increased about 20% in constant currencies for the quarter, driven by higher incentive-based compensation expense as a result of company performance exceeding our plan this year. We still expect G&A to be about 2.4% of system-wide sales for the full year.  
Year-to-date adjusted operating margin was 44.3%, reflecting the improved restaurant margins across all segments and higher other operating income compared to last year. Foreign currency translation benefited Q3 results by $0.04 per share. Based on current exchange rates, we expect currency to have a minimal impact on fourth quarter EPS with an estimated full year benefit of $0.21 to $0.23. As usual, this is directional guidance only as rates will likely change as we move through the rest of the year.  
And finally, in September, our Board of Directors approved a 7% dividend increase to the equivalent of $5.52 annually. This marked 45 years of increasing our dividend for shareholders, further reinforcing our confidence in accelerating the Arches. We also announced the resumption of our share repurchase program. As a reminder, we have suspended share buybacks at the beginning of the pandemic as we took on additional debt to provide liquidity support to the McDonald's system. Since then, we've been focused on returning to pre-COVID debt ratios that support our strong investment-grade credit rating. Going forward, we're confident that our operating performance will continue to fuel growth in our already-strong free cash flow profile. As a result, we're committed to our historical capital allocation priorities. First, to invest in new restaurants, existing restaurants and opportunities to grow the business. Then we expect to return all free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases over time.  
Now I'll turn it back to Chris to close."

And even though the pandemic has greatly altered so much in our business and our world, it hasn't changed the simple fact that we're better together than we are apart.  
For a long time, we had to bridge physical separation with technology and new ways of working. But as vaccines have reached critical mass of people in the U.S. and some places around the world, we're beginning to see a different future taking shape. Finally, we're coming together again in our communities, and cities around the world are beginning to open up and get back to a new normal.  
The same is true for our global McFamily. After being closed for over 1.5 years, the McDonald's headquarters reopened on October 11, and it was inspiring to see teams collaborating again in person. To protect the health and safety of our staff, we required all U.S.-based corporate employees to get vaccinated, and we're continuing to monitor local data and seek guidance from public health officials. Even though we've only been back for a few short weeks, we have found that working in the office together spurs a level of collaboration, creativity and connectedness that simply could not be replicated from behind our screens. And we're going to be doing the same thing with our global system soon.  
Next April, in Orlando, franchisees, suppliers and employees will convene for our worldwide convention in person for the first time in 4 years. It's already shaping up to be an experience unlike any other. Together, we'll showcase McDonald's bright future. We'll demonstrate the power of technology for our restaurants, learn how innovation is enhancing the customer experience and discuss plans in the pipeline to drive our Accelerating the Arches growth plan.  
As I've said before, it's not only important that we grow, it's equally important that we grow sustainably and in ways that positively impact the communities we serve. Driving climate action has been a centerpiece of our long-term strategy for a while now, and our focus has sharpened. In fact, in 2014, we established public commitments intended to make our entire system more sustainable by 2020. Among our goals were to sustainably source 100% of key ingredients, including coffee and beef.  
Looking back, this was just the beginning of what would become a much bolder agenda that we are pursuing with urgency. As the threats to our planet have grown, we are responding with a more ambitious plan for ourselves and for the entire industry. We achieved many of our 2020 goals ahead of schedule, and we built upon that momentum to set new ambitious targets. Just this past September, we announced that we would reduce the use of conventional virgin plastics in Happy Meal toys by 90% by 2025. We recently announced our ambition to achieve net 0 emissions across global operations by 2050, and we joined the UN race to 0. And I look forward to sharing more of our sustainability story with climate delegates at the United Nations Climate Change Conference, known as COP26 in Glasgow next week.  
We believe we have both a privilege and a responsibility to help lead on issues that matter most in communities, and there is no issue more globally important and locally impactful than protecting our planet for generations to come. This is why I continue to remain optimistic about what lies ahead for McDonald's. Accelerating the Arches, fortified by our purpose and guided by our values, makes me confident not just in the future successes of our business, but also for the future of the communities that we serve. With that, we'll begin Q&A."

And you talked about how there's going to be low double-digit same-store sales in 4Q. You're seeing that in October. You're obviously very strong, but does just a bit of a deceleration from the very strong sales you saw in the quarter. So curious if you can help with any numbers to kind of help parse that out a little bit more, given it's a challenge for everybody.

I'll start and then let Kevin fill in any other points on this. But certainly, it's a very challenging staffing environment in the U.S., a little bit less so in Europe, but still challenging in Europe.  
In the U.S., for us, we are seeing, as I've mentioned a few calls ago, that there is wage inflation. Our franchisees are increasing wages. They're over 10% wage inflation year-to-date that we're seeing in our McOpCo restaurants. We're up over 15% on wages. And that is having some helpful benefit. Certainly, the higher wages that you pay, it allows you to stay competitive. But we're also seeing that it's just -- it's very challenging right now in the market to find the level of talent that you need. And so for us, it is putting some pressure on things like operating hours, where we might be dialing back late night, for example, from what we would ordinarily be doing. It's also putting some pressure around speed of service, where we are down a little bit on speed of service over the last kind of year-to-date and even in the last quarter. That's also a function of not being able to have the restaurants fully staffed.  
But I would just -- I would tell you that it's not unsolvable either. And we're seeing in our McOpCo restaurants that a really strong focus on the shift manager and providing the training to the shift managers to keep engaged with the crew to keep the crew motivated that, that can make a difference. But certainly, I was hoping and expecting that we were going to see the situation improve maybe a little bit more quickly than what's materialized. And I think it is going to continue to be a difficult environment for the next several quarters.

And if we're able to sustain that for a long period of time, I think we'd be pretty happy with that. Certainly, there have been some changes that have gone on related to more of the full-service restaurants reopening, stimulus benefits, unemployment benefits rolling off.

Certainly, pricing and cost pressures are a bigger focus over the last few quarters than they had been previously. Last quarter, I think I talked about how we were seeing roughly a 6% increase year-over-year in the U.S. We are still seeing that, and that's pretty much the level we expect for the full year 2021 over 2020, right around that 6%. And that's really to cover both labor cost pressures and commodity cost pressures that we're seeing.  
If we step back for a second, obviously, we're all seeing the environment out there on a global basis, which is some pressure on commodities, certainly some pressure on labor availability and cost, supply chain disruptions, et cetera, that are all putting some pressure. We haven't seen, I'll say, any more resistant to our price increases than we've seen historically. So that -- the 6% has been pretty well received by customers. We do certainly have a very big focus to make sure that we are balancing cost pressures and being able to cover those, with making sure that our value perception by customers continue to be favorable. And we are continuing to see those surveys and scores, from a value favorability perspective, still positive from customers. So we'll continue to keep an eye on it.  
From a commodity perspective, commodities were up roughly 2% or so through the first 9 months, but we expect for the full year for those to be up roughly 3.5% to 4%, which will put a little bit of additional pressure on the fourth quarter, obviously. And then going into next year from a food and paper cost perspective, we would expect our cost to be up relatively in line with the industry. Right now, that expectation is roughly mid-single digits. And so we will continue to keep an eye both on the cost side and the pricing side.  
Both we and our franchisees, over the last couple of years, have been using a third party for pricing advisory services, if you will, using a pretty deep consumer-based research approach. And so we have, I think, more science built into our pricing decisions that take into account market conditions, competitive factors, et cetera. So like I said, we'll keep a close eye on cost and pricing. But right now, so far, it's been received okay by customers."

Thanks, Jared, for the question. I'll take that. I think it is fair to say, again, just thinking about the global environment, there are certainly supply chain challenges across the world on various things related to kitchen equipment; technology equipment; I'll say, pandemic-related disruptions; slower permitting times. All the things that you mentioned are making it a bigger challenge, I'll say, to get restaurants open than historically.  
For this year, we still expect roughly, in our IOM and U.S. markets, it's down a little bit from where we were previously. There will be a few that will spill over now into 2022. That's more of a timing issue than anything else. And so because of things taking a little bit longer, some of the openings that we thought we may be able to get done this year will spill into beginning of 2022.  
Going forward, I think we're still bullish on openings. We still expect our openings to increase, both in our wholly owned markets as well as our developmental licensed markets next year. The increase that you saw right now for 2021 is being primarily driven by China and a few other developmental licensed markets. So that's why the overall openings is up this year.  
But I'd say overall, it's a bigger challenge than it has been, but our supply chain does a phenomenal job of kind of just managing the whole process, making sure that we've got contingency plans. We're in touch extremely frequently with all of our suppliers. And I feel pretty good about where we are compared to where others may be just because of the strength of our supply chain. But I think it is fair to say that it's a bigger challenge than it's been historically."

In the markets where we're seeing restrictions relaxed, those businesses are bouncing back and bouncing back in a very healthy way.  
The markets that you mentioned, like in Australia, like in France, they have certainly had to navigate a more restrictive COVID environment. We did get a peak earlier in the year when things appeared to be getting better before the Delta variant that those markets were poised to spring back.  
So from our expectation, as soon as the conditions in those markets start to become more favorable in terms of being able to return to normal operating conditions, we expect those markets are going to perform in a very healthy way because that's how they were performing pre-pandemic.

So it's not that we have a reach opportunity, it's about driving frequency in this business. And we've seen in the places that where we have deployed loyalty that it absolutely does increase customer frequency. So for us, that's really encouraging.  
I think to the broader point of what do you do with the data, we had set out earlier an aspiration where we wanted to have 40% of our customers be known customers. Today, that number is probably only about 5% of the customers where we actually know who is the customer, what do they buy, what have they bought previously. And then you can imagine all sorts of things that you're able to learn about customers and their preferences when you're able to get more and more of your transactions where you know who the customer is. And loyalty is certainly the way that you get that customer to engage and share information with you.  
So for us, I think we're just getting started on it, but very optimistic about what loyal -- loyalty can do in this business. And by mid next year, we're going to have loyalty in our top 6 markets. So I think the ability to give you a better idea of what exactly it's doing for the business, I think once we have that kind of scale and roll out, we'll be able to talk with even more specificity about it."

Well, I think a shout-out to the U.S. team and our owner operators for doing a great job of sustaining that momentum, as you mentioned, through what continues to be a challenging environment for all the reasons that have come up on this call, labor challenges, commodity inflation, et cetera. I think the momentum that we're seeing in the U.S. business is not something that just came about in the last couple of years. This was something that started several years ago with the foundation that we've put in place in the U.S. And the foundation was around modernizing our estate, improving the food, making investments in digital and delivery. And I think the fact that we were able to get all those things sort of embedded in the business back in, call it, 2017, 2018 set us up really well for what none of us could have predicted, which is what we've now experienced through COVID.  
So I think for us, what I feel good about with the U.S. is we've got sort of the foundational elements in place for this business to outperform or perform quite well for an extended period of time. As to how you do that, it's going to be back to the strategy that we have with Accelerating the Arches. It's a focus on great marketing, driving core menu and outperforming on the 3Ds: delivery, drive-thru and digital.  
And so for us, message that I'm talking about to the teams internally is we have the right strategy. It's all about execution. And we've got to execute at a really high level. If we do that, on those 3 dimensions, then I'm confident. But we also can't get complacent. And I think there's a good healthy level of dialogue going on in the U.S. right now about just keeping that hunger, keeping that momentum going. And once you've got it, you don't want to give it up, and that's the mindset right now."

But -- so we don't share a specific breakout on delivery, but suffice to say, delivery for us continues to be a really important driver for us. The business has grown by billions and billions. I think it's fair to share over the last several years. And we're continuing to see, even as markets reopen and things start to get back to normal in places where they're able to get the dining room, et cetera, back open, delivery remains elevated. And so for us, I think what has become apparent is delivery was meeting a customer need that I don't think any of us fully appreciated even maybe a few years ago. So it's here to stay.  
What we're trying to do with our partners, the way that we had approached some of our delivery conversations previously with our 3PO partners, in many cases, those were discussions that were happening at the market level. And when you are a company the size and scale of McDonald's, we certainly have, we believe, a great proposition for 3PO partners on a global basis.  
And so what we're trying to do through these conversations is leverage the fact that we are the largest restaurant company in the world, that we have an ability to drive traffic onto 3PO apps that we think is second to none. And that, that should be reflected in the rates that we're paying with our 3PO partners. So those conversations are proceeding, but I'd say there is a good recognition on both sides that we need each other. And I'm optimistic that we'll be able to get to a good resolution on that in the next couple of months."

I think early on in the pandemic, I think we believed that the average check would decline quicker than it certainly has. And I think the reason right now at least is because the channels that much of our sales are going through, which continue to be things like drive-thru, delivery, digital, as you mentioned, people are still going through and ordering for several people. If you're getting delivery, you're getting it for your family or for at least a couple of people. If -- a lot of the folks going through drive-thru are getting orders for several people. And so we are seeing those larger order sizes continue. And I think at least some of that will be stickier than we originally may have thought. So we don't anticipate, certainly in the near term, average check returning back to the level that was at pre-pandemic.  
I think -- I lost my train of thought, but I do think we will continue to see -- the check continue to grow as those channels continue to grow. And like I said, we're not seeing any degradation of that check at this point."

And for me, that's a really good barometer about the health of this business.  
I think, as to whether that's sustained, whether these larger parties, larger order sizes sustain, we're going to follow the customer to whichever way they want to go. If the customer starts to come back and split the ticket and we have smaller check, I think so long as we continue to focus on the execution, we'll be just fine on that. But certainly, I think what you're seeing right now, and what we're expecting is that some of the benefits that we're seeing around larger check and the mix, the channel mix that goes with that, we're expecting that to continue."

In that situation, I think we have more evidence that it is filling an unmet need that certainly existed in the U.K. on their menus. So early results in the U.K. are very encouraging. A couple of other markets as well in Europe have seen success with McPlant and the rollout on that.  
So I think this is one where we've said all along, we're going to let the markets decide when is the best time to pull it down based on what the customer acceptance or interest is in this concept. I think certainly, I can say at this point, there are definitely a couple of European markets where there is customer acceptance for it.

I think to be fair, we had started thinking about accelerating some of the openings internationally, even pre-pandemic. Certainly, nothing that's happened in the pandemic has changed our thinking at all related to that and, if anything, I think, just reinforces our opportunity to continue growing in many of those International Operated Markets.  
As far as any constraints, I think the constraints really are -- from a market perspective, there is kind of a sweet spot of what they can open in terms of building a pipeline, having the right real estate representatives, opening in a way that it isn't disruptive to the rest of the market. So we do have a lot of tools that we use to determine kind of what the appropriate opening level is for the markets.  
I think we do have opportunity to open quicker in many of those markets than we have been. And I think our expectation is that we will continue to grow in many of those International Operated Markets where we still believe there's a lot of opportunity. We're just in the midst of going through our plans right now for 2022. So I don't have specifics yet for 2022. But I think it is fair to say that we would expect our openings next year to be higher than they are in 2021 and continue to kind of increase that level for a little while where we will.
We've talked about unit growth being about 1.5% to 2% contribution to sales growth. Right now, we're at the lower end of that, more of the 1.5%, and likely not a lot above that for '22 because it really relates to '21 openings.

And maybe more specifically, is this a signal as to how you're thinking about technology in-sourcing versus outsourcing? So where McDonald's should own the technology or really has specific expertise and maybe customer-facing or UI versus some of the sort of behind-the-scenes capabilities? So just anything you can signal about that. And longer term, as we think about your technology budget, does this change over time, not just with Apprente but more broadly."

And I think this is one where I'd go back to the conversation you and I had, I don't know, it's probably several quarters ago now on this topic of how do we think about technology, what's in-sourced, what's outsourced. And my thinking then is the same as my thinking now, which is there are certain times where it may make sense for us to go acquire a technology so that we can accelerate the development of that, make sure that it is bespoke to McDonald's needs. But at some point, that technology reaches a level of development where I think getting it to a partner who can then blow it out and scale it globally makes more sense. 
And so I think what we did with Apprente is very much consistent with that philosophy, which is we've had it for a couple of years. I've been really pleased with how the team has progressed, the development of that. We're seeing some very encouraging results in the restaurants that we have it. But there's still a lot of work that needs to go into introducing other languages, being able to do it across 14,000 restaurants with all the various menu permutations, et cetera. And that work is beyond the scale of our core competencies, if you will.  
And so I think in this case, IBM is a natural partner for us. I think going forward, it's going to be very much on a case-by-case basis as to when we just -- we go from day 1 with a partner versus where we might bring something in-house for a period of time. But the nice thing about being McDonald's is we're everybody's first call when it comes to a partner in the restaurant industry. And so we have a really good visibility to the various partners out there. And certainly, our -- I think our overall view is we are best on a long-term sustaining basis to use others externally partnering. But again, there may be time to time where there's benefit for us from being able to accelerate and learn to have it in for a period of time."

Well, I think not just in our industry but across, I'd say, most consumer industries, the youth and the preferences and desires of the youth drive consumer demand, whether it's in apparel, beverages, restaurant, et cetera. And so it becomes a very natural demographic target. That 18 to 35 target is, you know from a media standpoint, probably the most coveted, the most expensive demographic to reach, because of the brand preferences that get formed at an early age and that sustain over the lifetime value of that customer.  
So I think you're absolutely spot-on in observing that we have made a more demonstrable push against that demographic. And I expect that, that's going to continue. And it's one that we believe at McDonald's that we have a brand that can be part of culture. And we probably have not -- in my view, we haven't done enough to lean into the stature of our brand and culture and how we can connect to that. And so I think finding properties, finding a message that resonate with youth but also resonate more broadly in culture for us is a big upside opportunity.  
And we're seeing other markets. The U.S. started some of this, but we're seeing other markets like Russia, like Spain pick up on the Famous Orders concept and getting very similar results on that. And just to me, it speaks to our -- the ability of this brand and what we can do with it.  
I think in terms of how is that changing the mix, it's still early days on this. So I think we are seeing certainly the brand sentiment improving, but we're also having to move a pretty big boat here. And so we're not yet seeing it show up in terms of a big demographic shift within the business. But frankly, nor did we. This is something that I think for us is going to sustain over several years. And it's -- again, it's about making sure that our brand is one that is as powerful in the future as it has been in the past."

I would imagine that over 100% would be achievable given the gap between depreciation and maintenance CapEx on the owned real estate franchise restaurants.

For the third quarter at least, both the U.S. and IOM, comps were a little bit higher in -- with franchisees than they were with company operated. That's not dramatically different than historical, I'll say. So for a while, that's generally been the trend. Some of that is driven certainly in the U.S., depending on what the location of where our company-operated stores are versus others. But in general, franchisees are running a little bit ahead of company-operated on a comp basis. And that is what we saw both in the third quarter and on a year-to-date basis, I'll say, this year.  
Related to free cash flow, we've said we expect our free cash flow coverage to conversion to be greater than 90%, both for this year and going forward. I don't want to surmise of when or if it could get to over 100%. For now, we're going to stay with that over 90%. I think we are seeing that we have a pretty healthy flow-through that -- in our P&L that converts to free cash flow.  
The big question right now, and again, as I mentioned a couple of times, we're still in our planning phase to look at capital requirements and what that means related to some of the opening opportunities that I mentioned earlier, et cetera. So we've got to take all those pieces into account to figure out what the free cash flow profile looks for several years. We do expect free cash flow dollars to continue to grow.
