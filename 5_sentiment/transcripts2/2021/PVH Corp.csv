Joining me on the call today are Mike Shaffer, our COO and CFO; and Dana Perlman, our EVP, Chief Strategy Officer and Treasurer. 
It's a true pleasure to be leading the call this morning and an honor to lead this great company as we drive towards an accelerated recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, and at the same time, start to build our next growth chapter to win in the new normal. Pre COVID, there was already an unprecedented amount of change taking place in the apparel industry, driven mostly by technology and the consumer, which the pandemic only accelerated. The new normal will not be a static state rather an ever-increasing rate of change that we will be ready to compete and win in. 2020 will be remembered as one of the most challenging moments for our industry from a geopolitical, economic and public health perspective due to the pandemic. Our teams not only came together to successfully navigate the crisis, we also positioned PVH to march in a stronger position. 
I would like to thank all our associates for their hard work, resilience and ability to rise up to any challenge we have encountered. In particular, our dedicated retail store and distribution center associates who have managed to keep our business running throughout the toughest of COVID times. Before the pandemic hit, I was fortunate to spend time traveling and visiting many of our teams and partners around the world. I saw first hand many of the underlying strength that we are now focusing in on and connecting closer to where the consumer is going than any time before, all in an effort to drive sustainable, profitable growth. 
Our focus is on winning with the consumer, driving brand relevance, taking profitable market share and building further strength in our platform capabilities, and over time, to do that more efficiently. To accomplish this, we will work with a strong consumer focus, become even more demand and data-driven, and create value in a systematic, repeatable way, where we will continuously learn and improve. We have taken this time to proactively evolve our business with special focus on capturing where the consumer is going. We have been accelerating our digital businesses and reallocating additional resources to drive growth in this highly important channel. We also continue to shift our product towards the comfort and casual categories that are working with consumers today. And lastly, we doubled down on our international businesses, where we continue to see a very strong recovery and significant revenue opportunity for both Calvin and Tommy, while also contributing a higher operating margin. 
Our increased and sustained focus on these aspects of the business will drive long-term revenue and margin growth for our shareholders, driven by gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage. And importantly, I will continue to live our strong corporate values, including our unwavering commitment to empower our people and help drive the fashion industry forward in sustainability and making a real and lasting positive impact within inclusion and diversity. I will now share some key insights on how we drove performance in the fourth quarter and in our first quarter of 2021 so far and how we are progressing towards an accelerated recovery. Mike will then share more financial details. 
Even though our fourth quarter results faced greater-than-expected challenges due to virus resurgences and lockdown throughout multiple regions, we were able to deliver on our expectations from a top line, gross margin and EBIT perspective. We focused our execution around our strategic priorities and drove an above plan performance for the holiday period. And we are pleased that we have successfully sold through our seasonal inventory, allowing us to enter spring 2021 in a very clean inventory position. 
I'd like to share some proof points demonstrating our progress against the 3 value-creating areas that we have shared with you previously. First, we continue to supercharge our e-commerce channel. We are rapidly growing our overall digital penetration by both expanding our D2C digital business as well as deepening our strong relationships with third-party digital partners. Fiscal 2020 represented our strongest ever digital sales performance, up over 40%, including nearly 70% growth on our own site. And we doubled our penetration to close to 25% of total company revenue, all while driving a significant improvement in the channel's profitability. Looking ahead with robust new user growth, our most significant opportunity to drive continued conversion and leverage our data capabilities to further engage, personalize and simplify the shopping experience. 
Secondly, we continue to increase our focus on driving product relevance across our brands and regions. Our teams have taken proactive measures to tighten and refocus assortments as well as rationalizing unproductive SKUs to improve overall sell-through rates. We are optimizing our product development processes and leaning further into our key essentials and Hero products, which is driving positive initial results, including generating higher average unit retail prices. For Calvin, we are building on our global leadership in underwear and intimates, with Hero products such as the modern cotton program while growing in casual categories, including denim, tees and sweatshirts. For Tommy, we are expanding on the brand's casual lifestyle through our Hero products, supported by collaborations for each lifestyle Tommy Hilfiger and Tommy Jeans. We also have a meaningful opportunity to further advance our supply chain capabilities and react faster as consumers' needs continue to change, resulting in shorter lead times that will benefit our overall margin structure. 
Thirdly, we are continuing to evaluate our cost structure in the context of our evolving revenue base. Over the summer, we announced the exit of our heritage branch retail business and a reduction of our North American workforce. In addition, we will be executing on additional cost reduction efforts in certain international markets, while also rightsizing our real estate footprint. We also see a notable opportunity to optimize our internal processes by further scaling our digital and data capabilities. As we realize the benefit from these strategic actions, we will, over time, enhance our overall profitability while allowing for investments in our strategic growth areas. 
While our regions are all in various stages of their recovery, these focus areas continue to guide our teams with clear objectives to operate against to drive an accelerated recovery. 
Turning to our regional update. Let me start with Asia and specifically with China, which has emerged first in the recovery. We remain very pleased with our performance in the market where D2C sales trends continue to be positive, with double-digit growth in the fourth quarter and full year. The lack of travel and tourism continues to benefit local spending in the market. Our team has been successful in accelerating our performance through a number of initiatives, including the following: with supercharged e-commerce, sync online and offline initiatives driving conversion and sales growth in full price stores, while online key events were taking place. We also leaned into our most successful and relevant cash flow categories and Hero products for both Tommy and Calvin, better matching inventory with demand which drove higher full price sell-throughs and lower markdowns. 
With respect to the first quarter, we are pleased with our trends to date, highlighted by a very successful Chinese New Year, including very strong sell-throughs of over 50% for our holiday capsule. We also generated strong performance during the international women's day, generating nearly full sell-throughs on exclusive SKUs while modern crop and gifts set sold out. In addition, we are currently experienced encouraging consumer responses to our spring collections. Overall, while we have seen some virus-related headwinds in certain parts of the region, specifically in Japan, we remain confident in our Asia region overall. 
Moving on to Europe. Despite the much more aggressive lockdowns across the region during the fourth quarter, our teams drove impressive execution, which continued to generate profitable market share gains underscoring the strength in Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein. Given the virus resurgence, 70% of our stores in Europe were temporary closed for portions of the quarter, which was significantly worse than what we had been planning when we spoke with you in early December. Still, we were able to navigate through this difficult time and gain market share through the following: driving the digital business, both on our owned and operated sites as well as with pure players, coupled with our CRM efforts remained an important focus. This is especially important as many stores are closed and we are very well positioned relative to the market. Total digital sales grew by over 60% for the fourth quarter, with even stronger performance on our owned and operated sites. Given temporary store closures, our investments in digital and omnichannel capabilities enabled us to fully leverage our connected retail inventory to serve our digital demand. We also continue to win through product, where we saw great performance across both brands in key essentials and casual sportswear with an improvement in AUR. In addition, as part of Calvin's expansion as a lifestyle brand, we are pleased with our newly in-house footwear division, which represents a big long-term opportunity for the brand and region. 
Future order book demand remains strong, with fall 2021 planned up high single digits versus the prior year and up significantly versus fall 2019, coming off strong double-digit order books for spring 2021. It's important to note that our customers continue to take in spring 2021 goods despite extended lockdowns in certain markets. We also continue to invest in important growth areas. And at the same time, we're also controlling discretionary spend and achieving cost efficiencies in Europe. 
Lastly, turning to North America. During the fourth quarter, we showed strong growth in our digital business while capitalizing on better traffic trends in stores during the holiday period to sell-through seasonal inventory. To ask us of international tourism and some wholesale bankruptcies continue to challenge our North America business. As I shared with you on our last earnings call, we still have work to do in the region in order to pivot more towards the domestic consumer and operate with the same strength as our international businesses. However, we do see positive developments in the region. Digital remains an important driver of our results, with sales on our own sites, up 75%, even with increased promotional activity from the competition and our tight overall inventory position which partially offset additional headwinds in our stores from lockdowns in Canada. 
Similar to international trends, consumer continued to gravitate to key Hero products in comfort, casual and athleisure categories for both Tommy and Calvin. Our fourth quarter marketing efforts continue to be focused to support our digital expansion. We created an interactive virtual holiday theme shop on tommy.com, which generated significant new consumer acquisition, while Calvin leveraged its global assets and campaigns to reinforce brand relevancy in Hero product affinity. 
Lastly, I'd like to welcome Trish Donnelly, who recently joined the PVH team in the newly created role of CEO of PVH Americas. Trish joined PVH following nearly 7 years with Urban Outfitters. As a global CEO for Urban Outfitters, Trish successfully led the business to win with a younger consumer, rapidly scaled e-commerce to an industry-leading penetration while driving very strong connected retail and consumer engagement. We look forward to her leadership in unlocking the region's growth potential, where we see significant opportunity across consumer engagement, product and distribution. 
Our teams continue to take a very thoughtful approach to managing our iconic brands. And I'd like to share a few brief global brand highlights, beginning with Calvin Klein. Global brand health remained strong at over 85% aided brand awareness, with strong growth across our social channels. Responses to our Spring '21 campaign has been positive with growth in relevancy and consideration, continuing the momentum on the #MyCalvins platform for creativity and self-expression. The campaign featured established and emerging talent including recent Grammy winner, Megan Thee Stallion and euphoria Star, Jacob Elordi. In addition, the brand partnered with L.A.-based PJ Lab and launched the first-of-its-kind content series, with authentically engaged -- which authentically engaged new audience networks that was very positively received. 
We are excited about the activations that we have planned. In the coming weeks, Calvin Klein, we launched a global product collaboration, which will be an important first one with more to follow, where we use Calvin Klein's iconic brand and Hero products as the canvass for creative exploration. 
Moving on to Tommy. Similar to Calvin, Tommy continues to generate strong global brand equity with increases across all key measures, including awareness, which reached 78%. In December, we launched Tommy's Drop Shop, our newest platform for pop culture focused on limited edition releases, which have been received very well. In addition, our Tommy Jeans and Zalando exclusive European brand campaign produced 64 million views across multiple platforms and influence channels with very strong double-digit increases in brand consideration and purchase intent. We are pleased with the launch of our first circular denim collection, a significant milestone in our forward fashion journey to build towards a more circular and inclusive fashion industry. In addition, we continue to build upon our strong committing to bring our global brand vision to life, including welcoming our new Chief Marketing Officer. 
And finally, to our Heritage business. Our Heritage Brands business continued to face challenges in the fourth quarter. The exit of our brick-and-mortar retail business remains on track to be completed over the next few months. We are focused on increasingly shifting towards casualization with a recent focus on outdoor activity. We are continuing to actively address the business challenges managing inventory, lowering our cost base and reviewing additional ways to optimize and streamline the business. 
Before I hand it over to Mike, I would like to reiterate that the actions we are taking now will make PVH come out even stronger to compete within the new normal. As we plan and execute 2021, near-term visibility is limited by virus uncertainty, especially within Europe and extended lockdowns in certain countries. However, we are cautiously optimistic as we continue to lean in what's within our control to drive the business forward, specifically intensifying our focus on our core strength and executing against our strategic priorities including supercharging e-commerce and leaning further to our product strength to drive revenue growth, pricing power and gross margin expansion. Our international businesses are recovering faster than North America, and we are building on our strong performance in both Asia and Europe. We remain very confident in the recovery of these regions, given the underlying strength and momentum of our brands, product and distribution and expect revenues to exceed pre-pandemic levels in the first half year as we continue to take profitable market share. We are prudently planning our North America business, given ongoing pressures from a lack of foreign tourism, which we do not expect to return in any meaningful way until the end of the year. In the meantime, we are actively focusing on further improving our execution with a local consumer, amplifying our digital efforts as well as rightsizing our brick-and-mortar footprint under the region's new leadership. 
As we further leverage the power of PVH, I'm confident that we will drive brand relevance, cost efficiencies and deliver long-term sustainable growth while driving fashion forward for good. We look forward to sharing details with you on the long-term plan for PVH's next chapter of growth at our upcoming Investor Day later this year. 
And with that, I would like to hand it over to Mike."

Comments we're about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. I'm going to begin by discussing 2020 then move on to '21. Overall, revenues for the fourth quarter were down 20% as reported and down 23",1338,"Thanks, Stefan. Comments we're about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. I'm going to begin by discussing 2020 then move on to '21. 
Overall, revenues for the fourth quarter were down 20% as reported and down 23% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year and they were in line with our prior revenue guidance despite significantly more extensive lockdowns in Europe and Canada. When we released our third quarter earnings in early December, approximately 10% of our stores were closed in Europe and our guidance anticipated that those stores would reopen soon. However, lockdowns in Europe were significantly more extensive than we expected. And as a result, approximately 70% of our stores in Europe were closed in the fourth quarter. In addition, approximately 75% of our stores in Canada were close during the quarter as a result of the virus resurgence. 
Our total direct-to-consumer business was down 20% versus the prior year, including a 60% increase in digital commerce. All regions and brand businesses continue to experience strong digital growth and we continue to experience positive overall direct-to-consumer trends in China. Our lack of international tourists coming to the U.S. continues to challenge our North America brick-and-mortar retail business. Our wholesale revenue was down 19% versus the prior year, which included double-digit growth in our sales to digital channels. 
Looking at our segments. Tommy Hilfiger revenues were down 16% as reported and 20% on a constant currency basis, with international down 10% as reported and 17% on a constant currency basis which reflects the extensive lockdowns in Europe. North America was down 28%. Calvin Klein revenue was down 17% as reported and 20% on a constant currency basis, with international down 10% as reported and down 16% on a constant currency basis, which also reflects the extended lockdowns in Europe. North America was down 25%. Our Heritage revenues were down 41%, which included a 17% decline resulting from the sale of our Speedo North America business. Loss per share was $0.38 on a GAAP basis for the fourth -- on a non-GAAP basis for the fourth quarter, which reflected the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business as well as an unplanned $0.13 negative impact due to a settlement of a multiyear tax audit. Gross margin of 53.9% for the quarter was approximately flat to the prior year and in line with our expectations. Inventory is clean and ended the year down 12% compared to the prior year. We're carrying approximately $75 million of basic inventory into spring '21. That's a reduction compared to our prior projection of approximately $100 million. 
Expenses for the quarter were 52.5% of revenue and favorable to our expectation in the mid-50s as we reduced discretionary spending to offset the impact of the store closures. We ended the full year 2020 with revenue of $7.1 billion and non-GAAP loss per share of $1.97, which reflected the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. Our digital penetration for the year doubled compared to 2019 to 25% in 2020. 
Moving on to our outlook for '21. We're providing our 2021 outlook despite the significant uncertainty due to the pandemic, and as such, it could be subject to material change. Our outlook doesn't contemplate new store closures, lockdowns or extensions of current lockdowns beyond what we know already. In addition, our outlook does not contemplate further supply chain disruptions, including any greater impact beyond the minimal impact from we expected from the shipping disruption occurring as a result of the temporary blockage of the Suez Canal. Our actual 2021 results could differ materially from our current outlook as a result of the occurrence of any of the uncontemplated events. 
Despite the ongoing store closures in Europe, we are encouraged by the recovery we are seeing in our international businesses and expect those businesses to exceed 2019 pre-pandemic revenue levels within the first half of the year. We expect our North America business to remain challenged throughout '21 as we expect the international tourism which has historically represented 30% to 40% of our regional business will not show improvement throughout the year. 
Overall, for the full year, we're projecting revenue to approximately grow 22% to 24% as reported and 19% to 21% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. We expect gross margin to increase in 2021 versus 2020 due to significantly reduced promotional activity as inventory levels are significantly lower at the end of 2020, and a change in revenue mix with a higher-margin international businesses will make up a larger portion of our total revenue. 
When we think about our operating expenses, despite an expected increase due to revenue mix as our higher expense international businesses make up a larger portion of our revenue, we expect operating expenses overall to decrease as a percent of revenue in '21 compared to 2020. And we will continue actions that we began in 2020 to reduce course and reallocate resources to support strategic growth areas of the business. This includes in 2021, reducing our workforce in certain international markets, reducing our office space and closing select stores. We expect to realize $60 million of annualized savings from these actions, which are in addition to the previously announced actions we took to streamline our North America operations, including reducing our North American workforce by 12% and exiting our Heritage Brands Retail business by mid-2021. As a reminder, our outlook for 2021 reflects approximately $20 million of estimated operating losses in the first half of the year associated with the wind down of the Heritage Brands Retail business. 
We expect that the increase in gross margin percent in 2021 versus 2020 and the decrease in operating expenses as a percent of revenue in 2021 versus 2020 will be relatively similar in magnitude, with each worth a few hundred basis points. For the full year in 2021, we are projecting non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $6 versus a loss per share of $1.97 in 2020. Our tax rate for the year is estimated at 17.5% to 19.5%. When we think about our tax rate by quarter, we currently expect that the rate for the first 3 quarters will be relatively similar with the fourth quarter expected to benefit from certain discrete items, which bring down the overall rate for the full year. We expect our interest expense to decrease in 2021 to approximately $110 million. We're planning voluntary debt repayments of $700 million for the year which is equivalent to the incremental borrowings we took on in 2020 to manage through the pandemic. As of today, we have already made repayments of $400 million. We expect our capital expenditures in 2021 to be $300 million to $325 million and will include continued investments in platforms and systems, including digital commerce and enhancements in our warehouse and distribution networks. 
For the first quarter, our revenue is projected to increase 42% to 44% as reported and 34% to 36% on a constant currency basis. Revenue from directly operated digital commerce businesses continue to experience strong growth globally while our stores continue to face significant pressure as a result of the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in Europe and Canada, with approximately 75% of our stores in Europe closed early in the quarter and 50% that currently remain closed today. In addition, inventory and sales volume during the first quarter have been impacted by a recent global vessel and container shortage, which is leading to delayed spring 2021 inventory seats and in turn has delayed deliveries to our wholesale customers and effective product available in our direct-to-consumer businesses. First quarter non-GAAP earnings per share is planned in the range of $0.80 to $0.83 compared to a loss per share of $3.03 in the prior year period. We expect interest expense to be about $30 million and taxes to be about 40% in the first quarter. And with that, operator, we'll open it up for questions."

Joining me on the call today are Mike Shaffer, our COO and CFO; and Dana Perlman, our EVP, Chief Strategy Officer and Treasurer.  
It's a true pleasure to be leading the call this morning and an honor to lead this great company as we drive towards an accelerated recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and, at the same time, start to build our next growth chapter to win in the new normal. Pre COVID, there was already an unprecedented amount of change taking place in the apparel industry, driven mostly by technology and the consumer, which the pandemic only accelerated. The new normal will not be a static state rather an ever-increasing rate of change that we will be ready to compete and win in. 2020 will be remembered as one of the most challenging moments for our industry from a geopolitical, economic and public health perspective due to the pandemic. Our teams not only came together to successfully navigate the crisis. We also positioned PVH to march in a stronger position.  
I would like to thank all our associates for their hard work, resilience and ability to rise up to any challenge we have encountered. In particular, our dedicated retail store and distribution center associates who have managed to keep our business running throughout the toughest of COVID times. Before the pandemic hit, I was fortunate to spend time traveling and visiting many of our teams and partners around the world. I saw first hand many of the underlying strength that we are now focusing in on and connecting closer to where the consumer is going than any time before, all in an effort to drive sustainable, profitable growth.  
Our focus is on winning with the consumer, driving brand relevance, taking profitable market share and building further strength in our platform capabilities and, over time, to do that more efficiently. To accomplish this, we will work with a strong consumer focus, become even more demand and data-driven and create value in a systematic, repeatable way, where we will continuously learn and improve. 
We have taken this time to proactively evolve our business with special focus on capturing where the consumer is going. We have been accelerating our digital businesses and reallocating additional resources to drive growth in this highly important channel. We also continue to shift our product towards the comfort and casual categories that are working with consumers today. And lastly, we doubled down on our international businesses, where we continue to see a very strong recovery and significant revenue opportunity for both Calvin and Tommy, while also contributing a higher operating margin.  
Our increased and sustained focus on these aspects of the business will drive long-term revenue and margin growth for our shareholders, driven by gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage. And importantly, I will continue to live our strong corporate values, including our unwavering commitment to empower our people and help drive the fashion industry forward in sustainability and making a real and lasting positive impact within inclusion and diversity. I will now share some key insights on how we drove performance in the fourth quarter and in our first quarter of 2021 so far and how we are progressing towards an accelerated recovery. Mike will then share more financial details.  
Even though our fourth quarter results faced greater-than-expected challenges due to virus resurgences and lockdown throughout multiple regions, we were able to deliver on our expectations from a top line, gross margin and EBIT perspective. We focused our execution around our strategic priorities and drove an above plan performance for the holiday period. And we are pleased that we have successfully sold through our seasonal inventory, allowing us to enter spring 2021 in a very clean inventory position.  
I'd like to share some proof points demonstrating our progress against the 3 value-creating areas that we have shared with you previously. First, we continue to supercharge our e-commerce channel. We are rapidly growing our overall digital penetration by both expanding our D2C digital business as well as deepening our strong relationships with third-party digital partners. Fiscal 2020 represented our strongest ever digital sales performance, up over 40%, including nearly 70% growth on our own site. And we doubled our penetration to close to 25% of total company revenue, all while driving a significant improvement in the channel's profitability. Looking ahead with robust new user growth, our most significant opportunity to drive continued conversion and leverage our data capabilities to further engage, personalize and simplify the shopping experience.  
Secondly, we continue to increase our focus on driving product relevance across our brands and regions. Our teams have taken proactive measures to tighten and refocus assortments as well as rationalizing unproductive SKUs to improve overall sell-through rates. We are optimizing our product development processes and leaning further into our key essentials and hero products, which is driving positive initial results, including generating higher average unit retail prices. 
For Calvin, we are building on our global leadership in underwear and intimates, with Hero products such as the modern cotton program while growing in casual categories, including denim, tees and sweatshirts. 
For Tommy, we are expanding on the brand's casual lifestyle through our Hero products, supported by collaborations for each lifestyle, Tommy Hilfiger and Tommy Jeans. We also have a meaningful opportunity to further advance our supply chain capabilities and react faster as consumers' needs continue to change, resulting in shorter lead times that will benefit our overall margin structure.  
Thirdly, we are continuing to evaluate our cost structure in the context of our evolving revenue base. Over the summer, we announced the exit of our heritage branch retail business and a reduction of our North American workforce. In addition, we will be executing on additional cost reduction efforts in certain international markets, while also rightsizing our real estate footprint. We also see a notable opportunity to optimize our internal processes by further scaling our digital and data capabilities. As we realize the benefit from these strategic actions, we will, over time, enhance our overall profitability while allowing for investments in our strategic growth areas.  
While our regions are all in various stages of their recovery, these focus areas continue to guide our teams with clear objectives to operate against to drive an accelerated recovery.  
Turning to our regional update. Let me start with Asia, specifically with China, which has emerged first in the recovery. We remain very pleased with our performance in the market where D2C sales trends continue to be positive, with double-digit growth in the fourth quarter and full year. The lack of travel and tourism continues to benefit local spending in the market. Our team has been successful in accelerating our performance through a number of initiatives, including the following: with supercharged e-commerce, sync online and off-line initiatives driving conversion and sales growth in full price stores, while online key events were taking place. We also leaned into our most successful and relevant cash flow categories and Hero products for both Tommy and Calvin, better matching inventory with demand, which drove higher full price sell-throughs and lower markdowns.  
With respect to the first quarter, we are pleased with our trends to date, highlighted by a very successful Chinese New Year, including very strong sell-throughs of over 50% for our holiday capsule. We also generated strong performance during the international women's day, generating nearly full sell-throughs on exclusive SKUs while modern crop and gifts set sold out. In addition, we are currently experienced encouraging consumer responses to our spring collections. 
Overall, while we have seen some virus-related headwinds in certain parts of the region, specifically in Japan, we remain confident in our Asia region overall.  
Moving on to Europe. Despite the much more aggressive lockdowns across the region during the fourth quarter, our teams drove impressive execution, which continued to generate profitable market share gains underscoring the strength in Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein. Given the virus resurgence, 70% of our stores in Europe were temporary closed for portions of the quarter, which was significantly worse than what we had been planning when we spoke with you in early December. Still, we were able to navigate through this difficult time and gain market share through the following: driving the digital business, both on our owned and operated sites as well as with pure players, coupled with our CRM efforts remained an important focus. This is especially important as many stores are closed and we are very well positioned relative to the market. 
Total digital sales grew by over 60% for the fourth quarter, with even stronger performance on our owned and operated sites. Given temporary store closures, our investments in digital and omnichannel capabilities enabled us to fully leverage our connected retail inventory to serve our digital demand. We also continue to win through product, where we saw great performance across both brands in key essentials and casual sportswear with an improvement in AUR. In addition, as part of Calvin's expansion as a lifestyle brand, we are pleased with our newly in-house footwear division, which represents a big long-term opportunity for the brand and region.  
Future order book demand remains strong, with fall 2021 planned up high single digits versus the prior year and up significantly versus fall 2019, coming off strong double-digit order books for spring 2021. It's important to note that our customers continue to take in spring 2021 goods despite extended lockdowns in certain markets. We also continue to invest in important growth areas. And at the same time, we're also controlling discretionary spend and achieving cost efficiencies in Europe.  
Lastly, turning to North America. During the fourth quarter, we showed strong growth in our digital business while capitalizing on better traffic trends in stores during the holiday period to sell-through seasonal inventory. To ask us of international tourism and some wholesale bankruptcies continue to challenge our North America business. As I shared with you on our last earnings call, we still have work to do in the region in order to pivot more towards the domestic consumer and operate with the same strength as our international businesses. 
However, we do see positive developments in the region. Digital remains an important driver of our results, with sales on our own sites up 75%, even with increased promotional activity from the competition and our tight overall inventory position, which partially offset additional headwinds in our stores from lockdowns in Canada.  
Similar to international trends, consumer continued to gravitate to key Hero products in comfort, casual and athleisure categories for both Tommy and Calvin. Our fourth quarter marketing efforts continue to be focused to support our digital expansion. We created an interactive virtual holiday theme shop on tommy.com, which generated significant new consumer acquisition, while Calvin leveraged its global assets and campaigns to reinforce brand relevancy in Hero product affinity.  
Lastly, I'd like to welcome Trish Donnelly, who recently joined the PVH team in the newly created role of CEO of PVH Americas. Trish joined PVH following nearly 7 years with Urban Outfitters. As the global CEO for Urban Outfitters, Trish successfully led the business to win with a younger consumer, rapidly scaled e-commerce to an industry-leading penetration while driving very strong connected retail and consumer engagement. We look forward to her leadership in unlocking the region's growth potential, where we see significant opportunity across consumer engagement, product and distribution.  
Our teams continue to take a very thoughtful approach to managing our iconic brands. And I'd like to share a few brief global brand highlights, beginning with Calvin Klein. Global brand health remained strong at over 85% aided brand awareness, with strong growth across our social channels. Responses to our Spring '21 campaign has been positive with growth in relevancy and consideration, continuing the momentum on the #MyCalvins platform for creativity and self-expression. The campaign featured established and emerging talent including recent Grammy winner, Megan Thee Stallion and euphoria Star, Jacob Elordi. In addition, the brand partnered with L.A.-based PJ Lab and launched the first-of-its-kind content series, with authentically engaged -- which authentically engaged new audience networks that was very positively received.  
We are excited about the activations that we have planned. In the coming weeks, Calvin Klein will launch a global product collaboration, which will be an important first one with more to follow, where we use Calvin Klein's iconic brand and Hero products as the canvass for creative exploration.  
Moving on to Tommy. Similar to Calvin, Tommy continues to generate strong global brand equity with increases across all key measures, including awareness, which reached 78%. In December, we launched Tommy's Drop Shop, our newest platform for pop culture focused on limited edition releases, which have been received very well. In addition, our Tommy Jeans and Zalando exclusive European brand campaign produced 64 million views across multiple platforms and influencer channels with very strong double-digit increases in brand consideration and purchase intent. We are pleased with the launch of our first circular denim collection, a significant milestone in our forward fashion journey to build towards a more circular and inclusive fashion industry. In addition, we continue to build upon our strong Tommy Team to bring our global brand vision to life, including welcoming our new Chief Marketing Officer.  
And finally, to our Heritage business. Our Heritage Brands business continued to face challenges in the fourth quarter. The exit of our brick-and-mortar retail business remains on track to be completed over the next few months. We are focused on increasingly shifting towards casualization with a recent focus on outdoor activity. We are continuing to actively address the business challenges, managing inventory, lowering our cost base and reviewing additional ways to optimize and streamline the business.  
Before I hand it over to Mike, I would like to reiterate that the actions we are taking now will make PVH come out even stronger to compete within the new normal. As we plan and execute 2021, near-term visibility is limited by virus uncertainty, especially within Europe and extended lockdowns in certain countries. However, we are cautiously optimistic as we continue to lean in what's within our control to drive the business forward, specifically intensifying our focus on our core strength and executing against our strategic priorities, including supercharging e-commerce and leaning further to our product strength to drive revenue growth, pricing power and gross margin expansion. 
Our international businesses are recovering faster than North America, and we are building on our strong performance in both Asia and Europe. We remain very confident in the recovery of these regions, given the underlying strength and momentum of our brands, product and distribution and expect revenues to exceed pre-pandemic levels in the first half year as we continue to take profitable market share. We are prudently planning our North America business, given ongoing pressures from a lack of foreign tourism, which we do not expect to return in any meaningful way until the end of the year. In the meantime, we are actively focusing on further improving our execution with a local consumer, amplifying our digital efforts as well as rightsizing our brick-and-mortar footprint under the region's new leadership.  
As we further leverage the power of PVH, I'm confident that we will drive brand relevance, cost efficiencies and deliver long-term sustainable growth while driving fashion forward for good. We look forward to sharing details with you on the long-term plan for PVH's next chapter of growth at our upcoming Investor Day later this year.  
And with that, I would like to hand it over to Mike."

Comments we're about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. I'm going to begin by discussing 2020 then move on to '21. Overall, revenues for the fourth quarter were down 20% as reported and down 23",1340,"Thanks, Stefan. Comments we're about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. I'm going to begin by discussing 2020 then move on to '21. 
Overall, revenues for the fourth quarter were down 20% as reported and down 23% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year, and they were in line with our prior revenue guidance despite significantly more extensive lockdowns in Europe and Canada. When we released our third quarter earnings in early December, approximately 10% of our stores were closed in Europe and our guidance anticipated that those stores would reopen soon. However, lockdowns in Europe were significantly more extensive than we expected. And as a result, approximately 70% of our stores in Europe were closed in the fourth quarter. 
In addition, approximately 75% of our stores in Canada were close during the quarter as a result of the virus resurgence. 
Our total direct-to-consumer business was down 20% versus the prior year, including a 60% increase in digital commerce. All regions and brand businesses continue to experience strong digital growth and we continue to experience positive overall direct-to-consumer trends in China. Our lack of international tourists coming to the U.S. continues to challenge our North America brick-and-mortar retail business. Our wholesale revenue was down 19% versus the prior year, which included double-digit growth in our sales to digital channels. 
Looking at our segments. Tommy Hilfiger revenues were down 16% as reported and 20% on a constant currency basis, with international down 10% as reported and 17% on a constant currency basis which reflects the extensive lockdowns in Europe. North America was down 28%. Calvin Klein revenue was down 17% as reported and 20% on a constant currency basis, with international down 10% as reported and down 16% on a constant currency basis, which also reflects the extensive lockdowns in Europe. 
North America was down 25%. Our Heritage revenues were down 41%, which included a 17% decline resulting from the sale of our Speedo North America business. Loss per share was $0.38 on a GAAP basis for the fourth -- on a non-GAAP basis for the fourth quarter, which reflected the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business as well as an unplanned $0.13 negative impact due to a settlement of a multiyear tax audit. Gross margin of 53.9% for the quarter was approximately flat to the prior year and in line with our expectations. Inventory is clean and ended the year down 12% compared to the prior year. We're carrying approximately $75 million of basic inventory into spring '21. That's a reduction compared to our prior projection of approximately $100 million. 
Expenses for the quarter were 52.5% of revenue and favorable to our expectation in the mid-50s as we reduced discretionary spending to offset the impact of the store closures. We ended the full year 2020 with revenue of $7.1 billion and non-GAAP loss per share of $1.97, which reflected the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. Our digital penetration for the year doubled compared to 2019 to 25% in 2020. 
Moving on to our outlook for '21. We're providing our 2021 outlook despite the significant uncertainty due to the pandemic and, as such, it could be subject to material change. Our outlook doesn't contemplate new store closures, new lockdowns or extensions of current lockdowns beyond what we know already. 
In addition, our outlook does not contemplate further supply chain disruptions, including any greater impact beyond the minimal impact from what we expected from the shipping disruption occurring as a result of the temporary blockage of the Suez Canal. Our actual 2021 results could differ materially from our current outlook as a result of the occurrence of any of the uncontemplated events. 
Despite the ongoing store closures in Europe, we are encouraged by the recovery we are seeing in our international businesses and expect those businesses to exceed 2019 pre-pandemic revenue levels within the first half of the year. We expect our North America business to remain challenged throughout '21 as we expect the international tourism, which has historically represented 30% to 40% of our regional business will not show improvement throughout the year. 
Overall, for the full year, we're projecting revenue to approximately grow 22% to 24% as reported and 19% to 21% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. We expect gross margin to increase in 2021 versus 2020 due to significantly reduced promotional activity as inventory levels are significantly lower at the end of 2020, and a change in revenue mix with a higher-margin international businesses will make up a larger portion of our total revenue. 
When we think about our operating expenses, despite an expected increase due to revenue mix as our higher expense international businesses make up a larger portion of our revenue, we expect operating expenses overall to decrease as a percent of revenue in '21 compared to 2020. And we will continue actions that we began in 2020 to reduce course and reallocate resources to support strategic growth areas of the business. This includes in 2021, reducing our workforce in certain international markets, reducing our office space and closing select stores. We expect to realize $60 million of annualized savings from these actions, which are in addition to the previously announced actions we took to streamline our North America operations, including reducing our North America workforce by 12% and exiting our Heritage Brands Retail business by mid-2021. 
As a reminder, our outlook for 2021 reflects approximately $20 million of estimated operating losses in the first half of the year associated with the wind down of the Heritage Brands Retail business. 
We expect that the increase in gross margin percent in 2021 versus 2020 and the decrease in operating expenses as a percent of revenue in 2021 versus 2020 will be relatively similar in magnitude, with each worth a few hundred basis points. For the full year in 2021, we are projecting non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $6 versus a loss per share of $1.97 in 2020. 
Our tax rate for the year is estimated at 17.5% to 19.5%. When we think about our tax rate by quarter, we currently expect that the rate for the first 3 quarters will be relatively similar with the fourth quarter expected to benefit from certain discrete items, which bring down the overall rate for the full year. 
We expect our interest expense to decrease in 2021 to approximately $110 million. We're planning voluntary debt repayments of $700 million for the year which is equivalent to the incremental borrowings we took on in 2020 to manage through the pandemic. As of today, we have already made repayments of $400 million. We expect our capital expenditures in 2021 to be $300 million to $325 million and will include continued investments in platforms and systems, including digital commerce and enhancements in our warehouse and distribution networks. 
For the first quarter, our revenue is projected to increase 42% to 44% as reported and 34% to 36% on a constant currency basis. Revenue from directly operated digital commerce businesses continue to experience strong growth globally, but our stores continue to face significant pressure as a result of the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in Europe and Canada, with approximately 75% of our stores in Europe closed early in the quarter and 50% that currently remain closed today. 
In addition, inventory and sales volume during the first quarter have been impacted by a recent global vessel and container shortage, which is leading to delayed spring 2021 inventory seats and in turn has delayed deliveries to our wholesale customers and effective product available in our direct-to-consumer businesses. 
First quarter non-GAAP earnings per share is planned in the range of $0.80 to $0.83 compared to a loss per share of $3.03 in the prior year period. We expect interest expense to be about $30 million and taxes to be about 40% in the first quarter. 
And with that, operator, we'll open it up for questions."

But Mike, you described it as about half and half the contribution from gross margin and SG&A to get to that year-over-year improvement. I guess that could put you at a range of gross margin up close to like 57% above where we've seen the business in the past. I know there's some regional differences, but could you help maybe bridge us from the 54.7 you had in 2019 up to that level? 
And then I think that also would imply SG&A back to maybe $4.4 billion. In 2019, it was just over $4.4 billion. So I know the revenues are guided a little bit lower here.

And at this point, we're right on to being down 12%. So I think those are the real drivers. 
We continue to make -- see the business move towards the digital piece, and we get better utilization of inventories wherever we can, which I think is also helping. And that's part of the systems and the investment piece we talked about as well. When you think about the expenses, it's also being driven by the mix piece. We are -- these international businesses are higher EBIT margin, higher gross margin, higher operating expense businesses. And as we grow those faster, we do see an increase on the expenses as a percent of revenues, and that's a piece of it as well.

With me on the call today are Mike Shaffer, our COO and CFO; and Dana Perlman, our EVP, Chief Strategy Officer and Treasurer. I look forward to sharing the progress we are making in building our next growth chapter as we drive towards an accelerated recovery post-COVID to win in the new normal. Before I do that, I would like to thank our entire PVH team for an incredible job in successfully navigating the company through the pandemic and delivering a very strong start of the year. 
This quarter, we moved from navigating through the pandemic to increasingly coming into an accelerated recovery phase. This has been driven by the disciplined execution of our key strategic focus areas, led by Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger; our international markets, product strength and winning in the marketplace supercharged by e-commerce. 
We had a very strong first quarter. We overdelivered our revenue, gross margin rate and EPS versus our expectation. And the most important part of the strong performance is the underlying drivers behind it, which are important proof points for what we set out to achieve through our strategic focus areas. As we are connecting closer to where the consumer is going, the strength and value-creating potential of our global growth brands, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, is real and already starting to deliver results. 
You will remember from our last call that our focus is to win with the consumer by driving brand relevance, taking profitable market share and further strengthening our platform capabilities. And over time, doing that more efficiently, we're also becoming even more demand and data-driven, enabling us to create value in a more systematic and repeatable way. 
We believe that our increased and sustained focus on these aspects will drive long-term revenue and margin growth for our shareholders driven by gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage. 
Having had the opportunity to see a number of our important markets reopen and having been out walking stores again, I'm optimistic by what I'm seeing. While the consumer continues to lean into digital, the consumer is also out shopping in stores, and there is a general feeling of optimism and excitement. 
We are seeing signs of a real shift in consumer sentiment where the consumer is excited to come out of COVID restrictions, reflecting a new hybrid lifestyle. Consumers are evolving their casual and comfort focus to include more elements of self-expression through bolder colors increasingly influenced by the '90s pop culture. 
This combination of stay-at-home comfort with the joy of being able to socialize again, it's reflected as consumers mix and match [indiscernible] essential categories like underwear, lounge, active and daywear and we see an increased interest in denim. These consumer trends are positive for the fashion sector overall and for us in particular. 
Looking ahead, based upon our strong underlying performance, we are increasing our full year outlook. We are prudently managing our business as we navigate the ongoing effects of the pandemic, including lockdowns in certain markets and supply chain disruptions in countries that are being tragically affected such as India and Sri Lanka. We are confident in our ability to navigate these uncertainties and continue to drive an accelerated recovery. 
Let me now turn to some of the key proof points on how our key strategic focus areas positively drove our performance in the first quarter. And Mike will then share financial details. First, we continue to supercharge our e-commerce channel, with digital revenue growing approximately 95% in the quarter, including 66% growth in our owned and operated sites as we leveraged our multichannel business model to meet the consumer where they wanted to shop. 
Next, we continue to increase our focus on driving product relevance across our brands and regions. Across the board, our focus on key growth categories, hero products and cutting the unproductive assortment tail, yielding strong results. And we see increased pricing power and margin expansion in both Calvin and Tommy across our largest markets and channels. 
Lastly, we continue to drive cost efficiencies across our businesses globally through the initiatives we have underway, and we will continue to efficiently manage our cost structure. 
Turning to our regional update. Despite continued COVID-related challenges in the quarter, including closed stores, our teams drove performance significantly above plan in both revenue and profitability across our businesses globally. We delivered particularly strong results in our international business, which returned to pre-pandemic revenue levels at a faster pace than expected. 
Let me start with Asia. We remain pleased with our performance in the market. Our performance was led by the strength in China. And despite COVID resurgences in important markets like Japan, Singapore and Korea, our revenues were relatively in line with pre-pandemic levels. Our Asia and China teams continue to accelerate performance through a number of focused and well-executed initiatives. 
China is the furthest along in its recovery overall, and we continue to see increased traffic to our stores in addition to our growing digital business. Overall, revenues were above pre-pandemic levels. 
Our more focused strategies to strengthen product, coupled with better operational excellence in stores are driving higher conversion and strong full price selling. We are continuing to realize gross margin expansion from higher AURs. 
We also continue to supercharge e-commerce by successfully capturing key consumer moments around important holidays with positive responses for new season product launches, which are resonating both online and in stores. We are prepared and looking forward to several upcoming important selling periods, the next being for 6/18, which will be supported by strong product and channel execution. Overall, we remain optimistic of the long-term opportunity to grow our brands in Asia as we expand awareness and continue to invest in the market. 
Moving on to Europe. Our performance in the quarter was truly outstanding. We experienced earlier and much stronger-than-expected demand from our wholesale partners, who came out of the holiday season with very strong sell-throughs and low inventory levels for both Tommy and Calvin and wanted to be ready for the reopening of Europe. 
This led to the positive timing-related impact of earlier-than-expected wholesale shipments during the first quarter versus our plans for the second quarter. However, the underlying business performance in Europe was very strong, driven by our team's disciplined execution of our accelerated recovery priorities, including consistent and very strong product execution across both Tommy and Calvin, combined with a market presence that allowed us to very closely follow where the consumer wanted to shop, which in this quarter meant supercharging our digital channels through our connected inventory, enabling us to meet demand from all channels. 
We generated strong digital sales growth of over 100%, driven by both our owned and operated sites as well as sales to our digital partners, particularly pure players. And this growth also benefited from the store closures. 
It's important to note that as markets have reopened, the consumer has come back to our stores with better-than-expected traffic. For both Tommy and Calvin, we continue to gain market share driven by strong consumer demand for our product, resulting in increased pricing power and margin expansion. 
For Tommy, we continue to see strength for both men's and women's sportswear. across multiple product categories, including a strong and rising trend for Denim. For Calvin, underwear and casual essentials remain key performance drivers in addition to new denim cigarettes. 
Footwear, our newest category, which was recently brought in-house, is seeing strong consumer acceptance across all markets. The momentum in our future order book continues to be very strong with fall holiday 2021 now finalized and it's up double digits versus the prior year and pre-pandemic levels. 
We remain very confident in our team's ability to continue to drive sustainable, profitable growth in Europe for the remainder of the year and beyond. However, given the positive timing impact in the quarter, we are not expecting to see the same level of outperformance in the coming quarters. 
Turning to North America. During the first quarter, our inventory levels were very clean and we bought conservatively, which led to improvements in AUR and gross margin. However, sales were still down significantly in the quarter compared to pre-pandemic levels. 
As I have mentioned previously, the lack of tourism in North America, which pre-pandemic accounted for 30% to 40% of our revenues in the market has negatively impacted our business. We expect to see tourism come back gradually over time, although this is very much dependent on the pace of vaccinations in the rest of the world and the loosening of travel restrictions. Lastly, during the quarter, we had 50% of our stores in Canada closed due to COVID restrictions. 
In the meantime, we are leveraging our learnings and leaning in to build more strength with our domestic consumer. From this focused work, we already see a number of important initial proof points. We grew digital over 60% with growth on both our owned and operated sites as well as sales to our key wholesale partners, including digital pure players. 
In stores, we saw increases in traffic with the domestic consumer, although not enough to offset the lack of international tourism. Importantly though, this improved domestic consumer performance came in the result of less discounting, increased pricing power and strong margin improvement. 
From a product perspective, our inventory position is very good and we have started to see the positive effects of our key category and hero product focus as well as from cutting the unproductive assortment tail. So even though the top line is still very challenged by the tourism effect, below the surface, we are seeing strong positive comps for important hero products that performed significantly above pre-pandemic levels. 
While we are pleased to see these early positive signs from our accelerated recovery focus, we recognize that we still have much work to do to unlock the regions for potential. Even if it's still early days for Trish, who just joined us a few months ago in the role of CEO for PVH Americas, I'm very encouraged by how she and her team are starting to drive product strength with pricing power and margin expansion as well as doubling down on e-commerce growth in both direct-to-consumer channels and through our wholesale partners, and we see significant opportunity for the region. 
Next, I would like to share a few brief global brand highlights, beginning with Calvin Klein. Global brand health remains strong with consistently strong high level of awareness as well as increased purchase intent. 
During the quarter, Calvin launched its first global product collaboration with Heron Preston. The collection focuses on reinvented essentials true to the Calvin Klein brand DNA and connected to where culture is today. The response to date has been very positive, and we have a number of encouraging learnings. 
Globally, the collaboration has attracted a new, younger and very valuable consumer. We have seen strong consumer demand across product categories, starting with underwear. However, the fastest to sell out product categories were denim, trucker jackets, hoodies, t-shirts, which demonstrates Calvin Klein strength and potential as a true multi-category lifestyle brand. 
Through this collaboration, we have also seen higher AURs and average order value than any time before in recent history. We will continue to build out collaborations and campaigns to fuel brand heat and cultural relevance. One important campaign right now is our Pride capsule, which cuts across social, e-commerce and stores. 
Moving on to Tommy Hilfiger. We continue to generate increases across all brand health KPIs, including awareness, visibility and consideration as well as strong search interest. In Europe, Tommy drove strong sell-through for our spring capsules, including our collaboration with Pat, the Amsterdam-based streetwear brand, which was very well received. Additionally, the brand made another step towards circularity with the launch of our first limited edition upcycle collection. 
The remix collection is part of the Tommy for Life program, and a pioneering circular business model using pre-loved Tommy Hilfiger and Tommy Jeans products and marks another milestone in our sustainability vision. 
We also launched the third installment of Tommy's Drop shop with an artist capsule codesigned with London-based creative CVG, featuring limited-edition hoodies and tees. And finally, turning to our Heritage business. While we saw some improvements in our heritage brands this quarter, the business continued to face challenges. 
We remain on track to exit the remaining Heritage Brands retail stores this summer. Our intimates business performed well during the quarter with solid revenue growth compared to both last year and pre-pandemic levels. All while still under pressure, we have started to see some early signs of improvement in our dress shirt business as people reengage in social activities and return to offices. 
For the Heritage Brands, we are continuing to actively review additional ways to optimize the business. In closing, I feel very good about the strong performance we drove in the quarter, and I'm confident in our ability to continue to execute an increasingly strong recovery as reflected in our increased full year guidance. In addition, I feel particularly pleased with the disciplined way we achieved the growth in the quarter and how that positions us for sustainable, profitable growth for many years to come. 
I'm proud of how our teams continue to lean in to what's within our control to drive an accelerated recovery and position us as one of the winners in the new normal. Every quarter, we are taking further steps to get even closer to where the consumer is going. And I look forward to continuing to share more with you about the progress along the way. 
And before I hand it over to Mike, you will have seen that yesterday, we announced a couple of updates regarding our global leadership. Cheryl Hatches will be stepping down as Chief Executive Officer of Calvin Klein, moving to an advisory position on July 1. Chris Donnelly, CEO of PVH Americas, who has had oversight of Calvin Klein, will now take full global responsibility for the brand. I would like to extend my sincere thanks to Cheryl for the valuable impact she has made during her 15 years with the company in many areas of our business. And we also shared that after 30 years with PVH, Mike will be leaving to pursue other opportunities. Mike will be with us through September, so we will have time to celebrate his many contributions to the company. So for today, I would like to say thank you, Mike, for your partnership and stewardship over the years and for helping us build a strong foundation and strong leaders and teams we have today on which we will continue to build. So with that, I would like to hand it over to Mike."

The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. Overall revenues for the first quarter were up 55% as reported and up 46% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year and exceeded our prior revenue guidance driven by growth across all regions and channels. Revenue in our international business exceeded 2019 prepandemic levels. 
When we think about the comparison of 2021 versus first quarter results to the prior year, it is important to remember that during the first quarter of 2020, virtually all of our retail stores and our wholesale customer stores were closed globally for 6 weeks on average as a result of the pad demo. 
Our total direct-to-consumer business was up 66% versus the prior year, including a 66% increase in digital commerce across all regions and brands. Our retail stores faced continued pressure during the first quarter, although to a much lesser extent than in the previous year, with a significant percentage of our stores temporarily closed in Europe, Canada and Japan. 
All regions and brand businesses experienced strong digital growth due in part to the continued store closures, particularly in Europe. Although we expect digital penetration to remain consistent for the rest of the year, we expect digital growth will not be as pronounced as stores reopen. 
Our wholesale revenue was up 53% versus the prior year, including very strong sales to our digital channels. The increase was driven by strong performance in Europe due in part to an unplanned shift in the timing of wholesale shipments into the first quarter from the second quarter. 
Looking at our segments. Tommy Hilfiger revenues were up 63% as reported and 52% on a constant currency basis, with international up 78% as reported and 63% on a constant currency basis. North America was up 25%. Calvin Klein revenue was up 65% as reported and 56% on a constant currency basis with international up 91% as reported and 77% on a constant currency basis. 
North America was up 27%. Our Heritage revenues were up 9%, which included a reduction of 14% resulting from the sale of our Speedo North America business in April of 2020. We Gross margin was 59.1% for the quarter as compared to 49.5% in the prior year, which reflected improvements across all regions and brands due to less promotional selling, a favorable shift in regional sales mix and the absence of significant inventory reserves that have been recorded in the prior year. 
We continue to tightly manage our inventory, which decreased 7% at the end of the quarter as compared to the prior year. Earnings per share was $1.92 on a non-GAAP basis for the first quarter of 2021 and was $1.09 higher than the top end of our previous guidance. The beat included the impact of the unplanned timing ship of Europe wholesale shipments into the first quarter from the second quarter that I previously mentioned as well as a shift of advertising and other expenses out of the first quarter into the remainder of the year. 
Together, these timing shifts represent approximately $0.40 of the beat with the balance of $0.69 due to the business outperformance across all regions and brands. Notably, our EBIT margin was very strong at 12% for the quarter. This was due to the favorable shift in regional sales mix as our international business generally carry higher operating margins as well as unprecedented strength in our international businesses EBIT margins. 
The strength in international was due in part to Europe channel mix as a larger portion of revenue came from the wholesale channel, including sales to our brick-and-mortar and pure-play digital customers, which carry very low expenses. The higher proportion of Europe wholesale was due to a significant percentage of our stores being temporarily closed and the unplanned timing shift of wholesale shipments into the first quarter from the second quarter. 
Moving on to our outlook. We are providing our 2021 outlook despite the significant uncertainty due to the pandemic. And as such, it could be subject to material change. Our outlook does not contemplate new store closures, new lockdowns or extensions of current lockdowns beyond what is already known. 
We continue to monitor industry-wide supply chain headwinds, and our outlook contemplates certain inventory delays of approximately 4 to 6 weeks on average which is expected to result in additional air freight and other costs in order to maintain our sales plan in the second half of the year. 
While we have been able to successfully react throughout the year to delayed shipments, thanks to the strength of our supply chain, the current volatility in the industry may further impact our results in ways that we cannot currently able to predict. Our actual 2021 results could differ materially from our current outlook as a result of the occurrence of any un contemplated events. We continue to be encouraged by our international businesses, which have exceeded and are expected to continue to exceed pre-pandemic levels throughout the remainder of 2021. 
We expect North America to continue to face the ongoing challenge of reduced international tourism, which is the source of a significant amount of revenue and not expected to return to prepandemic levels within the year. Additionally, our outlook reflects approximately $20 million of estimated operating losses associated with the wind-down of the Heritage Brands retail business in the first half of the year. 
For the full year, we are projecting revenue to grow approximately 24% to 26% as reported and approximately 21% to 23% on a constant currency basis compared to 2020. We expect gross margin will continue to show improvements in 2021 compared to 2020 due to less promotional selling, though we do not expect a significant improvements for the remainder of the year as we experienced in the first quarter due in part to a less favorable shift in regional sales mix as growth in our international businesses, which generally carry higher gross margins was more pronounced in the first quarter relative to our lower-margin businesses in North America. 
We continue to manage our cost structure proactively, including reducing operating expenses and reallocating resources to support growth areas of the business. We continue to expect the increase in gross margin percent in 2021 versus 2020 and the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in 2021 versus 2020 will be relatively similar in magnitude with each worth a few hundred basis points. 
We expect EBIT margin will continue to show improvement in 2021 compared to 2020 although we do not expect a significant improvements for the remainder of the year as we experienced in the first quarter due to a less favorable shift in regional sales mix. We also do not expect the unprecedented strength we realized in our international businesses in the first quarter to continue at that level for the remainder of the year as stores have reopened and our wholesale business becomes a smaller proportion of the business. We expect our interest expense to decrease in 2021 to approximately $110 million. We are planning debt repayments of $700 million for the full year, which is equivalent to the incremental borrowings we took on in 2020 to manage through the pandemic. 
As of today, we have already made repayments of $600 million. This includes $500 million of repayments made in the first quarter and additional $100 million made after the quarter. Our tax rate for the year is estimated at 17.5% to 19%. And As a reminder, when we think about our tax rate by quarter, we expect that rate for the first 3 quarters will be relatively similar with the fourth quarter expected to benefit from certain discrete items, which bring down the overall rate for the year. 
For the full year in 2021, we are projecting non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $6.50, which is an increase compared to our previous guidance of approximately $6. Our current projection reflects an increase from our previous guidance of approximately $0.69 due to the business outperformance experienced in the first quarter. And while we are cautiously optimistic, we are prudently planning the balance of the year given supply chain disruptions and overall macro uncertainty. For the second quarter, our revenue is projected to increase 34% to 36% as reported and 29% to 31% on a constant currency basis. 
Second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share is planned in the range of $1.15 to $1.18 compared to $0.13 in the prior year period. We expect interest expense to be about $27 million and taxes to be in the range of 36% to 38% in the second quarter. And with that, operator, we'll open it up for questions."

She has a high-performance experience from 6, 7 years as the CEO of Urban Outfitters, winning with a young consumer, winning with product, pricing power, driving digital to best-in-class shares. So under the surface of the negative tourism effect and the Canada closures. We see some important proof points. So we see that digital, we were able to drive digital sales, 60% up. We were able to drive product strength. So we were able to drive sales to the domestic consumer with higher pricing power, increased gross margins, less discounting. But this is an opportunity that we will continue to lean into. And when it comes to the future years, we'll come back to that, the more clarity we get from navigating through COVID."

That puts gross margin about 57%, so well above the 54.7 million you had in 2019. But I think that still points to SG&A around $4.4 billion, and that's maybe just a touch lower than where you were in 2019. And I think the revenues are planned about 9% lower than 2019. So I wanted -- I'd love to hear your thoughts on the sustainability of that, just the cost structure on the level is being very similar to 2019, you mentioned the focus on efficiency and managing costs tightly a few times here in the last few conference calls. So how do you think about where -- how to plan the SG&A going forward? Is that a sustainable budget for where you see the revenues over the next few quarters and years?"

So -- and that was part of our beat for the quarter. So out of the $140 million, about $40 million of the beat was Europe wholesale sales. And then for the balance of the year, we basically held to our previous guide really didn't reflect any changes on revenue and we flowed through the other $100 million in revenue beat for the year.

On the supply side, we are seeing uncertainty. There are delays, but there's just some uncertainty surrounding the supply as well.

There are -- we're not allowed to -- our factories were not allowed to operate. And in Sri Lanka, we're partially open and factories are operating, but capacity is an issue. So it really -- what's concerning to us is when these factories will come out of those lockdowns and how they will open and how fast scheduling is that they'll open in the first week of June. So it's coming up quickly, and we'll have greater visibility in the next couple of weeks. As to some moving goods, it really isn't just airfreight. We have many different modes of expedited freight. So we can use faster ships, believe it or not, our airfreight. We have found airfreight constrained. There were not a lot of flights, but we are looking on certain product categories and underwear is particularly one where we can get goods in quicker and the cost is not great. The goods are smaller in scale in terms of size, and we can put quite a few into a path. So each order is looked at individually and we manage just PO by PO."

With me on the call today are Mike Shaffer, our COO and CFO; and Dana Perlman, our EVP, Chief Strategy Officer and Treasurer. I look forward to sharing the progress we are making in building our next growth chapter",2461,"Good morning, and thank you for joining. With me on the call today are Mike Shaffer, our COO and CFO; and Dana Perlman, our EVP, Chief Strategy Officer and Treasurer. I look forward to sharing the progress we are making in building our next growth chapter as we drive towards an accelerated recovery post-COVID to win in the new normal. Before I do that, I would like to thank our entire PVH team for an incredible job in successfully navigating the company through the pandemic and delivering a very strong start of the year. 
This quarter, we moved from navigating through the pandemic to increasingly coming into an accelerated recovery phase. This has been driven by the disciplined execution of our key strategic focus areas, led by Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger; our international markets, product strength and winning in the marketplace supercharged by e-commerce. 
We had a very strong first quarter. We overdelivered our revenue, gross margin rate and EPS versus our expectation. And the most important part of the strong performance is the underlying drivers behind it, which are important proof points for what we set out to achieve through our strategic focus areas. As we are connecting closer to where the consumer is going, the strength and value-creating potential of our global growth brands, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, is real and already starting to deliver results. 
You will remember from our last call that our focus is to win with the consumer by driving brand relevance, taking profitable market share and further strengthening our platform capabilities. And over time, doing that more efficiently, we're also becoming even more demand and data-driven, enabling us to create value in a more systematic and repeatable way. 
We believe that our increased and sustained focus on these aspects will drive long-term revenue and margin growth for our shareholders driven by gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage. 
Having had the opportunity to see a number of our important markets reopen and having been out walking stores again, I'm optimistic by what I'm seeing. While the consumer continues to lean into digital, the consumer is also out shopping in stores, and there is a general feeling of optimism and excitement. 
We are seeing signs of a real shift in consumer sentiment where the consumer is excited to come out of COVID restrictions, reflecting a new hybrid lifestyle. Consumers are evolving their casual and comfort focus to include more elements of self-expression through bolder colors increasingly influenced by the '90s pop culture. 
This combination of stay-at-home comfort with the joy of being able to socialize again, it's reflected as consumers mix and match casual essential categories like underwear, lounge, active and daywear and we see an increased interest in denim. These consumer trends are positive for the fashion sector overall and for us in particular. 
Looking ahead, based upon our strong underlying performance, we are increasing our full year outlook. We are prudently managing our business as we navigate the ongoing effects of the pandemic, including lockdowns in certain markets and supply chain disruptions in countries that are being tragically affected such as India and Sri Lanka. We are confident in our ability to navigate these uncertainties and continue to drive an accelerated recovery. 
Let me now turn to some of the key proof points on how our key strategic focus areas positively drove our performance in the first quarter. And Mike will then share financial details. First, we continue to supercharge our e-commerce channel, with digital revenue growing approximately 95% in the quarter, including 66% growth in our owned and operated sites as we leveraged our multichannel business model to meet the consumer where they wanted to shop. 
Next, we continue to increase our focus on driving product relevance across our brands and regions. Across the board, our focus on key growth categories, Hero products and cutting the unproductive assortment tail, yielding strong results. And we see increased pricing power and margin expansion in both Calvin and Tommy across our largest markets and channels. 
Lastly, we continue to drive cost efficiencies across our businesses globally through the initiatives we have underway, and we will continue to efficiently manage our cost structure. 
Turning to our regional update. Despite continued COVID-related challenges in the quarter, including closed stores, our teams drove performance significantly above plan in both revenue and profitability across our businesses globally. We delivered particularly strong results in our international business, which returned to prepandemic revenue levels at a faster pace than expected. 
Let me start with Asia. We remain pleased with our performance in the market. Our performance was led by the strength in China. And despite COVID resurgences in important markets like Japan, Singapore and Korea, our revenues were relatively in line with prepandemic levels. Our Asia and China teams continue to accelerate performance through a number of focused and well-executed initiatives. 
China is the furthest along in its recovery overall, and we continue to see increased traffic to our stores in addition to our growing digital business. Overall, revenues were above prepandemic levels. 
Our more focused strategies to strengthen product, coupled with better operational excellence in stores are driving higher conversion and strong full price selling. We are continuing to realize gross margin expansion from higher AURs. 
We also continue to supercharge e-commerce by successfully capturing key consumer moments around important holidays with positive responses for new season product launches, which are resonating both online and in stores. We are prepared and looking forward to several upcoming important selling periods, the next being for 6/18, which will be supported by strong product and channel execution. Overall, we remain optimistic of the long-term opportunity to grow our brands in Asia as we expand awareness and continue to invest in the market. 
Moving on to Europe. Our performance in the quarter was truly outstanding. We experienced earlier and much stronger-than-expected demand from our wholesale partners, who came out of the holiday season with very strong sell-throughs and low inventory levels for both Tommy and Calvin and wanted to be ready for the reopening of Europe. 
This led to the positive timing-related impact of earlier-than-expected wholesale shipments during the first quarter versus our plans for the second quarter. However, the underlying business performance in Europe was very strong, driven by our team's disciplined execution of our accelerated recovery priorities, including consistent and very strong product execution across both Tommy and Calvin, combined with a market presence that allowed us to very closely follow where the consumer wanted to shop, which in this quarter meant supercharging our digital channels through our connected inventory, enabling us to meet demand from all channels. 
We generated strong digital sales growth of over 100%, driven by both our owned and operated sites as well as sales to our digital partners, particularly pure players. And this growth also benefited from the store closures.
It's important to note that as markets have reopened, the consumer has come back to our stores with better-than-expected traffic. For both Tommy and Calvin, we continue to gain market share driven by strong consumer demand for our product, resulting in increased pricing power and margin expansion. 
For Tommy, we continue to see strength for both men's and women's sportswear. across multiple product categories, including a strong and rising trend for denim. For Calvin, underwear and casual essentials remain key performance drivers in addition to new denim sellers. 
Footwear, our newest category, which was recently brought in-house, is seeing strong consumer acceptance across all markets. The momentum in our future order book continues to be very strong with fall holiday 2021 now finalized and it's up double digits versus the prior year and prepandemic levels. 
We remain very confident in our team's ability to continue to drive sustainable, profitable growth in Europe for the remainder of the year and beyond. However, given the positive timing impact in the quarter, we are not expecting to see the same level of outperformance in the coming quarters. 
Turning to North America. During the first quarter, our inventory levels were very clean and we bought conservatively, which led to improvements in AUR and gross margin. However, sales were still down significantly in the quarter compared to prepandemic levels. 
As I have mentioned previously, the lack of tourism in North America, which prepandemic accounted for 30% to 40% of our revenues in the market has negatively impacted our business. We expect to see tourism come back gradually over time, although this is very much dependent on the pace of vaccinations in the rest of the world and the loosening of travel restrictions. Lastly, during the quarter, we had 50% of our stores in Canada closed due to COVID restrictions. 
In the meantime, we are leveraging our learnings and leaning in to build more strength with our domestic consumer. From this focused work, we already see a number of important initial proof points. We grew digital over 60% with growth on both our owned and operated sites as well as sales to our key wholesale partners, including digital pure players. 
In stores, we saw increases in traffic with the domestic consumer, although not enough to offset the lack of international tourism. Importantly though, this improved domestic consumer performance came in the result of less discounting, increased pricing power and strong margin improvement. 
From a product perspective, our inventory position is very good and we have started to see the positive effects of our key category and Hero product focus as well as from cutting the unproductive assortment tail. So even though the top line is still very challenged by the tourism effect, below the surface, we are seeing strong positive comps for important Hero products that performed significantly above prepandemic levels. 
While we are pleased to see these early positive signs from our accelerated recovery focus, we recognize that we still have much work to do to unlock the regions for potential. Even if it's still early days for Trish, who just joined us a few months ago in the role of CEO for PVH Americas, I'm very encouraged by how she and her team are starting to drive product strength with pricing power and margin expansion as well as doubling down on e-commerce growth in both direct-to-consumer channels and through our wholesale partners, and we see significant opportunity for the region. 
Next, I would like to share a few brief global brand highlights, beginning with Calvin Klein. Global brand health remains strong with consistently strong high level of awareness as well as increased purchase intent. 
During the quarter, Calvin launched its first global product collaboration with Hero in Preston. The collection focuses on reinvented essentials, true to the Calvin Klein brand DNA and connected to where culture is today. The response to date has been very positive, and we have a number of encouraging learnings. 
Globally, the collaboration has attracted a new, younger and very valuable consumer. We have seen strong consumer demand across product categories, starting with underwear. However, the fastest to sell out product categories were denim, trucker jackets, hoodies, t-shirts, which demonstrates Calvin Klein's strength and potential as a true multi-category lifestyle brand. 
Through this collaboration, we have also seen higher AURs and average order value than any time before in recent history. We will continue to build out collaborations and campaigns to fuel brand heat and cultural relevance. One important campaign right now is our Pride capsule, which cuts across social, e-commerce and stores. 
Moving on to Tommy Hilfiger. We continue to generate increases across all brand health KPIs, including awareness, visibility and consideration as well as strong search interest. In Europe, Tommy drove strong sell-through for our spring capsules, including our collaboration with Patta, the Amsterdam-based streetwear brand, which was very well received. Additionally, the brand made another step towards circularity with the launch of our first limited edition upcycle collection. 
The remix collection is part of the Tommy for Life program, and the pioneering circular business model using preloved Tommy Hilfiger and Tommy Jeans products and marks another milestone in our sustainability vision. We also launched the third installment of Tommy's Drop Shop with an artist capsule codesigned with London-based creative Stevie Gee, featuring limited-edition hoodies and Ts. 
And finally, turning to our Heritage business. While we saw some improvements in our heritage brands this quarter, the business continued to face challenges. 
We remain on track to exit the remaining Heritage Brands retail stores this summer. Our intimates business performed well during the quarter with solid revenue growth compared to both last year and prepandemic levels. All while still under pressure, we have started to see some early signs of improvement in our dress shirt business as people reengage in social activities and return to offices. 
For the Heritage Brands, we are continuing to actively review additional ways to optimize the business. In closing, I feel very good about the strong performance we drove in the quarter, and I'm confident in our ability to continue to execute an increasingly strong recovery as reflected in our increased full year guidance. In addition, I feel particularly pleased with the disciplined way we achieved the growth in the quarter and how that positions us for sustainable, profitable growth for many years to come. 
I'm proud of how our teams continue to lean in to what's within our control to drive an accelerated recovery and position us as one of the winners in the new normal. Every quarter, we are taking further steps to get even closer to where the consumer is going. And I look forward to continuing to share more with you about the progress along the way. 
And before I hand it over to Mike, you will have seen that yesterday, we announced a couple of updates regarding our global leadership. Cheryl Abel-Hodges will be stepping down as Chief Executive Officer of Calvin Klein, moving to an advisory position on July 1. Trish Donnelly, CEO of PVH Americas, who has had oversight of Calvin Klein, will now take full global responsibility for the brand. I would like to extend my sincere thanks to Cheryl for the valuable impact she has made during her 15 years with the company in many areas of our business. 
And we also shared that after 30 years with PVH, Mike will be leaving to pursue other opportunities. Mike will be with us through September, so we will have time to celebrate his many contributions to the company. So for today, I would like to say thank you, Mike, for your partnership and stewardship over the years and for helping us build a strong foundation and strong leaders and teams we have today on which we will continue to build. So with that, I would like to hand it over to Mike."
296568,715359497,2308961,"PVH Corp., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Jun 03, 2021",2021-06-03,"Earnings Calls","PVH Corp.","Executives","Thanks, Stefan.

Overall revenues for the first quarter were up 55% as reported and up 46% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year and exc",1449,"Thanks, Stefan. The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. Overall revenues for the first quarter were up 55% as reported and up 46% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year and exceeded our prior revenue guidance driven by growth across all regions and channels. Revenue in our international business exceeded 2019 prepandemic levels. 
When we think about the comparison of 2021 first quarter results to the prior year. It is important to remember that during the first quarter of 2020, virtually all of our retail stores and our wholesale customer stores were closed globally for 6 weeks on average as a result of the pandemic. 
Our total direct-to-consumer business was up 66% versus the prior year, including a 66% increase in digital commerce across all regions and brands. Our retail stores faced continued pressure during the first quarter, although to a much lesser extent than in the previous year, with a significant percentage of our stores temporarily closed in Europe, Canada and Japan. 
All regions and brand businesses experienced strong digital growth due in part to the continued store closures, particularly in Europe. Although we expect digital penetration to remain consistent for the rest of the year, we expect digital growth will not be as pronounced as stores reopen. 
Our wholesale revenue was up 53% versus the prior year, including very strong sales to our digital channels. The increase was driven by strong performance in Europe due in part to an unplanned shift in the timing of wholesale shipments into the first quarter from the second quarter. 
Looking at our segments. Tommy Hilfiger revenues were up 63% as reported and 52% on a constant currency basis, with international up 78% as reported and 63% on a constant currency basis. North America was up 25%. Calvin Klein revenue was up 65% as reported and 56% on a constant currency basis with international up 91% as reported and 77% on a constant currency basis.  North America was up 27%. Our Heritage revenues were up 9%, which included a reduction of 14% resulting from the sale of our Speedo North America business in April of 2020.
Gross margin was 59.1% for the quarter as compared to 49.5% in the prior year, which reflected improvements across all regions and brands due to less promotional selling, a favorable shift in regional sales mix and the absence of significant inventory reserves that have been recorded in the prior year. 
We continue to tightly manage our inventory, which decreased 7% at the end of the quarter as compared to the prior year. Earnings per share was $1.92 on a non-GAAP basis for the first quarter of 2021 and was $1.09 higher than the top end of our previous guidance. The beat included the impact of the unplanned timing ship of Europe wholesale shipments into the first quarter from the second quarter that I previously mentioned as well as a shift of advertising and other expenses out of the first quarter into the remainder of the year. 
Together, these timing shifts represent approximately $0.40 of the beat with the balance of $0.69 due to the business outperformance across all regions and brands. Notably, our EBIT margin was very strong at 12% for the quarter. This was due to the favorable shift in regional sales mix as our international business generally carry higher operating margins as well as unprecedented strength in our international businesses EBIT margins. 
The strength in international was due in part to Europe channel mix as a larger portion of revenue came from the wholesale channel, including sales to our brick-and-mortar and pure-play digital customers, which carry very low expenses. The higher proportion of Europe wholesale was due to a significant percentage of our stores being temporarily closed and the unplanned timing shift of wholesale shipments into the first quarter from the second quarter. 
Moving on to our outlook. We are providing our 2021 outlook despite the significant uncertainty due to the pandemic. And as such, it could be subject to material change. Our outlook does not contemplate new store closures, new lockdowns or extensions of current lockdowns beyond what is already known. 
We continue to monitor industry-wide supply chain headwinds, and our outlook contemplates certain inventory delays of approximately 4 to 6 weeks on average which is expected to result in additional air freight and other costs in order to maintain our sales plan in the second half of the year. 
While we have been able to successfully react throughout the year to delayed shipments, thanks to the strength of our supply chain, the current volatility in the industry may further impact our results in ways that we cannot currently able to predict. Our actual 2021 results could differ materially from our current outlook as a result of the occurrence of any uncontemplated events. We continue to be encouraged by our international businesses, which have exceeded and are expected to continue to exceed prepandemic levels throughout the remainder of 2021. 
We expect North America to continue to face the ongoing challenge of reduced international tourism, which is the source of a significant amount of revenue and not expected to return to prepandemic levels within the year. Additionally, our outlook reflects approximately $20 million of estimated operating losses associated with the wind-down of the Heritage Brands retail business in the first half of the year. 
For the full year, we are projecting revenue to grow approximately 24% to 26% as reported and approximately 21% to 23% on a constant currency basis compared to 2020. We expect gross margin will continue to show improvements in 2021 compared to 2020 due to less promotional selling, though we do not expect significant improvements for the remainder of the year as we experienced in the first quarter due in part to a less favorable shift in regional sales mix as growth in our international businesses, which generally carry higher gross margins was more pronounced in the first quarter relative to our lower-margin businesses in North America. 
We continue to manage our cost structure proactively, including reducing operating expenses and reallocating resources to support growth areas of the business. We continue to expect the increase in gross margin percent in 2021 versus 2020 and the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in 2021 versus 2020 will be relatively similar in magnitude with each worth a few hundred basis points. 
We expect EBIT margin will continue to show improvement in 2021 compared to 2020 although we do not expect a significant improvements for the remainder of the year as we experienced in the first quarter due to a less favorable shift in regional sales mix. We also do not expect the unprecedented strength we realized in our international businesses in the first quarter to continue at that level for the remainder of the year as stores have reopened and our wholesale business becomes a smaller proportion of the business. We expect our interest expense to decrease in 2021 to approximately $110 million. We are planning debt repayments of $700 million for the full year, which is equivalent to the incremental borrowings we took on in 2020 to manage through the pandemic. 
As of today, we have already made repayments of $600 million. This includes $500 million of repayments made in the first quarter and additional $100 million made after the quarter. Our tax rate for the year is estimated at 17.5% to 19%. As a reminder, when we think about our tax rate by quarter, we expect that rate for the first 3 quarters will be relatively similar with the fourth quarter expected to benefit from certain discrete items, which bring down the overall rate for the year. 
For the full year in 2021, we are projecting non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $6.50, which is an increase compared to our previous guidance of approximately $6. Our current projection reflects an increase from our previous guidance of approximately $0.69 due to the business outperformance experienced in the first quarter. And while we are cautiously optimistic, we are prudently planning the balance of the year given supply chain disruptions and overall macro uncertainty. For the second quarter, our revenue is projected to increase 34% to 36% as reported and 29% to 31% on a constant currency basis. 
Second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share is planned in the range of $1.15 to $1.18 compared to $0.13 in the prior year period. We expect interest expense to be about $27 million and taxes to be in the range of 36% to 38% in the second quarter. And with that, operator, we'll open it up for questions."

She has a high-performance experience from 6, 7 years as the CEO of Urban Outfitters, winning with the young consumer, winning with product, pricing power, driving digital to best-in-class shares. So under the surface of the negative tourism effect and the Canada closures, we see some important proof points. So we see that digital, we were able to drive digital sales, 60% up. We were able to drive product strength. 
So we were able to drive sales to the domestic consumer with higher pricing power, increased gross margins, less discounting. But this is an opportunity that we will continue to lean into.

Or was it really about strong sell-through product and brand strength. And can you tell us a little about the order books and how they build up for fall of '21."

And Mike will be able to give you a little bit more details around that. But when we look underneath that, was very, very strong performance. So the brand relevance that we are able to execute in Europe, the product strength the pricing power, the margin expansion and then how we have been able to, for a long period of time now, follow the consumer in how we win in the marketplace. 
So we see Europe's strength continue, and we see Europe opening up again after the lockdown from COVID. And we have full confidence in our team's ability to continue to build on the strength we already see. So with that, I'll hand it over to Mike to describe a little bit more of the onetime effect. But what excites me the most and what I'm interested in is what's the long-term strength of the business, and it's very, very strong. And when we break it down into the underlying value drivers of what drives profitable market share growth, sustainable profitable market share growth, Europe ticks all the boxes there. So very, very strong performance from the team."

Look, it was a great quarter, as Stefan said, and we beat the top end of our guidance overall by $140 million. Europe was a big piece of the beat. Coming into the quarter, there were lockdowns, there were store closures and there was a lot of uncertainty around how stores would open. We had goods planned for early shipment in May. It was about $40 million worth of product sales that we were pleasantly surprised there was demand and the customers asked for the goods in April, so the good shift. 
So -- and that was part of our beat for the quarter. So out of the $140 million, about $40 million of the beat was Europe wholesale sales. And then for the balance of the year, we basically held to our previous guide really didn't reflect any changes on revenue and we flowed through the other $100 million in revenue beat for the year. I just wanted to mention the order books. The order books for the -- for all holiday season are up double digits. Those are not frozen. So we are really happy with the performance there and just shows continued strength and the beats were across really all categories. We're seeing super strength in that business."

And then we focus in on product strength, and we see AUR growth, gross margin rate improvements across the board. And then we focused in on connecting even closer to where the consumer is going in the marketplace. And Europe is leading there, as you know, from an e-commerce contribution. But overall, as a company, we are now 25% e-commerce contribution and drove almost 100% growth. So that -- and then you layer on the efficiencies of $250 million savings.

On the supply side, we are seeing uncertainty. There are delays, but there's just some uncertainty surrounding the supply as well.

There are -- we're not allowed to -- our factories were not allowed to operate. And in Sri Lanka, we're partially open and factories are operating, but capacity is an issue. So it really -- what's concerning to us is when these factories will come out of those lockdowns and how they will open and how fast scheduling is that they'll open in the first week of June. 
So it's coming up quickly, and we'll have greater visibility in the next couple of weeks. As to some moving goods, it really isn't just airfreight. We have many different modes of expedited freight. So we can use faster ships, believe it or not, our airfreight. We have found airfreight constrained. There were not a lot of flights, but we are looking on certain product categories and underwear is particularly one where we can get goods in quicker and the cost is not great.

With me on the call today are Mike Shaffer, COO and CFO; Dana Perlman, EVP, Chief Strategy Officer and Treasurer; and Jim Holmes, our Corporate Controller, who we announced will be interim CFO effective September 1",2203,"Good morning, and thank you for joining. With me on the call today are Mike Shaffer, COO and CFO; Dana Perlman, EVP, Chief Strategy Officer and Treasurer; and Jim Holmes, our Corporate Controller, who we announced will be interim CFO effective September 10. 
Let me start by sharing that we delivered a very strong second quarter performance and significantly outperformed our plans from a revenue, EBIT margin and EPS perspective, all despite the ongoing challenges from COVID. We're also taking up our guidance for the year. I would like to thank our associates around the world for their hard work and critical contributions to the great second quarter and very strong first half of the year. 
Our results in the quarter included strong double-digit revenue growth against last year, which was relatively in line with pre-pandemic levels, and this was led by our international business, specifically Europe. Our performance was underpinned by meaningful gross margin expansion and operating expense efficiencies, which drove significant EBIT margin expansion of several hundred basis points compared to 2019. 
For several quarters now, we have shown great progress in driving an accelerated recovery through the disciplined execution against our strategic priorities. These include increasing our focus on our 2 iconic global power brands, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, building on the strength in international, delivering on product strength, pricing power and gross margin expansion while winning in the marketplace through supercharged e-commerce growth, and at the same time, driving operating efficiencies. 
Looking ahead, our strong performance in the quarter, combined with the strength of the underlying growth drivers in our business, has led us to increase our top and bottom line full year guidance. Our EBIT margin guidance now assumes a return to a margin similar to our 2019 levels. We are confident in our ability to continue to drive an accelerated recovery while also prudently planning our business for the remainder of the year as we navigate pandemic-related uncertainties, including market and supply chain disruptions. 
I will now share some of the key proof points on how we are executing our accelerated recovery priorities. Mike will then share more of the financial details. 
First, we have continued to supercharge e-commerce with digital revenue growing approximately 35% in the quarter. A strong result, particularly when compared to our outside growth last year when stores were closed or under restrictions, which are now open. Importantly, our digital penetration remained consistent at 25%, which is double pre-pandemic levels. 
We continue to ramp up investment in digital, while at the same time, growth in our brick-and-mortar retail stores is accelerating, demonstrating our increasing strength in connecting with the consumer across channels. 
Next, we are driving product strengths across our brands and regions. The trends we saw last quarter have continued, with consumers excited to come out of COVID restrictions and adopting a hybrid lifestyle towards an increasing mix of wearing occasions. This is still very much grounded in a casual lifestyle that fits both Calvin and Tommy really well. In the quarter, we saw continued strength in key essential product categories like underwear, t-shirts, polos, hoodies, active, sneakers and a rising demand for denim and categories like dresses. We continue to lean into the strength of our key essentials and Hero products, which represent a must-have product silhouette in key product categories. Through this work, we saw an improvement in AURs during the quarter, including double-digit increases in some of our biggest investments. 
We also continue to cut more unproductive SKUs, including a 20% cut on average for fall 2021. Through this work and by taking a more data- and demand-driven approach, we are driving revenue growth with AUR increases and gross margin expansion. 
Overall, our inventory levels across the board are in a very good shape, down 13% versus last year. And as we further improve the way we plan and buy our inventory, we will be able to read and react more quickly to demand. In addition, we continue to invest in our key strategic focus areas. And at the same time, we continue to drive efficiencies across our business as part of our work to operate with more speed, more agility to better follow the consumer in this dynamic environment. 
Lastly, we successfully sold our Heritage Brands as planned. This has already enabled an increased focus on Calvin and Tommy, which are higher return businesses with global growth potential. 
So turning to our regional update. While each of our regions is in varying stages of recovery, we drove performance significantly above plan for both revenue and profitability. Let me start with Europe this time. Our European team delivered another quarter of exceptional performance through very strong execution of our accelerated recovery priorities. Both Tommy and Calvin performed significantly above plan, including double-digit growth versus pre-pandemic levels. 
The strength in our Europe business is a very good example of the kind of performance we're able to drive when we execute really well. And it offers a proof point and a blueprint for what's possible in our other regions as well. Across both brands, we are winning with the consumer, driving brand relevance through leaning into the strength of our Hero products and we continue to supercharge our digital and our omnichannel capabilities. 
Building on our success in the first quarter, as lockdowns were lifted, we saw great demand for our product, both in our own channels as well as in wholesale. We delivered strong revenue trends supported by significant margin expansion, which included gross margins above 2019 levels driven by pricing power, lower promotions and higher retail productivity. 
We also continued to drive operating expense efficiency. We generated strong digital sales growth of 45%, even against the backdrop of stores reopening, driven by our expanded business with digital pure players. Europe represents our highest e-commerce penetration, well above the company's overall rate of 25%. In our D2C channel, we continue to accelerate our omnichannel capabilities by investing in connected retail technologies. 
Ahead with the e-commerce performance, we generated very strong retail store sales, with traffic levels sequentially improving versus 2019 as stores reopened. Highlighting the strength of our product in the marketplace, we drove higher conversion, stronger full price setters and higher AURs. In addition, the strong consumer demand drove significant core replenishment. And as spring and summer products sold through much faster than expected, we transitioned earlier to pre-fall collections. Demand in our future order books across both brands continue to be very strong, with spring 2022 planned up double digits, following double-digit growth for fall holiday 2021. 
Moving on to Asia. Our Asia team continues to execute really well. Although COVID resurgences across the region, in markets such as Japan, Korea, and most recently, Australia, are making it difficult to see the real underlying strength on how we are improving our execution in the markets. Overall, revenues were relatively in line with pre-pandemic levels and our plans, led by China. 
Despite the current COVID-related challenges, what excites me the most is the strength we are seeing against our strategic focus areas as we continue to drive increased product strength, pricing power, inventory efficiencies from better inventory management and higher gross margins, all driven by the same Hero product focus. 
China remains a significant growth opportunity for both Tommy and Calvin. As we continue to invest in the market, we are driving brand heat and relevance through our integrated marketing and capsules around key shopping malls, including 6 18 this quarter and most recently, Chinese Valentine's Day. We are creating unique content and activations to win with the consumer in these key moments. 
We have also leaned into our most successful Hero products, which are delivering strong KPIs, including higher conversion, higher sell-throughs and higher AURs and continue to drive comparable store sales increases in retail stores. And as with supercharge e-commerce, we are leveraging data analytics and utilizing new tools and channels to drive performance. We are focused on developing new creative ways to engage with consumers, including expanding our work with WeChat. Lastly, inventory levels continue to be very lean as we continue to focus on buying closer to demand. Overall, while we are still navigating covet challenges, like others in the region, we remain confident about the long-term strength and growth opportunities for both of our core brands. 
Turning to North America. The region is still under the most pressure with the lack of tourism remaining our biggest challenge. Tourism continues to trend down significantly versus 2019 levels, which in the normal year, made up 30% to 40% of our total business in the region. Our North American teams are leaning into what's within our control, focusing on the domestic consumer, supercharging e-commerce and driving product strength with AUR and margin improvements. 
And I'm pleased that we saw a number of green shoots during the quarter. Importantly, we drove sequential improvements in top and bottom line performance across brands and channels. Some of the proof points of our progress this past quarter include: we drove double-digit growth in our digital business, led by a combination of continuously improving our owned and operated e-commerce sites and strong partnerships with our key wholesale partners, including pure players. 
In stores, with the domestic consumer, we saw improved traffic with higher AURs. We're also better optimizing inventory across our channels and improving our ability to react to demand changes. For example, in Canada, where the country's reopening has been slower than other markets, we proactively redirected inventory to the U.S. 
Overall, in North America, we have a lot of work still to do, and we are focused on building the business for long-term growth. This work is focused on the same key value drivers that enable our international businesses to perform so strongly to continuously drive brand relevance through product strength, pricing power and winning across channels, digitally-led. 
Next, I'll share a few brief global brand highlights, beginning with Calvin Klein. Global brand health remains very strong with consistent high levels of global awareness. Our Pride campaign this year was successful in further building brand awareness. The campaign celebrated defining moments connecting to global LGBTQIA plus communities with a diverse international cast. It resulted in global reach that was up over 30% on last year. It drove a 300% increase in traffic to our site and delivered strong product sell-through and driven by Hero underwear products with limited edition pride colorways. 
In the spring, we launched the brand's first designer collaboration with Heron Preston, which has been very well received by the consumer. This quarter, we will release a second chapter of this collaboration across denim underwear and other wardrobe essentials. 
Looking ahead, we will continue to build out our collaboration strategy, connecting the iconic strength of Calvin Klein with creators and brands from around the world to express their unique perspective of the brand. This includes the second installment of our underwear collaboration with premium retailer kit, which taps into the power of Calvin with a Gen C audience. 
Moving on to Tommy Hilfiger. Global brand health KPIs for Tommy also remained very strong. The expansion of our purpose-oriented product offer continues to resonate with consumers, with more than 50% of the global summer pre-fall collection being sustainable. As we focus on Tommy Jeans growth potential with younger consumers, we continue to drive brand heat through successful capsules. From our blast from the past capsule inspired by pop culture cartoon icons, capsule, which drove very strong engagement and sell-throughs. The brand also launched collaborations that amplified our efforts to increase opportunities and visibility for underrepresented communities within the fashion and apparel industries. 
In July, we launched the first collaboration with a non-gendered capsule featuring Indiamore. The brand also launched a capsule with emerging Brooklyn designer, Romeo Hunt, following his mentorship with Mr. Hilfiger. The capsule reimagine iconic Tommy pieces with a focus on outerwear and is available on tommy.com as well as through an exclusive partnership with. These collaborations have increased traffic to our sites in the U.S. and Europe, with more than 40% driven by new consumers and with significantly higher average retail prices. 
In closing, I feel very good about how we came together and drove yet another strong quarter of accelerated recovery. Our increased focus on winning with the consumer through our 2 global power brands, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, is driving results. We're still early days in building our next growth chapter. And I continue to be very optimistic for the future as we lean further into our accelerated recovery priorities, leveraging our core strength and continuously following the consumer to position PVH for sustainable long-term profitable growth. 
And before I hand it over to Mike, since this is Mike's last earnings call, I would like to thank him again for his contributions of nearly 30 years to PVH. We are grateful for his guidance and leadership over the years. I'm also pleased to introduce Jim Halls. As our interim CFO. Jim has been with PVH for over 20 years and has played a critical role on our finance team, working very closely with Mike to build our strong financial foundation. 
So with that, I would like to hand it over to Mike."

The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. Overall, revenues for the second quarter were up 46% as reported and up 40% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year and",1220,"Thanks, Stefan. The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. 
Overall, revenues for the second quarter were up 46% as reported and up 40% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year and significantly exceeded our prior revenue guidance. Our international businesses significantly exceeded 2019 pre-pandemic levels, driven by Europe. When we compare 2021 second quarter results to the previous year, it's important to remember that during the second quarter of 2020, virtually all of our retail stores and the majority of our wholesale customer stores were closed globally during the first month of the quarter, and we're operating at a significantly reduced capacity for the remainder of the quarter as a result of the pandemic. 
Our total direct-to-consumer business was up 19% versus the prior year, and owned and operated digital commerce was flat despite exceptionally strong growth in the prior year and significant traffic improvement in brick-and-mortar this year as stores have reopened and capacity restrictions have lessened. 
Our retail stores face some continued pressure during the second quarter, although to a much lesser extent than in the previous year, with certain stores temporarily closed in Europe, Australia and Japan for various periods of time. Our wholesale revenues were up 77% versus the prior year driven by strong performance in Europe. In addition, we experienced a significant increase in sales to the digital businesses of our traditional and pure-play wholesale customers. 
Our overall revenue through our digital channels grew approximately 35% versus the prior year. And our digital penetration as a percentage of total revenue continues to be approximately 25%, even as stores have reopened. 
Looking at our segments. Tommy Hilfiger revenues were up 41% as reported and 35% on a constant currency basis, with international up 40% as reported and 32% on a constant currency basis. North America was up 45%. Calvin Klein revenue was up 56% as reported and 50% on a constant currency basis, with international up 47% as reported and 37% on a constant currency basis. North America was up 75%. Our Heritage revenues were up 37%. 
Gross margin was 57.7% for the quarter as compared to 55.9% in the prior year, which reflected substantial improvements across all regions due to less promotional selling. Our inventory is lean, down 13% as of the end of the quarter compared to the prior year. Earnings per share was $2.72 on a non-GAAP basis for the second quarter of 2021 compared to $0.13 in the prior year period and $2.10 in 2019. This beat the top end of our previous guidance by $1.54. The beat was primarily due to the business outperformance largely in Europe for $1.19 and as well as a favorable impact of taxes for $0.35, of which $0.25 is timing. Notably, our EBIT margin continued to be very strong at 12.7% for the quarter, driven by continued strength in our international business. 
Moving on to our outlook. We are providing our 2021 outlook despite the significant uncertainty due to the pandemic, and as such, it could be subject to material change. Our outlook does not contemplate any significant new store closures, new lockdowns or extensions of current lockdowns beyond what is already known. In addition, the 2021 outlook contemplates higher freight and other logistic costs in the second half of the year to mitigate delays of approximately 4 to 6 weeks on average for certain inventory orders, but does not contemplate any greater supply chain disruptions beyond that. Our actual 2021 results could differ materially from our current outlook as a result of the occurrence of any of these or any other uncontemplated events. 
We continue to be encouraged by our international businesses, which are expected to continue to exceed pre-pandemic levels through the remainder of 2021. We expect North America to continue to face the ongoing challenge of reduced international tourism which is the source of a significant amount of revenue and not expected to return to pre-pandemic levels within the year. 
Additionally, our full year outlook includes the sale of certain of our Heritage Brands, which will result in a decrease in revenue of 2% versus 2020 and have a slightly dilutive impact on earnings. For the full year, we are projecting revenue to grow approximately 26% to 28% as reported and approximately 24% to 26% on a constant currency basis compared to 2020. We expect gross margin will continue to show improvements for the remainder of the year due to less promotional selling and a favorable shift in regional sales mix compared to the prior year with our higher-margin international businesses making up a larger portion of total revenue. 
While we continue to manage our cost structure proactively by reducing operating expenses and reallocating resources to support strategic growth areas of the business, we expect higher expenses in the second half of the year than the first half. The incremental expenses in the second half include increases in marketing and other investments, which were planned in the second half of the year to coincide with when we expected our stores to be mostly open and to drive momentum as we hopefully exit the pandemic. 
We expect our EBIT margin will be nearly flat to our 2019 pre-pandemic level. We continue to expect that the increase in gross margin in 2021 versus 2020 and the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in 2021 versus 2020 will be relatively similar in magnitude. However, as compared to the first half of 2021, our EBIT margin in the second half will be impacted by the incremental expenses I noted previously as well as freight costs for approximately $0.35 to mitigate supply chain delays. 
We expect our interest expense decrease in 2021 to approximately $105 million compared to $116 million in 2020. We have made $200 million of voluntary debt repayments in the second quarter, bringing our total for the first half of the year to $700 million, which is equivalent to the incremental borrowings we took on in 2020 to manage through the pandemic. 
Our tax rate for the year is estimated at 17% to 18%, with the favorable impact we benefited from in the second quarter, largely offset in the second half due to time. As a reminder, when we think about our tax rate by quarter, the fourth quarter is expected to benefit from certain discrete items, which bring down the overall rate for the full year. 
For the full year in 2021, we are projecting non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $8.50, which is an increase compared to our previous guidance of approximately $6.50 and compared to a loss per share of $1.97 in 2020. The beat was primarily due to business outperformance, largely in Europe for $1.85, along with an improvement in taxes of $0.10 and an improvement of $0.05 from reduced interest expense. 
For the third quarter, our revenue is projected to increase 11% to 13%, both as reported and on a constant currency basis. Third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.95 to $2 compared to $1.32 in the prior year period. We expect interest expense to be about $25 million and taxes to be in the range of 26% to 28% in the third quarter."

And we see that continue. This is a multiyear journey where we drive brand relevance through focusing on winning with product and being very focused on the key categories that matters the most to the consumer. 
And then we build Hero products around that. And then we connect those Hero products with the consumers increasingly tighter and tighter to where the consumers want to shop channel-wise. And that's where we have doubled down on e-commerce. So we see that continue. On an operating efficiency perspective, that's the other driver of the EBIT rate improvement in Q2. We see that it's coming from being increasingly focused on investing in the accelerated recovery priorities and looking at efficiencies that we can free up that's outside of that. So you will see us continue to drive gross margin rate improvements over time, and you will see us continue to drive operating efficiencies over time."

One from exiting the Heritage retail business, but also just the way the held for sale accounting works. We closed on selling our Heritage wholesale business. So those inventories at the end of Q2 are not on the inventory lines. We have a benefit from that. 
But apart from that, our current inventory levels are lean. As Stefan mentioned, partly our disciplined inventory management, buying closer demand and cutting the unproductive SKUs is really having a benefit. Also at the end of Q2, as we've called out, we are experiencing supply chain delays, 4 to 6 weeks, which is also benefiting a little bit. As we move through the second half, we called out we're going to be incurring about $0.35 worth of airfreight expense, really to make sure that the inventories are getting -- are keeping in line with our sales forecast. 
And Bob, if you just -- if you look at the inventory this year versus last year, last year comparisons get difficult. This time last year, we really have been canceling a lot of orders so if we really compare it to 2019, which is probably a better comparison, we expect our inventory levels pretty much to get back in line with future sales growth projections by the end of the year."

And just to build -- Bob, just to build on what Jim was speaking about in terms of inventory levels. One thing I've seen throughout my career working with finding a systematic, repeatable way to create value from product and how we plan and buy inventories that when we have demand above what we expected, we tend to be able to sell more with less inventory. So we take this as an opportunity to learn as a team to say how do we better plan and buy inventory to demand? And how can we have an inventory level, in average, that's lower in relation to sales than what we historically have had. 
So this past quarter is a good example of that we can sell more at a higher pricing power with a lower inventory level. So that is something, again, it's a multiyear journey, but this quarter was a proof point on how much of a flow-through down to EBIT rate we can have from lower inventory to demand."

So -- but we -- from a regional perspective, from our 3 regions, we have the most work to do in North America. What excites me today though, is that we're starting to lean into the areas that really matters and starting to connect with that domestic consumer and really leverage the strength we have in Calvin and Tommy in North America. The underlying consumer strength with Calvin and Tommy is for us to improve our execution."

So you're going to see an increasing share of focus when it comes to our Hero products. And then where we are on the SKU rationalization. That's an ongoing work as well. But it starts with the focus -- the way we effectively cut unproductive SKUs is that we start to -- we start -- when we build the assortment to focus on the Hero products. And then we look at the ongoing demand from the assortment we have. And my experience over the years there is that when we continuously do that in a systematic way, we can cut -- we can keep cutting unproductive SKUs. 
So every product needs to have an intent that goes into our line. And for fall, as I mentioned, we are cutting 20% of the assortment. So it sounds a lot, but it's just the beginning because we have a history of overproducing SKUs. And now when we focus in and what really matters to the consumer, then we will have over the next few years. We will have a continuous opportunity to tighten the assortment to the SKUs that really matters to win with the consumer."

With me on the call today are Mike Shaffer, COO and CFO; Dana Perlman, EVP, Chief Strategy Officer and Treasurer; and Jim Holmes, our Corporate Controller, who we announced will be interim CFO effective September 10.
Let me start by sharing that we delivered a very strong second quarter performance and significantly outperformed our plans from a revenue, EBIT margin and EPS perspective, all despite the ongoing challenges from COVID. We're also taking up our guidance for the year. I would like to thank our associates around the world for their hard work and critical contributions to the great second quarter and very strong first half of the year.
Our results in the quarter included strong double-digit revenue growth against last year, which was relatively in line with prepandemic levels, and this was led by our international business, specifically Europe. Our performance was underpinned by meaningful gross margin expansion and operating expense efficiencies, which drove significant EBIT margin expansion of several hundred basis points compared to 2019.
For several quarters now, we have shown great progress in driving an accelerated recovery through the disciplined execution against our strategic priorities. These include increasing our focus on our 2 iconic global power brands, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, building on the strength in international, delivering on product strength, pricing power and gross margin expansion while winning in the marketplace through supercharged e-commerce growth and, at the same time, driving operating efficiencies.
Looking ahead, our strong performance in the quarter, combined with the strength of the underlying growth drivers in our business, has led us to increase our top and bottom line full year guidance. Our EBIT margin guidance now assumes a return to a margin similar to our 2019 levels. We are confident in our ability to continue to drive an accelerated recovery while also prudently planning our business for the remainder of the year as we navigate pandemic-related uncertainties, including market and supply chain disruptions.
I will now share some of the key proof points on how we are executing our accelerated recovery priorities. Mike will then share more of the financial details.
First, we have continued to supercharge e-commerce with digital revenue growing approximately 35% in the quarter, a strong result, particularly when compared to our outside growth last year when stores were closed or under restrictions, which are now open. Importantly, our digital penetration remained consistent at 25%, which is double prepandemic levels. We continue to ramp up investment in digital, while at the same time, growth in our brick-and-mortar retail stores is accelerating, demonstrating our increasing strength in connecting with the consumer across channels.
Next, we are driving product strengths across our brands and regions. The trends we saw last quarter have continued, with consumers excited to come out of COVID restrictions and adopting a hybrid lifestyle towards an increasing mix of wearing occasions. This is still very much grounded in a casual lifestyle that fits both Calvin and Tommy really well. In the quarter, we saw continued strength in key essential product categories like underwear, T-shirts, polos, hoodies, active, sneakers and a rising demand for denim and categories like dresses. We continue to lean into the strength of our key essentials and hero products, which represent a must-have product silhouette in key product categories. Through this work, we saw an improvement in AURs during the quarter, including double-digit increases in some of our biggest investments.
We also continue to cut more unproductive SKUs, including a 20% cut on average for fall 2021. Through this work and by taking a more data- and demand-driven approach, we are driving revenue growth with AUR increases and gross margin expansion.
Overall, our inventory levels across the board are in a very good shape, down 13% versus last year. And as we further improve the way we plan and buy our inventory, we will be able to read and react more quickly to demand. In addition, we continue to invest in our key strategic focus areas. And at the same time, we continue to drive efficiencies across our business as part of our work to operate with more speed, more agility to better follow the consumer in this dynamic environment.
Lastly, we successfully sold our Heritage Brands as planned. This has already enabled an increased focus on Calvin and Tommy, which are higher-return businesses with global growth potential.
So turning to our regional update. While each of our regions is in varying stages of recovery, we drove performance significantly above plan for both revenue and profitability. Let me start with Europe this time. Our European team delivered another quarter of exceptional performance through very strong execution of our accelerated recovery priorities. Both Tommy and Calvin performed significantly above plan, including double-digit growth versus prepandemic levels.
The strength in our Europe business is a very good example of the kind of performance we're able to drive when we execute really well. And it offers a proof point and a blueprint for what's possible in our other regions as well. Across both brands, we are winning with the consumer, driving brand relevance through leaning into the strength of our hero products, and we continue to supercharge our digital and our omnichannel capabilities.
Building on our success in the first quarter, as lockdowns were lifted, we saw great demand for our product, both in our own channels as well as in wholesale. We delivered strong revenue trends supported by significant margin expansion, which included gross margins above 2019 levels, driven by pricing power, lower promotions and higher retail productivity. We also continued to drive operating expense efficiency.
We generated strong digital sales growth of 45%, even against the backdrop of stores reopening, driven by our expanded business with digital pure players. Europe represents our highest e-commerce penetration, well above the company's overall rate of 25%. In our D2C channel, we continued to accelerate our omnichannel capabilities by investing in connected retail technologies.
Paired with the e-commerce performance, we generated very strong retail store sales, with traffic levels sequentially improving versus 2019 as stores reopened. Highlighting the strength of our product in the marketplace, we drove higher conversion, stronger full price sell-throughs and higher AURs. In addition, the strong consumer demand drove significant core replenishment. And as spring and summer products sold through much faster than expected, we transitioned earlier to pre-fall collections. Demand in our future order books across both brands continued to be very strong, with spring 2022 planned up double digits, following double-digit growth for fall holiday 2021.
Moving on to Asia. Our Asia team continues to execute really well, although COVID resurgences across the region, in markets such as Japan, Korea and, most recently, Australia, are making it difficult to see the real underlying strength on how we are improving our execution in the markets. Overall, revenues were relatively in line with prepandemic levels and our plans, led by China.
Despite the current COVID-related challenges, what excites me the most is the strength we are seeing against our strategic focus areas as we continue to drive increased product strength, pricing power, inventory efficiencies from better inventory management and higher gross margins, all driven by the same hero product focus.
China remains a significant growth opportunity for both Tommy and Calvin. As we continue to invest in the market, we are driving brand heat and relevance through our integrated marketing and capsules around key shopping moments, including 6/18 this quarter and, most recently, Chinese Valentine's Day. We are creating unique content and activations to win with the consumer in these key moments.
We have also leaned into our most successful hero products, which are delivering strong KPIs, including higher conversion, higher sell-throughs and higher AURs, and continue to drive comparable store sales increases in retail stores. And as with supercharged e-commerce, we are leveraging data analytics and utilizing new tools and channels to drive performance. We are focused on developing new creative ways to engage with consumers, including expanding our work with WeChat.
Lastly, inventory levels continue to be very lean as we continue to focus on buying closer to demand. Overall, while we are still navigating COVID challenges, like others in the region, we remain confident about the long-term strength and growth opportunities for both of our core brands.
Turning to North America. The region is still under the most pressure, with the lack of tourism remaining our biggest challenge. Tourism continues to trend down significantly versus 2019 levels, which in a normal year, made up 30% to 40% of our total business in the region. Our North American teams are leaning into what's within our control, focusing on the domestic consumer, supercharging e-commerce and driving product strength with AUR and margin improvements. And I'm pleased that we saw a number of green shoots during the quarter.
Importantly, we drove sequential improvements in top and bottom line performance across brands and channels. Some of the proof points of our progress this past quarter include: we drove double-digit growth in our digital business, led by a combination of continuously improving our owned and operated e-commerce sites and strong partnerships with our key wholesale partners, including pure players.
In stores, with the domestic consumer, we saw improved traffic with higher AURs. We're also better optimizing inventory across our channels and improving our ability to react to demand changes. For example, in Canada, where the country's reopening has been slower than other markets, we proactively redirected inventory to the U.S.
Overall, in North America, we have a lot of work still to do, and we are focused on building the business for long-term growth. This work is focused on the same key value drivers that enable our international businesses to perform so strongly to continuously drive brand relevance through product strength, pricing power and winning across channels, digitally-led.
Next, I'll share a few brief global brand highlights, beginning with Calvin Klein. Global brand health remains very strong with consistent high levels of global awareness. Our Pride campaign this year was successful in further building brand awareness. The campaign celebrated defining moments, connecting to global LGBTQIA+ communities with a diverse international cast. It resulted in global reach that was up over 30% on last year. It drove a 300% increase in traffic to our site and delivered strong product sell-through and driven by hero underwear products with limited edition Pride colorways.
In the spring, we launched the brand's first designer collaboration with Heron Preston, which has been very well received by the consumer. This quarter, we will release a second chapter of this collaboration across denim, underwear and other wardrobe essentials.
Looking ahead, we will continue to build out our collaboration strategy, connecting the iconic strength of Calvin Klein with creators and brands from around the world to express their unique perspective of the brand. This includes the second installment of our underwear collaboration with premium retailer, Kith, which taps into the power of Calvin with a Gen Z audience.
Moving on to Tommy Hilfiger. Global brand health KPIs for Tommy also remained very strong. The expansion of our purpose-oriented product offer continues to resonate with consumers, with more than 50% of the global summer pre-fall collection being sustainable. As we focus on TOMMY JEANS' growth potential with younger consumers, we continue to drive brand heat through successful capsules from our Blast From The Past capsule, inspired by pop culture cartoon icons, to our pastels capsule, which drove very strong engagement and sell-throughs. The brand also launched collaborations that amplified our efforts to increase opportunities and visibility for underrepresented communities within the fashion and apparel industries.
In July, we launched the first collaboration with a nongendered capsule featuring Indya Moore. The brand also launched a capsule with emerging Brooklyn designer, Romeo Hunte, following his mentorship with Mr. Hilfiger. The capsule reimagines iconic Tommy pieces with a focus on outerwear and is available on tommy.com as well as through an exclusive partnership with Selfridges. These collaborations have increased traffic to our sites in the U.S. and Europe, with more than 40% driven by new consumers and with significantly higher average retail prices.
In closing, I feel very good about how we came together and drove yet another strong quarter of accelerated recovery. Our increased focus on winning with the consumer through our 2 global power brands, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, is driving results. We're still early days in building our next growth chapter. And I continue to be very optimistic for the future as we lean further into our accelerated recovery priorities, leveraging our core strength and continuously following the consumer to position PVH for sustainable long-term profitable growth.
And before I hand it over to Mike, since this is Mike's last earnings call, I would like to thank him again for his contributions of nearly 30 years to PVH. We are grateful for his guidance and leadership over the years. I'm also pleased to introduce Jim Holmes as our interim CFO. Jim has been with PVH for over 20 years and has played a critical role on our finance team, working very closely with Mike to build our strong financial foundation.
So with that, I would like to hand it over to Mike."
296568,1677729372,2390452,"PVH Corp., Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Sep 01, 2021",2021-09-01,"Earnings Calls","PVH Corp.","Executives","Thanks, Stefan.

Overall, revenues for the second quarter were up 46% as reported and up 40% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year and s",1220,"Thanks, Stefan. The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. Overall, revenues for the second quarter were up 46% as reported and up 40% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year and significantly exceeded our prior revenue guidance. Our international businesses significantly exceeded 2019 prepandemic levels driven by Europe. When we compare 2021 second quarter results to the previous year, it's important to remember that during the second quarter of 2020, virtually all of our retail stores and the majority of our wholesale customer stores were closed globally during the first month of the quarter and were operating at a significantly reduced capacity for the remainder of the quarter as a result of the pandemic.
Our total direct-to-consumer business was up 19% versus the prior year, and owned and operated digital commerce was flat despite exceptionally strong growth in the prior year and significant traffic improvement in brick-and-mortar this year as stores have reopened and capacity restrictions have lessened.
Our retail stores face some continued pressure during the second quarter, although to a much lesser extent than in the previous year, with certain stores temporarily closed in Europe, Australia and Japan for various periods of time. Our wholesale revenues were up 77% versus the prior year driven by strong performance in Europe. In addition, we experienced a significant increase in sales to the digital businesses of our traditional and pure-play wholesale customers.
Our overall revenue through our digital channels grew approximately 35% versus the prior year. And our digital penetration as a percentage of total revenue continues to be approximately 25%, even as stores have reopened.
Looking at our segments. Tommy Hilfiger revenues were up 41% as reported and 35% on a constant currency basis, with international up 40% as reported and 32% on a constant currency basis. North America was up 45%. Calvin Klein revenue was up 56% as reported and 50% on a constant currency basis, with international up 47% as reported and 37% on a constant currency basis. North America was up 75%. Our Heritage revenues were up 37%.
Gross margin was 57.7% for the quarter as compared to 55.9% in the prior year, which reflected substantial improvements across all regions due to less promotional selling. Our inventory is lean, down 13% as of the end of the quarter compared to the prior year. Earnings per share was $2.72 on a non-GAAP basis for the second quarter of 2021 compared to $0.13 in the prior year period and $2.10 in 2019. This beat the top end of our previous guidance by $1.54. The beat was primarily due to the business outperformance largely in Europe for $1.19 as well as a favorable impact of taxes for $0.35, of which $0.25 is timing. Notably, our EBIT margin continued to be very strong at 12.7% for the quarter, driven by continued strength in our international business.
Moving on to our outlook. We are providing our 2021 outlook despite the significant uncertainty due to the pandemic, and as such, it could be subject to material change. Our outlook does not contemplate any significant new store closures, new lockdowns or extensions of current lockdowns beyond what is already known. In addition, the 2021 outlook contemplates higher freight and other logistic costs in the second half of the year to mitigate delays of approximately 4 to 6 weeks on average for certain inventory orders, but does not contemplate any greater supply chain disruptions beyond that. Our actual 2021 results could differ materially from our current outlook as a result of the occurrence of any of these or any other uncontemplated events.
We continue to be encouraged by our international businesses, which are expected to continue to exceed prepandemic levels through the remainder of 2021. We expect North America to continue to face the ongoing challenge of reduced international tourism, which is the source of a significant amount of revenue and not expected to return to prepandemic levels within the year. Additionally, our full year outlook includes the sale of certain of our Heritage Brands, which will result in a decrease in revenue of 2% versus 2020 and have a slightly dilutive impact on earnings.
For the full year, we are projecting revenue to grow approximately 26% to 28% as reported and approximately 24% to 26% on a constant currency basis compared to 2020. We expect gross margin will continue to show improvements for the remainder of the year due to less promotional selling and a favorable shift in regional sales mix compared to the prior year, with our higher-margin international businesses making up a larger portion of total revenue.
While we continue to manage our cost structure proactively by reducing operating expenses and reallocating resources to support strategic growth areas of the business, we expect higher expenses in the second half of the year than the first half. The incremental expenses in the second half include increases in marketing and other investments, which were planned in the second half of the year to coincide with when we expected our stores to be mostly open and to drive momentum as we hopefully exit the pandemic.
We expect our EBIT margin will be nearly flat to our 2019 prepandemic level. We continue to expect that the increase in gross margin in 2021 versus 2020 and the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in 2021 versus 2020 will be relatively similar in magnitude. However, as compared to the first half of 2021, our EBIT margin in the second half will be impacted by the incremental expenses I noted previously as well as freight costs for approximately $0.35 to mitigate supply chain delays.
We expect our interest expense to decrease in 2021 to approximately $105 million compared to $116 million in 2020. We have made $200 million of voluntary debt repayments in the second quarter, bringing our total for the first half of the year to $700 million, which is equivalent to the incremental borrowings we took on in 2020 to manage through the pandemic.
Our tax rate for the year is estimated at 17% to 18%, with the favorable impact we benefited from in the second quarter largely offset in the second half due to time. As a reminder, when we think about our tax rate by quarter, the fourth quarter is expected to benefit from certain discrete items, which bring down the overall rate for the full year.
For the full year in 2021, we are projecting non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $8.50, which is an increase compared to our previous guidance of approximately $6.50 and compared to a loss per share of $1.97 in 2020. The beat was primarily due to business outperformance, largely in Europe for $1.85, along with an improvement in taxes of $0.10 and an improvement of $0.05 from reduced interest expense.
For the third quarter, our revenue is projected to increase 11% to 13%, both as reported and on a constant currency basis. Third quarter non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.95 to $2 compared to $1.32 in the prior year period. We expect interest expense to be about $25 million and taxes to be in the range of 26% to 28% in the third quarter."

And we see that continue. This is a multiyear journey where we drive brand relevance through focusing on winning with product and being very focused on the key categories that matters the most to the consumers.
And then we build hero products around that. And then we connect those hero products with the consumers increasingly tighter and tighter to where the consumers want to shop channel-wise. And that's where we have doubled down on e-commerce. So we see that continue.
On an operating efficiency perspective, that's the other driver of the EBIT rate improvement in Q2. We see that it's coming from being increasingly focused on investing in the accelerated recovery priorities and looking at efficiencies that we can free up that's outside of that. So you will see us continue to drive gross margin rate improvements over time, and you will see us continue to drive operating efficiencies over time."

One from exiting the Heritage retail business, but also just the way the held for sale accounting works. We closed on selling our Heritage wholesale business. So those inventories at the end of Q2 are not on the inventory lines. We have a benefit from that.
But apart from that, our current inventory levels are lean. As Stefan mentioned, partly our disciplined inventory management of buying closer to demand and cutting the unproductive SKUs is really having a benefit. Also at the end of Q2, as we've called out, we are experiencing supply chain delays, 4 to 6 weeks, which is also benefiting a little bit. As we move through the second half, we called out we're going to be incurring about $0.35 worth of airfreight expense, really to make sure that the inventories are getting -- are keeping in line with our sales forecast.
And Bob, if you just -- if you look at the inventory this year versus last year, last year comparisons get difficult. This time last year, we really had been canceling a lot of orders. So if we were to compare it to 2019, which is probably a better comparison, we expect our inventory levels pretty much to get back in line with future sales growth projections by the end of the year."

So we take this as an opportunity to learn as a team to say how do we better plan and buy inventory to demand? And how can we have an inventory level, in average, that's lower in relation to sales than what we historically have had?
So this last -- this past quarter is a good example of -- that we can sell more at a higher pricing power with a lower inventory level. So that is something -- again, it's a multiyear journey, but this quarter was a proof point on how much of a flow-through down to EBIT rate we can have from lower inventory to demand."

And it's a kind of strength that forms, and I mentioned it in my prepared remarks, it forms a blueprint for us for what it could look like when we execute Calvin and Tommy really, really close to the consumer. So they are operating with a very strong consumer focus, very strong brand focus that they translate into stronger and stronger product assortments. And from a channel perspective, they keep moving where the consumer is moving, and they do it with increased pricing power across the channels. So I'm very confident, and we are very confident in their ability to continue to win with the consumer in Europe and continue to expand. So we see it as a multiyear growth opportunity.
Asia -- just, Michael, to mention Asia as well from an international perspective. We are very excited by the improvement in execution by our Asia team. But we can't fully see that in Q2 because of the COVID disturbances. But under the surface, we can see it. So they have the same focus there in connecting where the consumer is going, really starting to supercharge e-commerce and driving -- they also, today, even though the COVID disturbance is under the surface, drive pricing power, lower discount rates, higher sell-throughs. So it's a multiyear growth opportunity from strength in both Europe and Asia."

So proof points this quarter is we see digitally -- digital e-commerce, owned and operated, really taking off. And we see Calvin being ahead there. And those learnings, we can share, and we are sharing with Tommy immediately.
We see that we are starting to lean in, even if it's early days, on the hero product execution. So we see AURs up. We see discount rates down. So we -- our focus is on the domestic consumer and the same accelerated recovery priorities as we see in Europe and in Asia. So -- but we -- from a regional perspective, from our 3 regions, we have the most work to do in North America.

And then we look at the ongoing demand from the assortment we have. And my experience over the years there is that when we continuously do that in a systematic way, we can cut -- we can keep cutting unproductive SKUs.
So every product needs to have an intent that goes into our line. And for fall, as I mentioned, we are cutting 20% of the assortment. So it sounds a lot, but it's just the beginning because we have a history of overproducing SKUs. And now when we focus in on what really matters to the consumer, then we will have -- over the next few years, we will have a continuous opportunity to tighten the assortment to the SKUs that really matters to win with the consumer."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today.
For the third quarter, we delivered another strong quarter of high-quality growth driven by the disciplined execution of our accelerated recovery priorities across both Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger: driving brand and product strength with increased pricing power; supercharging e-commerce to win in the digitally led marketplace, where we are on track for a 25% digital penetration of our total business for the full year, double pre-pandemic levels; all while increasing our discipline in driving cost efficiencies and investing in growth.
All this has resulted in much better-than-expected EBIT margins and EPS, which significantly exceeded our guidance, with EBIT margins for the quarter above pre-pandemic levels and our gross margin rate up 300 basis points versus 2019. Our international businesses continued to execute very well across brands with increased product strength and strong consumer engagement both online and in stores. This resulted in strong sales growth, significantly increased pricing power and margin expansion compared to both last year and to pre-pandemic levels.
In North America, despite worsening logistics disruptions, including U.S. port delays towards the very end of the quarter which shifted revenues from the third to the fourth quarter, the region is still on track to deliver against the full year plan. Without this shift of revenues to Q4, we would have exceeded our overall revenue guidance for the quarter.
Looking ahead at the full year. Despite the COVID-related disruptions we are all currently navigating, based on the strength of our underlying performance trends and most recently through early positive reads of the start of our holiday season, we are affirming the upper end of our revenue guidance and are increasing our earnings guidance for the full year. We are raising our EBIT margin guidance to nearly 10%, which is above 2019 and pre-pandemic levels.
Our guidance is based on the knowledge we have of the COVID situation today and how we have successfully navigated through previous COVID resurgences. Yet we are carefully monitoring developments around the new COVID variant and its impact on the consumer.
Let me now turn to our regional update, starting with Europe. Our Europe team delivered another very strong quarter with continued market share gains. Both Tommy and Calvin generated strong double-digit revenue growth compared to pre-pandemic levels with gross margin expansion above 2019 levels, driven by strong full-price sell-throughs which, combined with ongoing cost efficiencies, drove significantly higher operating margins well above pre-pandemic levels. The region's strong results highlight how we are successfully meeting the consumer through a digitally led omnichannel approach and continuously elevating the brand positioning through having the best hero products in the market for both Tommy and Calvin.
Continued demand for our brands and products drove higher conversion and sell-throughs with strong sales in both our owned and operated channels as well as our wholesale channels. We generated digital sales growth of 23%, which included double-digit growth for both our owned and operated channels and third-party partners, especially with digital pure players. Our investments in building direct digital consumer connections through our own digital business continue to drive engagement and fuel high-quality growth.
Our brick-and-mortar retail business significantly outperformed our plan and impressively delivered double-digit growth above pre-pandemic levels. Demand in our core replenishment business remains strong, on top of future order books for spring 2022 across brands, which, as a reminder, are up double digits.
I visited over 40 stores across 4 countries in Europe this past quarter, and it was incredibly exciting to see the key drivers behind the region's performance and to meet and learn from the teams that are directly driving these strong results. The way we focus on the consumer, drive brand elevation, product strength, pricing power and winning across the marketplace, led by digital, all serve as a blueprint for the type of top-tier execution and financial performance that we will over time be able to deliver for Calvin and Tommy across all our regions.
While we are closely monitoring the recent COVID resurgences in multiple markets in Europe, our business there has demonstrated strong resilience during previous COVID resurgences with our ability to pivot to where the consumer is going faster than most of our competitors by leveraging our connected retail capabilities.
Moving on to Asia. I remain excited about the progress and the underlying performance in the region. Results were led by China, which outperformed our plan, while revenues for the region overall were in line with pre-pandemic levels, and trends were consistent with the prior quarter. This is despite facing additional COVID resurgences across markets, which was particularly pronounced in Australia. For a significant portion of the quarter, over half of our stores in Australia were closed. And we are now pleased that strong consumer demand has returned as the market has been able to open up again.
In Asia, we continue to invest in driving growth and building awareness for our brands, focusing on key consumer moments, strengthening product storytelling for key categories and hero products and enhancing the consumer experience in our stores. With our focus on driving brand and product relevance, our regional and local marketing campaigns are resonating with consumers as we saw strong performance of our fall and winter collections and we continue to build brand heat and strong engagement, particularly around key holidays.
For example, China's 11/11 Singles' Day outperformed our plan with double-digit sales increases for both Tommy and Calvin with strong full price selling, which follows a nice improvement of traffic in the market. We also continue to further enhance the consumer experience both online as well as off-line through new concepts. Ahead of Singles' Day, we hosted a CK Jeans House of Denim pop-up in Shanghai. This event showcased brand storytelling and featured interactive consumer engagement activities, driving significant social media exposure with over 300 million impressions.
Online, our interactive experiences on Tmall and live streaming events are achieving high viewership and engagement, and we're excited about the upcoming special product capsules and 360 digital activations in honor of the Chinese Lunar New Year. In addition, inventory levels continue to be very lean as we are buying inventory closer to demand.
Turning to North America. The region continued to face pressure from the lack of tourism, which pre-pandemic accounted for 30% to 40% of our total revenues in the market. In addition, towards the end of the quarter, as I mentioned earlier, we experienced worsening U.S. port delays in October, which pushed some of our revenues from Q3 to Q4. Inventory receipt delays have also impacted our retail businesses in this region, especially for Tommy Hilfiger, which has a higher penetration of seasonal product offerings.
However, there are some early green shoots, and we saw borders start to reopen. In the quarter, I had the opportunity to visit 30 stores in 5 regional markets in North America. And I remain very encouraged about the multiyear opportunity to unlock a sustainable, increasingly profitable business for both brands.
Given the lack of tourism due to COVID, our teams are leaning into our accelerated recovery priorities with a much increased focus on the domestic consumer, particularly with the Gen Z and millennials, and driving towards an increased product strength with pricing power and supercharging e-commerce while winning in the whole marketplace in a balanced and sustainable way.
Some proof points of our progress this quarter include: we continue to drive less discounting and higher AURs as domestic consumer responded well to newness in our fall product, especially in our focus categories and iconic hero products, such as knits, fleece, denim, underwear.
For example, ahead of the holiday season come in partnered with Amazon Fashion, Amazon Live and Amazon Music to deliver a shoppable live stream holiday special with platinum-selling hit rapper Saweetie. The event drove the highest-traffic day on the CK brand store on Amazon Fashion outside of Prime Day.
Overall, as we have shared before, we know we have the most work to do in the North America region to unlock the multiyear opportunity ahead. This is something we are leaning into with full force, and we'll keep you updated along the way.
Next, I'll share a few brief global brand highlights, beginning with Calvin Klein. Global brand health remains strong with a recent increase in purchase intent along with continued strong global awareness. This past quarter was great globally for hero products in our key focus categories with double-digit growth in sales and much higher AURs. Our global fall campaign, The Language of Calvin Klein, resonated very well with our consumers, featuring regionally relevant ambassadors, including Jenny Kim, Damson Idris and Kaia Gerber, and focus on hero products in support of key seasonal categories like underwear and jeans.
We also continue to connect our iconic Calvin Klein brand to people who shape culture by launching the second chapter of the brand's collaboration with designer Heron Preston. The response has been very positive. And as we saw with the first drop, many styles sold out very quickly. Celebrities and influencers, including Skid Game Star, HoYeon Jung, continue to wear and organically post our products. The collection continues to deliver higher AURs, higher sell-throughs, high conversion and highlighting the strength and relevance of our collaborations when we connect our brand to culture and the younger consumer. We're looking forward to the upcoming holiday season, and we have a strong social media-based campaign planned for this key selling period.
Moving on to Tommy Hilfiger. Consumer connection, brand awareness and brand relevance remain strong with a unique DNA of Tommy as a key growth engine for our business globally. Consumers responded very positively to our seasonal collections. For menswear, the expansion of hero product programs, such as the 1985 Menswear Essentials Collection, continued to drive strong results.
Our recent collaboration with Timberland has been very well received. This unique iconic collaboration drove brand heat and exceeded expectations in traffic and sell-through with an authentic focus on sustainability and inclusivity. In Europe, we saw strong double-digit increases in traffic in activated stores and on tommy.com, and we achieved a 100% sell-through within 2 weeks. The collaboration is attracting new audiences with 40% of site visits being made by new users, and we experienced a significant increase in average spend.
In North America, the capsule is gaining momentum. Over 200 million consumer impressions were generated across media in 2 weeks, and significant buzz was generated at ComplexCon through a dedicated brand activation during the event. Lastly, the brand recently kicked off its World of Hilfiger holiday campaign, which welcomes to holiday Spirit, embracing traditions, fresh beginnings and the brand's New York City routes.
In closing, as I have shared previously, when the pandemic hit, we first set out to successfully navigate through the initial phase of the COVID crisis, which we did; and to do that in a way that sets us up to drive an accelerated recovery, which we are now driving, all while positioning us to win in the new normal coming out of it. We look forward to sharing more of how we will win in the new normal when we present our multiyear growth plan at our upcoming Investor Day in mid-April. It will be the first Investor Day for PVH in over 10 years, and it will be an important moment for us to take you through our strategy and long-term performance targets as we look ahead to tapping into more of our full potential: focusing in on our core strength, connecting them closer to where the consumer is going than any time before, all with the goal to win with the consumer, drive long-term profitable growth while driving fashion forward for good.
On Investor Day, I look forward to introducing you to our regional and brand leaders who are key drivers on this journey. Before I turn the call over to Jim, I would like to thank all our associates around the world for your hard work and critical contributions this year. And I wish everyone a happy, healthy and safe holiday season.
And with that, I would like to hand the call over to Jim."
296568,1758441903,2454260,"PVH Corp., Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Dec 02, 2021",2021-12-02,"Earnings Calls","PVH Corp.","Executives","Thanks, Stefan. The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release.Overall, revenues for the third quarter were up 10% compared to the prior year but below our previous guidance due to worsening logistic",1145,"Thanks, Stefan. The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release.
Overall, revenues for the third quarter were up 10% compared to the prior year but below our previous guidance due to worsening logistics disruptions in October, including significant U.S. port delays, which resulted in a 4% negative impact from an unplanned shift in the timing of U.S. wholesale shipments from the third quarter into the fourth quarter. Absent this shift, our revenues for the third quarter would have exceeded our guidance.
Third quarter revenue also reflects a 4% reduction from the sale of the Heritage Brands business, which closed on the first day of the third quarter, and also the exit from the Heritage Brands retail business that was substantially completed in the second quarter of 2021. Our retail stores faced continued pressure during the third quarter with the majority of stores temporarily closed in Australia for most of this year's quarter. Owned and operated digital commerce increased 21%, and our overall revenue through our digital channels grew approximately 15% on top of exceptionally strong growth in the prior year. The impact of foreign currency translation on our revenues was immaterial for the quarter.
Looking at our segments. Tommy Hilfiger revenues were up 12% with international up 11% and North America up 13% versus third quarter of 2020. Calvin Klein revenue was up 22% with international up 19% and North America up 27%. Our Heritage revenues were down 36%, which included a 40% decline from the Heritage Brands transaction and the exit from the Heritage Brands retail business.
Gross margin was very strong at 57.7% for the quarter as compared to 52% in the prior year and an increase of over 300 basis points compared to 2019 pre-pandemic levels, which drove operating margin expansion. The improvement was primarily due to increased full price sales and a favorable shift in regional sales mix, which more than offset higher freight costs, including an increase in airfreight.
Inventory was down 7% at the end of the quarter compared to the prior year, primarily due to the Heritage Brands sale and the exit from the Heritage Brands retail business. However, within our total inventory, our on-hand levels were down mid-teens versus last year; while our in-transit inventory levels increased over 50% due to extended lead times from supply chain and logistics disruptions, including U.S. port delays, which drove the shift in timing of U.S. wholesale shipments from the third to fourth quarter that I mentioned earlier.
Despite the unplanned shift of timing of U.S. wholesale shipments, we significantly exceeded our earnings guidance for the third quarter. Notably, the shifted shipments were lower-margin, seasonless goods that we did not use airfreight to transport it.
Earnings per share was $2.67 compared to $1.32 in the prior year period, beating the top end of our previous guidance by $0.67. The beat was primarily due to business outperformance for approximately $0.50, driven by gross margin and expense improvements. Also included in the beat is an approximately $0.17 favorable impact from taxes due to our mix of earnings. Notably, our EBIT margin continued to be very strong at 11.4% for the quarter, exceeding 2019 pre-pandemic levels, driven by continued strength in our international business.
Additionally, we made over $100 million of voluntary term loan payments in the third quarter, bringing voluntary payments to over $800 million for the first 9 months of 2021. And we repurchased approximately 149 million of common stock and reinstated our cash dividend.
Moving on to our outlook. We are providing our 2021 outlook despite the continued significant uncertainty due to the pandemic, including the Omicron variant and related supply chain and logistics disruptions globally. We continue to be encouraged by our international businesses, which are expected to continue to exceed pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter. We expect North America to continue to face the ongoing challenge of reduced international tourism, which was the source of approximately 30% to 40% of pre-pandemic revenue from the region and higher for Tommy Hilfiger than for Calvin Klein. We are not planning for international tourism to return to any significant levels in the fourth quarter.
In addition, North America has been and continues to be the region most challenged by supply chain disruptions, including higher airfreight costs and lower-than-optimal inventory levels on hand in stores. For the full year, we are reaffirming the top end of our revenue guidance range and are projecting revenue to grow approximately 27% to 28% as reported and approximately 25% to 26% on a constant currency basis compared to 2020.
We expect gross margin will continue to show significant improvement for the remainder of the year due to more full price selling and a favorable shift in regional sales mix compared to the prior year, with our higher-margin international businesses making up a larger portion of total revenue. We expect our fourth quarter gross margin rate will be relatively in line with the prior 2 quarters.
We now expect our full year EBIT margin will exceed our 2019 pre-pandemic level and will reach nearly 10%. However, our EBIT margin in the fourth quarter is expected to be below 2019 levels and also to the first 9 months of 2021 as the fourth quarter is more heavily impacted by incremental airfreight as well as planned increases in marketing and other investments. We expect our interest expense to decrease in 2021 to approximately $105 million compared to $116 million in 2020. Our tax rate for the year is estimated at 16% to 17%.
For the full year in 2021, we are projecting non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $9.25, which is an increase compared to our previous guidance of $8.50 and compares to a loss per share of $1.97 in 2020. The increase versus previous guidance was primarily due to better-than-anticipated gross margin expansion and operating expense efficiencies worth approximately $0.60, along with an improvement in taxes of approximately $0.15.
For the fourth quarter, our revenue is projected to increase 11% to 14% as reported and 16% to 19% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. Compared to our fourth quarter previously implied revenue guidance, this reflects the positive impact of the shift of U.S. wholesale shipments from the third quarter into the fourth quarter and a 2% negative impact of foreign currency translation, primarily due to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to the euro. The underlying business performance has not changed compared to our previously implied guidance.
Fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be approximately $1.94 compared to a loss per share of $0.38 in the prior year period. Our fourth quarter guidance reflects an incremental $0.10 of expected airfreight costs versus our prior expectations.
And with that, operator, we would like to open it up to questions."

So looking forward, Jim can give you a little bit more of the details of what we expect in terms of AUC increases, but we are confident from a product strength perspective that we will continue to drive AUR increases.

But then excluding the wholesale shift and the FX changes, it looked like the underlying sales for fourth quarter pretty much where you thought they'd be, but the SG&A looks like it stepped up a little bit more for fourth quarter. Maybe help us think about, if that's right, what might have stepped up.
And then Stephane, as we spoke through this year, we talked a little bit about how much opportunity you see to realign work streams and accelerate product lead times in different brands.

As far as when you get below revenue, really, the main changes we had to incur an additional $0.10 -- $10 million, $0.10 of airfreight costs in Q4. But really, everything underlying, we're still generating very strong gross margins, just like in Q3, continuing to gain expense efficiencies.

And digital is a key part there. So when we look at 11/11, as an example, the Singles' Day that's now way beyond the day, we performed really, really strongly. And then -- so digital is an important component, leaning into the different consumer moments like the 11/11 and then it's the product focus on making sure that we play into the right big categories that matters the most.

If we talk about Heritage, yes, it has helped the gross margin somewhat. Smaller -- the Heritage business was a much smaller base, so it's not moving a PVH needle that much, but it is a slight improvement. But also just maybe some of the offsets to that improvement in Q3, and particularly in Q4, is the airfreight cost. So we called out about $45 million of additional airfreight cost, which is all hitting in the second half.

And what's so exciting there is to see the consumer focus, the brand focus, continuously elevating the brand position, driving very strong product execution and AUR coming out of that and then having a multichannel, omnichannel approach to winning with the consumer.
So when we see European markets resurgence in COVID, we see that we have been better than most in the market to pivot to where the consumer then how the consumer acts because the consumer is resilient and the consumer is strong. So even though we have a fourth wave now, we see that -- in countries where we have COVID restrictions coming in, we start to see a pattern from having navigated successfully through a number of waves.
So we see brick-and-mortar foot traffic slightly come down, but we see conversion go up in brick-and-mortar, and then we see the consumer immediately pivot to digital. Because when I look at the consumer in Europe and overall is that the consumer is starting to get back to life as we knew it. So we are 1.5 years, almost 2 years, into COVID.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. For the third quarter, we delivered another strong quarter of high-quality growth, driven by the disciplined execution of our accelerated recovery priorities across both",2028,"Thank you, Dana. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. 
For the third quarter, we delivered another strong quarter of high-quality growth, driven by the disciplined execution of our accelerated recovery priorities across both Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger: driving brand and product strength with increased pricing power, supercharging e-commerce to win in the digitally led marketplace, where we are on track for a 25% digital penetration of our total business for the full year, double pre-pandemic levels, all while increasing our discipline in driving cost efficiencies and investing in growth.  
All this has resulted in much better-than-expected EBIT margins and EPS, which significantly exceeded our guidance, with EBIT margins for the quarter above pre-pandemic levels and our gross margin rate up 300 basis points versus 2019. Our international businesses continued to execute very well across brands, with increased product strength and strong consumer engagement, both online and in stores. This resulted in strong sales growth, significantly increased pricing power and margin expansion compared to both last year and to pre-pandemic levels.  
In North America, despite worsening logistics disruptions, including U.S. port delays towards the very end of the quarter, which shifted revenues from the third to the fourth quarter, the region is still on track to deliver against the full year plans. Without this shift of revenues to Q4, we would have exceeded our overall revenue guidance for the quarter.  
Looking ahead at the full year. Despite the COVID-related disruptions we are all currently navigating, based on the strength of our underlying performance trends and most recently through early positive reads of the start of our holiday season, we are affirming the upper end of our revenue guidance and are increasing our earnings guidance for the full year. 
We are raising our EBIT margin guidance to nearly 10%, which is above 2019 and pre-pandemic levels. Our guidance is based on the knowledge we have of the COVID situation today and how we have successfully navigated through previous COVID resurgences, yet we are carefully monitoring developments around the new COVID variant and its impact on the consumer.  
Let me now turn to our regional update, starting with Europe. Our Europe team delivered another very strong quarter with continued market share gains. Both Tommy and Calvin generated strong double-digit revenue growth compared to pre-pandemic levels, with gross margin expansion above 2019 levels driven by strong full-price sell-throughs, which, combined with ongoing cost efficiencies, drove significantly higher operating margins well above pre-pandemic levels. 
The region's strong results highlight how we are successfully meeting the consumer through a digitally led omnichannel approach and continuously elevating the brand positioning through having the best hero products in the market for both Tommy and Calvin. Continued demand for our brands and products drove higher conversion and sell-throughs, with strong sales in both our owned and operated channels as well as our wholesale channels. 
We generated digital sales growth of 23%, which included double-digit growth for both our owned and operated channels and third-party partners, especially with digital pure players. Our investments in building direct digital consumer connections through our own digital business continue to drive engagement and fuel high-quality growth.  
Our brick-and-mortar retail business significantly outperformed our plan and impressively delivered double-digit growth above pre-pandemic levels. Demand in our core replenishment business remains strong, on top of future order books for spring 2022 across brands, which, as a reminder, are up double digits. I visited over 40 stores across 4 countries in Europe this past quarter, and it was incredibly exciting to see the key drivers behind the region's performance and to meet and learn from the teams that are directly driving these strong results. 
The way we focus on the consumer, drive brand elevation, product strength, pricing power and winning across the marketplace, led by digital, all serve as a blueprint for the type of top-tier execution and financial performance that we will, over time, be able to deliver for Calvin and Tommy across all our regions. While we are closely monitoring the recent COVID resurgences in multiple markets in Europe, our business there has demonstrated strong resilience during previous COVID resurgences, with our ability to pivot to where the consumer is going faster than most of our competitors by leveraging our connected retail capabilities.  
Moving on to Asia. I remain excited about the progress and the underlying performance in the region. Results were led by China, which outperformed our plan, while revenues for the region overall were in line with pre-pandemic levels, and trends were consistent with the prior quarter. This is despite facing additional COVID resurgences across markets, which was particularly pronounced in Australia. For a significant portion of the quarter, over half of our stores in Australia were closed. And we are now pleased that strong consumer demand has returned as the market has been able to open up again.  
In Asia, we continue to invest in driving growth and building awareness for our brands, focusing on key consumer moments, strengthening product storytelling for key categories and hero products and enhancing the consumer experience in our stores. With our focus on driving brand and product relevance, our regional and local marketing campaigns are resonating with consumers as we saw strong performance of our fall and winter collections. 
And we continue to build brand heat and strong engagement, particularly around key holidays. For example, China's 11/11 Singles' Day outperformed our plan with double-digit sales increases for both Tommy and Calvin, with strong full-price selling which follows a nice improvement of traffic in the market. 
We also continue to further enhance the consumer experience, both online as well as off-line, through new concepts. Ahead of Singles' Day, we hosted a CK Jeans House of Denim pop-up in Shanghai. This event showcased brand storytelling and featured interactive consumer engagement activities, driving significant social media exposure with over 300 million impressions.  
Online, our interactive experiences on Tmall and live streaming events are achieving high viewership and engagement. And we're excited about the upcoming special product capsules and 360 digital activations in honor of the Chinese Lunar New Year. In addition, inventory levels continue to be very lean as we are buying inventory closer to demand.  
Turning to North America. The region continued to face pressure from the lack of tourism, which, pre-pandemic, accounted for 30% to 40% of our total revenues in the market. In addition, towards the end of the quarter, as I mentioned earlier, we experienced worsening U.S. port delays in October, which pushed some of our revenues from Q3 to Q4. 
Inventory receipt delays have also impacted our retail businesses in this region, especially for Tommy Hilfiger, which has a higher penetration of seasonal product offerings. However, there are some early green shoots, and we saw borders start to reopen. In the quarter, I had the opportunity to visit 30 stores in 5 regional markets in North America. And I remain very encouraged about the multiyear opportunity to unlock a sustainable, increasingly profitable business for both brands. 
Given the lack of tourism due to COVID, our teams are leaning in to our accelerated recovery priorities with a much increased focus on the domestic consumer, particularly with the Gen Z and millennials, and driving towards an increased product strength with pricing power and supercharging e-commerce while winning in the whole marketplace in a balanced and sustainable way. Some proof points of our progress this quarter include: we continue to drive less discounting and higher AURs as domestic consumer responded well to newness in our fall product, especially in our focus categories and iconic hero products such as knits, fleece, denim, underwear. 
For example, ahead of the holiday season, Calvin partnered with Amazon Fashion, Amazon Live and Amazon Music to deliver a shoppable live stream holiday special with platinum-selling hit rapper, Saweetie. The event drove the highest-traffic day on the CK brand store on Amazon Fashion outside of Prime Day. Overall, as we have shared before, we know we have the most work to do in the North America region to unlock the multiyear opportunity ahead. This is something we are leaning into with full force, and we'll keep you updated along the way.  
Next, I'll share a few brief global brand highlights, beginning with Calvin Klein. Global brand health remains strong, with a recent increase in purchase intent, along with continued strong global awareness. This past quarter was great globally for hero products in our key focus categories, with double-digit growth in sales and much higher AURs. Our global fall campaign, The Language of Calvin Klein, resonated very well with our consumers, featuring regionally relevant ambassadors, including Jennie Kim, Damson Idris and Kaia Gerber, and focus on hero products in support of key seasonal categories like underwear and jeans.  
We also continue to connect our iconic Calvin Klein brand to people who shape culture by launching the second chapter of the brand's collaboration with designer Heron Preston. The response has been very positive. And as we saw with the first drop, many styles sold out very quickly. Celebrities and influencers, including Squid Game star, Ho Yeon Jung, continue to wear and organically post our products. 
The collection continues to deliver higher AURs, higher sell-throughs, high conversion and highlighting the strength and relevance of our collaborations when we connect our brand to culture and the younger consumer. We're looking forward to the upcoming holiday season, and we have a strong social media-based campaign planned for this key selling period.  
Moving on to Tommy Hilfiger. Consumer connection, brand awareness and brand relevance remain strong, with the unique DNA of Tommy as a key growth engine for our business globally. Consumers responded very positively to our seasonal collections. For menswear, the expansion of hero product programs, such as the 1985 Menswear Essentials Collection, continued to drive strong results.  
Our recent collaboration with Timberland has been very well received. This unique iconic collaboration drove brand heat and exceeded expectations in traffic and sell-through, with an authentic focus on sustainability and inclusivity. In Europe, we saw strong double-digit increases in traffic in activated stores and on tommy.com, and we achieved a 100% sell-through within 2 weeks. The collaboration is attracting new audiences, with 40% of site visits being made by new users. And we experienced a significant increase in average spend. 
In North America, the capsule is gaining momentum. Over 200 million consumer impressions were generated across media in 2 weeks. And significant buzz was generated at ComplexCon through a dedicated brand activation during the event. Lastly, the brand recently kicked off its WORLD OF HILFIGER Holiday campaign, which welcomes the holiday spirit, embracing traditions, fresh beginnings and the brand's New York City routes.  
In closing, as I have shared previously, when the pandemic hit, we first set out to successfully navigate through the initial phase of the COVID crisis, which we did, and to do that in a way that sets us up to drive an accelerated recovery, which we are now driving, all while positioning us to win in the new normal coming out of it. We look forward to sharing more of how we will win in the new normal when we present our multiyear growth plan at our upcoming Investor Day in mid-April. 
It will be the first Investor Day for PVH in over 10 years, and it will be an important moment for us to take you through our strategy and long-term performance targets as we look ahead to tapping into more of our full potential: focusing in on our core strength, connecting them closer to where the consumer is going than any time before, all with the goal to win with the consumer, drive long-term profitable growth while driving fashion forward for good. On Investor Day, I look forward to introducing you to our regional and brand leaders, who are key drivers on this journey. 
Before I turn the call over to Jim, I would like to thank all our associates around the world for your hard work and critical contributions this year. And I wish everyone a happy, healthy and safe holiday season. And with that, I would like to hand the call over to Jim."
296568,1758441903,2454369,"PVH Corp., Q3 2022 Earnings Call, Dec 02, 2021",2021-12-02,"Earnings Calls","PVH Corp.","Executives","Thanks, Stefan. The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. Overall, revenues for the third quarter were up 10% compared to the prior year but below our previous guidance due to worsening logistics",1143,"Thanks, Stefan. The comments I'm about to make are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. Overall, revenues for the third quarter were up 10% compared to the prior year but below our previous guidance due to worsening logistics disruptions in October, including significant U.S. port delays, which resulted in a 4% negative impact from an unplanned shift in the timing of U.S. wholesale shipments from the third quarter into the fourth quarter. 
Absent this shift, our revenues for the third quarter would have exceeded our guidance. Third quarter revenue also reflects a 4% reduction from the sale of the Heritage Brands business, which closed on the first day of the third quarter, and also the exit from the Heritage Brands retail business that was substantially completed in the second quarter of 2021. 
Our retail stores faced continued pressure during the third quarter, with the majority of stores temporarily closed in Australia for most of this year's quarter. Owned and operated digital commerce increased 21%, and our overall revenue through our digital channels grew approximately 15% on top of exceptionally strong growth in the prior year. The impact of foreign currency translation on our revenues was immaterial for the quarter.  
Looking at our segments. Tommy Hilfiger revenues were up 12%, with international up 11% and North America up 13% versus third quarter of 2020. Calvin Klein revenue was up 22%, with international up 19% and North America up 27%. Our Heritage revenues were down 36%, which included a 40% decline from the Heritage Brands transaction and the exit from the Heritage Brands retail business.  
Gross margin was very strong at 57.7% for the quarter as compared to 52% in the prior year and an increase of over 300 basis points compared to 2019 pre-pandemic levels, which drove operating margin expansion. The improvement was primarily due to increased full-price sales and a favorable shift in regional sales mix, which more than offset higher freight costs, including an increase in airfreight.  
Inventory was down 7% at the end of the quarter compared to the prior year, primarily due to the Heritage Brands sale and the exit from the Heritage Brands retail business. However, within our total inventory, our on-hand levels were down mid-teens versus last year while our in-transit inventory levels increased over 50% due to extended lead times from supply chain and logistics disruptions, including U.S. port delays, which drove the shift in timing of U.S. wholesale shipments from the third to fourth quarter that I mentioned earlier.  
Despite the unplanned shift of timing of U.S. wholesale shipments, we significantly exceeded our earnings guidance for the third quarter. Notably, the shifted shipments were lower-margin, seasonless goods that we did not use airfreight to transport them.  
Earnings per share was $2.67 compared to $1.32 in the prior year period, beating the top end of our previous guidance by $0.67. The beat was primarily due to business outperformance for approximately $0.50, driven by gross margin and expense improvements. Also included in the beat is an approximately $0.17 favorable impact from taxes due to our mix of earnings. 
Notably, our EBIT margin continued to be very strong at 11.4% for the quarter, exceeding 2019 pre-pandemic levels, driven by continued strength in our international business. Additionally, we made over $100 million of voluntary term loan payments in the third quarter, bringing voluntary payments to over $800 million for the first 9 months of 2021. And we repurchased approximately 149 million of common stock and reinstated our cash dividend.  
Moving on to our outlook. We are providing our 2021 outlook despite the continued significant uncertainty due to the pandemic, including the Omicron variant and related supply chain and logistics disruptions globally. We continue to be encouraged by our international businesses, which are expected to continue to exceed pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter. 
We expect North America to continue to face the ongoing challenge of reduced international tourism, which was the source of approximately 30% to 40% of pre-pandemic revenue from the region, and higher for Tommy Hilfiger than for Calvin Klein. We are not planning for international tourism to return to any significant levels in the fourth quarter. In addition, North America has been and continues to be the region most challenged by supply chain disruptions, including higher airfreight costs and lower-than-optimal inventory levels on hand in stores. 
For the full year, we are reaffirming the top end of our revenue guidance range and are projecting revenue to grow approximately 27% to 28%, as reported, and approximately 25% to 26% on a constant currency basis compared to 2020. We expect gross margin will continue to show significant improvement for the remainder of the year due to more full-price selling and a favorable shift in regional sales mix compared to the prior year, with our higher-margin international businesses making up a larger portion of total revenue. We expect our fourth quarter gross margin rate will be relatively in line with the prior 2 quarters.
We now expect our full year EBIT margin will exceed our 2019 pre-pandemic level and will reach nearly 10%. However, our EBIT margin in the fourth quarter is expected to be below 2019 levels and also to the first 9 months of 2021 as the fourth quarter is more heavily impacted by incremental airfreight as well as planned increases in marketing and other investments. We expect our interest expense to decrease in 2021 to approximately $105 million compared to $116 million in 2020. Our tax rate for the year is estimated at 16% to 17%.
For the full year in 2021, we are projecting non-GAAP earnings per share to be approximately $9.25, which is an increase compared to our previous guidance of $8.50 and compares to a loss per share of $1.97 in 2020. The increase versus previous guidance was primarily due to better-than-anticipated gross margin expansion and operating expense efficiencies worth approximately $0.60, along with an improvement in taxes of approximately $0.15.
For the fourth quarter, our revenue is projected to increase 11% to 14%, as reported, and 16% to 19% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. Compared to our fourth quarter previously implied revenue guidance, this reflects the positive impact of the shift of U.S. wholesale shipments from the third quarter into the fourth quarter and a 2% negative impact of foreign currency translation, primarily due to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to the euro. The underlying business performance has not changed compared to our previously implied guidance.
Fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be approximately $1.94 compared to a loss per share of $0.38 in the prior year period. Our fourth quarter guidance reflects an incremental $0.10 of expected airfreight costs versus our prior expectations.
And with that, operator, we would like to open it up to questions."

In Q4, with revenues, the underlying business is pretty much held, and we were able to cover some weakening of the euro. The euro did weaken against the U.S. dollar, particularly we saw that in the last month.
As far as when you get below revenue, really, the main changes we had to incur an additional $0.10 -- $10 million, $0.10 of airfreight costs in Q4. But really, everything underlying, we're still generating very strong gross margins, just like in Q3, continuing to gain expense efficiencies.
The marketing that I alluded to was always planned to always be very heavily weighted to the second half of the year, particularly to Q4, where we really wanted to connect those -- that spending to some of the consumer moments that we have, particularly Black Friday and Singles' Day."

Within that, then develop an increased focus on hero products, the most essential products in the consumers' wardrobe. 
Every single product has to have an intent, then cutting the assortment tail. So we have done a good first job on that. We will -- looking ahead, coming back to your question, we see opportunities to continue to cut the unproductive assortment tail.

It's very much driven by leaning into Calvin and Tommy and connecting them even closer to the consumer, and digital is a key part there. 
So when we look at 11/11, as an example, the Singles' Day that's now way beyond the day, we performed really, really strongly. And then -- so digital is an important component, leaning into the different consumer moments like the 11/11, and then it's the product focus on making sure that we play into the right big categories that matters the most. And then we see that the hero products that we have been developing over the last year is really resonating in China with the Chinese consumer and leading to higher sell-throughs and higher AURs."

If we talk about Heritage, yes, it has helped the gross margin somewhat. Smaller -- the Heritage business was a much smaller base, so it's not moving the PVH needle that much, but it is a slight improvement. 
But also, just maybe some of the offsets to that improvement in Q3, and particularly in Q4, is the airfreight cost.

And what's so exciting there is to see the consumer focus, the brand focus, continuously elevating the brand position, driving very strong product execution and AUR coming out of that and then having a multichannel, omnichannel approach to winning with the consumer.
So when we see European markets resurgence in COVID, we see that we have been better than most in the market to pivot to where the consumer then how the consumer acts because the consumer is resilient and the consumer is strong. So even though we have a fourth wave now, we see that in countries where we have COVID restrictions coming in, we start to see a pattern from having navigated successfully through a number of waves.
So we see brick-and-mortar foot traffic slightly come down, but we see conversion go up in brick-and-mortar, and then we see the consumer immediately pivot to digital. Because when I look at the consumer in Europe and overall is that the consumer is starting to get back to life as we knew it. So we are 1.5 years, almost 2 years, into COVID.
