Before we move to quarter results, let me speak for a moment about our recent growth news. As you know, a key part of our strategy is to operate in states where we can best serve customers, drive efficiencies and continue to grow our regulated business. 
Recall that earlier in the year, we announced the sale of our Michigan operation. And as you know, in late 2019, we announced the sale of our New York operation. This slide shows what our new regulated service territory will look like after the announced transactions are completed. 
Moving to Slide 6. We recently announced what will be the largest municipal acquisition in Pennsylvania American Water's history. On April 6, we signed an agreement to acquire the wastewater treatment and collection system for the City of York, Pennsylvania. This agreement will add an equivalent customer connection total of more than 45,000. As part of the agreement, Pennsylvania American Water will also continue to provide contracted wholesale wastewater treatment and disposal for 7 surrounding communities of York. We look forward to developing strong relationships that meet the needs of all customers, including those outside the city. 
This is yet another example of our strategy to grow where we can add value. It was also executed under Act 12 of 2016, which allows municipalities to sell their water and wastewater systems for a price-based on the fair market value of the facilities. York Major, Michael Helfrich said, ""This is a new day for York, one filled with an unwavering optimism as our residents and businesses can finally breathe the sign of relief for the first time in decades.""
Turning to Slide 7. New Jersey American Water announced an agreement during the first quarter to acquire the water and wastewater assets of Egg Harbor City, New Jersey. This municipally owned water and wastewater system serves approximately 3,000 customer connections. The agreement is notable as is the first sale being executed through New Jersey's Water Infrastructure Protection Act, or WIPA. That law facilitates the sale or lease of municipally owned water or wastewater systems that meet certain criteria, such as significant noncompliance. Egg Harbor City Major Lisa Jiampetti said, ""This sale will mean better infrastructure, stable water rates and millions in funds for the city."" Additionally, Virginia American Water signed an agreement to acquire the drinking water assets at the town of Waverly. This municipally owned water system serves approximately 900 customer connections and is our first agreement signed under the new fair market value legislation in the Virginia commonwealth. 
To date this year, we've added approximately 4,500 customer connections through closed acquisitions and organic growth. We have under agreement more than 86,000 customer connections, including the City of York. In total, the acquisitions closed so far this year, and all those under agreement represent approximately $440 million in additional rate base and an estimated $115 million of follow-on additional capital expenditures over the next 5 years, and our growth pipeline remains strong with more than 1.2 million customer connection opportunities. 
Lastly, I'd like to provide an update on the sale of New York American water. In late March 2021, the New York State Department of Public Service Special Council released the findings of their municipalization study. As expected, the study focused primarily on the need for tax relief for customers, including recommendations to eliminate the special franchise tax. The study also focused on the feasibility of municipalization. These findings were not addressed in the governor's recently released budget. 
Our New York subsidiary continues to work constructively with the New York State Department of Public Service, including through ongoing settlement discussions with all parties, and we remain confident that the sale will be completed. We're working diligently to close the transaction. 
Assuming progress continues as expected, we believe that the net impact from New York results on 2021 results won't impact our '21 guidance range. Further, we don't anticipate any impact on the expected timing of our previously discussed future equity needs. 
Let's move to Slide 8 and cover our first quarter results. Our first quarter 2021 earnings per share of $0.73 were up 7.4% compared to the first quarter of 2020. We invested capital of $342 million in the first quarter as we continue to balance that investment by focusing on operating and capital efficiencies, constructive regulatory outcomes and by leveraging the size and scale of our business. As a reminder, we've challenged ourselves with a new O&M efficiency target of 3.4% by 2025. 
With this strong start to 2021 and continued execution of our strategies, we're affirming today our 2021 earnings guidance range of $4.18 to $4.28 per share. We are also affirming our long-term EPS compound annual growth rate in the 7% to 10% range. 
Turning to Slide 9. Let's go through some of the regulatory and legislative highlights in the first quarter of 2021. In February, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission unanimously approved a previously filed settlement agreement between Pennsylvania American Water and the PUC Bureau of Investigation and Enforcement. The request was driven by $1.64 billion of investment from 2019 through 2022. The Pennsylvania American Water was authorized additional annualized revenues of $90 million over a 2-year period, excluding an agreed to reduction in revenues for tax savings passed back to customers as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. 
On April 7, the Missouri Public Service Commission approved an agreement reached by the parties in Missouri American Water request for a rate adjustment. The rate order includes approximately $620 million in water and wastewater system improvements made since the end of 2017. Rates will be effective on May 28, 2021, and will result in additional annualized water and wastewater revenue of $22 million, excluding the reduction in revenue for tax savings passed back to customers, also a result of TCJA. 
We also have a pending rate case in Iowa, which is moving on schedule, and we filed a rate case in West Virginia on April 30. 
Additionally, as we've reported previously, California American Water filed for new rates in July 2019. The case covers 2021 through 2023. In January 2021, California America Water submitted to the commission a comprehensive settlement with the public advocates office and several interveners. If the global settlement is adopted by the commission without changes, revenues will increase by $33.5 million over 3 years, with agreed capital investments of $165 million in 2021 and 2022. And just yesterday, California American Water filed its cost of capital application with the commission. As part of the application, California American Water requested an authorized cost of equity of 10.75%, cost of debt of 4.35% and overall rate of return of 8%, which is sufficient to provide California American Water with the opportunity to earn a reasonable return on its investments. The case covers 2022 through 2024, with the revised cost of capital to be effective January 1, 2022. 
Regarding the Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project. As a reminder, California American Water refiled its application to the Coastal Commission on November 6, 2020. On December 3, 2020, the Coastal Commission sent a notice requesting additional information needed to consider the application complete. In March 2021, California American Water provided the requested responses and once staff deems the application complete, by statute, the Coastal Commission would have 180 days to process it. 
Moving to state legislation on Slide 10. We continue to see states take action to help address water and wastewater challenges. In Kentucky, the governor signed into law new acquisition adjustment legislation. This law allows systems to be acquired above net book value when certain criteria are met. The law also establishes a time line for a PSC decision on an acquisition, which is within 60 to 150 days of application approval. 
In Indiana, there are 2 pieces of legislation that have been signed into law that will benefit our current and future customers. Act 1287 creates a mechanism that reduces the required upfront cost to new customers for water and wastewater utility to extend service to underserved areas. And Act 349 establishes a tax writer for water and wastewater utilities based upon any change in state or federal income tax law. 
On the national level, we're pleased to see that water and wastewater infrastructure is included in both the administration's build back better plan as well as introduced in state -- or federal legislation. There continues to be a significant need to invest in water and wastewater infrastructure, not just within our system, but broadly across the United States. We think the proposed funding to state revolving funds for drinking water and the possible expansion of a water program would directly benefit to our customers. The administration's plan also includes a tax package, and Susan will talk about that in a moment. 
Moving to Slide 11. Customers remain at the center of every decision we make. This means smart investments balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. For the 12-month period ending March 31, 2021, our O&M efficiency ratio was 34.1%, a decrease from 34.5% for the 12-month period ended March 31, 2020. 
As we note each quarter, our adjusted O&M expenses are slightly higher today than they were in 2010. Since then, we've added approximately 327,000 customer connections while expenses only increased at a compound annual growth rate of 1.1%. 
Before I turn the call over to Susan, let me cover a few additional items. You may have seen in our 10-Q, a discussion around a matter related to HOS and likely, you saw a note from a rating agency commenting on that disclosure. As noted in the 10-Q, I want to remind you that this is a matter that relates to a subpoena received by AWR, an American Water subsidiary that operates a portion of HOS. The subpoena seeks information related only to HOS' metropolitan New York City operations. As we noted in the 10-Q, AWR is cooperating fully with the investigation. And while it's impossible to predict the outcome at this point, we do not believe it will result in any material impact to our overall operations or financial results. 
As a final note on the business, I'd like to congratulate Mark McDonough, who was recently named President of New Jersey American Water. And Steve Curtis, who will replace Mark as President of our Military Services Group. These are great examples of how we build and leverage the deep bench strength of American Water. Both Mark and Steve have had increasing roles of responsibility throughout their careers in American Water and are models of our values. 
And I'll end with a thank you to our employees for their continued response to COVID-19. We continue to execute our preparedness plans as we look to reintegrate those employees who have been working remotely. As always, safety is our top priority. This past March, we were very pleased that it was our first month in our history, where no OSHA recordable incidents occur throughout our entire company. Our commitment to 0 injuries and incidents will continue because no injury is ever acceptable to us. 
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Susan now."

And let's start on Slide 13 with a bit more detail on results. As Walter highlighted, first quarter 2021 earnings were $0.73 per share compared to $0.68 per share in the first quarter of 2020. Results for the regulated business segment wer",807,"Thanks, Walter. And let's start on Slide 13 with a bit more detail on results. As Walter highlighted, first quarter 2021 earnings were $0.73 per share compared to $0.68 per share in the first quarter of 2020. Results for the regulated business segment were $0.74 per share, an increase of $0.06 per share, primarily driven by continued growth from infrastructure investment, acquisitions and organic growth. Results for the market-based business were $0.09 per share, a decrease of $0.03 per share as we saw an increase in claims in the homeowner services group due largely to weather-related events. Current company results improved $0.02 per share in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020. 
Moving on to Slide 14. Regulated results increased $0.06 per share, as I said. We saw a $0.19 per share increase in revenues from new rates in effect as well as earnings from acquisitions. O&M expense increased by $0.08 per share and somewhat offsetting with an increase in depreciation of $0.05 per share in support of growth in the business. 
As previously mentioned, the market-based business results increased -- decreased $0.03 per share in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the first quarter of '20. The lower results were due to increased claims expense, which was driven by extreme cold weather, primarily in Texas and Illinois and the continuation of stay-at-home activities, as we saw throughout most of 2020 due to the pandemic. 
The parent results improved $0.02 per share in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of last year. The improved results were largely driven by a number of small items that increased expenses in the first quarter of 2020, offset by higher interest expense to support growth in the regulated business. 
While I'm on the subject of results, I'd also like to discuss the company's lower effective income tax rate in the quarter. This was primarily due to an increase in the amortization of excess accumulated deferred income taxes from the settlement of general rate cases in New Jersey and Pennsylvania that approve the timing and method by which the excess deferred taxes are returned to customers. The increased amortization of excess deferred taxes lowers tax expense and is largely offset dollar-for-dollar with lower revenue, resulting in no impact to earnings. 
We will continue to see this impact and the resulting lower effective tax rate as the amortization continues in these states and others as similar provisions are put in place. And as a reminder, the excess accumulated deferred income taxes resulted from the federal rate being lowered from 35% to 21% as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as Walter mentioned. 
Moving on to Slide 15. The continued successful execution of our regulatory strategy is a key element of our ability to consistently deliver financial results. To date, the regulated businesses have received $123 million in annualized new revenues in 2021. This includes $92 million from the Pennsylvania and Missouri rate case as discussed earlier, excluding the agreed reduction in revenues for tax savings passed back to customers and $31 million from infrastructure surcharges. In addition, the Pennsylvania rate case includes a second step increase of $20 million effective January 2022. 
We have also filed requests and are awaiting final orders on 3 rate cases, totaling an annualized revenue request of $61 million. And as Walter mentioned, we are also closely following President Biden's tax proposal and evaluating the impact that the current proposal would have on our long-term growth strategy. While there are many proposed provisions that need further analysis, our early indications are that there will be minimal impact to our plan. 
And finally, moving on to Slide 16. On April 28, 2021, our Board of Directors increased the company's quarterly cash dividend payment from $0.55 to $0.6025 per share. We continue to be a top leader in dividend growth. We have grown our dividend at a compound annual growth rate of about 10% over the last 5 years, significantly outpacing our peers in the Dow Jones utility average and the Philadelphia Utility Index. We expect to continue our dividend growth at the high end of the 7% to 10% range, as we know that, that is very important to many of our shareholders. 
Also, we continue to target a dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60% of earnings. As this quarter's results demonstrate we continue to consistently deliver on our earnings commitment, regulatory execution, along with the results from our market-based businesses allows us to continue that performance. We believe that delivering on results, combined with our strong earnings growth and superior dividend growth expectation provides excellent value for our shareholders as we continue to outperform our peers. 
And with that, let me turn the call back over to Walter for a few closing remarks."

In the first WIPA, that's really important, the first WIPA acquisition. And we're hopeful many other communities are going to see the benefits of that and continue to sell their systems to New Jersey American Water and Pennsylvania American Water, but it's really about providing meaningful solutions. And again, as we've talked about having consolidated tariffs and the ability to spread those costs across a big customer base, over 700,000 customer connections, really helps those communities to mitigate and minimize customer bill impacts. So that's a competitive advantage of ours. It's part of our strategy to make sure these communities understand the value that we can bring to them through investment.

Before we move to quarter results, let me speak for a moment about our recent growth news. As you know, a key part of our strategy is to operate in states where we can best serve customers, drive efficiencies and continue to grow our regulated business.  
Recall that earlier in the year, we announced the sale of our Michigan operation. And as you know, in late 2019, we announced the sale of our New York operation. This slide shows what our new regulated service territory will look like after the announced transactions are completed.  
Moving to Slide 6. We recently announced what will be the largest municipal acquisition in Pennsylvania American Water's history. On April 6, we signed an agreement to acquire the wastewater treatment and collection system for the City of York, Pennsylvania. This agreement will add an equivalent customer connection total of more than 45,000. As part of the agreement, Pennsylvania American Water will also continue to provide contracted wholesale wastewater treatment and disposal for 7 surrounding communities of York. We look forward to developing strong relationships that meet the needs of all customers, including those outside the city.  
This is yet another example of our strategy to grow where we can add value. It was also executed under Act 12 of 2016, which allows municipalities to sell their water and wastewater systems for a price-based on the fair market value of the facilities. York Mayor, Michael Helfrich said, ""This is a new day for York, one filled with an unwavering optimism as our residents and businesses can finally breathe the sign of relief for the first time in decades."" 
Turning to Slide 7. New Jersey American Water announced an agreement during the first quarter to acquire the water and wastewater assets of Egg Harbor City, New Jersey. This municipally owned water and wastewater system serves approximately 3,000 customer connections. The agreement is notable and is the first sale being executed through New Jersey's Water Infrastructure Protection Act, or WIPA. That law facilitates the sale or lease of municipally owned water or wastewater systems that meet certain criteria, such as significant noncompliance. Egg Harbor City Major Lisa Jiampetti said, ""This sale will mean better infrastructure, stable water rates and millions in funds for the city."" 
Additionally, Virginia American Water signed an agreement to acquire the drinking water assets at the town of Waverly. This municipally owned water system serves approximately 900 customer connections and is our first agreement signed under the new fair market value legislation in the Virginia commonwealth.  
To date this year, we've added approximately 4,500 customer connections through closed acquisitions and organic growth. We have under agreement more than 86,000 customer connections, including the City of York. In total, the acquisitions closed so far this year, and all those under agreement represent approximately $440 million in additional rate base and an estimated $115 million of follow-on additional capital expenditures over the next 5 years. And our growth pipeline remains strong with more than 1.2 million customer connection opportunities.  
Lastly, I'd like to provide an update on the sale of New York American water. In late March 2021, the New York State Department of Public Service Special Council released the findings of their municipalization study. As expected, the study focused primarily on the need for tax relief for customers, including recommendations to eliminate the special franchise tax. The study also focused on the feasibility of municipalization. These findings were not addressed in the governor's recently released budget.  
Our New York subsidiary continues to work constructively with the New York State Department of Public Service, including through ongoing settlement discussions with all parties. And we remain confident that the sale will be completed. We're working diligently to close the transaction.  
Assuming progress continues as expected, we believe that the net impact from New York results on 2021 results won't impact our 2021 guidance range. Further, we don't anticipate any impact on the expected timing of our previously discussed future equity needs.  
Let's move to Slide 8 and cover our first quarter results. Our first quarter 2021 earnings per share of $0.73 were up 7.4% compared to the first quarter of 2020. We invested capital of $342 million in the first quarter as we continue to balance that investment by focusing on operating and capital efficiencies, constructive regulatory outcomes and by leveraging the size and scale of our business. As a reminder, we've challenged ourselves with a new O&M efficiency target of 30.4% by 2025.  
With this strong start to 2021 and continued execution of our strategies, we're affirming today our 2021 earnings guidance range of $4.18 to $4.28 per share. We are also affirming our long-term EPS compound annual growth rate in the 7% to 10% range.  
Turning to Slide 9. Let's go through some of the regulatory and legislative highlights in the first quarter of 2021. In February, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission unanimously approved a previously filed settlement agreement between Pennsylvania American Water and the PUC Bureau of Investigation and Enforcement. The request was driven by $1.64 billion of investment from 2019 through 2022. Pennsylvania American Water was authorized additional annualized revenues of $90 million over a 2-year period, excluding an agreed to reduction in revenues for tax savings passed back to customers as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.  
On April 7, the Missouri Public Service Commission approved an agreement reached by the parties in Missouri American Water request for a rate adjustment. The rate order includes approximately $620 million in water and wastewater system improvements made since the end of 2017. Rates will be effective on May 28, 2021, and will result in additional annualized water and wastewater revenue of $22 million, excluding the reduction in revenue for tax savings passed back to customers, also a result of TCJA.  
We also have a pending rate case in Iowa, which is moving on schedule. And we filed a rate case in West Virginia on April 30.  
Additionally, as we've reported previously, California American Water filed for new rates in July 2019. The case covers 2021 through 2023. In January 2021, California America Water submitted to the commission a comprehensive settlement with the public advocates office and several interveners. If the global settlement is adopted by the commission without changes, revenues will increase by $33.5 million over 3 years, with agreed capital investments of $165 million in 2021 and 2022. And just yesterday, California American Water filed its cost of capital application with the commission. As part of the application, California American Water requested an authorized cost of equity of 10.75%, cost of debt of 4.35% and overall rate of return of 8%, which is sufficient to provide California American Water with the opportunity to earn a reasonable return on its investments. The case covers 2022 through 2024, with the revised cost of capital to be effective January 1, 2022.  
Regarding the Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project. As a reminder, California American Water refiled its application to the Coastal Commission on November 6, 2020. On December 3, 2020, the Coastal Commission sent a notice requesting additional information needed to consider the application complete. In March 2021, California American Water provided the requested responses. And once staff deemed the application complete, by statute, the Coastal Commission would have 180 days to process it.  
Moving to state legislation on Slide 10. We continue to see states take action to help address water and wastewater challenges. In Kentucky, the governor signed into law new acquisition adjustment legislation. This law allows systems to be acquired above net book value when certain criteria are met. The law also establishes a time line for a PSC decision on an acquisition, which is within 60 to 150 days of application approval.  
In Indiana, there are 2 pieces of legislation that have been signed into law that will benefit our current and future customers. Act 1287 creates a mechanism that reduces the required upfront cost to new customers for water and wastewater utility to extend service to underserved areas. And Act 349 establishes a tax writer for water and wastewater utilities based upon any change in state or federal income tax law.  
On the national level, we're pleased to see that water and wastewater infrastructure is included in both the administration's build back better plan as well as introduced in state -- or federal legislation. There continues to be a significant need to invest in water and wastewater infrastructure, not just within our system, but broadly across the United States. We think the proposed funding to state revolving funds for drinking water and the possible expansion of a water light-heat program would directly benefit our customers. The administration's plan also includes a tax package, and Susan will talk about that in a moment.  
Moving to Slide 11. Customers remain at the center of every decision we make. This means smart investments balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. For the 12-month period ending March 31, 2021, our O&M efficiency ratio was 34.1%, a decrease from 34.5% for the 12-month period ended March 31, 2020.  
As we note each quarter, our adjusted O&M expenses are slightly higher today than they were in 2010. Since then, we've added approximately 327,000 customer connections, while expenses only increased at a compound annual growth rate of 1.1%.  
Before I turn the call over to Susan, let me cover a few additional items. You may have seen in our 10-Q, a discussion around a matter related to HOS. And likely, you saw a note from a rating agency commenting on that disclosure. As noted in the 10-Q, I want to remind you that this is a matter that relates to a subpoena received by AWR, an American Water subsidiary that operates a portion of HOS. The subpoena seeks information related only to HOS' metropolitan New York City operations. As we noted in the 10-Q, AWR is cooperating fully with the investigation. And while it's impossible to predict the outcome at this point, we do not believe it will result in any material impact to our overall operations or financial results.  
As a final note on the business, I'd like to congratulate Mark McDonough, who was recently named President of New Jersey American Water; and Steve Curtis, who will replace Mark as President of our Military Services Group. These are great examples of how we build and leverage the deep bench strength of American Water. Both Mark and Steve have had increasing roles of responsibility throughout their careers in American Water and are models of our values.  
And I'll end with a thank you to our employees for their continued response to COVID-19. We continue to execute our preparedness plans as we look to reintegrate those employees who have been working remotely. As always, safety is our top priority. This past March, we were very pleased that it was our first month in our history where no OSHA recordable incidents occur throughout our entire company. Our commitment to 0 injuries and incidents will continue because no injury is ever acceptable to us.  
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Susan now."

And let's start on Slide 13 with a bit more detail on results. As Walter highlighted, first quarter 2021 earnings were $0.73 per share compared to $0.68 per share in the first quarter of 2020. Results for the regulated business segment wer",808,"Thanks, Walter. And let's start on Slide 13 with a bit more detail on results. As Walter highlighted, first quarter 2021 earnings were $0.73 per share compared to $0.68 per share in the first quarter of 2020. Results for the regulated business segment were $0.74 per share, an increase of $0.06 per share, primarily driven by continued growth from infrastructure investment, acquisitions and organic growth. Results for the market-based business were $0.09 per share, a decrease of $0.03 per share as we saw an increase in claims in the homeowner services group due largely to weather-related events. Current company results improved $0.02 per share in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020. 
Moving on to Slide 14. Regulated results increased $0.06 per share, as I said. We saw a $0.19 per share increase in revenues from new rates in effect as well as earnings from acquisitions. O&M expense increased by $0.08 per share and somewhat offsetting with an increase in depreciation of $0.05 per share in support of growth in the business. 
As previously mentioned, the market-based business results increased -- or decreased $0.03 per share in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the first quarter of '20. The lower results were due to increased claims expense, which was driven by extreme cold weather, primarily in Texas and Illinois and the continuation of stay-at-home activities, as we saw throughout most of 2020 due to the pandemic. 
The parent results improved $0.02 per share in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of last year. The improved results were largely driven by a number of small items that increased expenses in the first quarter of 2020, offset by higher interest expense to support growth in the regulated business. 
While I'm on the subject of results, I'd also like to discuss the company's lower effective income tax rate in the quarter. This was primarily due to an increase in the amortization of excess accumulated deferred income taxes from the settlement of general rate cases in New Jersey and Pennsylvania that approved the timing and method by which the excess deferred taxes are returned to customers. The increased amortization of excess deferred taxes lowers tax expense and is largely offset dollar-for-dollar with lower revenue, resulting in no impact to earnings. 
We will continue to see this impact and the resulting lower effective tax rate as the amortization continues in these states and others as similar provisions are put in place. And as a reminder, the excess accumulated deferred income taxes resulted from the federal rate being lowered from 35% to 21% as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as Walter mentioned. 
Moving on to Slide 15. The continued successful execution of our regulatory strategy is a key element of our ability to consistently deliver financial results. To date, the regulated businesses have received $123 million in annualized new revenues in 2021. This includes $92 million from the Pennsylvania and the Missouri rate cases discussed earlier, excluding the agreed reduction in revenues for tax savings passed back to customers and $31 million from infrastructure surcharges. In addition, the Pennsylvania rate case includes a second step increase of $20 million effective January 2022. 
We have also filed requests and are awaiting final orders on 3 rate cases, totaling an annualized revenue request of $61 million. And as Walter mentioned, we are also closely following President Biden's tax proposal and evaluating the impact that the current proposal would have on our long-term growth strategy. While there are many proposed provisions that need further analysis, our early indications are that there will be minimal impact to our plan. 
And finally, moving on to Slide 16. On April 28, 2021, our Board of Directors increased the company's quarterly cash dividend payment from $0.55 to $0.6025 per share. We continue to be a top leader in dividend growth. We have grown our dividend at a compound annual growth rate of about 10% over the last 5 years, significantly outpacing our peers in the Dow Jones utility average and the Philadelphia Utility Index. We expect to continue our dividend growth at the high end of the 7% to 10% range, as we know that, that is very important to many of our shareholders. 
Also, we continue to target a dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60% of earnings. As this quarter's results demonstrate we continue to consistently deliver on our earnings commitment, regulatory execution, along with the results from our market-based businesses allows us to continue that performance. We believe that delivering on results, combined with our strong earnings growth and superior dividend growth expectation provides excellent value for our shareholders as we continue to outperform our peers. 
And with that, let me turn the call back over to Walter for a few closing remarks."

It's all part of what we're doing and providing solutions for communities with the City of York on the wastewater side and then Egg Harbor City. In the first WIPA, that's really important, is the first WIPA acquisition. And we're hopeful many other communities are going to see the benefits of that and continue to sell their systems to New Jersey American Water and Pennsylvania American Water. But it's really about providing meaningful solutions. 
And again, as we've talked about having consolidated tariffs and the ability to spread those costs across a big customer base, over 700,000 customer connections, really helps those communities to mitigate and minimize customer bill impacts. So that's a competitive advantage of ours. It's part of our strategy to make sure these communities understand the value that we can bring to them through investment.

250885,1674648594,2360425,"American Water Works Company, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2021",2021-08-03,"Earnings Calls","American Water Works Company, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Once again, the employees of American Water delivered solid results as we continue to execute on our low-risk profile and predictable growth story. Let's move to Slide 5 to cover the highlight",1475,"Thanks, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Once again, the employees of American Water delivered solid results as we continue to execute on our low-risk profile and predictable growth story. Let's move to Slide 5 to cover the highlights of our second quarter and 6-month results. Our second quarter 2021 earnings per share increased 17.5% compared to the second quarter of 2020. Included in the results is a $0.03 per share benefit from weather primarily in the Northeast, where we saw a moderate impact from warmer and drier-than-normal conditions. 
In the first 6 months of, we invested $782 million with the majority dedicated to needed infrastructure improvements to better serve our customers. We continue to work hard to minimize the bill impacts of these investments by focusing on capital and operating efficiencies, constructive regulatory outcomes and by leveraging the size and scale of our business. As a reminder, we previously announced an O&M efficiency target of [ 30.4% ] by 2025.  We also continue our disciplined approach to regulated acquisitions. 
We've added approximately 11,200 customer connections to date through closed acquisitions and organic growth and look forward to welcoming an additional 86,900 customer connections through pending acquisitions. I'll provide more detail on growth in a moment. 
Moving to Slide 6. The foundation of our earnings growth continues to be the capital investment we make in our regulated operations. We plan to spend $1.9 billion in 2021 and about $10.4 billion over the next 5 years. The continued investment is critical to improving and maintaining distribution and treatment infrastructure, including improving water quality, fixing leaks and providing water for fire hydrants. 
These efforts help our communities remain strong and attractive to residents and businesses. With a strong first half of 2021 and continued execution of our strategies, we're affirming today our 2021 earnings guidance range of $4.18 to $4.28 per share. We're also affirming our long-term EPS compound annual growth rate range of 7% to 10%. 
Turning to Slide 7. Let's go through some of the regulatory and legislative highlights of the second quarter 2021. On June 28, the Iowa Utilities Board issued an order approving an increase in annual base revenue of $1 million for Iowa American Water. The company's investment of almost $87 million in water system improvements was the primary driver behind the rate adjustment request. We also have pending cases in West Virginia and California. We covered California American Water's general rate case as well as the cost of capital application on the last call, in both cases are progressing as expected. Let me spend a few minutes on California's drought emergency. As you've likely heard, Governor Newsom expanded the state's drought emergency declaration in 50 out of 58 counties. Currently, our water supplies in California are in good shape, but we're activating mandatory conservation measures for our customers in Sonoma County. 
We're also conducting extensive outreach to our highest water users and encouraging our customers to voluntarily reduce their water use across our entire service area. The drought once again highlights the need for the Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project. As we previously discussed, California American Water refiled its application to the Coastal Commission on November 6, 2020. On December 3, 2020, the Coastal Commission sent a notice requesting additional information. California American Water provided the requested responses in March 2021. The Coastal Commission then requested additional information on June 18. 
Our California team is working on this additional request. Once we provide that information and [indiscernible] the application complete, by statute, the Coastal Commission would have 180 days to process it. Additionally, on July 29, The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities issued a final order denying approval of acquisition adjustments and rates associated with the purchase of Shorelands and Haddonfield in 2017 and 2015, respectively. The order is not the outcome we've been working towards, and we continue to evaluate next steps. 
However, we had a counter for this possibility and the decision will not have an impact on our financial results. Moving to state legislation. We continue to engage with states as they take action to help address water and wastewater challenges. In New Jersey, legislation that strengthens the state's Water Quality Accountability Act has passed both houses unanimously and is awaiting the governor signature. The enhancements include additional enforcement requirements for reporting data, stronger cybersecurity requirements and asset management plans and requirements for the sale of systems with prolonged violations. 
New Jersey was the first state to pass a Water Quality Accountability Act, and we're pleased to see the act strengthen on behalf of all water customers in New Jersey. Also in New Jersey, the Governor signed a lead service line replacement bill that includes O&M expenses and interest accrued on customer-owned lines as recoverable items. As you know, American Water is long advocated for full service line replacement versus a partial replacement to address lead issues. In Missouri, the governor signed the Water and Sewer Infrastructure Act, which will become effective on August 28, 2021. 
This act establishes a new statewide infrastructure system replacement surcharge program that broadens the list of eligible projects. It also increases the cap from 10% to 15% of Missouri American Water's revenue requirement for these eligible projects. Additionally, customer-owned lead service line replacements are excluded from the cap. Finally, as we mentioned last call, at a national level, we remain supportive of investments in water and wastewater infrastructure. The proposed bipartisan package supported by the administration includes $55 billion for water infrastructure. We believe the proposed additions to state revolving funds for drinking water and the possible expansion of a water [indiscernible] type program for all water customers would help improve our nation's water infrastructure. 
Moving to Slide 8. Customers remain at the center of every decision we make. This means smart investments balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. For the 12-month period ending June 30, 2021, our O&M efficiency ratio was 33.9% compared to 34.3% for the 12-month period ended June 30, 2020. As we note each quarter, our adjusted O&M expenses are just slightly higher today than they were in 2010. 
During that period, we've added approximately 333,000 customer connections while expenses only increased at a compound annual growth rate of just over 1%. On the subject of cost, inflationary pressures and scarcities of some supplies in certain sectors of the U.S. economy, let me remind you that our company does have the advantage of volumetric purchases and economies of scale. 
By leveraging our national size and scale and working closely with our suppliers in the water sector, we've been able to shield ourselves for the most part from these effects. At this time, we've not experienced and do not anticipate any material negative impacts on our supply chain. 
Before we move to growth, let me provide a quick update on the sale of New York American Water. Both American Water and Liberty remain committed to closing the sale and continue to work through the regulatory process. As noted by 8-K filing on June 29, both parties agreed to extend the closing end date in accordance with the terms of the stock purchase agreement. We remain confident that the sale will be completed. Assuming progress continues as expected, we believe that the net impact from New York in 2021 results won't materially impact our 2021 guidance range. 
Further, we don't anticipate any impact on the expected timing of our previously discussed future equity needs. Moving to Slide 9. We've announced multiple acquisitions in the first half of 2021, including our largest acquisition in York, Pennsylvania, which will add an equivalent customer connection total of more than 45,000. 
We continue to make progress on that acquisition, most recently filing an application with the Public Utility Commission on July 1. As I mentioned earlier, so far in 2021, we've closed on 8 acquisitions in 4 different states, adding approximately 3,000 new customer connections. We've also added approximately 8,200 customer connections to organic growth in the first 6 months. We look forward to adding another 86,900 customer connections through 37 currently signed agreements in 8 states. These new agreements reflect our commitment to provide water and wastewater solutions in communities where we can leverage our scale and expertise. We know that many communities are facing unprecedented challenges, and we're well positioned to provide them solutions. Our growth is also a direct result of our commitment to customer service. 
I want to congratulate both our New Jersey and Illinois subsidiaries for earning J.D. Power awards for ranking highest in customer satisfaction among large utilities, large water utilities in the Northeast and Midwest. This is the second year in a row that our Illinois subsidiary, ranked highest. We're proud of our teams and the way they put our customers first every day. With that, I'll turn it over to Susan."

Second quarter 2021 earnings were $1.14 per share compared to $0.97 per share in the second quarter of 2020. As Walter mentioned, included in earnings is an estimated $0.03 per share favorable impact from weather, primarily in the Northeast, where we saw conditions warmer and drier than normal through the quarter. Results for the Regulated Business segment were $1.18 per share, an increase of $0.21 per share compared to 2020 earnings. Results for the market-based business were $0.11 per share, a decrease of $0.02 per share. 
And finally, parent company results decreased $0.02 per share in the second quarter of 2021 as compared to the same period last year. Our 2021 earnings through June 30 were $1.87 per share, an increase of $0.22 per share compared to the same period last year. Results for the 6-month period include the estimated $0.03 per share favorable impact from weather in the second quarter of '21. 
Regulated business results increased $0.27 per share compared to 2020 earnings, and our market-based business results decreased $0.05 per share and parent company results were unchanged year-over-year. Moving on to Slide 12. Let me provide just a few more details by business. As I noted earlier, regulated results increased $0.21 per share. And we saw a $0.30 per share increase in revenues from new rates in effect from acquisitions and from the lower demand in the second quarter of 2020 from the COVID-19 pandemic. As a reminder, we saw the 2020 full year impact on demand due to the pandemic to be nearly 0, and we see no real lingering impact on demand in 2021. Also, as I mentioned previously, results reflect an estimated $0.03 per share increase from warmer and drier-than-normal weather, primarily in the Northeast. 
Partially offsetting these results, O&M expense increased by $0.09 per share and depreciation expense increased $0.03 per share in support of growth in the regulated business. The Market-Based Business results decreased $0.02 per share in the second quarter of '21 as compared to the second quarter of 2020. The lower results reflect increased claims in 2021 in the Homeowner Services Group. The parent results decreased $0.02 per share in the second quarter of '21 compared to the second quarter of 2020, largely driven by higher interest expense to support regulated growth. 
While on the topic of results, I'd like to also reiterate what we told you last quarter with regard to the company's lower effective income tax rate. This results from an increase in the amortization of excess, accumulated deferred income taxes as agreed to through the regulatory process and is largely offset with lower revenue, resulting in no material impact to earnings and we will continue to see this impact as that amortization continues. Moving on to Slide 13. Consolidated results increased $0.22 per share for the year-to-date period compared to the same period last year. Results for the regulated operations increased $0.27 per share for the year-to-date period. 
We saw a $0.50 per share increase from additional revenue -- additional authorized revenue from acquisitions and from the lower demand in the second quarter of '20 attributable to the pandemic. Year-to-date results also reflect the estimated $0.03 per share favorable weather benefit. Offsetting these increases were increases in O&M expense of $0.18 per share and depreciation of $0.08 per share, all as a result of growth in the business. The Market-Based Businesses results decreased $0.05 per share due to higher claims in 2021 in Homeowner Services Group, including the extreme cold weather across the country during the first quarter of '21, primarily in Texas and Illinois. 
And parent results were flat compared to the same period in '20 as higher interest expense to support regulated growth was offset by a number of small items that increased expenses in 2020. Moving on to Slide 14. The continued successful execution of our regulatory strategy is a key element of our ability to consistently deliver financial results. And to date, the regulated business has received $146 million in annualized new revenues in 2021. This includes $100 million from general rate cases and step increases, excluding the agreed reduction in revenue from the amortization of excess accumulated deferred income taxes and $46 million from infrastructure surcharges. We have also filed requests and are awaiting final orders on the 2 rate cases previously mentioned by Walter and 2 infrastructure surcharge proceedings for a total annualized revenue request of $71 million. I'd also like to add that generally, we have received favorable regulatory decisions addressing our incremental financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have received favorable deferral orders in most jurisdictions, including cost recovery orders approved by our regulators in Illinois, Missouri and Iowa. 
In Pennsylvania, the administrative law judge issued a recommendation that would allow us to defer our incremental, uncollectible expense resulting from the pandemic, but would exclude other financial impacts, such as waive delayed fees and additional interest costs. Our Pennsylvania subsidiary has filed exceptions to the ALG recommendation -- recommended decision, highlighting among other things, the favorable decisions we have received in other jurisdictions. We expect a final Pennsylvania deferral order addressing these matters later in the third quarter. 
Moving on to Slide 15. I want to provide a few details of the very favorable debt offering we executed in May. The company successfully completed a $1.1 billion debt offering in support of our $10.4 billion 5-year capital plan and to refinance approximately $327 million of high coupon debt. We issued $550 million each of 10- and 30-year debt with coupon rates of 2.3% and 3.25%, respectively. These are the lowest rates American Water has ever achieved on a public debt offering and is representative of the company's healthy balance sheet and strong credit profile, and we're pleased to have achieved such favorable rates to the benefit of our customers. 
Moving on to Slide 16. I'd like to reiterate Walter's comments earlier, because of our strong performance and continued focus on execution, we are affirming our 2021 earnings guidance range of $4.18 to $4.28 per share. We are also affirming our long-term earnings per share, compound annual growth rate of 7% to 10%. As shown on Slide 17, and as our results demonstrate, we continue to deliver on our earnings commitment. We believe that delivering on results, combined with our strong earnings growth and superior dividend growth expectations provides excellent value for our shareholders. 
We continue to outperform our peers. And as you can see on this slide, measured currently, we have delivered a total shareholder return of 126% over the last 5 years, outpacing our peers in the Philadelphia Utility Index as well as the S&P 500 Index. 
And with that, let me turn the call back over to Walter for some closing remarks."

And before we move on to your questions, I want to take a few minutes to talk about our ESG highlights over the last 6 months. We've been hearing from stakeholders that they'd like to receive more ESG data on an annual basis. We've published 2 new documents on our website. First, we made our environmental policy more visible by posting it on our ESG page. We also posted an ESG data summary, which we'll update annually. We also continue to implement best practices and respond to surveys and reports. For example, just last week, we submitted our annual CDP climate change response which highlights American Water's efforts to address greenhouse gas emissions and risks associated with climate variability. 
As we've discussed previously, since 2007 through year-end 2020, we've reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 36%. This means we're close to our goal of a 40% reduction by 2025. I also want to mention our recent recognition as a top score in the Disability Equality Index for a third year in a row. We firmly believe we're more successful when our workforce reflects the communities that we serve. We're proud to be recognized by DEI to be an ally to those with different abilities. Finally, as a reminder, we'll be publishing and posting our 2019 to 2020 sustainability report this fall. With that, we're happy to take your questions."

Let me make just a couple of comments, and Walter can certainly weigh in. I think the weather event that we saw in the first quarter in Texas and Illinois, that was really isolated to the first quarter. But we have seen a continuation of sort of higher claims experience I think, really largely driven by more at-home activities. 
We've got more folks at home and there's more pressure on systems. And so we're seeing more failures and more work being done by the HOS team. And so that claims experience has been a bit higher than we would have expected. And I think you can also expect higher claims just simply from growth in the business. We've seen more of that occur. And there's also a little bit of higher marketing expense. We didn't call that out specifically, but a bit more marketing expenses. We continue to introduce new products throughout the HOS territory. So it really is a factor, I think, of sort of the pandemic itself and just a bit higher experience than we would have anticipated."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Once again, the employees of American Water delivered solid results as we continue to execute on our low-risk profile and predictable growth story. Let's move to Slide 5 to cover the highlight",1475,"Thanks, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Once again, the employees of American Water delivered solid results as we continue to execute on our low-risk profile and predictable growth story. Let's move to Slide 5 to cover the highlights of our second quarter and 6-month results. Our second quarter 2021 earnings per share increased 17.5% compared to the second quarter of 2020. Included in the results is a $0.03 per share benefit from weather primarily in the Northeast, where we saw a moderate impact from warmer and drier-than-normal conditions. 
In the first 6 months of 2021, we invested $782 million with the majority dedicated to needed infrastructure improvements to better serve our customers. We continue to work hard to minimize the bill impacts of these investments by focusing on capital and operating efficiencies, constructive regulatory outcomes and by leveraging the size and scale of our business. As a reminder, we previously announced an O&M efficiency target of 30.4% by 2025.  We also continue our disciplined approach to regulated acquisitions.
We've added approximately 11,200 customer connections to date through closed acquisitions and organic growth and look forward to welcoming an additional 86,900 customer connections through pending acquisitions. I'll provide more detail on growth in a moment. 
Moving to Slide 6. The foundation of our earnings growth continues to be the capital investment we make in our regulated operations. We plan to spend $1.9 billion in 2021 and about $10.4 billion over the next 5 years. The continued investment is critical to improving and maintaining distribution and treatment infrastructure, including improving water quality, fixing leaks and providing water for fire hydrants.
These efforts help our communities remain strong and attractive to residents and businesses. With a strong first half of 2021 and continued execution of our strategies, we're affirming today our 2021 earnings guidance range of $4.18 to $4.28 per share. We're also affirming our long-term EPS compound annual growth rate range of 7% to 10%.  
Turning to Slide 7. Let's go through some of the regulatory and legislative highlights of the second quarter 2021. On June 28, the Iowa Utilities Board issued an order approving an increase in annual base revenue of $1 million for Iowa American Water. The company's investment of almost $87 million in water system improvements was the primary driver behind the rate adjustment request. We also have pending cases in West Virginia and California. We cover California American Water's general rate case as well as the cost of capital application on the last call and both cases are progressing as expected. Let me spend a few minutes on California's drought emergency. As you've likely heard, Governor Newsom expanded the state's drought emergency declaration in 50 out of 58 counties. Currently, our water supplies in California are in good shape, but we're activating mandatory conservation measures for our customers in Sonoma County.
We're also conducting extensive outreach to our highest water users and encouraging our customers to voluntarily reduce their water use across our entire service area. The drought once again highlights the need for the Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project. As we previously discussed, California American Water refiled its application to the Coastal Commission on November 6, 2020. On December 3, 2020, the Coastal Commission sent a notice requesting additional information. California American Water provided the requested responses in March 2021. The Coastal Commission then requested additional information on June 18.
Our California team is working on this additional request. Once we provide that information and staff deems the application complete, by statute, the Coastal Commission would have 180 days to process it. Additionally, on July 29, The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities issued a final order denying approval of acquisition adjustments and rates associated with the purchase of Shorelands and Haddonfield in 2017 and 2015, respectively. The order is not the outcome we've been working towards, and we continue to evaluate next steps.
However, we had a counter for this possibility and the decision will not have an impact on our financial results. Moving to state legislation. We continue to engage with states as they take action to help address water and wastewater challenges. In New Jersey, legislation that strengthens the state's Water Quality Accountability Act has passed both houses unanimously and is awaiting the governor signature. The enhancements include additional enforcement requirements for reporting data, stronger cybersecurity requirements and asset management plans and requirements for the sale of systems with prolonged violations.  
New Jersey was the first state to pass the Water Quality Accountability Act, and we're pleased to see the act strengthen on behalf of all water customers in New Jersey. Also in New Jersey, the Governor signed a lead service line replacement bill that includes O&M expenses and interest accrued on customer-owned lines as recoverable items. As you know, American Water is long advocated for full service line replacement versus a partial replacement to address lead issues. In Missouri, the governor signed the Water and Sewer Infrastructure Act, which will become effective on August 28, 2021.  
This act establishes a new statewide infrastructure system replacement surcharge program that broadens the list of eligible projects. It also increases the cap from 10% to 15% of Missouri American Water's revenue requirement for these eligible projects. Additionally, customer-owned lead service line replacements are excluded from the cap. Finally, as we mentioned last call, at a national level, we remain supportive of investments in water and wastewater infrastructure. The proposed bipartisan package supported by the administration includes $55 billion for water infrastructure. We believe the proposed additions to state revolving funds for drinking water and the possible expansion of a water LIHEAP type program for all water customers would help improve our nation's water infrastructure.  
Moving to Slide 8. Customers remain at the center of every decision we make. This means smart investments balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. For the 12-month period ending June 30, 2021, our O&M efficiency ratio was 33.9% compared to 34.3% for the 12-month period ended June 30, 2020. As we note each quarter, our adjusted O&M expenses are just slightly higher today than they were in 2010.
During that period, we've added approximately 333,000 customer connections while expenses only increased at a compound annual growth rate of just over 1%. On the subject of cost, inflationary pressures and scarcities of some supplies in certain sectors of the U.S. economy, let me remind you that our company does have the advantage of volumetric purchases and economies of scale.
By leveraging our national size and scale and working closely with our suppliers in the water sector, we've been able to shield ourselves for the most part from these effects. At this time, we've not experienced and do not anticipate any material negative impacts on our supply chain.
Before we move to growth, let me provide a quick update on the sale of New York American Water. Both American Water and Liberty remain committed to closing the sale and continue to work through the regulatory process. As noted by 8-K filing on June 29, both parties agreed to extend the closing end date in accordance with the terms of the stock purchase agreement. We remain confident that the sale will be completed. Assuming progress continues as expected, we believe that the net impact from New York in 2021 results won't materially impact our 2021 guidance range.
Further, we don't anticipate any impact on the expected timing of our previously discussed future equity needs. Moving to Slide 9. We've announced multiple acquisitions in the first half of 2021, including our largest acquisition in York, Pennsylvania, which will add an equivalent customer connection total of more than 45,000.
We continue to make progress on that acquisition, most recently filing an application with the Public Utility Commission on July 1. As I mentioned earlier, so far in 2021, we've closed on 8 acquisitions in 4 different states, adding approximately 3,000 new customer connections. We've also added approximately 8,200 customer connections to organic growth in the first 6 months. We look forward to adding another 86,900 customer connections through 37 currently signed agreements in 8 states. These new agreements reflect our commitment to provide water and wastewater solutions in communities where we can leverage our scale and expertise. We know that many communities are facing unprecedented challenges, and we're well positioned to provide them solutions. Our growth is also a direct result of our commitment to customer service.
I want to congratulate both our New Jersey and Illinois subsidiaries for earning J.D. Power awards for ranking highest in customer satisfaction among large utilities, large water utilities in the Northeast and Midwest. This is the second year in a row that our Illinois subsidiary, ranked highest. We're proud of our teams and the way they put our customers first every day. With that, I'll turn it over to Susan."

Let's start on Slide 11 with a review of results. Second quarter 2021 earnings were $1.14 per share compared to $0.97 per share in the second quarter of 2020.

Second quarter 2021 earnings were $1.14 per share compared to $0.97 per share in the second quarter of 2020. As Walter mentioned, included in earnings is an estimated $0.03 per share favorable impact from weather, primarily in the Northeast, where we saw conditions warmer and drier than normal through the quarter. Results for the Regulated Business segment were $1.18 per share, an increase of $0.21 per share compared to 2020 earnings. Results for the market-based business were $0.11 per share, a decrease of $0.02 per share.  
And finally, parent company results decreased $0.02 per share in the second quarter of 2021 as compared to the same period last year. Our 2021 earnings through June 30 were $1.87 per share, an increase of $0.22 per share compared to the same period last year. Results for the 6-month period include the estimated $0.03 per share favorable impact from weather in the second quarter of '21.
Regulated business results increased $0.27 per share compared to 2020 earnings, and our market-based business results decreased $0.05 per share and parent company results were unchanged year-over-year. Moving on to Slide 12. Let me provide just a few more details by business. As I noted earlier, regulated results increased $0.21 per share. And we saw a $0.30 per share increase in revenues from new rates in effect from acquisitions and from the lower demand in the second quarter of 2020 from the COVID-19 pandemic. As a reminder, we saw the 2020 full year impact on demand due to the pandemic to be nearly 0, and we see no real lingering impact on demand in 2021. Also, as I mentioned previously, results reflect an estimated $0.03 per share increase from warmer and drier-than-normal weather, primarily in the Northeast.
Partially offsetting these results, O&M expense increased by $0.09 per share and depreciation expense increased $0.03 per share in support of growth in the regulated business. The Market-Based Business results decreased $0.02 per share in the second quarter of '21 as compared to the second quarter of 2020. The lower results reflect increased claims in 2021 in the Homeowner Services Group. The parent results decreased $0.02 per share in the second quarter of '21 compared to the second quarter of 2020, largely driven by higher interest expense to support regulated growth.
While on the topic of results, I'd like to also reiterate what we told you last quarter with regard to the company's lower effective income tax rate. This results from an increase in the amortization of excess, accumulated deferred income taxes as agreed to through the regulatory process and is largely offset with lower revenue, resulting in no material impact to earnings, and we will continue to see this impact as that amortization continues. Moving on to Slide 13. Consolidated results increased $0.22 per share for the year-to-date period compared to the same period last year. Results for the regulated operations increased $0.27 per share for the year-to-date period.
We saw a $0.50 per share increase from additional revenue -- additional authorized revenue from acquisitions and from the lower demand in the second quarter of '20 attributable to the pandemic. Year-to-date results also reflect the estimated $0.03 per share favorable weather benefit. Offsetting these increases were increases in O&M expense of $0.18 per share and depreciation of $0.08 per share, all as a result of growth in the business. The Market-Based Businesses results decreased $0.05 per share due to higher claims in 2021 in Homeowner Services Group, including the extreme cold weather across the country during the first quarter of '21, primarily in Texas and Illinois.
And parent results were flat compared to the same period in '20 as higher interest expense to support regulated growth was offset by a number of small items that increased expenses in 2020. Moving on to Slide 14. The continued successful execution of our regulatory strategy is a key element of our ability to consistently deliver financial results. And to date, the regulated business has received $146 million in annualized new revenues in 2021. This includes $100 million from general rate cases and step increases, excluding the agreed reduction in revenue from the amortization of excess accumulated deferred income taxes and $46 million from infrastructure surcharges. We have also filed requests and are awaiting final orders on the 2 rate cases previously mentioned by Walter and 2 infrastructure surcharge proceedings for a total annualized revenue request of $71 million. 
I'd also like to add that generally, we have received favorable regulatory decisions addressing our incremental financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have received favorable deferral orders in most jurisdictions, including cost recovery orders approved by our regulators in Illinois, Missouri and Iowa.
In Pennsylvania, the administrative law judge issued a recommendation that would allow us to defer our incremental, uncollectible expense resulting from the pandemic, but would exclude other financial impacts, such as waive delayed fees and additional interest costs. Our Pennsylvania subsidiary has filed exceptions to the ALG recommendation -- recommended decision, highlighting among other things, the favorable decisions we have received in other jurisdictions. We expect a final Pennsylvania deferral order addressing these matters later in the third quarter.
Moving on to Slide 15. I want to provide a few details of the very favorable debt offering we executed in May. The company successfully completed a $1.1 billion debt offering in support of our $10.4 billion 5-year capital plan and to refinance approximately $327 million of high coupon debt. We issued $550 million each of 10- and 30-year debt with coupon rates of 2.3% and 3.25%, respectively. These are the lowest rates American Water has ever achieved on a public debt offering and is representative of the company's healthy balance sheet and strong credit profile, and we're pleased to have achieved such favorable rates to the benefit of our customers.
Moving on to Slide 16. I'd like to reiterate Walter's comments earlier because of our strong performance and continued focus on execution, we are affirming our 2021 earnings guidance range of $4.18 to $4.28 per share. We are also affirming our long-term earnings per share, compound annual growth rate of 7% to 10%. As shown on Slide 17, and as our results demonstrate, we continue to deliver on our earnings commitment. We believe that delivering on results, combined with our strong earnings growth and superior dividend growth expectations provides excellent value for our shareholders.
We continue to outperform our peers. And as you can see on this slide, measured currently, we have delivered a total shareholder return of 126% over the last 5 years, outpacing our peers in the Philadelphia Utility Index as well as the S&P 500 Index. 
And with that, let me turn the call back over to Walter for some closing remarks."

And before we move on to your questions, I want to take a few minutes to talk about our ESG highlights over the last 6 months. We've been hearing from stakeholders if they'd like to receive more ESG data on an annual basis. We've published 2 new documents on our website. First, we made our environmental policy more visible by posting it on our ESG page. We also posted an ESG data summary, which we'll update annually. We also continue to implement best practices and respond to surveys and reports. For example, just last week, we submitted our annual CDP climate change response which highlights American Water's efforts to address greenhouse gas emissions and risks associated with climate variability. 
As we've discussed previously, since 2007 through year-end 2020, we've reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 36%. This means we're close to our goal of a 40% reduction by 2025. I also want to mention our recent recognition as a top score in the Disability Equality Index for a third year in a row. We firmly believe we're more successful when our workforce reflects the communities that we serve. We're proud to be recognized by DEI and to be an ally to those with different abilities. Finally, as a reminder, we'll be publishing and posting our 2019 to 2020 sustainability report this fall. With that, we're happy to take your questions."

We've got more folks at home and there's more pressure on systems. And so we're seeing more failures and more work being done by the HOS team. And so that claims experience has been a bit higher than we would have expected. And I think you can also expect higher claims just simply from growth in the business. We've seen more of that occur.
