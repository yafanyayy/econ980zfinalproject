We certainly appreciate you all joining us today, and I hope everybody is staying well. I want to start with saying difficult. I want to start by extending my most heartfelt condolences to the Sørensen family",1371,"Thank you, Jill, and good morning, everyone. We certainly appreciate you all joining us today, and I hope everybody is staying well. I want to start with saying difficult. I want to start by extending my most heartfelt condolences to the Sørensen family and the thousands of Marriott associates around the world following the heartbreaking news of Arne's passing. To say I'm deeply saddened by that loss, it would be an understatement. 
As many of you know, had the opportunity to work with Arne in a number of capacities throughout my career, including earlier on at Host. I think it's very fair to say he was an exceptional leader, but also an incredible person and a great friend. Our industry is better because of him, and I am a better professional and a better person because of him. On behalf of everyone at Hilton Family, the entire Marriott family are in our thoughts. 
As we all know, this past year has presented unique challenges, including a pandemic that devastated lives, communities, and businesses across the world, widespread economic declines and acts of social and justice. Due to the extraordinary levels of disruption, our industry experienced demand declines we've never seen before in our 101-year history. Guided by our founding purpose to make the world a better place through the light and warmth of hospitality, we acted quickly to ensure the safety and well-being of our people. We also took steps to protect our business by rightsizing our cost structure and enhancing our liquidity position while continuing to drive net unit growth and increase our network effect. 
As a result of these moves, we expect to recover from the pandemic as a stronger, higher-margin business that is even better positioned to deliver performance for our owners and strong free cash flow for our shareholders. While it's certainly been a very difficult year, we're proud of everything we've accomplished, but we certainly could not have done it without the support of all of our stakeholders. For that, I'd like to extend a heartfelt thank you to all of our loyal customers, our important owner partners, our communities who supported us and enabled us to support them. Our team members who gave their hearts and souls to our business and our shareholders who stood by us. 
Because of our amazing people, we've been able to lean on our award-winning culture, which earned the #1 Best Place to Work in the United States for the second consecutive year and the #3 World's Best Workplace to help get us through these trying times. 
Turning to results. For the full year, system-wide RevPAR declined 57% with adjusted EBITDA down only modestly, more illustrating the resiliency of our fee-based model. We also demonstrate the strength of our brands and power of our customer-centric strategy by achieving market share gains across every region, even in a distressed business environment. 
For the quarter, system-wide RevPAR declined 59%, relatively in line with our expectations. The positive momentum in demand that we saw through the summer and early fall was disrupted in November, December by rising COVID cases, tightening travel restrictions and further hotel suspensions, particularly in Europe. Similar to the third quarter, drive to leisure travel drove an outsized portion of demand. 
Business transient and group trends showed modest sequential improvement versus the prior quarter, but overall demand remained quite muted. As we look to the year ahead, we remain optimistic that accelerating vaccine distribution will lead to easing government restrictions and unlock pent-up travel demand. For the first quarter, overall trends so far appear to be similar to the fourth quarter with modest increases in demand in the U.S. offsetting stalled recoveries in Europe and Asia Pacific. 
We expect improving fundamentals heading into spring with essentially all system-wide rooms reopened by the end of the second quarter. We expect a more pronounced recovery in the back half of the year driven by increased leisure demand and meaningful rebounds in corporate transient and group business. 
Over the last year, the personal savings rate in the United States has nearly doubled, increasing by more than $1.6 trillion to $2.9 trillion, with the potential to go even higher given additional stimulus. We expect this to drive greater leisure demand as travel restrictions ease and markets reopened a tourism. Additionally, conversations with our large corporate customers along with sequential upticks in business transient booking pace year-to-date indicate that there is pent-up demand for business travel that should drive a recovery in corporate transient trends as the year progresses. 
On the group side, we saw a meaningful step-up in new group demand in January with our back half group position showing significant sequential improvement versus the first half of the year. With roughly 70% of bookings made within a week of travel, overall visibility remains limited. However, we continue to see signs of optimism. In fact, the vast majority of our large corporate accounts agreed to extend 2020 negotiated rates into this year. 
Despite the challenges in 2020, we opened more than 400 hotels, totaling nearly 56,000 rooms and achieved net unit growth of 5.1%, slightly ahead of guidance. Fourth quarter openings were up nearly 30% year-over-year, largely driven by new development in China, where our focus service brands continue to command a disproportionate share of industry growth. 
We also celebrated our 1 Millionth Room milestone and the openings of our 3ooth hotel in China, our 600th Doubletree hotel and our 900th Hilton garden. We ended up the year with 397,000 rooms in our development pipeline, up 3% year-over-year. While market disruption weighed on new development signings, conversion signings increased more than 30% versus the prior year. 
As owners look to benefit from the strength of our network, we anticipate continued positive momentum and conversion activity, particularly through Doubletree and our collection brands. During the quarter, we signed agreements to expand our Curio collection in Mexico and bring our Tapestry collection to Portugal. This marks one of several new Tapestry hotels scheduled to open across Europe this year. We also announced plans to debut LXR in the Seychelles with Mango House Seychelles. The property will deliver a truly unique hospitality experience with spaces, guest rooms and suites and 5 world-class food and beverage venues. Scheduled to open in the coming months, the hotel underscores our commitment to further expanding our resort portfolio. 
Building on that momentum, we kicked off 2021 with an agreement to bring LXR to Bali. Additionally, we celebrated the openings of Oceana Santa Monica, which marked LXR's U.S. debut as well as the Waldorf Astoria, Monarch Beach Resort and the Hilton Vancouver Downtown, which was converted from a competitor brand. With these notable openings and many exciting development opportunities in front of us, we are confident in our ability to continue delivering solid growth over the next several years. 
The pandemic rapidly changed guest behaviors, priorities and concerns. We listen to our customers and move quickly to launch modifications to our Honors loyalty program, deliver industry-leading standards of cleanliness and hygiene with Hilton CleanStay and provide flexible distraction-free environments for remote work with Workspaces by Hilton. Additionally, with an even stronger focus on recovery, last month, we implemented Hilton Event Ready Hybrid Solutions, an expanded set of resources to help event planners address the dramatic shift towards hybrid meetings as group business rebound. 
Our flexibility and innovation drove continued growth in our Honors network, ending the year with more than 112 million members who accounted for approximately 60% of system-wide occupancy. Throughout 2020, we also remained focused on our corporate responsibility and our commitment to our ESG initiatives. We're proud to contribute to our communities, and we're honored to be named the Global Industry Leader in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the second year in a row. 
Earmarked by challenge and change, we effectively executed our crisis response strategy, carefully managed key stakeholder relationships and continued to press forward on strategic opportunities. I'm confident that there are brighter days ahead and that we are in a stronger, more resilient, and we are better positioned than ever before. 
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Kevin for a few more details on the fourth quarter and the full year."

My thoughts are certainly with his family and with my many friends at Marriott, who I know are hurting this morning. 
During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR declined 59.2% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis as the pandemic continued to disrupt the demand environment. Relative to the third quarter, occupancy was modestly lower, partially due to seasonality and further tempered by rising COVID cases and associated travel restrictions. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $204 million in the fourth quarter, down 65% year-over-year. Results reflected the continued impact of the pandemic on global travel demand, including temporary suspensions at some of our hotels during the quarter. Management and franchise fees decreased 50%, less than RevPAR decreased as franchise fee declines were somewhat mitigated by better-than-expected Honors license fees and development fees. 
Overall, revenue declines were mitigated by continued cost control at both the corporate and property levels. For the full year, our corporate G&A expenses were down nearly 30% year-over-year at the high end of our expectations. Our ownership portfolio posted a loss for the quarter due to the challenging demand environment, temporary closures in Europe and fixed operating costs, including fixed rent payments at some of our leased properties. Continued cost control measures, coupled with onetime items mitigated segment losses. For the quarter, diluted loss per share adjusted for special items was $0.10. 
Turning to our balance sheet. We continue to enhance our liquidity position and preserve our financial flexibility. Over the last few months, we opportunistically refinanced $3.4 billion of senior notes to extend our maturities at lower rates. In January, we also repaid $250 million of the outstanding balance under our $1.75 billion revolving credit facility. On a pro forma basis, taking these transactions into effect as of year-end 2020, we've lowered our weighted average cost of debt to 3.6% and extended our weighted average maturity to 7.2 years. 
We have no major debt maturities until 2024 and maintain a well-staggered maturity ladder thereafter. Further details on our fourth quarter and full year can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. We would like to speak with all of you this morning, so we ask that you limit yourself to 1 question. Chad, can we have our first question, please?"

But Chris, I'd love to hear your thoughts on how you're thinking about your business 3 years out post vaccine. What's different about your business in terms of individual business transient travel, group travel, leisure travel relative to pre COVID?

And so a lot to unpack there. But I think, Joe, when you go out, and obviously, you could debate this and I've debated it ad nauseam with a lot of people. I think if you go out 3 years, whatever, 3 or 4 years, I think demand is",1181,"Yes, it's a great question. And so a lot to unpack there. But I think, Joe, when you go out, and obviously, you could debate this and I've debated it ad nauseam with a lot of people. I think if you go out 3 years, whatever, 3 or 4 years, I think demand is going to look a lot like it did in '17, '18 and '19. And meaning the makeup of the business has between business transient, leisure transient and group at that point in time, I think, we'll look quite similar. 
Now certain of the types of -- if you get underneath the demand, particularly in business transient, and the group side might be for different reasons than then. I mean there'll be a substitution effect. Clearly, in certain types of travel being substituted with sort of the new Zoom calls and digital opportunities. But they'll be replaced with other forms of travel. And we've seen this throughout history. I mean, if you go back -- and I wasn't really around, but the telephone and the Internet and telepresence and voice mail. There were always the arguments that this is going to truncate the need to travel and congregate. 
And the reality is what it typically does is it accelerates it, right, because it just gives more efficiency. It speeds -- it ultimately speeds things up. It ultimately continues to connect the world and speed up globalization. And as a result, people need to congregate, they need to travel, they need to build relationships, they need to build cultures, they need to innovate. And those things really cannot be done as well without face-to-face opportunities, both in a group setting as well as individual business travel type needs. 
And so I -- having done it longer than I'd like to admit, 35, 40 years, we've been debating this. I don't -- again, I think there'll be some substitution effect. But I think it will look a lot like it did. And then our business, a couple of comments since you asked, our business is going to be a better business and a stronger business and a faster growing, higher-margin business. Why? Because, listen, throughout the next 3 years, we're going to continue to grow 4% or 5% unit growth. So we're going to be a bigger company. The units that we had pre COVID, if you believe what I believe, which is you'll have similar demand levels, we'll be producing like they were. 
You'll have all these new units that are then going to also be producing and you have a lower cost structure, because we've taken a significant amount of cost out on a cash basis. Sort of if you look at on a run rate in this year, so on a cash basis in the mid-teens, something like that, maybe a little bit better. And we're going to be incredibly disciplined as we always have been. I think we've been on a G&A basis, at the low end of spending in the industry, but we got even better last year. And that's going to -- when you put all the same flows of fees through the system with more units and a lower cost structure, it's simple math. It's a higher-margin business. 
And so I know it's sort of an odd time to be pounding the table with optimism, and so I probably shouldn't. But as we sit around this table, I'm at our Board table and we talk about it, it's been a hard year, the hardest any of us have ever endured. But as a result of it, we put ourselves in about the best position we could have. And honestly, I think the business is going to be better for it. And I think it's going to produce higher margins and more free cash flow, which were going to be -- which is going to allow us to return even more capital than we were pre COVID to our shareholders, which you think over the very long term is going to drive incredible returns. 
The last point was on limited service, full service. And I'm not -- I'm covering a lot of territory, you know. But you ask these things. And I think it's an important note because it's something I talked a lot about pre COVID that, frankly, I don't think got enough attention, which is the mega trend in our -- in the industry in every market in the world, there is not an exception, is the mid-market, right? That's -- why is that? Because that's where the bulk of the population is. That's where the bulk of the population growth is, particularly in the emerging markets. And so what can those people afford mid-market brands? I would say, I know I'm sort of padding us up. We have the best mid-market brands in the world. 
I mean it's being proven out in the growth of those brands in -- both in the U.S. but outside the U.S., outstripping the competition in Europe, outstripping the competition in Asia Pacific, particularly China. And that's not by luck. We've been very purposeful over the last 10 years in making sure that we take the best brands here, and we adapt those and refine those from a product and service point of view. We pick great development partners, like we've done in China, to make sure that these are adapted to those environments, what the customers want with the development community, in those environments, in those regions who want that. It has allowed us to show really strong growth and continue to. 
So the mega trend, which was before COVID, and I would say as a result of the economic distress that this has caused, only gets sort of accentuated in a post COVID world is the mid-market. And I feel really, really good about the work that we've done to put ourselves in a good position. And I think it's showing up. I think it's showing up in the numbers of our unit growth, right, because the bulk of that unit, I mean, we have lots of great things going on in luxury. We're making tremendous progress there. Lots of great things going on in the upper upscale and all that. But the bulk of -- you see, particularly in this environment, the bulk of the growth all over the world is really coming in limited service. And I've been saying it for years. If you wake up in 20 years and you look back and say, where was the bulk of the growth in demand and thus, the bulk of the growth in rooms. It's going to be in the mid-market. And that's why we've been focused on everything, but so intensely focused on that because in the end, that's what's going to drive higher growth rate. 
That is what having the best brands in that space that we adapt to the local market conditions is what's going to deliver alpha for us, the real alpha, over the next 10 or 20 years."

So I'll answer what I think I heard, and if I miss something, come back and remind me. So in terms of NUG, we feel the same way we have felt over the last couple of quarters. We obviously delivered a little bit better at 5.1, because we had a huge fourth quarter in terms of deliveries. But we've said over the next few years, we think we'll deliver 4% to 5%. And I still feel really good about that. I think this year, it will probably be more the midpoint to the high end of that, similar to last year. But I think over the next few years, we feel comfortable with that. 
And in part, leading to what I heard is the second part of your question, is success that we're having on the conversion side. We've always been focused on conversions and in downturns, as everybody knows, that's very fertile ground. Over the past 5 or 6 years, we've gone from having essentially one conversion brand, really, that was the big engine, which was Doubletree to now having 4 between our 3 soft brands and Doubletree, all of which are producing for us. And I think we'll continue to escalate. 
I mentioned in my prepared comments our signings for conversions were up 30% last year. Our starts, which I did not mention, probably should have, were up 40%. And our fourth quarter are open. We're up about 44%. So what you see happening is sort of natural, like it takes a little bit of time to ramp. You're right, we were circa 20% of overall NUG and conversions. That was up 300 or 400 basis points versus the prior year. And I think what you'll see over the next few years is that will become a larger and larger component of overall NUG. How high will it go, which maybe would be the next question, so I'll answer it. Unclear. I mean, we -- in the Great Recession, it went into the 40s. I don't think it will go that high because I honestly think we have so many other engines firing, particularly in China with all of our limited service growth as compared to the Great Recession. I don't think it will go that higher. But I think it could clearly go into the upper 20s, low 30s over the next few years. 
And so we have tremendous amount of focus on it. As you would guess, and the development teams are aligned around those goals. And I think you are starting to see, with some of the numbers that I described, the natural ramp-up in that and very, very good progress there. So I think things are coming along really nicely. Did I miss anything in your question?"

And then I know Chris did say this, we think '21 versus 2019 will be down in the mid-teens on a cash basis. And so how can that trend going forward? I think, look, overall, wages and benefits have been growing in excess of core inflation. Over time, that's probably not going to trend. But we've -- look, we're adding no new heads in the business this year. And so we think for several years we're going to remain disciplined as we always have and there's no reason to think that we can't grow cash overhead at sort of slightly ahead of inflation. There's slightly more than inflation, because that's probably what wages and benefits wants to grow over the next few years. And there's nothing that we see in the future that says we can't continue to get back to scaling the business without having step changes in growth in overhead."

I can give you -- I'll give you what I do have. I mean, I talked about in my prepared comments, David, the leisure side, and I think we all -- I think we can all kind of stipulate that people want to get out of their basements and they want to travel",1144,"Yes. I can give you -- I'll give you what I do have. I mean, I talked about in my prepared comments, David, the leisure side, and I think we all -- I think we can all kind of stipulate that people want to get out of their basements and they want to travel. And while people have been starting to do that, not that many have. And certainly, the higher end leisure business has not really been out and about. And so I think as you get through what is going to be a mass vaccination period of time over the next 90 days, I think when you get to late spring and summer, everything I'm hearing, talking to the Biden administration, which you're now reading in the papers, too, but we're having pretty direct conversations. I think maybe even sooner, I think -- the President said last night, I heard that by the end of July every American will be able to be vaccinated. My own belief based -- if you look at the manufacturing curve and expectation of J&J getting approved, probably by the end of this month that, that could be much -- that could be sooner than the middle of the summer. 
So I think once you get there, I think people have a lot of savings, even though they've been buying stuff like crazy as we know because a lot of the retail and car business and homes and all that have been doing well. They want to get out. They want to get out more than ever, talk to anybody, talk to any of your friends and you get the answer. And so I think the trend line there will be quite good when you get a bit of the all-clear sign, which I think will be -- hopefully, by spring, certainly no worse than summer. 
On the business transient, there are data points. I mean, but a lot of it is admittedly anecdotal in the sense of just discussions that we're having with our big customers and trends that we're seeing as we're having discussions with our customers, as we've been renegotiating all of our corporate negotiated accounts. I mean, clearly, there is massive pent-up demand. I mean, they may -- by the way, they're obviously in businesses that are hurting, they're going to have cutbacks for maybe their run rate numbers of '18 and '19. But the reality is they just -- in the short term, they have so many things that they need to do when you talk to them about collecting their people, innovation, just team meetings, getting out with clients and customers and the like that it's just -- it's been over a year. By the time they're out a little bit, 15 months. And forget the fact they want to see people. They need to see people. 
And so you're starting to see that even though we're in the -- you see the infection rate coming down. I mean, we're still not through the crisis, for sure. And you're starting to see it in the booking trends. I mean the business transient trends are clearly sort of, week by week, are marching up even in the middle of all this, even though we don't have the an all-clear sign, so not tons of data other than real booking data suggests short term, it's moving in the right direction, but lots of conversations with customers are saying that. And lots of surveying that we're doing is suggesting like it was -- that people are more interested in travel for leisure and business. As our polling goes, like over 80% are going to say they got to get back out on the road, which is the highest number, obviously, we've seen since this mess began. So that's good. 
On the group side, that's going to take longer, but the trend lines are good. If you look at like our lead volume, sort of fourth quarter versus January, January was up 35%. If you look at it, January versus December, it was up 50%. I'd give you the quarter because normally, January would step-up from December because of the holidays. So I want to -- I think a better number would probably be sort of the average over the whole fourth quarter. But that's up by more than 1/3. A staff that -- as I go through the team that I thought was very encouraging on the group side was that our first half position for 2021 versus '19. So let's forget '20, because it was a washout. I mean the comparability is not relevant. If you look at it versus a stabilized year of '19, first half position on the group side system-wide is down 80%. The second half of the year versus the second half of '19 is down by 32%. 
So again, it's still off, but by a lot lesser margin. And that's a result of people saying, I got to get out, I want to get out, I want to -- I got to have team meetings, I got to have small group, medium-sized group, conventions are starting to book again because they're going to go out of business if they don't get booking again. With an expectation, obviously, by the time you get the second half of the year, that it's safe, and they can do it from a health point of view. And so we need this -- my belief is we will get there, but we need this vaccination effort between now and June, July to really ramp up. And it feels like, day by day, that's happening. So that's a little bit of color. 
Obviously, we got to play out the next few months and have the right things fall into place. But I think there is a -- I think there's a real opportunity for the -- I said this publicly, I think on Bloomberg or somewhere, but I do think there's a great opportunity for the second half of the year to be better than any of us think. Because when -- it's like everything. When you're at the top of the cycle, you always think everything is going to stay good forever, and it's a new norm. And when you're looking from the bottom, the depths of doom, you're sort of trend lining off of a lot of negativity. And eventually, this thing is going to flip and people want to get out, no matter what anybody says, they want to travel. And when the all clear sign is sort of given, which is the light at the end of the tunnel and I think coming soon, I think there's a huge amount of pent-up demand. And I think we could all like what we see in the second half of the year."

So all of our efforts across what we're doing with Honors, what we're doing with promotions, what we're doing with our marketing spend have been focused on that.

In the fourth quarter, I would say -- I don't have all the data in front of me, but I would say anecdotally from lots of conversations with our Asia Pac and our China team, it was very rapidly sort of approaching normalcy, meaning we weren't fully back with -- there was still a little bit heavier leisure component, but there always is in China, by the way. I mean it's a heavier leisure market broadly. But we weren't too terribly far off of our business transient and our group trends, but it was following the same pattern I would expect here. Leisure leads, business transient is a close second. And the groups just because they're, by nature of group business, it's a little bit longer lead time, there's a little bit more planning with lagging a bit. 
But they -- China we were running like 10 points off, something like that. So we were getting -- before they backed up, we were getting to, I think, very normalized levels of demand. We were not seeing any material, as far as we could tell, with the data we had, any sort of substitution effect. Reality is China was sort of going back to the normal trends that it had very rapidly before COVID. And so I think, well, China is different in lots of ways. I think, humans are humans. And I think that's why my belief is that as we sort of come out of this, leisure will lead business streams, it will be a fast follow group will take a little bit longer to develop because of the lead times. But the demand patterns will, over a couple of years, return and look a lot like they did pre COVID."

And broadly, I think, many, including me, are supportive over time that the minimum wage needs to move up. But as I've said to a number of people in the administration time in place, sort of how you do it and when you do it matters. And so I think the likely outcome is -- I don't know that it will end up in this first bill. I do think that there -- I think that is probably not highly likely based on what I'm hearing, possible but not highly likely. But it will not be an issue that goes away. 
And I think that the how and the when then become important. And so how being that, first of all, even in what's being proposed now, it's not all to $15. It's staged in over basically 5 years. And so I think that creates a ramp that allows people to adjust and create -- we're obviously working with our owners on creating even more efficiencies. So it's not like overnight you go across the country to $15. By the way, there are a whole bunch of markets that are already $15, and so they've been dealing with it. 
I would also like to think that if people really spend the time figuring out that not every market is the same, that living in [indiscernible] is not the same as living in New York City and that these can be indexed. And then when do you start to sort of move it up, I think, is a big issue. My personal worry and concern is the hospitality industry has been more impacted from a jobs point of view than any industry in the country. And it's the slowest in recovery in terms of bringing jobs back. And I don't think raising the minimum wage, no matter how you look at the analysis, is going to help. I think it will slow the rehiring of people in the industry. 
And so I am hopeful that in the end that people will be a rational -- rational thinking will prevail. And as a result, this will not be a major issue, certainly in the short to intermediate term. I think we should all assume that the minimum wage is going to be going up over time. In fact, because it needs to. But again, I think it's -- I'm hopeful that it will be done in a staged way. And there'll be other mechanisms built into the timing and the geographical approach. That will make it make sense on all sides. So the short -- that's a long answer, Bill. The short answer is, I don't think in the short to intermediate term, there's any meaningful impact as a result of it."

I mean, I think I've been saying for 13 years since we bought nothing. We've gone from a family of 9 brands to 18 brands. So we've doubled this. In the time I've been here, we haven't bought one of them. We've organically developed every single one of them. So for my entire time here, I've been saying, never say never, right? You've heard my speech. If it passes all the right filters, we'd consider it, but nothing has, and so I think not necessarily the path is indicative of the future, but it sort of tells you our predisposition. 
And so I would say, never say never. But the filter is a very tight filtration system, which is we think we got the best brand portfolio in the business. We think that is -- that can be proven scientifically by the fact that every one of our brands is a market share leader. Everyone that we've developed, we get purpose-built around exactly what customers want, and we like that. And so anything that we would look to acquire would have to sort of meet that profile, like we don't want to go backwards because we don't have to. We have pretty much every category covered. If something is not covered, we could launch it. I don't think you'll see us launch a whole lot of new brands in the short term. 
But why would we do that? We have -- all the segments generally covered we want to cover. We have the best brands. Why would we pick up something that wasn't superb in the same way that we don't have to be distracted trying to fix and that we paid a lot of money for, which leads me to the next filter, which is economics. If you do simple math, we're developing these brands for nothing, not to make it -- and so we have an infinite yield every time we do it. Every time we do a Tru or a Home 2 and these things become mega brands, they become billion -- multibillion-dollar businesses over time. It's an infinite return because we've effectively invested just sweat equity, so something, but not much. 
So when we look at buying stuff, we haven't found anything that was perfect that doesn't require a lot of elbow grease, and you're paying a lot of money for it. So we just -- again, never say never. But that's sort of how we think about it. Now your comment -- your question also implied like region -- sort of regional process. That's where maybe, I hate to say it and have it become a headline, because I think the likelihood is we're not going to do that. But there are sort of smaller regional brands and places where maybe we want a stronger foothold that aren't -- that don't show up a whole lot in the radar, but for what they are, are very, very good. And so we've looked at a bunch of those over time. And we'll continue to do that. 
The net result has been, while we've looked at a bunch of them, we haven't done any. And again, I would say -- I would condition everybody to say, we like what we got. We think we got the -- no offense to our competitors, maybe we got the best setup for the future in the industry. And the last thing we want to do is botch it by either bringing brands that, like my father used to say, you hang with the dogs, you get the fleas. We don't want to bring stuff in that messes up the portfolio. And we're intensely focused on good capital allocation. I was -- those are my origins and business being a good capital allocator. 
And so when you put it together, I think, not high likelihood, but never impossible."

The big stuff, it takes time when you're doing 1,000 person or multi-thousand person conventions. Even if you're doing it hybrid, it takes a lot of planning. And so that's really almost, at this point, got to start to fall into next year. So yes, I think if all goes according to plan in the first half of this year with vaccinations and there's a reality that people feel like they can start to congregate again, being intelligent about it, but do it in a safe way. I think you'll -- in the second half of this year, you'll see a bunch of demand that will dump into next year on stuff that requires planning."

So on the first, our published rates, you would say, if you average all our brands, is about 5.6% in license fees. We're about 5% right now in terms of effective rate, in terms of where people are in the cycle. We're not going to, anytime soon, be increasing those rates in an absolute sense. But by definition, every time a contract turns, it goes to the new rate. And I think -- I'm not saying anybody likes it, but that's sort of standard -- the standard within the industry. It's certainly what we've always done, and we'll continue to do that. 
So you'll see that sort of grind up about 10, 15 basis points a year. And then when we get to the other side of this, depending on the economics and ultimate market share and all those things, obviously, we can look at what we do with our fee structures. But we're going to sort of keep -- we think that they are good where they are, and we'll keep our effective rates will keep grinding up as you have natural rollover. 
On the CapEx side, it's really important. It's a delicate balance. The obvious one, which is you got to keep the portfolio. We have the market share leaders in every one of these categories. Part of that is obviously service, a part of it's product. And part of that product is about having fresh product, consistent and high-quality product. We're very religious about it. We have given a lot of relief. Thankfully, we went into the crisis in a really good position because we've been unbelievably diligent and disciplined, and our owner community over time has recognized that to get those premiums, they have to keep their assets up. 
And so we went into the crisis a year ago in a good place. We have the ability, we think, to give them a bit of grace for a period of time and not have a significant impact with our customer base. But as we get to the other side of this, yes, we're going to have to get back to having that kind of discipline, which is not just in our interest, it's in our owner's interest if they want to continue to drive results. I suspect that that's going to be next year and not this year, just in the sense that while I think the second half we're going to be in a very different world, we're going to have to let folks get back on their feet. And I think given, again, the quality of -- on average of our brands and the upkeep of the brands and the individual hotels going into this, I think we can do that without it being harmful."

We certainly appreciate you all joining us today, and I hope everybody is staying well. I want to start with something difficult. I want to start by extending my most heartfelt condolences to the Sorenson family and the thousands of Marriott associates around the world following the heartbreaking news of Arne's passing. To say I'm deeply saddened by that loss, it would be an understatement.
As many of you know, had the opportunity to work with Arne in a number of capacities throughout my career, including earlier on at Host. I think it's very fair to say he was an exceptional leader, but also an incredible person and a great friend. Our industry is better because of him, and I am a better professional and a better person because of him. On behalf of everyone at Hilton family, the entire Marriott family are in our thoughts.
As we all know, this past year has presented unique challenges, including a pandemic that devastated lives, communities, and businesses across the world, widespread economic declines and acts of social injustice. Due to the extraordinary levels of disruption, our industry experienced demand declines we've never seen before in our 101-year history. Guided by our founding purpose, to make the world a better place through the light and warmth of hospitality, we acted quickly to ensure the safety and well-being of our people. We also took steps to protect our business by rightsizing our cost structure and enhancing our liquidity position while continuing to drive net unit growth and increase our network effect.
As a result of these moves, we expect to recover from the pandemic as a stronger, higher-margin business that is even better positioned to deliver performance for our owners and strong free cash flow for our shareholders. While it's certainly been a very difficult year, we're proud of everything we've accomplished, but we certainly could not have done it without the support of all of our stakeholders.
For that, I'd like to extend a heartfelt thank you to all of our loyal customers, our important owner partners, our communities who supported us and enabled us to support them, our team members who gave their hearts and souls to our business and our shareholders who stood by us. Because of our amazing people, we've been able to lean on our award-winning culture, which earned the #1 Best Place to Work in the United States for the second consecutive year and the #3 World's Best Workplace to help get us through these trying times.
Turning to results. For the full year, system-wide RevPAR declined 57% with adjusted EBITDA down only modestly, more illustrating the resiliency of our fee-based model. We also demonstrated the strength of our brands and power of our customer-centric strategy by achieving market share gains across every region, even in a distressed business environment.
For the quarter, system-wide RevPAR declined 59%, relatively in line with our expectations. The positive momentum in demand that we saw through the summer and early fall was disrupted in November, December by rising COVID cases, tightening travel restrictions and further hotel suspensions, particularly in Europe. Similar to the third quarter, drive to leisure travel drove an outsized portion of demand. Business transient and group trends showed modest sequential improvement versus the prior quarter, but overall demand remained quite muted.
As we look to the year ahead, we remain optimistic that accelerating vaccine distribution will lead to easing government restrictions and unlock pent-up travel demand. For the first quarter, overall trends so far appear to be similar to the fourth quarter with modest increases in demand in the U.S., offsetting stalled recoveries in Europe and Asia Pacific. We expect improving fundamentals heading into spring with essentially all system-wide rooms reopened by the end of the second quarter. We expect a more pronounced recovery in the back half of the year driven by increased leisure demand and meaningful rebounds in corporate transient and group business.
Over the last year, the personal savings rate in the United States has nearly doubled, increasing by more than $1.6 trillion to $2.9 trillion, with the potential to go even higher given additional stimulus. We expect this to drive greater leisure demand as travel restrictions ease and markets reopened the tourism. Additionally, conversations with our large corporate customers along with sequential upticks in business transient booking pace year-to-date indicate that there is pent-up demand for business travel that should drive a recovery in corporate transient trends as the year progresses.
On the group side, we saw a meaningful step-up in new group demand in January with our back half group position showing significant sequential improvement versus the first half of the year. With roughly 70% of bookings made within a week of travel, overall visibility remains limited. However, we continue to see signs of optimism. In fact, the vast majority of our large corporate accounts agreed to extend 2020 negotiated rates into this year.
Despite the challenges in 2020, we opened more than 400 hotels, totaling nearly 56,000 rooms and achieved net unit growth of 5.1%, slightly ahead of guidance. Fourth quarter openings were up nearly 30% year-over-year, largely driven by new development in China, where our focused-service brands continue to command a disproportionate share of industry growth. We also celebrated our 1,000,000th room milestone and the openings of our 300th hotel in China, our 600th DoubleTree hotel and our 900th Hilton Garden Inn. We ended up the year with 397,000 rooms in our development pipeline, up 3% year-over-year. While market disruption weighed on new development signings, conversion signings increased more than 30% versus the prior year.
As owners look to benefit from the strength of our network, we anticipate continued positive momentum and conversion activity, particularly through DoubleTree and our collection brands. During the  quarter, we signed agreements to expand our Curio Collection in Mexico and bring our Tapestry Collection to Portugal. This marks one of several new Tapestry hotels scheduled to open across Europe this year. We also announced plans to debut LXR in the Seychelles with Mango House Seychelles. The property will deliver a truly unique hospitality experience with spaces, guest rooms and suites and 5 world-class food and beverage venues. Scheduled to open in the coming months, the hotel underscores our commitment to further expanding our resort portfolio.
Building on that momentum, we kicked off 2021 with an agreement to bring LXR to Bali. Additionally, we celebrated the openings of Oceana Santa Monica, which marked LXR's U.S. debut as well as the Waldorf Astoria, Monarch Beach Resort and the Hilton Vancouver Downtown, which was converted from a competitor brand. With these notable openings and many exciting development opportunities in front of us, we are confident in our ability to continue delivering solid growth over the next several years.
The pandemic rapidly changed guest behaviors, priorities and concerns. We listen to our customers and move quickly to launch modifications to our Honors loyalty program, deliver industry-leading standards of cleanliness and hygiene with Hilton CleanStay and provide flexible, distraction-free environments for remote work with WorkSpaces by Hilton. Additionally, with an even stronger focus on recovery, last month, we implemented Hilton EventReady Hybrid Solutions, an expanded set of resources to help event planners address the dramatic shift towards hybrid meetings as group business rebounds. Our flexibility and innovation drove continued growth in our Honors network, ending the year with more than 112 million members who accounted for approximately 60% of system-wide occupancy.
Throughout 2020, we also remained focused on our corporate responsibility and our commitment to our ESG initiatives. We're proud to contribute to our communities, and we're honored to be named the global industry leader in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the second year in a row. And earmarked by challenge and change, we effectively executed our crisis response strategy, carefully managed key stakeholder relationships and continued to press forward on strategic opportunities. I'm confident that there are brighter days ahead and that we are in a stronger, more resilient, and we are better positioned than ever before.
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Kevin for a few more details on the fourth quarter and the full year."

During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR declined 59.2% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis as the pandemic continued to disrupt the demand environment. Relative to the third quarter, occupancy was modestly lower, partially due to seasonality and further tempered by rising COVID cases and associated travel restrictions.
Adjusted EBITDA was $204 million in the fourth quarter, down 65% year-over-year. Results reflected the continued impact of the pandemic on global travel demand, including temporary suspensions at some of our hotels during the quarter. Management and franchise fees decreased 50%, less than RevPAR decreased as franchise fee declines were somewhat mitigated by better-than-expected Honors license fees and development fees.
Overall, revenue declines were mitigated by continued cost control at both the corporate and property levels. For the full year, our corporate G&A expenses were down nearly 30% year-over-year at the high end of our expectations. Our ownership portfolio posted a loss for the quarter due to the challenging demand environment, temporary closures in Europe and fixed operating costs, including fixed rent payments at some of our leased properties. Continued cost control measures, coupled with onetime items mitigated segment losses. For the fourth -- for the quarter, diluted loss per share adjusted for special items was $0.10.
Turning to our balance sheet. We continue to enhance our liquidity position and preserve our financial flexibility. Over the last few months, we opportunistically refinanced $3.4 billion of senior notes to extend our maturities at lower rates. In January, we also repaid $250 million of the outstanding balance under our $1.75 billion revolving credit facility. On a pro forma basis, taking these transactions into effect as of year-end 2020, we've lowered our weighted average cost of debt to 3.6% and extended our weighted average maturity to 7.2 years. We have no major debt maturities until 2024 and maintain a well-staggered maturity ladder thereafter. Further details on our fourth quarter and full year can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning.

And so a lot to unpack there. But I think, Joe, when you go out, and obviously, you could debate this and I've debated it ad nauseam with a lot of people.

But I think, Joe, when you go out, and obviously, you could debate this and I've debated it ad nauseam with a lot of people. I think if you go out 3 years, whatever, 3 or 4 years, I think demand is going to look a lot like it did in '17, '18 and '19. And meaning the makeup of the business has between business transient, leisure transient and group at that point in time, I think, will look quite similar.
Now certain of the types of -- if you get underneath the demand, particularly in business transient and the group side might be for different reasons than then. I mean there'll be a substitution effect, clearly, in certain types of travel being substituted with sort of the new -- the Zoom calls and digital opportunities. But they'll be replaced with other forms of travel. And we've seen this throughout history. I mean if you go back -- and I wasn't really around, but the telephone and the Internet and telepresence and voice mail. There were always the arguments that this is going to truncate the need to travel and congregate.
And the reality is what it typically does is it accelerates it, right, because it just gives more efficiency. It speeds -- it ultimately speeds things up. It ultimately continues to connect the world and speed up globalization. And as a result, people need to congregate. They need to travel. They need to build relationships. They need to build cultures. They need to innovate. And those things really cannot be done as well without face-to-face opportunities, both in a group setting as well as individual business travel-type needs. And so I -- having done it longer than I'd like to admit, 35, 40 years, I -- we've been debating this. I don't -- again, I think there'll be some substitution effect. But I think it will look a lot like it did.
And then our business, a couple of comments since you asked, our business is going to be a better business and a stronger business and a faster growing, higher-margin business. Why? Because, listen, throughout the next 3 years, we're going to continue to grow 4% or 5% unit growth. So we're going to be a bigger company. The units that we had pre COVID, if you believe what I believe, which is you'll have similar demand levels, will be producing like they were.
You'll have all these new units that are then going to also be producing and you have a lower cost structure, because we've taken a significant amount of cost-out on a cash basis. Sort of if you look at on a run rate in this year, so on a cash basis in the mid-teens, something like that, maybe a little bit better. And we're going to be incredibly disciplined as we always have been. I think we've been on a G&A basis, at the low end of spending in the industry, but we got even better last year. And that's going to -- when you put all the same flows of fees through the system with more units and a lower cost structure, it's simple math. It's a higher-margin business.
And so I know it's sort of an odd time to be pounding the table with optimism, and so I probably shouldn't. But as we sit around this table, I'm at our Board table when we talk about it, it's been a hard year, the hardest any of us have ever endured. But as a result of it, we put ourselves in about the best position we could have. And honestly, I think the business is going to be better for it. And I think it's going to produce higher margins and more free cash flow, which were going to be -- which is going to allow us to return even more capital than we were pre COVID to our shareholders, which we think over the very long term is going to drive incredible returns.
The last point was on limited service, full service. And I'm not -- I'm covering a lot of territory, I know, but you ask these things. And I think it's an important note because it's something I talked a lot about pre COVID that, frankly, I don't think got enough attention, which is the mega trend in our -- in the industry in every market in the world, there is not an exception, is the mid-market, right? That's -- why is that? Because that's where the bulk of the population is. That's where the bulk of the population growth is, particularly in the emerging markets. And so what can those people afford mid-market brands? I would say, I know I'm sort of padding us up. We have the best mid-market brands in the world.
I mean it's being proven out in the growth of those brands in -- both in the U.S. but outside the U.S., outstripping the competition in Europe, outstripping the competition in Asia Pacific, particularly China. And that's not by luck. We've been very purposeful over the last 10 years in making sure that we take the best brands here, and we adapt those and refine those from a product and service point of view. We pick great development partners, like we've done in China, to make sure that these are adapted to those environments, what the customers want with the development community, in those environments, in those regions want that it has allowed us to show really strong growth and continue to.
So the mega trend, which was before COVID, and I would say as a result of the economic distress that this has caused, only gets sort of accentuated in a post-COVID world is the mid-market. And I feel really, really good about the work that we've done to put ourselves in a good position. And I think it's showing up. I think it's showing up in the numbers of our unit growth, right, because the bulk of that unit -- I mean, we have lots of great things going on in luxury. We're making tremendous progress there. Lots of great things going on in the upper upscale and all that.
But the bulk of -- you see, particularly in this environment, the bulk of the growth all over the world is really coming in limited service. And I've been saying it for years. If you wake up in 20 years and you look back and say, where was the bulk of the growth in demand and thus, the bulk of the growth in rooms, it's going to be in the mid-market. And that's why we've been focused on everything, but so intensely focused on that because in the end, that's what's going to drive  higher growth rate. That is what -- having the best brands in that space that we adapt to the local market conditions is what's going to deliver alpha for us, the real alpha, over the next 10 or 20 years."

So I'll answer what I think I heard, and if I miss something, come back and remind me. So in terms of NUG, we feel the same way we have felt over the last couple of quarters. We obviously delivered a little bit better at 5.1%, because we had a huge fourth quarter in terms of deliveries. But we've said over the next few years, we think we'll deliver 4% to 5%. And I still feel really good about that. I think this year, it will probably be more the midpoint to the high end of that, similar to last year. But I think over the next few years, we feel comfortable with that.
And in part, leading to what I heard is the second part of your question, is success that we're having on the conversion side. We've always been focused on conversions and in downturns. As everybody knows, that's very fertile ground. Over the past 5 or 6 years, we've gone from having essentially one conversion brand, really, that was the big engine, which was DoubleTree to now having 4 between our 3 soft brands and DoubleTree, all of which are producing for us. And I think we'll continue to escalate.
I mentioned in my prepared comments, our signings for conversions were up 30% last year. Our starts, which I did not mention, probably should have, were up 40%. And our fourth quarter are open, we're up about 44%. So what you see happening is sort of natural, like it takes a little bit of time to ramp. You're right, we were circa 20% of overall NUG and conversions, that was up 300 or 400 basis points versus the prior year. And I think what you'll see over the next few years is that will become a larger and larger component of overall NUG.
How high will it go, which maybe would be the next question, so I'll answer it. Unclear. I mean we -- in the Great Recession, it went into the 40s. I don't think it will go that high because I honestly think we have so many other engines firing, particularly in China with all of our limited service growth as compared to the Great Recession, that I don't think it will go that higher. But I think it could clearly go into the upper 20s, low 30s over the next few years.
And so we have tremendous amount of focus on it as you would guess, and the development teams are aligned around those goals. And I think you are starting to see, with some of the numbers that I described, the natural ramp-up in that and very, very good progress there. So I think things are coming along really nicely. Did I miss anything in your question?"

And then I know Chris did say this, we think '21 versus 2019 will be down in the mid-teens on a cash basis.
And so how can that trend going forward? I think, look, overall, wages and benefits have been growing in excess of core inflation. Over time, that's probably not going to trend. But we've -- look, we're adding no new heads in the business this year. And so we think for several years, we're going to remain disciplined as we always have, and there's no reason to think that we can't grow cash overhead at sort of slightly ahead of inflation. There's slightly more than inflation, because that's probably what wages and benefits wants to grow over the next few years. And there's nothing that we see in the future that says we can't continue to get back to scaling the business without having step changes in growth in overhead."

I can give you -- I'll give you what I do have. I mean I talked about in my prepared comments, David, the leisure side, and I think we all -- I think we can all kind of stipulate that people want to get out of their basements and they want to travel. And while people have been starting to do that, not that many have. And certainly, the higher-end leisure business has not really been out and about.
And so I think as you get through what is going to be a mass vaccination period of time over the next 90 days, I think when you get to late spring and summer, everything I'm hearing, talking to the Biden administration, which you're now reading in the papers, too, but we're having pretty direct conversations. I think maybe even sooner, I think -- the President said last night, I heard that by the end of July, every American will be able to be vaccinated. My own belief based -- if you look at the manufacturing curve and expectation of J&J getting approved, probably by the end of this month that could be much -- that could be sooner than the middle of the summer.
So I think once you get there, I think people have a lot of savings, even though they've been buying stuff like crazy as we know because a lot of the retail and car business and homes and all that have been doing well. They want to get out. They want to get out more than ever, talk to anybody, talk to any of your friends and you get the answer. And so I think the trend line there will be quite good when you get a bit of the all-clear sign, which I think will be -- hopefully, by spring, certainly no worse than summer.
On the business transient, there are data points. I mean what -- but a lot of it is admittedly anecdotal in the sense of just discussions that we're having with our big customers and trends that we're seeing. As we're having discussions with our customers, as we've been renegotiating all of our corporate negotiated accounts. I mean clearly, there is massive pent-up demand.
I mean they may -- by the way, they're obviously in businesses that are hurting, they're going to have cutbacks for maybe their run rate numbers of '18 and '19. But the reality is they just -- in the short term, they have so many things that they need to do when you talk to them about collecting their people, innovation, just team meetings, getting out with clients and customers and the like that it's just -- it's been over a year. By the time they're out a little bit, 15 months. And forget the fact they want to see people. They need to see people.
And so you're starting to see that even though we're in the -- you see the infection rate coming down. I mean we're still not through the crisis, for sure. And you're starting to see it in the booking trends. I mean the business transient trends are clearly sort of, week by week, are marching up even in the middle of all this, even though we don't have the -- an all-clear sign.
So not tons of data other than real booking data suggests short term, it's moving in the right direction, but lots of conversations with customers are saying that. And lots of surveying that we're doing is suggesting like it was -- that people are more interested in travel for leisure and business. As our polling goes, like over 80% are going to say they got to get back out on the road, which is the highest number, obviously, we've seen since this mess began. So that's good.
On the group side, that's going to take longer, but the trend lines are good. If you look at like our lead volume, sort of fourth quarter versus January, January was up 35%. If you look at it, January versus December, it was up 50%. I'd give you the quarter because normally, January would step up from December because of the holidays. So I want to -- I think a better number would probably be sort of the average over the whole fourth quarter. But that's up by more than 1/3.
A staff that -- as I go through the team that I thought was very encouraging on the group side was that our first half position for 2021 versus '19. So let's forget '20, because it was a washout. I mean the comparability is not relevant. If you look at it versus a stabilized year of '19, first half position on the group side system-wide is down 80%. The second half of the year versus the second half of '19 is down by 32%.
So again, it's still off, but by a lot lesser margin. And that's a result of people saying, I got to get out. I want to get out. I want to -- I got to have team meetings. I got to have small group, medium-sized group. Conventions are starting to book again because they're going to go out of business if they don't get booking again. With an expectation, obviously, by the time you get the second half of the year, that it's safe, and they can do it from a health point of view. And so we need this -- my belief is we will get there, but we need this vaccination effort between now and June, July to really ramp up. And it feels like, day by day, that's happening. So that's a little bit of color.
Obviously, we got to play out the next few months and have the right things fall into place. But I think there's a real opportunity for the -- I said this publicly, I think on Bloomberg or somewhere, but I do think there's a great opportunity for the second half of the year to be better than any of us think. Because when -- it's like everything. When you're at the top of the cycle, you always think everything is going to stay good forever, and it's a new norm. And when you're looking from the bottom, the depths of doom, your sort of trend lining off of a lot of negativity. And eventually, this thing is going to flip and people want to get out. No matter what anybody says, they want to travel. And when the all-clear sign is sort of given, which is the light at the end of the tunnel and I think coming soon, I think there's a huge amount of pent-up demand. And I think we could all like what we see in the second half of the year."

So and it's really -- the bleisure part of it is small businesses that really don't have the choice but to travel to keep their businesses going, and they are sort of mixing it with leisure opportunities because they have more mobility in a sense they're not locked into -- their kids aren't locked into necessarily being in schools and they're not locked into being in an office. So all of our efforts across what we're doing with Honors, what we're doing with promotions, what we're doing with our marketing spend have been focused on that.

In the fourth quarter, I would say -- I don't have all the data in front of me, but I would say anecdotally from lots of conversations with our Asia Pac and our China team, it was very rapidly sort of approaching normalcy, meaning we weren't fully back with -- there was still a little bit heavier leisure component, but there always is in China, by the way. I mean it's a heavier leisure market broadly. But we weren't too terribly far off of our business transient and our group trends, but it was following the same pattern I would expect here. Leisure leads, business transient is a close second, and the groups just because they're, by nature of group business, it's a little bit longer lead time, there's a little bit more planning with lagging a bit.
But they -- China, we were running like 10 points off, something like that. So we were getting -- before they backed up, we were getting to, I think, very normalized levels of demand. We were not seeing any material, as far as we could tell, with the data we had, any sort of substitution effect. Reality is China was sort of going back to the normal trends that it had very rapidly before COVID. And so I think, well, China is different in lots of ways. I think humans are humans. And I think that's why my belief is that as we sort of come out of this, leisure will lead business streams, it will be a fast follow. Group will take a little bit longer to develop because of the lead times. But the demand patterns will, over a couple of years, return and look a lot like they did pre COVID."

And broadly, I think many, including me, are supportive over time that the minimum wage needs to move up. But as I've said to a number of people in the administration time in place, sort of how you do it and when you do it matters. And so I think the likely outcome is -- I don't know that it will end up in this first bill. I do think that there -- I think that is probably not highly likely based on what I'm hearing, possible but not highly likely. But it will not be an issue that goes away.
And I think that the how and the when then become important. And so how being that, first of all, even in what's being proposed now, it's not all to $15. It's staged in over basically 5 years. And so I think that creates a ramp, that allows people to adjust and create -- we're obviously working with our owners on creating even more efficiencies. So it's not like overnight, you go across the country to $15. By the way, there are a whole bunch of markets that are already $15, and so they've been dealing with it.
I would also like to think that if people really spend the time figuring out that not every market is the same, that living in Poughkeepsie is not the same as living in New York City and that these can be indexed. And then when do you start to sort of move it up, I think, is a big issue. My personal worry and concern is the hospitality industry has been more impacted from a jobs point of view than any industry in the country. And it's the slowest in recovery in terms of bringing jobs back. And I don't think raising the minimum wage, no matter how you look at the analysis, is going to help. I think it will slow the rehiring of people in the industry.
And so I am hopeful that in the end that people will be a rational -- rational thinking will prevail. And as a result, this will not be a major issue, certainly in the short to intermediate term. I think we should all assume that the minimum wage is going to be going up over time, in fact, because it needs to. But again, I think it's -- I'm hopeful that it will be done in a staged way. And there'll be other mechanisms built into the timing and the geographical approach. That will make it make sense on all sides. So the short -- that's a long answer, Bill. The short answer is, I don't think in the short to intermediate term, there's any meaningful impact as a result of it."

So they're going to -- when we get out of the crisis, those businesses will be higher margin and require less labor than they did pre COVID. So that will also sort of factored for in my commentary.
But I think that, hopefully, the net of it is, as it goes up, it's done over a longer period of time and it's done in a sort of thoughtful way."

A good question and one we certainly -- we get frequently. I don't think my views changed at all. I mean, I think I've been saying for 13 years since we bought nothing. We've gone from a family of 9 brands to 18 brands. So we've doub",673,"Yes. Thanks, Patrick. A good question and one we certainly -- we get frequently. I don't think my views changed at all. I mean, I think I've been saying for 13 years since we bought nothing. We've gone from a family of 9 brands to 18 brands. So we've doubled it in the time I've been here, and we haven't bought one of them. We've organically developed every single one of them. So for my entire time here, I've been saying, never say never, right? You've heard my speech. If it passes all the right filters, we'd consider it, but nothing has, and so I think not necessarily the path is indicative of the future, but it sort of tells you our predisposition.
And so I would say, never say never. But the filter is a very tight filtration system, which is we think we got the best brand portfolio in the business. We think that is -- that can be proven scientifically by the fact that every one of our brands is a market share leader. Everyone that we've developed, we think, is purpose-built around exactly what customers want, and we like that. And so anything that we would look to acquire would have to sort of meet that profile, like we don't want to go backwards because we don't have to. We have pretty much every category covered. If something is not covered, we could launch it. I don't think you'll see us launch a whole lot of new brands in the short term.
But why would we do that? We have -- all the segments generally covered we want to cover. We have the best brands. Why would we pick up something that wasn't superb in the same way that we didn't have to be distracted trying to fix and that we paid a lot of money for, which leads me to the next filter, which is economics. If you do a simple math, we're developing these brands for nothing, not to make it -- and so we have an infinite yield every time we do it. Every time we do a Tru or a Home2 and these things become mega brands, they become billion -- multibillion-dollar businesses over time, it's an infinite return because we've effectively invested just sweat equity, so something, but not much. So when we look at buying stuff, we haven't found anything that was perfect that doesn't require a lot of elbow grease, and you're paying a lot of money for it. So we just -- again, never say never. But that's sort of how we think about it.
Now your comment -- your question also implied like region -- sort of regional process. That's where maybe, I hate to say it and have it become a headline, because I think the likelihood is we're not going to do that. But there are sort of smaller regional brands and places where maybe we want a stronger foothold that aren't -- that don't show up a whole lot in the radar, but for what they are, are very, very good. And so we've looked at a bunch of those over time. And we'll continue to do that.
The net result has been, while we've looked at a bunch of them, we haven't done any. And again, I would say -- I would condition everybody to say, we like what we got. We think we got the -- no offense to our competitors, maybe we got the best setup for the future in the industry. And the last thing we want to do is botch it by either bringing brands that, like my father used to say, you hang with the dogs, you get the fleas. We don't want to bring stuff in that messes up the portfolio. And we're intensely focused on good capital allocation. I was -- those are my origins and business being a good capital allocator. And so when you put it together, I think, not high likelihood, but not -- never impossible."

And as a result, more pricing power than people think just because you -- people have accumulated all sorts of needs that are going to get released, and it takes time to plan. So what you're going to see in the second half of this year is, I think, the big uptick will be in the SMERF business because those are smaller groups. They can have -- the planning is not as time-consuming. The lead times aren't.
The big stuff, it takes time when you're doing 1,000 person or multi-thousand person conventions. Even if you're doing it hybrid, it takes a lot of planning. And so that's really almost, at this point, got to start to fall into next year. So yes, I think if all goes according to plan in the first half of this year with vaccinations and there's a reality that people feel like they can start to congregate again, being intelligent about it, but do it in a safe way, I think you'll -- in the second half of this year, you'll see a bunch of demand that will dump into next year on stuff that requires planning."

I think next year, I mean, we still -- we put 75,000 rooms under construction last year. And most of that is not going to deliver this year. It's going to deliver in the next. And as I said, we're ramping on conversions. So I do think that 2022 could be lower than 2021, but not by the degree that you're suggesting.

So on the first, our published rates, you would say, if you average all our brands, is about 5.6% in license fees. We're about 5% right now in terms of effective rate, in terms of where people are in the cycle. We're not going to, anytime soon, be increasing those rates in an absolute sense. But by definition, every time a contract turns, it goes to the new rate. And I think -- I'm not saying anybody likes it, but that's sort of standard -- the standard within the industry. It's certainly what we've always done, and we'll continue to do that.
So you'll see that sort of grind up about 10, 15 basis points a year. And then when we get to the other side of this, depending on the economics and ultimate market share and all those things, obviously, we can look at what we do with our fee structures. But we're going to sort of keep -- we think that they are good where they are, and we'll keep our effective rates will keep grinding up as you have natural rollover.
On the CapEx side, it's really important. It's a delicate balance. The obvious one, which is you got to keep the portfolio. We have the market share leaders in every one of these categories. Part of that is obviously service, a part of it's product. And part of that product is about having fresh product, consistent and high-quality product. We're very religious about it. We have given a lot of relief. Thankfully, we went into the crisis in a really good position because we've been unbelievably diligent and disciplined, and our owner community over time has recognized that to get those premiums, they have to keep their assets up.
And so we went into the crisis a year ago in a good place. We have the ability, we think, to give them a bit of grace for a period of time and not have a significant impact with our customer base. But as we get to the other side of this, yes, we're going to have to get back to having that kind of discipline, which is not just in our interest, it's in our owner's interest if they want to continue to drive results.
I suspect that that's going to be next year and not this year, just in the sense that while I think the second half we're going to be in a very different world, we're going to have to let folks get back on their feet. And I think given, again, the quality of -- on average of our brands and the upkeep of the brands and the individual hotels going into this, I think we can do that without it being harmful."

As many of you know, I had the opportunity to work with Arne in a number of capacities throughout my career, including earlier on at Host. I think it's very fair to say he was an exceptional leader, but also an incredible person and a great friend. Our industry is better because of him, and I am a better professional and a better person because of him. On behalf of everyone at Hilton, [ Arne's ] family and the entire Marriott family are in our thoughts.
As we all know, this past year has presented unique challenges, including a pandemic that devastated lives, communities and businesses across the world, widespread economic declines and acts of social injustice. Due to the extraordinary levels of disruption, our industry experienced demand declines we've never seen before in our 101-year history.
Guided by our founding purpose, to make the world a better place through the light and warmth of hospitality, we acted quickly to ensure the safety and well-being of our people. We also took steps to protect our business by rightsizing our cost structure and enhancing our liquidity position while continuing to drive net unit growth and increase our network effect. As a result of these moves, we expect to recover from the pandemic as a stronger, higher-margin business that is even better positioned to deliver performance for our owners and strong free cash flow for our shareholders.
While it's certainly been a very difficult year, we're proud of everything we've accomplished, but we certainly could not have done it without the support of all of our stakeholders. For that, I'd like to extend a heartfelt thank you to all of our loyal customers, our important owner partners, our communities who supported us and enabled us to support them, our team members who gave their hearts and souls to our business and our shareholders who stood by us. Because of our amazing people, we've been able to lean on our award-winning culture, which earned the #1 Best Place to Work in the United States for the second consecutive year and the #3 World's Best Workplace to help get us through these trying times.
Turning to results. For the full year, system-wide RevPAR declined 57% with adjusted EBITDA down only modestly, more -- illustrating the resiliency of our fee-based model. We also demonstrated the strength of our brands and power of our customer-centric strategy by achieving market share gains across every region, even in a distressed business environment.
For the quarter, system-wide RevPAR declined 59%, relatively in line with our expectations. The positive momentum in demand that we saw through the summer and early fall was disrupted in November, December by rising COVID cases, tightening travel restrictions and further hotel suspensions, particularly in Europe. Similar to the third quarter, drive-to leisure travel drove an outsized portion of demand. Business transient and group trends showed modest sequential improvement versus the prior quarter, but overall demand remained quite muted.
As we look to the year ahead, we remain optimistic that accelerating vaccine distribution will lead to easing government restrictions and unlock pent-up travel demand. For the first quarter, overall trends so far appear to be similar to the fourth quarter with modest increases in demand in the U.S., offsetting stalled recoveries in Europe and Asia Pacific. We expect improving fundamentals heading into spring with essentially all system-wide rooms reopened by the end of the second quarter. We expect a more pronounced recovery in the back half of the year driven by increased leisure demand and meaningful rebounds in corporate transient and group business.
Over the last year, the personal savings rate in the United States has nearly doubled, increasing by more than $1.6 trillion to $2.9 trillion, with the potential to go even higher given additional stimulus. We expect this to drive greater leisure demand as travel restrictions ease and markets reopen to tourism. Additionally, conversations with our large corporate customers along with sequential upticks in business transient booking pace year-to-date indicate that there is pent-up demand for business travel that should drive a recovery in corporate transient trends as the year progresses.
On the group side, we saw a meaningful step-up in new group demand in January with our back half group position showing significant sequential improvement versus the first half of the year. With roughly 70% of bookings made within a week of travel, overall visibility remains limited. However, we continue to see signs of optimism. In fact, the vast majority of our large corporate accounts agreed to extend 2020 negotiated rates into this year.
Despite the challenges in 2020, we opened more than 400 hotels, totaling nearly 56,000 rooms and achieved net unit growth of 5.1%, slightly ahead of guidance. Fourth quarter openings were up nearly 30% year-over-year, largely driven by new development in China, where our focused service brands continue to command a disproportionate share of industry growth. We also celebrated our 1,000,000th room milestone and the openings of our 300th hotel in China, our 600th DoubleTree hotel and our 900th Hilton Garden Inn. We ended up the year with 397,000 rooms in our development pipeline, up 3% year-over-year. While market disruption weighed on new development signings, conversion signings increased more than 30% versus the prior year.
As owners look to benefit from the strength of our network, we anticipate continued positive momentum and conversion activity, particularly through DoubleTree and our Collection brands. During the  quarter, we signed agreements to expand our Curio Collection in Mexico and bring our Tapestry Collection to Portugal. This marks one of several new Tapestry hotels scheduled to open across Europe this year. We also announced plans to debut LXR in the Seychelles with Mango House Seychelles. The property will deliver a truly unique hospitality experience with spacious guest rooms and suites and 5 world-class food and beverage venues. Scheduled to open in the coming months, the hotel underscores our commitment to further expanding our resort portfolio.
Building on that momentum, we kicked off 2021 with an agreement to bring LXR to Bali. Additionally, we celebrated the openings of Oceana Santa Monica, which marked LXR's U.S. debut as well as the Waldorf Astoria, Monarch Beach Resort and the Hilton Vancouver Downtown, which was converted from a competitor brand. With these notable openings and many exciting development opportunities in front of us, we are confident in our ability to continue delivering solid growth over the next several years.
The pandemic rapidly changed guest behaviors, priorities and concerns. We listened to our customers and moved quickly to launch modifications to our Honors loyalty program, deliver industry-leading standards of cleanliness and hygiene with Hilton CleanStay and provide flexible, distraction-free environments for remote work with WorkSpaces by Hilton. Additionally, with an even stronger focus on recovery, last month, we implemented Hilton EventReady Hybrid Solutions, an expanded set of resources to help event planners address the dramatic shift towards hybrid meetings as group business rebounds.
Our flexibility and innovation drove continued growth in our Honors network, ending the year with more than 112 million members who accounted for approximately 60% of system-wide occupancy.
Throughout 2020, we also remained focused on our corporate responsibility and our commitment to our ESG initiatives. We're proud to contribute to our communities, and we're honored to be named the global industry leader in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the second year in a row.
In a year marked by challenge and change, we effectively executed our crisis response strategy, carefully managed key stakeholder relationships and continued to press forward on strategic opportunities. I'm confident that there are brighter days ahead and that we are in a stronger, more resilient -- and we are better positioned than ever before.
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Kevin for a few more details on the fourth quarter and the full year."

During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR declined 59.2% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis as the pandemic continued to disrupt the demand environment. Relative to the third quarter, occupancy was modestly lower, partially due to seasonality and further tempered by rising COVID cases and associated travel restrictions.
Adjusted EBITDA was $204 million in the fourth quarter, down 65% year-over-year. Results reflected the continued impact of the pandemic on global travel demand, including temporary suspensions at some of our hotels during the quarter. Management and franchise fees decreased 50%, less than RevPAR decreased, as franchise fee declines were somewhat mitigated by better-than-expected Honors license fees and development fees.
Overall, revenue declines were mitigated by continued cost control at both the corporate and property levels. For the full year, our corporate G&A expenses were down nearly 30% year-over-year at the high end of our expectations.
Our ownership portfolio posted a loss for the quarter due to the challenging demand environment, temporary closures in Europe and fixed operating costs, including fixed rent payments at some of our leased properties. Continued cost control measures, coupled with onetime items mitigated segment losses. For the fourth -- for the quarter, diluted loss per share adjusted for special items was $0.10.
Turning to our balance sheet. We continued to enhance our liquidity position and preserve our financial flexibility. Over the last few months, we opportunistically refinanced $3.4 billion of senior notes to extend our maturities at lower rates. In January, we also repaid $250 million of the outstanding balance under our $1.75 billion revolving credit facility. On a pro forma basis, taking these transactions into effect as of year-end 2020, we've lowered our weighted average cost of debt to 3.6% and extended our weighted average maturity to 7.2 years. We have no major debt maturities until 2024 and maintain a well-staggered maturity ladder thereafter.
Further details on our fourth quarter and full year can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning.
This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. [Operator Instructions] Chad, can we have our first question, please?"

And so a lot to unpack there. But I think, Joe, when you go out -- and obviously, you could debate this and I've debated it ad nauseam with a lot of people. I think if you go out 3 years, whatever, 3 or 4 years, I think demand",1179,"Yes, it's a great question. And so a lot to unpack there. But I think, Joe, when you go out -- and obviously, you could debate this and I've debated it ad nauseam with a lot of people. I think if you go out 3 years, whatever, 3 or 4 years, I think demand is going to look a lot like it did in '17, '18 and '19. And meaning the makeup of the business heads between business transient, leisure transient and group at that point in time, I think, will look quite similar.
Now certain of the types of -- if you get underneath the demand, particularly in business transient and the group side might be for different reasons than then. I mean there'll be a substitution effect, clearly, and certain types of travel being substituted with sort of the new -- the Zoom calls and digital opportunities. But they'll be replaced with other forms of travel. And we've seen this throughout history. I mean if you go back -- and I wasn't really around, but the telephone and the Internet and telepresence and voice mail. There were always the arguments that this is going to truncate the need to travel and congregate.
And the reality is what it typically does is it accelerates it, right, because it just gives more efficiency. It speeds -- it ultimately speeds things up. It ultimately continues to connect the world and speed up globalization. And as a result, people need to congregate. They need to travel. They need to build relationships. They need to build cultures. They need to innovate. And those things really cannot be done as well without face-to-face opportunities, both in a group setting as well as individual business travel type needs. And so I -- having done it longer than I'd like to admit, 35, 40 years, I -- we've been debating this. I don't -- again, I think there'll be some substitution effect. But I think it will look a lot like it did.
And then our business, a couple of comments since you asked, our business is going to be a better business and a stronger business and a faster growing, higher-margin business. Why? Because, listen, throughout the next 3 years, we're going to continue to grow 4% or 5% unit growth. So we're going to be a bigger company. The units that we had pre-COVID, if you believe what I believe, which is you'll have similar demand levels, we'll be producing like they were.
You'll have all these new units that are then going to also be producing and you have a lower cost structure, because we've taken a significant amount of cost out on a cash basis. Sort of if you look at on a run rate in this year, sort of on a cash basis in the mid-teens, something like that, maybe a little bit better. And we're going to be incredibly disciplined as we always have been. I think we've been on a G&A basis, at the low end of spending in the industry, but we got even better last year. And that's going to -- when you put all the same flows of fees through the system with more units and a lower cost structure, it's simple math. It's a higher-margin business.
And so I know it's sort of an odd time to be pounding the table with optimism, and so I probably shouldn't. But as we sit around this table, I'm at our Board table and we talk about it, it's been a hard year, the hardest any of us have ever endured. But as a result of it, we put ourselves in about the best position we could have. And honestly, I think the business is going to be better for it. And I think it's going to produce higher margins and more free cash flow, which we're going to be -- which is going to allow us to return even more capital than we were pre-COVID to our shareholders, which we think over the very long term is going to drive incredible returns.
The last point was on limited service, full service. And I'm not -- I'm covering a lot of territory, I know, but you asked these things. And I think it's an important note because it's something I talked a lot about pre-COVID that, frankly, I don't think got enough attention, which is the mega trend in our -- in the industry in every market in the world, there is not an exception, is the mid-market, right? That's -- why is that? Because that's where the bulk of the population is. That's where the bulk of the population growth is, particularly in the emerging markets. And so what can those people afford, mid-market brands. I would say, I know I'm sort of padding us now. We have the best mid-market brands in the world. I mean it's being proven out in the growth of those brands in -- both in the U.S., but outside the U.S., outstripping the competition in Europe, outstripping the competition in Asia Pacific, particularly China.
And that's not by luck. We've been very purposeful over the last 10 years in making sure that we take the best brands here, and we adapt those and refine those from a product and service point of view. We picked great development partners, like we've done in China, to make sure that these are adapted to those environments, what the customers want, what the development community, in those environments, in those regions want that it has allowed us to show really strong growth and continue to.
So the mega trend, which was before COVID, and I would say as a result of the economic distress that this has caused, only gets sort of accentuated in a post-COVID world is the mid-market. And I feel really, really good about the work that we've done to put ourselves in a good position. And I think it's showing up in the numbers of our unit growth, right, because the bulk of that unit -- I mean, we have lots of great things going on in luxury. We're making tremendous progress there. Lots of great things going on in the upper upscale and all that.
But the bulk of -- you see, particularly in this environment, the bulk of the growth all over the world is really coming in limited service. And I've been saying it for years. If you wake up in 20 years and you look back and say, where was the bulk of the growth in demand and thus, the bulk of the growth in rooms, it's going to be in the mid-market. And that's why we've been focused on everything, but so intensely focused on that because in the end, that's what's going to drive  higher growth rate. That is what -- having the best brands in that space that we adapt to the local market conditions is what's going to deliver alpha for us, the real alpha, over the next 10 or 20 years."

So I'll answer what I think I heard, and if I miss something, come back and remind me. So in terms of NUG, we feel the same way we have felt over the last couple of quarters. We obviously delivered a little bit better at 5.1%, because we had a huge fourth quarter in terms of deliveries. But we've said over the next few years, we think we'll deliver 4% to 5%. And I still feel really good about that. I think this year, it will probably be more the midpoint to the high end of that, similar to last year. But I think over the next few years, we feel comfortable with that.
And in part, leading to what I heard is the second part of your question, is success that we're having on the conversion side. We've always been focused on conversions and in downturns, as everybody knows, that's very fertile ground. Over the past 5 or 6 years, we've gone from having essentially 1 conversion brand, really that was the big engine, which was DoubleTree, to now having 4 between our 3 soft brands and DoubleTree, all of which are producing for us and I think will continue to escalate.
I mentioned in my prepared comments, our signings for conversions were up 30% last year. Our starts, which I did not mention, probably should have, were up 40%. And our fourth quarter, our opens, we're up about 44%. So what you see happening is sort of natural, like it takes a little bit of time to ramp. You're right. We were circa 20% of overall NUG and conversions that was up 300 or 400 basis points versus the prior year. And I think what you'll see over the next few years is that will become a larger and larger component of overall NUG.
How high will it go, which maybe would be the next question, so I'll answer it. Unclear. I mean we -- in the Great Recession, it went into the 40s. I don't think it will go that high because I honestly think we have so many other engines firing, particularly in China with all of our limited service growth as compared to the Great Recession, that I don't think it will go that higher. But I think it could clearly go into the upper 20s, low 30s over the next few years.
And so we have tremendous amount of focus on it, as you would guess, and the development teams are aligned around those goals. And I think you are starting to see, with some of the numbers that I described, the natural ramp-up in that and very, very good progress there. So I think things are coming along really nicely.

And so how can that trend going forward? I think, look, overall, wages and benefits have been growing in excess of core inflation. Over time, that's probably not going to trend. But we've -- look, we're adding no new heads in the business this year. And so we think for several years, we're going to remain disciplined as we always have, and there's no reason to think that we can't grow cash overhead at sort of slightly ahead of inflation -- slightly more than inflation, because that's probably what wages and benefits wants to grow over the next few years. And there's nothing that we see in the future that says we can't continue to get back to scaling the business without having step changes in growth in overhead."

I can give you -- I'll give you what I do have. I mean I talked about in my prepared comments, David, the leisure side, and I think we all -- I think we can all kind of stipulate that people want to get out of their basements and they want to travel. And while people have been starting to do that, not that many have. And certainly, the higher-end leisure business has not really been out and about.
And so I think as you get through what is going to be a mass vaccination period of time over the next 90 days, I think when you get to late spring and summer, everything I'm hearing, talking to the Biden administration, which you're now reading in the papers, too, but we're having pretty direct conversations. I think maybe even sooner, I think -- the President said last night, I heard that by the end of July, every American will be able to be vaccinated. My own belief based -- if you look at the manufacturing curve and expectation of J&J getting approved, probably by the end of this month that, that could be much -- that could be sooner than the middle of the summer.
So I think once you get there, I think people have a lot of savings, even though they've been buying stuff like crazy as we know because a lot of the retail and car business and homes and all that have been doing well. They want to get out. They want to get out more than ever, talk to anybody, talk to any of your friends and you get the answer. And so I think the trend line there will be quite good when you get a bit of the all-clear sign, which I think will be -- hopefully, by spring, certainly no worse than summer.
On the business transient, there are data points. I mean what -- but a lot of it is admittedly anecdotal in the sense of just discussions that we're having with our big customers and trends that we're seeing. As we're having discussions with our customers, as we've been renegotiating all of our corporate negotiated accounts. I mean, clearly, there is massive pent-up demand.
I mean they may -- by the way, they're -- obviously, in businesses that are hurting, they're going to have cutbacks for maybe their run rate numbers of '18 and '19. But the reality is they just -- in the short term, they have so many things that they need to do when you talk to them about collecting their people, innovation, just team meetings, getting out with clients and customers and the like that it's just -- it's been over a year. By the time they're out a little bit, 15 months, and forget the fact they want to see people, they need to see people.
And so you're starting to see that even though we're in the -- you see the infection rate coming down. I mean we're still not through the crisis, for sure. And you're starting to see it in the booking trends. I mean the business transient trends are clearly sort of, week by week, are marching up even in the middle of all this, even though we don't have the all -- an all-clear sign.
So not tons of data other than what real booking data suggests short term, it's moving in the right direction, but lots of conversations with customers are saying that. And lots of surveying that we're doing is suggesting like it was -- that people are more interested in travel for leisure and business. As our polling goes, like over 80% of them say they got to get back out on the road, which is the highest number, obviously, we've seen since this mess began. So that's good.
On the group side, that's going to take longer, but the trend lines are good. If you look at like our lead volume, sort of fourth quarter versus January, January was up 35%. If you look at it, January versus December, it was up 50%. I'd give you the quarter because normally, January would step up from December because of the holidays. So I want to - I think a better number would probably be sort of the average over the whole fourth quarter. But that's up by more than 1/3.
A stat that I - as I go through with the team that I thought was very encouraging on the group side was that our first half position for 2021 versus '19. So let's forget '20, because it was a washout. I mean the comparability is not relevant. If you look at it versus a stabilized year of '19, first half position on the group side system-wide is down 80%. The second half of the year versus the second half of '19 is down by 32%.
So again, it's still off, but by a lot lesser margin. And that's a result of people saying, I got to get out. I want to get out. I want to -- I got to have team meetings. I got to have small group, medium-sized group. Conventions are starting to book again because they're going to go out of business if they don't get booking again. With an expectation, obviously, by the time you get to the second half of the year, that it's safe, and they can do it from a health point of view. And so we need this -- my belief is we will get there, but we need this vaccination effort between now and June, July to really ramp up. And it feels like, day by day, that's happening. So that's a little bit of color.
Obviously, we got to play out the next few months and have the right things fall into place. But I think there's a real opportunity for the -- I said this publicly, I think on Bloomberg or somewhere, but I do think there's a great opportunity for the second half of the year to be better than any of us think. Because when -- it's like everything. When you're at the top of the cycle, you always think everything is going to stay good forever, and it's a new norm. And when you're looking from the bottom, the depths of doom, you're sort of trend lining off a lot of negativity. And eventually, this thing is going to flip and people want to get out, no matter what anybody says, they want to travel. And when the all-clear sign is sort of given, which is the light at the end of the tunnel and I think coming soon, I think there's a huge amount of pent-up demand. And I think we could all like what we see in the second half of the year."

So -- and it's really -- the bleisure part of it is small businesses that really don't have the choice but to travel to keep their businesses going, and they are sort of mixing it with leisure opportunities because they have more mobility. In a sense, they're not locked into -- their kids aren't locked into necessarily being in schools and they're not locked into being in an office. So all of our efforts across what we're doing with Honors, what we're doing with promotions, what we're doing with our marketing spend have been focused on that.
Now that's all going to obviously shift. If all goes well and I'm right, you'll -- and we're obviously working on the plans to not go immediately back to where we were, but to start to migrate back to sort of a more normal approach as demand patterns become more normalized."

In the fourth quarter, I would say -- I don't have all the data in front of me, but I would say anecdotally from lots of conversations with our Asia Pac and our China team, it was very rapidly sort of approaching normalcy, meaning we weren't fully back with -- there was still a little bit heavier leisure component, but there always is in China, by the way. I mean it's a heavier leisure market broadly. But we weren't too terribly far off of our business transient and our group trends, but it was following the same pattern I would expect here.
Leisure leads, business transient is a close second. And the groups just because they're, by nature of group business, it's a little bit longer lead time, there's a little bit more planning, was lagging a bit. But they -- China, we were running like 10 points off, something like that. So we were getting -- before they backed up, we were getting to, I think, very normalized levels of demand. We were not seeing any material, as far as we could tell, with the data we had, any sort of substitution effect. Reality is China was sort of going back to the normal trends that it had very rapidly before COVID.
And so I think, well, China is different in lots of ways. I think humans are humans. And I think that's why my belief is that as we sort of come out of this, leisure will lead business streams, it will be a fast follow. Group will take a little bit longer to develop because of the lead times. But the demand patterns will, over a couple of years, return and look a lot like they did pre-COVID."

And broadly, I think many, including me, are supportive over time that the minimum wage needs to move up. But as I've said to a number of people in the administration time and place, sort of how you do it and when you do it matters. And so I think the likely outcome is -- I don't know that it will end up in this first bill. I do think that they're -- I think that is probably not highly likely based on what I'm hearing, possible but not highly likely. But it will not be an issue that goes away.
And I think that the how and the when then become important. And so how being that, first of all, even in what's being proposed now, it's not all to $15. It's staged in over basically 5 years. And so I think that creates a ramp that allows people to adjust and create -- we're obviously working with our owners on creating even more efficiencies. So it's not like overnight you go across the country to $15. By the way, there are a whole bunch of markets that are already $15, and so they've been dealing with it.
I would also like to think that if people really spend the time figuring out that not every market is the same, that living in Poughkeepsie is not the same as living in New York City and that these can be indexed. And then when do you start to sort of move it up, I think, is a big issue. My personal worry and concern is the hospitality industry has been more impacted from a jobs point of view than any industry in the country. And it's the slowest in recovery in terms of bringing jobs back. And I don't think raising the minimum wage, no matter how you look at the analysis, is going to help. I think it will slow the rehiring of people in the industry.
And so I am hopeful that in the end that people will be rational. Rational thinking will prevail. And as a result, this will not be a major issue, certainly in the short to intermediate term. I think we should all assume that the minimum wage is going to be going up over time, in fact, because it needs to. But again, I think it's -- I'm hopeful that it will be done in a staged way. And there'll be other mechanisms built into the timing and the geographical approach that will make it make sense on all sides. So the short -- that's the long answer, Bill. The short answer is I don't think, in the short to intermediate term, there's any meaningful impact as a result of it."

So they're going to -- when we get out of the crisis, those businesses will be higher margin and require less labor than they did pre-COVID.

A good question and one we certainly -- we get frequently. I don't think my view's changed at all.

A good question and one we certainly -- we get frequently. I don't think my view's changed at all. I mean, I think I've been saying for 13 years, since we bought nothing, we've gone from a family of 9 brands to 18 brands. So we've doubled it in the time I've been here and we haven't bought one of them. We've organically developed every single one of them. So for my entire time here, I've been saying, never say never, right? You've heard my speech. If it passes all the right filters, we'd consider it, but nothing has, and so I think not necessarily the path is indicative of the future, but it sort of tells you our predisposition.
And so I would say, never say never. But the filter is a very tight filtration system, which is we think we got the best brand portfolio in the business. We think that is -- that can be proven scientifically by the fact that every one of our brands is a market share leader. Every one that we've developed, we think, is purpose-built around exactly what customers want, and we like that. And so anything that we would look to acquire would have to sort of meet that profile, like we don't want to go backwards because we don't have to. We have pretty much every category covered. If something is not covered, we could launch it. I don't think you'll see us launch a whole lot of new brands in the short term.
But why would we do that? We have all the segments generally covered that we want to cover. We have the best brands. Why would we pick up something that wasn't superb in the same way that we then have to be distracted trying to fix and that we paid a lot of money for, which leads me to the next filter, which is economics. If you do the simple math, we're developing these brands for nothing, not to make it -- and so we have an infinite yield every time we do it. Every time we do a Tru or a Home2 and these things become mega brands, they become billion -- multibillion-dollar businesses over time. It's an infinite return because we've effectively invested just sweat equity, so something, but not much. So when we look at buying stuff, we haven't found anything that was perfect, that doesn't require a lot of elbow grease, and you're paying a lot of money for it. So we just -- again, never say never. But that's sort of how we think about it.
Now your comment -- your question also implied like region -- sort of regional process. That's where maybe -- I hate to say this and have it become a headline, because I think the likelihood is we're not going to do that. But there are sort of smaller regional brands and places where maybe we want a stronger foothold that aren't -- that don't show up a whole lot in the radar, but for what they are, are very, very good. And so we've looked at a bunch of those over time. And we'll continue to do that. The net result has been, while we've looked at a bunch of them, we haven't done any.
And again, I would say -- I would condition everybody to say, we like what we got. We think we got the -- no offense to our competitors, we think we have the best setup for the future in the industry. And the last thing we want to do is botch it by either bringing brands that, like my father used to say, you hang with the dogs, you get the fleas. We don't want to bring stuff in that messes up the portfolio. And we're intensely focused on good capital allocation. I was -- those are my origins in business, being a good capital allocator. And so when you put it together, I think, not high likelihood, but never impossible."

And as a result, more pricing power than people think just because you -- people have accumulated all sorts of needs that are going to get released, and it takes time to plan.

So on the first, our published rates, you would say, if you average all our brands, is about 5.6% in license fees. We're about 5% right now in terms of effective rate, in terms of where people are in the cycle. We're not going to, anytime soon, be increasing those rates in an absolute sense. But by definition, every time a contract turns, it goes to the new rate. And I think -- I'm not saying anybody likes it, but that's sort of standard -- the standard within the industry. It's certainly what we've always done, and we'll continue to do that.
So you'll see that sort of grind up about 10, 15 basis points a year. And then when we get to the other side of this, depending on the economics and ultimate market share and all those things, obviously, we can look at what we do with our fee structures. But we're going to sort of keep -- we think that they are good where they are, and we'll keep -- our effective rates will keep grinding up as you have natural rollover.
On the CapEx side, it's really important. It's a delicate balance. The obvious one, which is you got to keep the portfolio. We have the market share leaders in every one of these categories. Part of that is obviously service, a part of it's product. And part of that product is about having fresh product, consistent and high-quality product. We're very religious about it. We have given a lot of relief. Thankfully, we went into the crisis in a really good position because we've been unbelievably diligent and disciplined, and our owner community over time has recognized that to get those premiums, they have to keep their assets up.
And so we went into the crisis a year ago in a good place. We have the ability, we think, to give them a bit of grace for a period of time and not have a significant impact with our customer base. But as we get to the other side of this, yes, we're going to have to get back to having that kind of discipline, which is not just in our interest, it's in our owners' interest if they want to continue to drive results.
I suspect that that's going to be next year and not this year, just in the sense that while I think the second half we're going to be in a very different world, we're going to have to let folks get back on their feet. And I think given, again, the quality of -- on average of our brands and the upkeep of the brands and the individual hotels going into this, I think we can do that without it being harmful."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. It has been a little over a year since the pandemic started. Over that time, we acted swiftly to address the challenges we face, so we could quickly turn our focus to best positioning ourselves towards recovery and beyond. I'm really proud of how we've set up the company for the future. And most importantly, I'm grateful to our team members who have continued to lead with hospitality and to all of our stakeholders for their ongoing support. 
In the first quarter, system-wide RevPAR decreased 38% year-over-year and 53% versus 2019. Rising COVID cases and tightening travel restrictions, particularly across Europe and Asia Pacific weighed on demand through January and most of February. March marked a turning point as we lap the start of the U.S. lockdowns, RevPAR turned positive up more than 23% year-over-year. System-wide occupancy reached 55% by the end of the month driven by strong leisure demand. As expected, recovery in group and corporate transient continued to lag, but both segments showed sequential improvement versus the fourth quarter. 
Overall, this positive momentum has continued into the second quarter. While recovery varies by region and country, we can see the light at the end of the tunnel. In the U.S., more than 50% of adults have received at least 1 dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. As a result, we're seeing a significant lift in forward bookings and occupancy, which is now around 60% as well as lengthening booking windows. This mirrors trends in other countries around the work, for instance, China is running in the low 70s occupancy. We do expect this momentum to continue . Vaccine distribution, coupled with relaxed travel restrictions and increasing consumer confidence should drive further RevPAR improvements in the coming months and quarters. In fact, we are on pace to see record leisure demand in the U.S. over the summer months with April bookings for the summer exceeding 2019 peak levels by nearly 10%. We also expect continued corporate office reopenings to drive a meaningful pickup in business transient demand towards the back half of the year. 
Based on what we've seen in China and pockets of the U.S., once restrictions are lifted and offices reopen business travel returns. In the first quarter, business transient revenue was roughly 75% of 2019 levels in states that were further along in their reopening process. 
Additionally, recent forecast for nonresidential fixed investment are up more than 3 percentage points from prior projections to 7.8%, indicating even greater optimism around business spending. 
On the group side, forward booking activity continues to improve month-over-month Group bookings made in the first quarter for the back half of the year were roughly flat with 2019 booking activity, suggesting customers are increasingly optimistic about safety measures and loosening pandemic restrictions. Near-term group bookings continue to be driven largely by social events and smaller meetings, but we are seeing a slow shift back to a more normal mix of business with corporate group leads up more than 70% for future periods. 
Associations and trade shows have also started opening up housing and registration sites for events later this year. Further signs of moving forward with in-person group meetings. 
As we look out to next year, our group position is roughly 85% of peak 2019 levels with rate increases versus 2019. Group bookings were up in the mid-teens for 2023 versus 2019. In fact, last week, I was in Mexico to Chair the World Travel and Tourism Council's Global Summit where more than 800 participants from all over the world attended in person and thousands more attended virtually. The conference demonstrated that it is possible to meet in a safe way and the hybrid events can be incredibly effective at expanding participation and enhancing collaboration. It was great to be in the same room with other hospitality and government leaders talking about the bright future that lies in our industry. The event made me even more optimistic for our recovery and confident that we are beginning to see a new era of travel emerge. 
Turning to development. During the quarter, we added 105 hotels totaling more than 16,500 rooms to our system and achieved net unit growth of 5.8%. We celebrated the openings of our 100th Curio and our 50th Tapestry hotel demonstrating the strength of our conversion friendly brands. Overall conversions accounted for approximately 24% of additions in the quarter. 
We also continued to enhance our resort footprint during the quarter with the openings of the 1,500 room Virgin Hotel in Las Vegas, the Hilton Abu Dhabi Yas land, the all-inclusive Yucatan resort Playa del Carmen and 6 spectacular properties along the California Coast, customers have even more opportunities to stay with us as travel resumes. Building on our already impressive portfolio in the world's most desirable locations. 
During the quarter, we signed agreements to bring our Waldorf Astoria and Canopy brands to the Seychelles. The properties are scheduled to open in 2023, joining the Mango House Seychelles LXR Hotel and Resorts set to open later this summer. 
In the quarter, we signed nearly 22,000 rooms modestly ahead of our expectations. This included our first Signia hotel. Additionally, through our strategic partnership with Country Garden to introduce the Home2 Suites brand in China, we added more than 5,000 rooms to our pipeline. We're excited for the opportunities this partnership provides with one of our fastest-growing brands. 
Home2 recently celebrated its tenth anniversary, marking the milestone with nearly 1,000 rooms hotels open and in the pipeline. On Entrepreneur Magazine's Annual Franchise 500 list, which featured 11 of our 18 brands, Home2 was the #2 hotel brand ranking only behind Hampton. 
Overall, we are very happy with our development progress and excited for additional growth opportunities with more than half of our 399,000 root pipeline under construction, We're confident in our ability to grow net units in the mid-single-digit range for the next several years and continue to expect growth in the 4.5% to 5% range in 2021. 
And in an environment where safety and cleanliness are top priorities for travelers, we continue to create more opportunities for our guests to enjoy a contactless experience from pre-arrival to post checkout. Our digital key feature, which enables guests to bypass the front desk and go straight to the rooms is now available in the vast majority of our hotels worldwide. 
Additionally, we've joined forces with Lyft to mobilize Honors members to contribute to the Lyft vaccine access initiative, which funds rises for those in need of reliable transportation to their vaccine appointment. We're excited to continue the momentum of our partnership with Lyft by supporting this important cause. 
During the quarter, we also launched 2 new co-branded credit cards in Japan building on our 25-year partnership with American Express and marking the first time our co-branded cards have been made available to customers outside the United States. These cards are designed with both frequent and occasional tollers in mind and offer customers the opportunity to earn the Hilton Honors bonus points on everyday spending as well as at our properties worldwide. 
As a result of our strong partnerships, industry-leading brands, and unmatched value proposition, our loyalty program continues attracting new members. We ended the first quarter with more than 115 million Honors members, up roughly 8% year-over-year with membership increasing across every major region despite lower demand due to the pandemic. 
As I reflect on the quarter and the past year, I'm very proud of the determination creativity and hospitality that our Hilton team members have demonstrated. This earned us recognition by Fortune and Great Place to Work as the #1 Best Big Company to Work For and #3 Best Company to Work For in the United States. 
Overall, I'm pleased with our first quarter results and feel very good about the momentum for the remainder of the year. I'm optimistic for the future of travel and for Hilton as we emerge stronger and better positioned continuing to drive value for our guests, our owners, our communities and, of course, our shareholders. 
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Kevin to give more details on our results for the quarter."

During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR declined 38.4% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis as rising COVID cases and reinstated travel restrictions and lockdowns disrupted the demand environment, especially across Europe and Asia Pacific. However, occupancy improved sequentially throughout the quarter, increasing more than 20 points. Adjusted EBITDA was $198 million in the first quarter, down 45% year-over-year. Results reflected the continued impact of the pandemic on global travel demand, including temporary suspensions at some of our hotels during the quarter. Management and franchise fees decreased 34%, less than RevPAR decrease as franchise fee declines were somewhat mitigated by better-than-expected license fees and development fees. 
Additionally, results were helped by continued cost control at both the corporate and property levels. Our ownership portfolio posted a loss for the quarter due to the challenged demand environment. Reinstated lockdowns and travel restrictions in Europe and Japan, coupled with temporary hotel closures and fixed operating costs, including fixed rent payments at some of our leased properties weighed on our performance. Continued cost control mitigated segment losses. 
For the quarter, diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $0.02. 
Turning to our regional performance. First quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR declined nearly 37% year-over-year and 50% versus 2019. Demand improved sequentially throughout the quarter with March occupancy 62% higher than January and ending at 55%. The highest level since the pandemic began. Leisure travel continued to lead the recovery, particularly on weekends with warm weather destinations benefiting the most. 
In the Americas outside the U.S., first quarter RevPAR declined 55% year-over-year and 63% versus 2019. Performance recovered in March, but lagged the broader system due to the region's greater dependence on international travel, which remain constrained by tightened travel restrictions. 
In Europe, RevPAR fell 76% year-over-year and 82% versus 2019. Declines were driven by increasing COVID cases and reinstated lockdowns across both the United Kingdom and Continental Europe. Delays in vaccination distribution also disrupted recovery. 
In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR was down 32% year-over-year and 46% versus 2019. Performance in the region benefited from strong domestic demand and easing restrictions. In the Asia Pacific region, first quarter RevPAR fell 7% year-over-year and 49% versus 2019 as rising infections, lockdowns and border closures weighed on performance early in the quarter. RevPAR in China increased 64% year-over-year with occupancy levels increasing from roughly 35% to roughly 65% during the quarter. 
Both leisure and business transient demand rebounded quickly as restrictions eased with March occupancy in China exceeding 2019 levels. 
Turning to development. As Chris mentioned, in the first quarter, we grew net units 5.8% driven primarily by the Americas and Asia Pacific. Tightening restrictions and lockdowns across Europe delayed openings in the region. However, we expect an uptick in development activity as countries continue to reopen. 
For the full year, we continue to expect net unit growth of 4.5% to 5%. Signings in the quarter decreased year-over-year due to pre-pandemic comparisons, but exceeded our expectations due to greater-than-expected signings in China, particularly for our Home2 Suites brand. For the year, we expect signings to increase mid-single digits versus 2020. 
Turning to the balance sheet. During the quarter, we took steps to further enhance our liquidity position and preserve financial flexibility. We repaid $500 million of the outstanding balance under our $1.75 billion revolving credit facility and opportunistically executed a favorable debt refinancing transaction to extend our maturities at lower rates. As we look ahead, we remain confident in our balance sheet and liquidity positions as we continue to focus on recovery. Further details on our first quarter can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning.

Maybe Kevin will throw some things in and we'll save a little bit maybe for later because I'm sure others have similar questions. But thank you, and I do think that is the question. Obviously, as both Kevin and I covered, Carlo, we saw a pretty marked improvement as we march through the quarter, and that continued into April. In terms of the global data, I think the best way to look at it is against a '19 comparison because looking at it against 2020, particularly right now as you are in the early stages of the pandemic is relatively useless. And so if you look at January and February, you were globally. And the U.S. was similar. If you look at it, You were sort of in the 55% to 60% down from a RevPAR point of view. And you picked up about 10 points going down into sort of the mid 40s down in March. And then in April, we -- you had another step-up in you into the low 40s. Obviously, May, it's a little early to say, but I would say the trajectory in our mind, continues as we look at forward bookings, both then the leisure transient side, which is what's going to dominate the second quarter, It feels like we're going to continue marching on. 
If you look at it by segments, which I obviously have spent a lot of time, and this will sort of get to some of our views on business transient and the group side. If you look at -- you break down room nights by segments relative to 2019, again, I'm focusing on room nights to sort of take rate for the moment out of it. Leisure in the first quarter was already close to 90% of '19. By the way, for what it's worth, much lower based on lower rated business, but just again, room nights. And business was about 50% in the first quarter. Again, lower if you look at it on a RevPAR basis. And group was about 35% to 40%. 
As you march through our expectations for the year, our belief is globally and every region will be a little bit different. I'll save a regional question for somebody else because I don't want to do too much of a filibuster on 1 question. But If you march through the year, my expectation is you're going to have an incredibly robust leisure-driven summer. So we're going to continue to see good progress. We believe the summer will be meaningfully over 2019 peak levels of leisure demand. As we get into the fall and every day, you're reading the same things that I'm reading, but I'm also, as I'm sure you are talking to a lot of CEOs of large companies that we deal with or that are friends of mine. And I think clearly, as you get into the summer, many people are starting to bring folks back in the office, certainly, as you get into the fall, all things sort of being equal in terms of trajectory vaccination. Most businesses are going to be bringing folks back, maybe not fully -- probably not fully, but on some flexible basis, but a whole lot different than what we've been experiencing. We do believe that -- and we do see it both in China, as I said in my prepared comments, we do see it in parts of the United States where restrictions have been lifted earlier. I mentioned in my prepared comments, business travel volumes already 75% of what they were in '19 in those markets. So I think it is -- even though not fully through it, not fully open anywhere, I think it is really good evidence that as people get back to work, as kids in the fall go back to school, which at this point, I think, is very highly likely, you're going to see a step change into the third and fourth quarter in business transient. 
I also see it in our booking pace on the group side that you will see a pretty good step change In the group side, I gave you some stats, so I won't repeat them. At the moment, it is more SMERF kind of related business and small meetings in the second half of this year with the bigger meetings really some happening, but really those getting booked more into next year at a high volume. But we do believe that we will have a lot of realized group business, a lot more of it than we've been experiencing in the second half of the year. 
So if you sort of jump to the fourth quarter, recognizing Q2 is going to be largely leisure. Q3 is going to sort of be a transition. On a room night basis, our forecasting which is all it is, but it's based on a lot of data to sort of the current trajectory that we're on. We think room nights and leisure will be at '19 levels. We don't think rate will be back to '19 levels. So sort of RevPAR levels in the leisure, sort of in the 80, low 80s sort of percent. We think business transient, by the time you get to the fourth quarter based on what we're seeing in markets that are recovering on a room night basis, we'll be about 70%-ish. I'm being reasonably precise obviously, but these are sort of our sense of estimates. And obviously, lower than that, on a RevPAR basis because we're still not going to have the -- all the highest-rated business travel back. That's why it takes time to sort of get back to '19 levels. And we think group from a volume point of view, could be could be halfway back to '19 levels. Again, it won't be the highest rated groups. Those will start coming next year when we get to a place where we have the larger groups, association et cetera, that are typically are paying. So that's sort of -- that's how we think the year is going to play out. We think that as a result, RevPAR levels every sort of month as we go versus '19 are going to get better. By the time we end the year, I think we could be back somewhere around 70% or something -ish of '19 levels on a run rate basis, which isn't all the way home. But it's a heck of a lot better than where we were. And what I would say, not to be [ poly-ish ] about it. What I would say is the recovery of late, certainly, since we had our last call, the recovery -- the slope of the recovery has been steeper than what we would have thought. In all regards, a lot of it is to come on the business transient, although we're seeing some, as I described, it's not like we have none, and we're seeing a pretty decent uptick. But that is sort of a fall expectation. But I would say broadly, as you can probably tell from my comments, there's a bunch of data to support it. We think the slope of the recovery has steepened since the last time we talked. And thus, our reason for optimism that things are on a good path. 
You asked about fee generation that will follow. I don't think there's a whole lot more to say that as the business recovers. So go our fees, we get -- that's how we get paid. And I do think sort of built into my expectations that I gave is sort of my view and our view of pent-up demand. I think there's a huge amount of pent-up demand. And my guess is every single person that you guys talk to, whether they run a business, whether you talk to them, they're friendlier. you see him on the beach or wherever you are that they're talking about needing to and wanting to get out both for leisure, but increasingly needing to and wanting to to get out for business and the congregating groups. There are a lot of important work that gets done in these in these group settings that I think after a while, people realized that it's not possible to keep going without it. So I do think there's a -- I think we're on a real -- on a very good slope. We need the vaccination trends and the infection rates and all of the fun stuff that we're all looking at every minute of every day because that's all the media is covering obviously. We need all that to progress. But our view is we're on a solid -- a very solid road to recovery. Did I get most of what you want? I left a few nuggets for somebody else to ask about."

Nice to see that up sequentially on a quarter-over-quarter basis. What we've been seeing for a while now is that the non-U.S. component is becoming a bigger percentage of the pipeline. How much of the non-U.S. is limited service? And how did that composition, how did that compare to maybe a year ago? And maybe where I'm going with this question is when you look at the average fee per room in your development pipeline now versus a year ago, is that average fee per room up or down?"

You have seen growth, I mean, primarily through our Master and limited partnerships in China with Hampton and Home2 but also as we deploy Hilton Garden and other brands around the world, you are seeing slightly faster growth in limited service. So for it to change the overall trajectory of fees per room, it will take a really long time. And so that has been pretty steady as has the mix between full service and limited service generally speaking, in both the pipeline and rooms under construction, I think it's about 60-40 full-service limited service. And that stayed pretty constant. Oh, the other way, sorry, 40-60."

I mean we haven't sort of inflation going on, not just in the input cost, but labor as well. So when they ultimately when people need to operate -- open and operate the cost or higher. Now we've done a bunch of things and are doing a bunch of things to bring cost down inside the hotels by creating really good efficiencies that I think will more than offset that component of it. But cost to build are going up and financing is not particularly readily available. For the best owners, it is and people are starting new build projects in the U.S. and around the world. But I suspect and sort of built in, Sean, to our expectations on unit growth is that the U.S., you will see a cycle where, particularly in the U.S., the new construction numbers are going to be much, much lower. That's obviously long-term healthy for the industry. But the good news for us is the world is a big place. And the pressures are not the same in all places in the world, particularly recognizing that the place where we get the second biggest chunk of our growth is Asia Pacific and China in particular. And those pressures are very different in the sense that they're less and there's a lot more financing available, et cetera, et cetera. 
And so not unlike coming out of the great recession, our job is to be really resilient. This is the benefit of an investment in a big global company. I think we're really good at this and sort of anticipating and adapting to the trends. And like after the Great Recession, the same thing happened in the U.S. There wasn't so much an inflationary issue. It was just of capital. New construction starts went way down. That's what's happening here. That will be healthy for the industry. And what did we do? We pivoted then the same way. We're pivoting now just with more tools in the toolkit, meaning conversions become a much larger part of what we're doing. And we have -- we are much further along in terms of the relationships we have around the world in the areas of the world that are continuing to not only motor along, but pick up steam. I mean I think in China, as an example, our second biggest market, we're going to sign more start more and open more pressures on the cost to build will abate over a period of time, and I don't think it will be that long period of time. I'm highly confident that the financing markets will have been easing up and will continue to ease up and the U.S., in terms of new development or new constructions. Starts will be a huge engine of opportunity for us as it always has been and pick up a lot of steam. And I'm sure other things around the world will happen over time where they slow down. But we're very quick on our feet, not to pat us on the back too much, but I think we've been able for 15 years to continue to drive really good growth while lots of crazy things are going on around the world because there are different conditions and there's ways to continue to grow. 
And so while we do starting -- finishing with where we started, we do worry about it. I think we have a plan to address it. I think we've built that into the expectations that we've provided to you guys in terms of where we think growth will be."

Obviously, we've suspended dividend and buyback to preserve liquidity during the pandemic. But the way we think about it broadly hasn't changed. And I think the way we think about it more specifically on the first part of your question is, we want to get a little further into the recovery, a little bit further into reliably generating free cash -- positive free cash flow and having our leverage level start to come down. And so that -- unless something crazy happens, we think that happens over the course of the year. We'll talk to our Board about it sort of in the second half of the year as the recovery takes shape. And we'd say it's highly likely that starting next year, we get back into the capital return business. 
[Audio Gap] 
And the one that we were debating over the last few days ourselves. And they're varying opinions on it even inside our own shop. I mean I've been saying 23 or 24, as you know, on these calls publicly. And I still believe that. I think from a I think with the slope of the recovery, I'd probably be on the earlier end of that rather than the later as we have a little bit more visibility. I think there is a chance from a room night point of view, certainly on a run rate basis that we get back next year. But I think to get both room nights and rate and the compression we need requires certainly in the U.S., but broadly requires the bigger groups to be back. And while I think they're coming back and certainly, they want to be back, the planning and all of that -- it's on a lag. So I think that takes some time next year. 
So I'd still say '23, '24 but I'd probably err towards the earlier end of that."

A lot of most businesses, by number, have been really negatively impacted by the pandemic, and they need to cut expenses. And so I'm highly confident, as is the case with any cyclical downturn in recovery when this happens that those budgets will build back, but it will take  will take some time. 
Now I think in the second half of this year, I think, number one, there's a huge amount of pent-up demand. And by definition, they only have half a year to spend whatever they have anyway because nobody is doing a ton of traveling in the first half of the 
year. So I think ironically, I think there's plenty of budget capacity. I look at our own budget. There's plenty of budget capacity when you talk to businesses for the rest of this year. I think as you go into next year, in a full-scale recovery while people are going to for a period of time, want to be thrifty I think in the end, it will just be what the opportunity set is. And if we're in a robust recovery, what I have seen, again, I can't prove it, but I've seen it in every other cycle as you get into that the rope gets -- they let -- businesses let the rope through their hands because they have to, they have to deliver alpha. They have to compete against other businesses that are trying to do the same thing. And so they have to -- their people have to get out on the road. They have to have meetings. They have to build their culture, innovate, collaborate, get out to get their sales forces out and do all the things they do. So the steeper the slope of the recovery The -- like in every other cyclical recovery and that's when we get through the pandemic, we're done largely with the health and you're in a cyclical economic recovery. The steeper the slope, the faster it comes back. That's just the way it's always worked. I don't think it'll be any different here. 
But it will -- that's why I said 23, 24, again, I said probably I'd take the the earlier of that rather than the later given the current slope of what we're seeing. But that's why it takes longer. We will get back to room nights, I think, faster because we'll still find room nights that are lower-rated business because we've gotten really good at that. But we're going to want to shift the mix out over the next couple of years to the higher-rated business, get more compression from groups to ultimately get back there. So I think budgets will normally, sort of between now and 2023 if the slope of the recovery is what we think -- is what we're seeing."

I think when you boil it down, I don't think there is going to be any material shift. I do believe in the obviously, short to intermediate term, there's a shift because like everybody, not all of our owners, but most of our owners are dealing with a very difficult situation. I would say the 99.9%. Now some of them are much further longer in recovery because their portfolios are in markets that have had rapid recovery, resort markets, Southern U.S. and they're doing pretty well. But broadly, the owner community obviously has been hurting as have weak as has have the whole industry. There's not -- it's not like it's been easy on any of us. 
We obviously have deployed a whole host of things to be supportive of the owner community, and those are still fully deployed in the sense of working very hard with a lot of folks on behalf of the industry for government support in the right areas, and we don't -- we have not stopped those efforts. And I do believe as we get to a real recovery, there's opportunities to help -- get helped with real stimulus to get people moving again. And so we continue to work day and night on those efforts as things evolve. And obviously, we've done a whole bunch of work in the short term to provide massive amounts of relief from standards across the board so that owners could make -- manage their way. We could all manage our way to the other side. I mentioned it in passing but it's worth mentioning again, we call it our hotel, the future work. We're looking in a very granular way across every one of our brands. We're not done with the work, but we're done with a lot of the work to figure out when we get to the other side, how do we deliver the incredible experience for the customer that continues to drive the premiums that we've had, by the way, which are at the highest levels in our history at this moment. but also do it in a way that's more cost efficient for our ownership community. And I'm highly confident, as I said, even with the labor pressures that we are going to experience here in the U.S., particularly that when it's all said and done, we're going to be able to drive higher margins. So on a like-for-like basis, if you believe, which I do that when you get out a couple of years, you're going to have similar demand levels to '18 or '19. Even with the cost pressures, we believe that we have engineered a way to be able to drive even greater returns. So our owners -- while it's difficult now when we get to the other side, both their existing assets and their opportunity set for doing new development, we think are going to be better than what we had pre-pandemic because we think we're just doing -- we're going to do -- we are and we'll continue to do a better job. 
And so that's a long-winded way getting to the answer, which I gave you at the beginning. So as a result of that, I don't think there'll be a meaningful difference. I mean with some owners, there may be. But I would say in the main, I don't think so. I think the owner community that we deal with, which is an immensely diversified community. We have 10,000 owners around the world that we deal with. The vast majority of them, this is their business. This is what they do, own and operate on a franchise basis, and it's all they do. It's not the case across all 10,000 owners, but the bulk of our system, this is what people do. And I don't think if we can deliver for them the premiums we've delivered, which have only gone up and do it in a way where they can get more to the bottom line that they're going to abandon their business model. I think they're going to want to carry on. But it takes some time, right, just being pragmatic because this has been really difficult, which is why we worked so hard to sort of help create the bridges, both in what we could do, what the government could do to get them to the other side. And why I said in my -- honestly, in my earlier comments, particularly in the U.S., where why I think the new development side, all of these pressures and just the pressures of owners broadly is going to mean it's going to take a little time for the new construction side of of development to pick up the -- what it was pre-pandemic. But that will happen in my opinion. And I think the relationship will be much more similar than different to what continue to enhance our network effect and deliver more hotels and more fees."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. It has been a little over a year since the pandemic started.

I'm really proud of how we've set up the company for the future. And most importantly, I'm grateful to our team members who have continued to lead with hospitality and to all of our stakeholders for their ongoing support. 
In the first quarter, system-wide RevPAR decreased 38% year-over-year and 53% versus 2019. Rising COVID cases and tightening travel restrictions, particularly across Europe and Asia Pacific weighed on demand through January and most of February. March marked a turning point as we lap the start of the U.S. lockdowns, RevPAR turned positive up more than 23% year-over-year. System-wide occupancy reached 55% by the end of the month driven by strong leisure demand. As expected, recovery in group and corporate transient continued to lag, but both segments showed sequential improvement versus the fourth quarter. 
Overall, this positive momentum has continued into the second quarter. While recovery varies by region and country, we can see the light at the end of the tunnel. In the U.S., more than 50% of adults have received at least 1 dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. As a result, we're seeing a significant lift in forward bookings and occupancy, which is now around 60% as well as lengthening booking windows. This mirrors trends in other countries around the work, for instance, China is running in the low 70s occupancy. We do expect this momentum to continue . Vaccine distribution, coupled with relaxed travel restrictions and increasing consumer confidence should drive further RevPAR improvements in the coming months and quarters. In fact, we are on pace to see record leisure demand in the U.S. over the summer months with April bookings for the summer exceeding 2019 peak levels by nearly 10%. We also expect continued corporate office reopenings to drive a meaningful pickup in business transient demand towards the back half of the year. 
Based on what we've seen in China and pockets of the U.S., once restrictions are lifted and offices reopen business travel returns. In the first quarter, business transient revenue was roughly 75% of 2019 levels in states that were further along in their reopening process. 
Additionally, recent forecast for nonresidential fixed investment are up more than 3 percentage points from prior projections to 7.8%, indicating even greater optimism around business spending. 
On the group side, forward booking activity continues to improve month-over-month Group bookings made in the first quarter for the back half of the year were roughly flat with 2019 booking activity, suggesting customers are increasingly optimistic about safety measures and loosening pandemic restrictions. Near-term group bookings continue to be driven largely by social events and smaller meetings, but we are seeing a slow shift back to a more normal mix of business with corporate group leads up more than 70% for future periods. 
Associations and trade shows have also started opening up housing and registration sites for events later this year. Further signs of moving forward with in-person group meetings. 
As we look out to next year, our group position is roughly 85% of peak 2019 levels with rate increases versus 2019. Group bookings were up in the mid-teens for 2023 versus 2019. In fact, last week, I was in Mexico to Chair the World Travel and Tourism Council's Global Summit where more than 800 participants from all over the world attended in person and thousands more attended virtually. The conference demonstrated that it is possible to meet in a safe way and the hybrid events can be incredibly effective at expanding participation and enhancing collaboration. It was great to be in the same room with other hospitality and government leaders talking about the bright future that lies in our industry. The event made me even more optimistic for our recovery and confident that we are beginning to see a new era of travel emerge. 
Turning to development. During the quarter, we added 105 hotels totaling more than 16,500 rooms to our system and achieved net unit growth of 5.8%. We celebrated the openings of our 100th Curio and our 50th Tapestry hotel demonstrating the strength of our conversion friendly brands. Overall conversions accounted for approximately 24% of additions in the quarter. 
We also continued to enhance our resort footprint during the quarter with the openings of the 1,500 room Virgin Hotel in Las Vegas, the Hilton Abu Dhabi Yas land, the all-inclusive Yucatan resort Playa del Carmen and 6 spectacular properties along the California Coast, customers have even more opportunities to stay with us as travel resumes. Building on our already impressive portfolio in the world's most desirable locations. 
During the quarter, we signed agreements to bring our Waldorf Astoria and Canopy brands to the Seychelles. The properties are scheduled to open in 2023, joining the Mango House Seychelles LXR Hotel and Resorts set to open later this summer. 
In the quarter, we signed nearly 22,000 rooms modestly ahead of our expectations. This included our first Signia hotel. Additionally, through our strategic partnership with Country Garden to introduce the Home2 Suites brand in China, we added more than 5,000 rooms to our pipeline. We're excited for the opportunities this partnership provides with one of our fastest-growing brands. 
Home2 recently celebrated its tenth anniversary, marking the milestone with nearly 1,000 rooms hotels open and in the pipeline. On Entrepreneur Magazine's Annual Franchise 500 list, which featured 11 of our 18 brands, Home2 was the #2 hotel brand ranking only behind Hampton. 
Overall, we are very happy with our development progress and excited for additional growth opportunities with more than half of our 399,000 root pipeline under construction, We're confident in our ability to grow net units in the mid-single-digit range for the next several years and continue to expect growth in the 4.5% to 5% range in 2021. 
And in an environment where safety and cleanliness are top priorities for travelers, we continue to create more opportunities for our guests to enjoy a contactless experience from pre-arrival to post checkout. Our digital key feature, which enables guests to bypass the front desk and go straight to the rooms is now available in the vast majority of our hotels worldwide. 
Additionally, we've joined forces with Lyft to mobilize Honors members to contribute to the Lyft vaccine access initiative, which funds rises for those in need of reliable transportation to their vaccine appointment. We're excited to continue the momentum of our partnership with Lyft by supporting this important cause. 
During the quarter, we also launched 2 new co-branded credit cards in Japan building on our 25-year partnership with American Express and marking the first time our co-branded cards have been made available to customers outside the United States. These cards are designed with both frequent and occasional tollers in mind and offer customers the opportunity to earn the Hilton Honors bonus points on everyday spending as well as at our properties worldwide. 
As a result of our strong partnerships, industry-leading brands, and unmatched value proposition, our loyalty program continues attracting new members. We ended the first quarter with more than 115 million Honors members, up roughly 8% year-over-year with membership increasing across every major region despite lower demand due to the pandemic. 
As I reflect on the quarter and the past year, I'm very proud of the determination creativity and hospitality that our Hilton team members have demonstrated. This earned us recognition by Fortune and Great Place to Work as the #1 Best Big Company to Work For and #3 Best Company to Work For in the United States. 
Overall, I'm pleased with our first quarter results and feel very good about the momentum for the remainder of the year. I'm optimistic for the future of travel and for Hilton as we emerge stronger and better positioned continuing to drive value for our guests, our owners, our communities and, of course, our shareholders. 
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Kevin to give more details on our results for the quarter."

During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR declined 38.4% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis as rising COVID cases and reinstated travel restrictions and lockdowns disrupted the demand environment, especially across Europe and Asia Pacific. However, occupancy improved sequentially throughout the quarter, increasing more than 20 points. Adjusted EBITDA was $198 million in the first quarter, down 45% year-over-year. Results reflected the continued impact of the pandemic on global travel demand, including temporary suspensions at some of our hotels during the quarter. Management and franchise fees decreased 34%, less than RevPAR decrease as franchise fee declines were somewhat mitigated by better-than-expected license fees and development fees. 
Additionally, results were helped by continued cost control at both the corporate and property levels. Our ownership portfolio posted a loss for the quarter due to the challenged demand environment. Reinstated lockdowns and travel restrictions in Europe and Japan, coupled with temporary hotel closures and fixed operating costs, including fixed rent payments at some of our leased properties weighed on our performance. Continued cost control mitigated segment losses. 
For the quarter, diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $0.02. 
Turning to our regional performance. First quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR declined nearly 37% year-over-year and 50% versus 2019. Demand improved sequentially throughout the quarter with March occupancy 62% higher than January and ending at 55%. The highest level since the pandemic began. Leisure travel continued to lead the recovery, particularly on weekends with warm weather destinations benefiting the most. 
In the Americas outside the U.S., first quarter RevPAR declined 55% year-over-year and 63% versus 2019. Performance recovered in March, but lagged the broader system due to the region's greater dependence on international travel, which remain constrained by tightened travel restrictions. 
In Europe, RevPAR fell 76% year-over-year and 82% versus 2019. Declines were driven by increasing COVID cases and reinstated lockdowns across both the United Kingdom and Continental Europe. Delays in vaccination distribution also disrupted recovery. 
In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR was down 32% year-over-year and 46% versus 2019. Performance in the region benefited from strong domestic demand and easing restrictions. In the Asia Pacific region, first quarter RevPAR fell 7% year-over-year and 49% versus 2019 as rising infections, lockdowns and border closures weighed on performance early in the quarter. RevPAR in China increased 64% year-over-year with occupancy levels increasing from roughly 35% to roughly 65% during the quarter. 
Both leisure and business transient demand rebounded quickly as restrictions eased with March occupancy in China exceeding 2019 levels. 
Turning to development. As Chris mentioned, in the first quarter, we grew net units 5.8% driven primarily by the Americas and Asia Pacific. Tightening restrictions and lockdowns across Europe delayed openings in the region. However, we expect an uptick in development activity as countries continue to reopen. 
For the full year, we continue to expect net unit growth of 4.5% to 5%. Signings in the quarter decreased year-over-year due to pre-pandemic comparisons, but exceeded our expectations due to greater-than-expected signings in China, particularly for our Home2 Suites brand. For the year, we expect signings to increase mid-single digits versus 2020. 
Turning to the balance sheet. During the quarter, we took steps to further enhance our liquidity position and preserve financial flexibility. We repaid $500 million of the outstanding balance under our $1.75 billion revolving credit facility and opportunistically executed a favorable debt refinancing transaction to extend our maturities at lower rates. As we look ahead, we remain confident in our balance sheet and liquidity positions as we continue to focus on recovery. Further details on our first quarter can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning.

And then perhaps how you're thinking about beyond people coming back into the office.

Maybe Kevin will throw some things in and we'll save a little bit maybe for later because I'm sure others have similar questions. But thank you, and I do think that is the question. Obviously, as both Kevin and I covered, Carlo, we saw a pretty marked improvement as we march through the quarter, and that continued into April. In terms of the global data, I think the best way to look at it is against a '19 comparison because looking at it against 2020, particularly right now as you are in the early stages of the pandemic is relatively useless. And so if you look at January and February, you were globally. And the U.S. was similar. If you look at it, You were sort of in the 55% to 60% down from a RevPAR point of view. And you picked up about 10 points going down into sort of the mid 40s down in March. And then in April, we -- you had another step-up in you into the low 40s. Obviously, May, it's a little early to say, but I would say the trajectory in our mind, continues as we look at forward bookings, both then the leisure transient side, which is what's going to dominate the second quarter, It feels like we're going to continue marching on. 
If you look at it by segments, which I obviously have spent a lot of time, and this will sort of get to some of our views on business transient and the group side. If you look at -- you break down room nights by segments relative to 2019, again, I'm focusing on room nights to sort of take rate for the moment out of it. Leisure in the first quarter was already close to 90% of '19. By the way, for what it's worth, much lower based on lower rated business, but just again, room nights. And business was about 50% in the first quarter. Again, lower if you look at it on a RevPAR basis. And group was about 35% to 40%. 
As you march through our expectations for the year, our belief is globally and every region will be a little bit different. I'll save a regional question for somebody else because I don't want to do too much of a filibuster on 1 question. But If you march through the year, my expectation is you're going to have an incredibly robust leisure-driven summer. So we're going to continue to see good progress. We believe the summer will be meaningfully over 2019 peak levels of leisure demand. As we get into the fall and every day, you're reading the same things that I'm reading, but I'm also, as I'm sure you are talking to a lot of CEOs of large companies that we deal with or that are friends of mine. And I think clearly, as you get into the summer, many people are starting to bring folks back in the office, certainly, as you get into the fall, all things sort of being equal in terms of trajectory vaccination. Most businesses are going to be bringing folks back, maybe not fully -- probably not fully, but on some flexible basis, but a whole lot different than what we've been experiencing. We do believe that -- and we do see it both in China, as I said in my prepared comments, we do see it in parts of the United States where restrictions have been lifted earlier. I mentioned in my prepared comments, business travel volumes already 75% of what they were in '19 in those markets. So I think it is -- even though not fully through it, not fully open anywhere, I think it is really good evidence that as people get back to work, as kids in the fall go back to school, which at this point, I think, is very highly likely, you're going to see a step change into the third and fourth quarter in business transient. 
I also see it in our booking pace on the group side that you will see a pretty good step change In the group side, I gave you some stats, so I won't repeat them. At the moment, it is more SMERF kind of related business and small meetings in the second half of this year with the bigger meetings really some happening, but really those getting booked more into next year at a high volume. But we do believe that we will have a lot of realized group business, a lot more of it than we've been experiencing in the second half of the year. 
So if you sort of jump to the fourth quarter, recognizing Q2 is going to be largely leisure. Q3 is going to sort of be a transition. On a room night basis, our forecasting which is all it is, but it's based on a lot of data to sort of the current trajectory that we're on. We think room nights and leisure will be at '19 levels. We don't think rate will be back to '19 levels. So sort of RevPAR levels in the leisure, sort of in the 80, low 80s sort of percent. We think business transient, by the time you get to the fourth quarter based on what we're seeing in markets that are recovering on a room night basis, we'll be about 70%-ish. I'm being reasonably precise obviously, but these are sort of our sense of estimates. And obviously, lower than that, on a RevPAR basis because we're still not going to have the -- all the highest-rated business travel back. That's why it takes time to sort of get back to '19 levels. And we think group from a volume point of view, could be halfway back to '19 levels. Again, it won't be the highest rated groups. Those will start coming next year when we get to a place where we have the larger groups, association et cetera, that are typically are paying. So that's sort of -- that's how we think the year is going to play out. We think that as a result, RevPAR levels every sort of month as we go versus '19 are going to get better. By the time we end the year, I think we could be back somewhere around 70% or something -ish of '19 levels on a run rate basis, which isn't all the way home. But it's a heck of a lot better than where we were. And what I would say, not to be [ poly-ish ] about it. What I would say is the recovery of late, certainly, since we had our last call, the recovery -- the slope of the recovery has been steeper than what we would have thought. In all regards, a lot of it is to come on the business transient, although we're seeing some, as I described, it's not like we have none, and we're seeing a pretty decent uptick. But that is sort of a fall expectation. But I would say broadly, as you can probably tell from my comments, there's a bunch of data to support it. We think the slope of the recovery has steepened since the last time we talked. And thus, our reason for optimism that things are on a good path. 
You asked about fee generation that will follow. I don't think there's a whole lot more to say that as the business recovers. So go our fees, we get -- that's how we get paid. And I do think sort of built into my expectations that I gave is sort of my view and our view of pent-up demand. I think there's a huge amount of pent-up demand. And my guess is every single person that you guys talk to, whether they run a business, whether you talk to them, they're friendlier. you see him on the beach or wherever you are that they're talking about needing to and wanting to get out both for leisure, but increasingly needing to and wanting to to get out for business and the congregating groups. There are a lot of important work that gets done in these group settings that I think after a while, people realized that it's not possible to keep going without it. So I do think there's a -- I think we're on a real -- on a very good slope. We need the vaccination trends and the infection rates and all of the fun stuff that we're all looking at every minute of every day because that's all the media is covering obviously. We need all that to progress. But our view is we're on a solid -- a very solid road to recovery. Did I get most of what you want? I left a few nuggets for somebody else to ask about."

Nice to see that up sequentially on a quarter-over-quarter basis. What we've been seeing for a while now is that the non-U.S. component is becoming a bigger percentage of the pipeline. How much of the non-U.S. is limited service? And how did that composition, how did that compare to maybe a year ago? And maybe where I'm going with this question is when you look at the average fee per room in your development pipeline now versus a year ago, is that average fee per room up or down?"

You have seen growth, I mean, primarily through our Master and limited partnerships in China with Hampton and Home2 but also as we deploy Hilton Garden and other brands around the world, you are seeing slightly faster growth in limited service. So for it to change the overall trajectory of fees per room, it will take a really long time. And so that has been pretty steady as has the mix between full service and limited service generally speaking, in both the pipeline and rooms under construction, I think it's about 60-40 full-service limited service. And that stayed pretty constant. Oh, the other way, sorry, 40-60."

I mean, of course, it's a concern. I mean we haven't sort of inflation going on, not just in the input cost, but labor as well.

I mean we haven't sort of inflation going on, not just in the input cost, but labor as well. So when they ultimately when people need to operate -- open and operate the cost or higher. Now we've done a bunch of things and are doing a bunch of things to bring cost down inside the hotels by creating really good efficiencies that I think will more than offset that component of it. But cost to build are going up and financing is not particularly readily available. For the best owners, it is and people are starting new build projects in the U.S. and around the world. But I suspect and sort of built in, Sean, to our expectations on unit growth is that the U.S., you will see a cycle where, particularly in the U.S., the new construction numbers are going to be much, much lower. That's obviously long-term healthy for the industry. But the good news for us is the world is a big place. And the pressures are not the same in all places in the world, particularly recognizing that the place where we get the second biggest chunk of our growth is Asia Pacific and China in particular. And those pressures are very different in the sense that they're less and there's a lot more financing available, et cetera, et cetera. 
And so not unlike coming out of the great recession, our job is to be really resilient. This is the benefit of an investment in a big global company. I think we're really good at this and sort of anticipating and adapting to the trends. And like after the Great Recession, the same thing happened in the U.S. There wasn't so much an inflationary issue. It was just of capital. New construction starts went way down. That's what's happening here. That will be healthy for the industry. And what did we do? We pivoted then the same way. We're pivoting now just with more tools in the toolkit, meaning conversions become a much larger part of what we're doing. And we have -- we are much further along in terms of the relationships we have around the world in the areas of the world that are continuing to not only motor along, but pick up steam. I mean I think in China, as an example, our second biggest market, we're going to sign more start more and open more pressures on the cost to build will abate over a period of time, and I don't think it will be that long period of time. I'm highly confident that the financing markets will have been easing up and will continue to ease up and the U.S., in terms of new development or new constructions. Starts will be a huge engine of opportunity for us as it always has been and pick up a lot of steam. And I'm sure other things around the world will happen over time where they slow down. But we're very quick on our feet, not to pat us on the back too much, but I think we've been able for 15 years to continue to drive really good growth while lots of crazy things are going on around the world because there are different conditions and there's ways to continue to grow. 
And so while we do starting -- finishing with where we started, we do worry about it. I think we have a plan to address it. I think we've built that into the expectations that we've provided to you guys in terms of where we think growth will be."

I think from a I think with the slope of the recovery, I'd probably be on the earlier end of that rather than the later as we have a little bit more visibility. I think there is a chance from a room night point of view, certainly on a run rate basis that we get back next year. But I think to get both room nights and rate and the compression we need requires certainly in the U.S., but broadly requires the bigger groups to be back. And while I think they're coming back and certainly, they want to be back, the planning and all of that -- it's on a lag. So I think that takes some time next year. 
So I'd still say '23, '24 but I'd probably towards the earlier end of that."

A lot of most businesses, by number, have been really negatively impacted by the pandemic, and they need to cut expenses. And so I'm highly confident, as is the case with any cyclical downturn in recovery when this happens that those budgets will build back, but it will take will take some time. 
Now I think in the second half of this year, I think, number one, there's a huge amount of pent-up demand. And by definition, they only have half a year to spend whatever they have anyway because nobody is doing a ton of traveling in the first half of the 
year. So I think ironically, I think there's plenty of budget capacity. I look at our own budget. There's plenty of budget capacity when you talk to businesses for the rest of this year. I think as you go into next year, in a full-scale recovery while people are going to for a period of time, want to be thrifty I think in the end, it will just be what the opportunity set is. And if we're in a robust recovery, what I have seen, again, I can't prove it, but I've seen it in every other cycle as you get into that the rope gets -- they let -- businesses let the rope through their hands because they have to, they have to deliver alpha. They have to compete against other businesses that are trying to do the same thing. And so they have to -- their people have to get out on the road. They have to have meetings. They have to build their culture, innovate, collaborate, get out to get their sales forces out and do all the things they do. So the steeper the slope of the recovery The -- like in every other cyclical recovery and that's when we get through the pandemic, we're done largely with the health and you're in a cyclical economic recovery. The steeper the slope, the faster it comes back. That's just the way it's always worked. I don't think it'll be any different here. 
But it will -- that's why I said 23, 24, again, I said probably I'd take the earlier of that rather than the later given the current slope of what we're seeing. But that's why it takes longer. We will get back to room nights, I think, faster because we'll still find room nights that are lower-rated business because we've gotten really good at that. But we're going to want to shift the mix out over the next couple of years to the higher-rated business, get more compression from groups to ultimately get back there. So I think budgets will normally, sort of between now and 2023 if the slope of the recovery is what we think -- is what we're seeing."

I think when you boil it down, I don't think there is going to be any material shift. I do believe in the obviously, short to intermediate term, there's a shift because like everybody, not all of our owners, but most of our owners are dealing with a very difficult situation. I would say the 99.9%. Now some of them are much further longer in recovery because their portfolios are in markets that have had rapid recovery, resort markets, Southern U.S. and they're doing pretty well. But broadly, the owner community obviously has been hurting as have weak as has have the whole industry. There's not -- it's not like it's been easy on any of us. 
We obviously have deployed a whole host of things to be supportive of the owner community, and those are still fully deployed in the sense of working very hard with a lot of folks on behalf of the industry for government support in the right areas, and we don't -- we have not stopped those efforts. And I do believe as we get to a real recovery, there's opportunities to help -- get helped with real stimulus to get people moving again. And so we continue to work day and night on those efforts as things evolve. And obviously, we've done a whole bunch of work in the short term to provide massive amounts of relief from standards across the board so that owners could make -- manage their way. We could all manage our way to the other side. I mentioned it in passing but it's worth mentioning again, we call it our hotel, the future work. We're looking in a very granular way across every one of our brands. We're not done with the work, but we're done with a lot of the work to figure out when we get to the other side, how do we deliver the incredible experience for the customer that continues to drive the premiums that we've had, by the way, which are at the highest levels in our history at this moment. but also do it in a way that's more cost efficient for our ownership community. And I'm highly confident, as I said, even with the labor pressures that we are going to experience here in the U.S., particularly that when it's all said and done, we're going to be able to drive higher margins. So on a like-for-like basis, if you believe, which I do that when you get out a couple of years, you're going to have similar demand levels to '18 or '19. Even with the cost pressures, we believe that we have engineered a way to be able to drive even greater returns. So our owners -- while it's difficult now when we get to the other side, both their existing assets and their opportunity set for doing new development, we think are going to be better than what we had pre-pandemic because we think we're just doing -- we're going to do -- we are and we'll continue to do a better job. 
And so that's a long-winded way getting to the answer, which I gave you at the beginning. So as a result of that, I don't think there'll be a meaningful difference. I mean with some owners, there may be. But I would say in the main, I don't think so. I think the owner community that we deal with, which is an immensely diversified community. We have 10,000 owners around the world that we deal with. The vast majority of them, this is their business. This is what they do, own and operate on a franchise basis, and it's all they do. It's not the case across all 10,000 owners, but the bulk of our system, this is what people do. And I don't think if we can deliver for them the premiums we've delivered, which have only gone up and do it in a way where they can get more to the bottom line that they're going to abandon their business model. I think they're going to want to carry on. But it takes some time, right, just being pragmatic because this has been really difficult, which is why we worked so hard to sort of help create the bridges, both in what we could do, what the government could do to get them to the other side. And why I said in my -- honestly, in my earlier comments, particularly in the U.S., where why I think the new development side, all of these pressures and just the pressures of owners broadly is going to mean it's going to take a little time for the new construction side of of development to pick up the -- what it was pre-pandemic. But that will happen in my opinion. And I think the relationship will be much more similar than different to what continue to enhance our network effect and deliver more hotels and more fees."

I think our ambitions in that portfolio, we are pretty capital-light, right? So even in normal times, that ownership was down to 7% to 8% of our overall EBITDA, something like that in 2019. And we've been saying for a long time that if we think about our portfolio, it's about 60 hotels, primarily leases, about 20 of them were strategic. We'll be in those leases, no matter what, over time, they have good coverage. They're important hotels. We've got '20 at the bottom where there's sort of legacy -- their legacy deals that we inherited, fixed lease payments in markets that aren't as robust, those we will exit, no matter what, when the leases are up, and then there's about '20 that are in the middle where when the leases roll, we sit down with the landlord. And if we can work out an arrangement that we think makes sense for us to continue. We continue if we don't, we get out. And we've sort of been rolling our way out of 3 to 4 of them a year. We think it's actually probably more like 6 to 8 of them this year that we'll transition out of either transitioning them to management agreements or franchise agreements or just getting out. And over time, you'll wake up a few years from now, and it will be something like less than 5% of our overall EBITDA, and that will remain the trajectory. 
Having said that, in the next -- starting in the second half of the year and into the next couple of years, this will accelerate our overall growth just because sadly, the ownership segment, given a lot of the fixed rent nature of it and where it's been, which has been concentrated in U.K., Europe and Japan, which have been impacted, dramatically more impacted. If you look at the RevPAR numbers in those markets and in the segment are twice as bad in the first quarter as the overall. As you get those markets open, you're going to take those numbers, which have been terrible, will become a significant contributor to growth."

In other words, are you in the early stages of a bunch of conversions that maybe will come out later this year?

So we still think 4% to 5%, and it will be within that range for the next few years. 
And then the second half on conversions, yes, we do think conversions will pick up over time. In the last cycle, it got to something in the 40% range of overall deliveries, probably doesn't get -- and we think we've said this publicly as well. It probably doesn't get back to that level this cycle just because the denominator likely won't contract that dramatically. But we do think conversions will continue to be a bigger contributor. It will be a little bit lumpy. A lot of them are larger hotels. Some of the things we're working on now are bigger deals either portfolio deals or larger individual hotels that sort of require a transaction to happen for the conversion to happen. So I don't know if that happens later this year or next year, but it definitely will pick up over time."

In fact, I participated in a meeting with the Premier Lee of China just a couple of weeks ago, and this is one of the topics that we talked about. If you look at our b",818,"Yes. I mean we've been having a lot of discussion within the industry and within China. In fact, I participated in a meeting with the Premier Lee of China just a couple of weeks ago, and this is one of the topics that we talked about. If you look at our business, using some metrics in our business, like in the U.S., inbound, global -- international inbounds, only about 4% of the business. If you look at our business globally, it's about 10%. And it does weigh obviously, more heavily inbound business in other parts of the world, particularly in Europe, which depends on it more. So it would be higher than 10%. A large feeder market is China. I mean, it's other parts of the world as well, but it is China. And so I think as Europe opens up, obviously, they're going to be like the rest of the world. I think they're going to be doing within region travel, which given all the pent-up demand has actually, I think, been reasonably good, just like we're seeing in the U.S., even though we don't have much inbound travel going on, we don't have any outbound going on. And so I think in the end, Europe's opportunity for the early stages of recovery are robust for the same reason, while they're not going to have inbound from China or other markets, they're not going to have any outbound, and Europeans like to travel, particularly in the summer like the com vacations. And when it's open and they can, they will and they'll stay within the confines of either their countries or the region. So I think it's going to be fine. 
Obviously, longer term, as you get to a more stabilized world, you want to open up these travel quarters. I had a meeting with the White House last week, maybe the week before, as I said, with Premier Lee of China, the week before that. And we were talking about a lot of topics, but that was a primary topic, both with the Chinese administration and the U.S. administration on trying to figure out how do we figure out as the world is getting vaccinated, and it's a little uneven. But as certain countries are getting heavily vaccinated and getting to a reasonable level of herd immunity, how do we open up safe travel quarters. 
Europe is doing the same thing. Those discussions are ongoing. We're trying to get those discussions going with the U.S. They are obviously already starting to have those discussions with China. And so I don't -- that will take some time. I think it's -- I think you will start to see some bilateral agreements or multilateral agreements in the second half of this year. I think we're at a stage right now where everybody is still focused on vaccination to get their herd immunity. But with the overwhelming amount of supply of vaccines, which aren't all distributed perfectly around the world or even around our country at this point, but the numbers are becoming overwhelming. The surpluses are going to become as we get into the summer. My sense is overwhelming, and we're going to be able to have a shifting of those resources around the world to the market's most in need as we get into July -- June, July, August, September and into the latter part of the year, that is going to allow for a reasonably -- hopefully, a reasonable trajectory in terms of some of these economies getting to a better place. 
China is obviously already in a reasonably good place. So as the U.S. sort of has a few more months in Europe, I think there are real opportunities to start opening travel quarters. I do think it will happen that way just based on the discussions I'm having with multiple administrations that our teams are having. I don't think it's going to be like one day the world is open, like, yay, everybody -- I think it's going to be agreements between like the U.S. and the U.K., the EU and China, the U.S. and China, that will allow for those quarters to open up, make sure that there's flight capacity that the regime for vaccination testing and all that is sort of -- is bolted down. 
So that's a long answer because it needs to be. It's complicated. I think in the second half of the year, my hope is and belief is that you're going to start to see some of those quarters open up. We're pushing everybody really hard. But in the meantime, I think we're fine just because if a quarter is not open, as I said, people are restrained in leaving their country or their territory, and they're going to start traveling when they feel safe and you're going to keep all that pent-up demand in your local market."

It is singularly, at the moment, I wouldn't say the only issue when you're in a global pandemic. There's lots of issues, but it's one of the most important issues because it is very difficult, particularly here in the U.S. to get labor, and it is constraining recovery at certain times because you just -- you can't get enough people to service the properties. I do think in the short term, I've already said it, and it's implied in earlier questions, there's going to be wage pressure, wage inflation. I do think it will stabilize and it work itself out as we get later into the year. It's a complex issue that is at the intersection of people being concerned about their health still, particularly in some of the communities that we need to get focused back and coming back to work. And that's going to take some time, both vaccination and marketing to a number of those communities to get vaccinated and getting it done and getting them to a place where they feel safe being in a workplace. So that's part of it. And then the other part of it is getting kids back in school because a lot of people in the workforce are taking care of kids, they don't -- there's no day care, the school becomes daycare and the federal government, for all the right reasons, the way back when did a top-up of unemployment insurance and on top of the state unemployment insurance and obviously sent out $1,400 checks, and they did all these things to support people who are in harm's way, all of which made sense at the time, maybe some of it makes a little bit less sense now in the sense that the demand is there and the jobs are there, yet people don't have as much of a need to come back to it. So -- but that, in theory, on September, whatever, 6th, the federal top-up expires. I guess it could be extended. My impression is it will not be. My hope is it will not be, not because I don't care about the people. I think there's just enough jobs. We literally, I think, there are 3 million of our, not Hilton, but industry folks still out of work. I think by the time you get to September, October, I think the vast majority of those could easily be reemployed given what I think demand will be in the business. And that's best for everybody, right? It's best of the country, it's best for the individual team members to -- but it's -- that's the convergence of all of that. So I think it's going to be tough. I've been talking to tons of -- I think it will be tough between now and September. I think when we by the time you get to September, mass vaccination will hopefully be behind us. Kids will be back in school, and people will feel safe -- that it's safe to go back and they want to get back and be earning a paycheck. And so I think it will then stabilize as we get into the latter part of the year."

I've always had confidence in the business model of ours. I've always had confidence in people's desire to travel for all the reasons they have always wanted to travel. I think the evidence is pretty clear. One, that the decisions that we made as a result of the crisis have made our business stronger. It will -- we're driving higher market shares, higher margins on a lower cost structure. And that as we see the telltale signs of getting past the health crisis, we're starting to see the world come back to life and all the reasons I thought people wanted to travel are, I think, playing out the way I and we had hoped for. We have ways to go. So I don't want to be a [ Pollyanna ] about it, but we feel good about where we are and definitely incrementally better than we did over the last couple of quarters.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. It has been a little over a year since the pandemic started. Over that time, we acted swiftly to address the challenges we face, so we could quickly turn our focus to best positioning ourselves towards recovery and beyond. I'm really proud of how we've set up the company for the future. And most importantly, I'm grateful to our team members who have continued to lead with hospitality and to all of our stakeholders for their ongoing support.  
In the first quarter, system-wide RevPAR decreased 38% year-over-year and 53% versus 2019. Rising COVID cases and tightening travel restrictions, particularly across Europe and Asia Pacific, weighed on demand through January and most of February. However, March marked a turning point. As we lapped the start of the U.S. lockdowns, RevPAR turned positive up more than 23% year-over-year. System-wide occupancy reached 55% by the end of the month driven by strong leisure demand. As expected, recovery in group and corporate transient continued to lag, but both segments showed sequential improvement versus the fourth quarter.  
Overall, this positive momentum has continued into the second quarter. While recovery varies by region and country, we can see the light at the end of the tunnel. In the U.S., more than 50% of adults have received at least 1 dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. As a result, we're seeing a significant lift in forward bookings and occupancy, which is now around 60% as well as lengthening booking windows. This mirrors trends in other countries around the world. For instance, China is running in the low 70s occupancy. We do expect this momentum to continue . Vaccine distribution, coupled with relaxed travel restrictions and increasing consumer confidence should drive further RevPAR improvements in the coming months and quarters. In fact, we are on pace to see record leisure demand in the U.S. over the summer months with April bookings for the summer exceeding 2019 peak levels by nearly 10%. We also expect continued corporate office reopenings to drive a meaningful pickup in business transient demand towards the back half of the year.  
Based on what we've seen in China and pockets of the U.S., once restrictions are lifted and offices reopen, business travel returns. In the first quarter, business transient revenue was roughly 75% of 2019 levels in states that were further along in their reopening process.  
Additionally, recent forecast for nonresidential fixed investment are up more than 3 percentage points from prior projections to 7.8%, indicating even greater optimism around business spending.  
On the group side, forward booking activity continues to improve month-over-month. Group bookings made in the first quarter for the back half of the year were roughly flat with 2019 booking activity, suggesting customers are increasingly optimistic about safety measures and loosening pandemic restrictions. Near-term group bookings continue to be driven largely by social events and smaller group meetings, but we are seeing a slow shift back to a more normal mix of business with corporate group leads up more than 70% for future periods.  
Associations and trade shows have also started opening up housing and registration sites for events later this year, further signs of moving forward with in-person group meetings.  
As we look out to next year, our group position is roughly 85% of peak 2019 levels with rate increases versus 2019. Group bookings were up in the mid-teens for 2023 versus 2019. In fact, last week, I was in Mexico to chair the World Travel and Tourism Council's Global Summit where more than 800 participants from all over the world attended in person and thousands more attended virtually. The conference demonstrated that it is possible to meet in a safe way and that hybrid events can be incredibly effective at expanding participation and enhancing collaboration. It was great to be in the same room with other hospitality and government leaders talking about the bright future that lies ahead for our industry. The event made me even more optimistic for our recovery and confident that we are beginning to see a new era of travel emerge.  
Turning to development. During the quarter, we added 105 hotels totaling more than 16,500 rooms to our system and achieved net unit growth of 5.8%. We celebrated the openings of our 100th Curio and our 50th Tapestry hotel demonstrating the strength of our conversion-friendly brands. Overall conversions accounted for approximately 24% of additions in the quarter.  
We also continued to enhance our resort footprint during the quarter with the openings of the 1,500-room Virgin Hotel Las Vegas, the Hilton Abu Dhabi Yas Island, the all-inclusive Yucatan Resort Playa del Carmen and 6 spectacular properties along the California Coast. Customers have even more opportunities to stay with us as travel resumes. Building on our already impressive portfolio in the world's most desirable locations, during the quarter, we signed agreements to bring our Waldorf Astoria and Canopy brands to the Seychelles. The properties are scheduled to open in 2023, joining the Mango House Seychelles, LXR Hotel and Resorts set to open later this summer.  
In the quarter, we signed nearly 22,000 rooms modestly ahead of our expectations. This included our first Signia hotel. Additionally, through our strategic partnership with Country Garden to introduce the Home2 Suites brand to China, we added more than 5,000 rooms to our pipeline. We're excited for the opportunities this partnership provides with one of our fastest-growing brands.  
Home2 recently celebrated its tenth anniversary, marking the milestone with nearly 1,000 rooms, hotels open and in the pipeline. On Entrepreneur Magazine's Annual Franchise 500 List, which featured 11 of our 18 brands, Home2 was the #2 hotel brand ranking only behind Hampton.  
Overall, we are very happy with our development progress and excited for additional growth opportunities with more than half of our 399,000-room pipeline under construction, We're confident in our ability to grow net units in the mid-single-digit range for the next several years and continue to expect growth in the 4.5% to 5% range in 2021.  
And in an environment where safety and cleanliness are top priorities for travelers, we continue to create more opportunities for our guests to enjoy a contactless experience from pre-arrival to post-checkout. Our digital key feature, which enables guests to bypass the front desk and go straight to the rooms is now available in the vast majority of our hotels worldwide.  
Additionally, we've joined forces with Lyft to mobilize Honors members to contribute to the Lyft Vaccine Access Initiative, which funds rides for those in need of reliable transportation to their vaccine appointment. We're excited to continue the momentum of our partnership with Lyft by supporting this important cause.  
During the quarter, we also launched 2 new co-branded credit cards in Japan, building on our 25-year partnership with American Express and marking the first time our co-branded cards have been made available to customers outside the United States. These cards are designed with both frequent and occasional travelers in mind and offer customers the opportunity to earn Hilton Honors bonus points on everyday spending as well as at our properties worldwide.  
As a result of our strong partnerships, industry-leading brands, and unmatched value proposition, our loyalty program continues attracting new members. We ended the first quarter with more than 115 million Honors members, up roughly 8% year-over-year with membership increasing across every major region despite lower demand due to the pandemic.  
As I reflect on the quarter and the past year, I'm very proud of the determination, creativity and hospitality that our Hilton team members have demonstrated. This earned us recognition by Fortune and Great Place to Work as the #1 Best Big Company to Work For and #3 Best Company to Work For in the United States.  
Overall, I'm pleased with our first quarter results and feel very good about the momentum for the remainder of the year. I'm optimistic for the future of travel and for Hilton as we emerge stronger and better positioned continuing to drive value for our guests, our owners, our communities and, of course, our shareholders.  
With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Kevin to give more details on our results for the quarter."

During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR declined 38.4% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis as rising COVID cases and reinstated travel restrictions and lockdowns disrupted the demand environment, especially across Europe and Asia Pacific. However, occupancy improved sequentially throughout the quarter, increasing more than 20 points. Adjusted EBITDA was $198 million in the first quarter, down 45% year-over-year. Results reflected the continued impact of the pandemic on global travel demand, including temporary suspensions at some of our hotels during the quarter. Management and franchise fees decreased 34%, less than RevPAR decrease as franchise fee declines were somewhat mitigated by better-than-expected license fees and development fees.  
Additionally, results were helped by continued cost control at both the corporate and property levels. Our ownership portfolio posted a loss for the quarter due to the challenged demand environment. Reinstated lockdowns and travel restrictions in Europe and Japan, coupled with temporary hotel closures and fixed operating costs, including fixed rent payments at some of our leased properties, weighed on our performance. Continued cost control mitigated segment losses. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $0.02.  
Turning to our regional performance. First quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR declined nearly 37% year-over-year and 50% versus 2019. Demand improved sequentially throughout the quarter with March occupancy 62% higher than January and ending at 55%, the highest level since the pandemic began. Leisure travel continued to lead the recovery, particularly on weekends with warm weather destinations benefiting the most.  
In the Americas outside the U.S., first quarter RevPAR declined 55% year-over-year and 63% versus 2019. Performance recovered in March, but lagged the broader system due to the region's greater dependence on international travel, which remain constrained by tightened travel restrictions.  
In Europe, RevPAR fell 76% year-over-year and 82% versus 2019. Declines were driven by increasing COVID cases and reinstated lockdowns across both the United Kingdom and Continental Europe. Delays in vaccination distribution also disrupted recovery.  
In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR was down 32% year-over-year and 46% versus 2019. Performance in the region benefited from strong domestic demand and easing restrictions. In the Asia Pacific region, first quarter RevPAR fell 7% year-over-year and 49% versus 2019 as rising infections, lockdowns and border closures weighed on performance early in the quarter. RevPAR in China increased 64% year-over-year with occupancy levels increasing from roughly 35% to roughly 65% during the quarter.  
Both leisure and business transient demand rebounded quickly as restrictions eased with March occupancy in China exceeding 2019 levels.  
Turning to development. As Chris mentioned, in the first quarter, we grew net units 5.8% driven primarily by the Americas and Asia Pacific. Tightening restrictions and lockdowns across Europe delayed openings in the region. However, we expect an uptick in development activity as countries continue to reopen.  
For the full year, we continue to expect net unit growth of 4.5% to 5%. Signings in the quarter decreased year-over-year due to pre-pandemic comparisons, but exceeded our expectations due to greater-than-expected signings in China, particularly for our Home2 Suites brand. For the year, we expect signings to increase mid-single digits versus 2020.  
Turning to the balance sheet. During the quarter, we took steps to further enhance our liquidity position and preserve financial flexibility. We repaid $500 million of the outstanding balance under our $1.75 billion revolving credit facility and opportunistically executed a favorable debt refinancing transaction to extend our maturities at lower rates. As we look ahead, we remain confident in our balance sheet and liquidity positions as we continue to focus on recovery.

And speaking more maybe on the U.S. front, could you guys maybe talk a little bit about March and maybe to the extent you're willing to, April and how kind of -- not only RevPAR trends, I know you gave some data points on occupancy with the 55% exit rate coming out of March, kind of what you've seen from a fee generation on the U.S. side as it pertains to the occupancy gains that you're seeing? And then perhaps, how you're thinking about beyond people coming back into the office. The aspect of pent-up demand within the business and corporate traveler as we get maybe -- it's probably a 4Q event, I think, most of us would assume at this point. But how do you guys think about that?"

But that is probably the most important. I'll cover parts of it. Maybe Kevin will throw some things in, and we'll save a little bit maybe for later because I'm sure others will have similar questions. Bu",1508,"Boy, that's a lot of questions all embedded in one. But that is probably the most important. I'll cover parts of it. Maybe Kevin will throw some things in, and we'll save a little bit maybe for later because I'm sure others will have similar questions. But thank you, and I do think that is the question du jour. Obviously, as both Kevin and I covered, Carlo, we saw a pretty marked improvement as we marched through the quarter, and that continued into April. In terms of the global data, I think the best way to look at it is against a '19 comparison because looking at it against 2020, particularly right now as you are in the early stages of the pandemic, is relatively useless. 
And so -- yes, if you look at January and February, you were globally -- and the U.S. was similar. If you look at it, you were sort of in the 55% to 60% down from a RevPAR point of view. And you picked up about 10 points going down into sort of the mid 40s down in March. And then in April, we -- you had another step-up in your -- into the low 40s. Obviously, May, it's a little early to say, but I would say the trajectory in our mind continues if we look at forward bookings, both on the transient -- on the leisure transient side, which is what's going to dominate the second quarter. It feels like we're going to continue marching on.  
If you look at it by segments, which I obviously have spent a lot of time, and this will sort of get to some of our views on business transient and the group side. If you look at -- if you break down room nights by segments relative to 2019, again, I'm focusing on room nights to sort of take rate for the moment out of this. Leisure in the first quarter was already close to 90% of '19. By the way, for what it's worth, much lower based on lower rated business, but just again, room nights. And business was about 50% in the first quarter. Again, lower if you look at it on a RevPAR basis. And group was about 35% to 40%.  
As you march through our expectations for the year, our belief is globally -- and every region will be a little bit different. I'll save a regional question for somebody else because I don't want to do too much of a filibuster on one question. But if you march through the year, my expectation is you're going to have an incredibly robust leisure-driven summer. So we're going to continue to see good progress. We believe the summer will be meaningfully over 2019 peak levels of leisure demand. 
As we get into the fall and every day, you're reading the same things that I'm reading, but I'm also, as I'm sure you are, talking to a lot of CEOs of large companies that we deal with or that are friends of mine. And I think clearly, as you get into the summer, many people are starting to bring folks back in the office. Certainly, as you get into the fall, all things sort of being equal in terms of trajectory of vaccination, most businesses are going to be bringing folks back. Maybe not fully -- probably not fully, but on some flexible basis, but a whole lot different than what we've been experiencing. 
We do believe that -- and we do see it both in China, as I said in my prepared comments, we do see it in parts of the United States where restrictions have been lifted earlier. I mentioned in my prepared comments, business travel volume's already 75% of what they were in '19 in those markets. So I think it is -- even though not fully through it, not fully open anywhere, I think it is really good evidence that as people get back to work, as kids in the fall go back to school, which at this point, I think, is very highly likely, you're going to see a step change into the third and fourth quarter in business transient.  
I also see it in our booking pace on the group side that you will see a pretty good step change. In the group side, I gave you some stats, so I won't repeat them. At the moment, it is more SMERF kind of related business and small meetings in the second half of this year with the bigger meetings really some happening, but really those getting booked more into next year at a high volume. But we do believe that we will have a lot of realized group business, a lot more of it than we've been experiencing in the second half of the year.  
So if you sort of jump to the fourth quarter, recognizing Q2 is going to be largely leisure, Q3 is going to sort of be a transition. On a room night basis, our forecasting which is all it is, but it's based on a lot of data and based on sort of the current trajectory that we're on, we think room nights in leisure will be at '19 levels. We don't think rate will be back to '19 levels. So sort of RevPAR levels in the leisure, sort of in the 80, low 80s sort of percent. We think business transient, by the time you get to the fourth quarter based on what we're seeing in markets that are recovering on a room night basis, we'll be about 70%-ish. 
I'm being reasonably precise, obviously, but these are sort of our sense of estimates. And obviously, lower than that on a RevPAR basis because we're still not going to have the -- all the highest-rated business travel back. That's why it takes time to sort of get back to '19 levels. And we think group from a volume point of view could be -- could be halfway back to '19 levels. Again, it won't be the highest-rated groups. Those will start coming next year when we get to a place where we have the larger groups, association, et cetera, that are typically are paying. So that's sort of -- that's how we think the year is going to play out. 
We think that as a result, RevPAR levels every sort of month as we go versus '19 are going to get better. By the time we end the year, I think we could be back somewhere around 70% or something-ish of '19 levels on a run rate basis, which isn't all the way home. But it's a heck of a lot better than where we were. And what I would say, not to be Pollyannaish about it, what I would say is the recovery of late, certainly, since we had our last call, the recovery -- the slope of the recovery has been steeper than what we would have thought. In all regards, now a lot of it is to come on the business transient, although we're seeing some. 
As I described, it's not like we have none, and we're seeing a pretty decent uptick. But that is sort of a fall expectation. But I would say broadly, as you can probably tell from my comments, there's a bunch of data to support it. We think the slope of the recovery has steepened since the last time we talked and thus, our reason for optimism that things are on a good path.  
You asked about fee generation that will follow. I don't think there's a whole lot more to say that as the business recovers, so do our fees. We get -- that's how we get paid. And I do think sort of built into my expectations that I gave is sort of my view and our view of pent-up demand. I think there's a huge amount of pent-up demand. And my guess is every single person that you guys talk to, whether they run a business, whether you talk to them, they're a friend of yours, you see him on the beach or wherever you are, that they're talking about needing to and wanting to get out both for leisure, but increasingly needing to and wanting to get out for business and the congregating groups. 
There are a lot of important work that gets done in these -- in these group settings that I think, after a while, people realized that it's not possible to keep going without it. So I do think there's a -- I think we're on a real -- on a very good slope. We need the vaccination trends and the infection rates and all of the fun stuff that we're all looking at every minute of every day because that's all the media is covering obviously. We need all that to progress. But our view is we're on a solid -- a very solid road to recovery. Did I get most of what you want?"

You have seen growth, I mean, primarily through our master and limited partnerships in China with Hampton and Home2. But also as we deploy Hilton Garden and other brands around the world, you are seeing slightly faster growth in limited service. So for it to change the overall trajectory of fees per room, it will take a really long time. And so that has been pretty steady as has the mix between full service and limited service generally speaking, in both the pipeline and rooms under construction.

I mean, of course, it's a concern. I mean we have in -- sort of inflation going on, not just in the input cost but labor as well. So when they ultimately -- when people need to operate -- open and operate, the cost are higher. Now we've done a bunch",638,"Yes. I mean, of course, it's a concern. I mean we have in -- sort of inflation going on, not just in the input cost but labor as well. So when they ultimately -- when people need to operate -- open and operate, the cost are higher. Now we've done a bunch of things and are doing a bunch of things to bring cost down inside the hotels by creating really good efficiencies that I think will more than offset that component of it. But cost to build are going up and financing is not particularly readily available. For the best owners, it is and people are starting new build projects in the U.S. and around the world. 
But I suspect and sort of built in, Shaun, to our expectations on unit growth is that the U.S., you will see a cycle where, particularly in the U.S., the new construction numbers are going to be much, much lower. That's obviously long-term healthy for the industry. But the good news for us is the world is a big place. And the pressures are not the same in all places in the world, particularly recognizing that the place where we get the second biggest chunk of our growth is Asia Pacific and China in particular. And those pressures are very different in the sense that they're less and there's a lot more financing available, et cetera, et cetera.  
And so not unlike coming out of the Great Recession, our job is to be really resilient. This is the benefit of an investment in a big global company. I think we're really good at this and sort of anticipating and adapting to the trends. And like after the Great Recession, the same thing happened in the U.S. It wasn't so much an inflationary issue. It was just a dearth of capital. And new construction starts went way down. That's what's happening here. That will be healthy for the industry. 
And what did we do? We pivoted then the same way we're pivoting now, just with more tools in the toolkit, meaning conversions become a much larger part of what we're doing. And we have -- we are much further along in terms of the relationships we have around the world in the areas of the world that are continuing to not only motor along but pick up steam. I mean I think in China, as an example, our second biggest market, we're going to sign more, start more and open more deals than I think we ever have this year, right? And so diversification is a powerful thing. Ultimately, I do believe the pressures on the cost to build will abate over a period of time, and I don't think it will be that long a period of time. 
I'm highly confident that the financing markets will have been easing up and will continue to ease up. And the U.S., in terms of new development or new construction starts, will be a huge engine of opportunity for us as it always has been and then pick up a lot of steam. And I'm sure other things around the world will happen over time where they slow down. But we're very quick on our feet, not to pat us on the back too much, but I think we've been able for 15 years to continue to drive really good growth while lots of crazy things are going on around the world because there are different conditions and there's ways to continue to grow.  
And so while we do starting -- finishing with where we started, we do worry about it. I think we have a plan to address it. I think we've built that into the expectations that we've provided to you guys in terms of where we think growth will be."

But I think to get both room nights and rate and the compression we need requires, certainly in the U.S., it broadly requires the bigger groups to be back.

A l",526,"It's another reason I think it takes time to get back to '19 levels, sort of my picking up from my earlier answer, is because I do think not only have people cut budgets, not everybody was Amazon or whatever that has really benefited during this time. A lot of them, most businesses, by number, have been really negatively impacted by the pandemic, and they need to cut expenses. And so I'm highly confident, as is the case with any cyclical downturn in recovery when this happens, that those budgets will build back, but it will take will take some time. 
Now I think in the second half of this year, I think, number one, there's a huge amount of pent-up demand. And by definition, they only have half a year to spend whatever they have anyway because nobody is doing a ton of traveling in the first half of the year. So I think ironically, I think there's plenty of budget capacity. I look at our own budget. There's plenty of budget capacity when you talk to businesses for the rest of this year. I think as you go into next year, if we're in a full-scale recovery while people are going to, for a period of time, want to be thrifty, I think in the end, it will just be what the opportunity set is. 
And if it were in a robust recovery, what I have seen -- again, I can't prove it, but I've seen it in every other cycle as you get into that, the rope gets -- they let -- businesses let the rope through their hands because they have to. They have to deliver alpha. They have to compete against other businesses in -- that are trying to do the same thing. And so they have to -- their people have to get out on the road. They have to have meetings. 
They have to build their culture, innovate, collaborate, get out and get their sales forces out and do all the things they do. So the steeper the slope of the recovery, the fact -- like in every other cyclical recovery, and that's when we get through the pandemic, we're done largely with the help and you're in a cyclical economic recovery. The steeper the slope, the faster it comes back. That's just the way it's always worked. I don't think it'll be any different here. 
But it will -- that's why I said '23, '24. Again, I said probably, I'd take the earlier of that rather than the later given the current slope of what we're seeing. But that's why it takes longer. We will get back to room nights, I think, faster because we'll still find room nights that are lower-rated business because we've gotten really good at that. But we're going to want to shift the mix out over the next couple of years to the higher-rated business, get more compression from groups to ultimately get back there. So I think budgets will normalize sort of between now and 2023 if the slope of the recovery is what we think -- is what we're seeing."

I think when you boil it down, I don't think there is going to be any material shift. I do believe in the -- obviously, short to intermediate term, there's a shift because like everybody, not all of our owners, but most of our owners are dealing with a very difficult situation. I would say the 99.9%. Now some of them are much further along in the recovery because their portfolios are in markets that have had rapid recovery, resort markets, Southern U.S. and they're doing pretty well. But broadly, the owner community obviously has been hurting as have we as have the whole industry. There's not -- it's not like it's been easy on any of us. 
We obviously have deployed a whole host of things to be supportive of the owner community, and those are still fully deployed in the sense of working very hard with a lot of folks on behalf of the industry for government support in the right areas. And we don't -- we have not stopped those efforts, and I do believe as we get to a real recovery, there's opportunities to help -- get helped with real stimulus to get people moving again. And so we continue to work day and night on those efforts as things evolve. 
And obviously, we've done a whole bunch of work in the short term to provide massive amounts of relief from standards across the board so that owners could make -- manage their way. We could all manage our way to the other side. I mentioned it in passing but it's worth mentioning again. We call it our hotel, the future work. We're looking in a very granular way across every one of our brands. We're not done with the work, but we're done with a lot of the work to figure out when we get to the other side, how do we deliver the incredible experience for the customer that continues to drive the premiums that we've had, by the way, which are at the highest levels in our history at this moment but also do it in a way that's more cost efficient for our ownership community. 
I'm highly confident, as I said, even with the labor pressures that we are going to experience here in the U.S. particularly, that when it's all said and done, we're going to be able to drive higher margins. So on a like-for-like basis, if you believe, which I do that when you get out a couple of years, you're going to have similar demand levels to '18 or '19. Even with the cost pressures, we believe that we have engineered a way to be able to drive even greater returns. 
So our owners, while it's difficult now, when we get to the other side, both their existing assets and their opportunity set for doing new development, we think, are going to be better than what we had pre-pandemic because we think we're just doing a better -- we're going to do -- we are and we'll continue to do a better job. 
And so that's a long-winded way of getting to the answer, which I gave you at the beginning. So as a result of that, I don't think there'll be a meaningful difference. I mean with some owners, there may be. But I would say in the main, I don't think so. I think the owner community that we deal with, which is an immensely diversified community, we have 10,000 owners around the world that we deal with. The vast majority of them, this is their business. This is what they do, own and operate on a franchise basis, and it's all they do. It's not the case across all 10,000 owners, but the bulk of our system, this is what people do. 
And I don't think if we can deliver for them the premiums we've delivered, which have only gone up and do it in a way where they can get more to the bottom line, that they're going to abandon their business model. I think they're going to want to carry on. But it takes some time, right, just being pragmatic because this has been really difficult and which is why we worked so hard to sort of help create the bridges, both in what we could do, what the government could do to get them to the other side. And why I said in my -- honestly, in my earlier comments, particularly in the U.S., where why I think the new development side, all of these pressures, and just the pressures of owners broadly is going to mean it's going to take a little time for the new construction side of development to pick up the -- what it was pre-pandemic. 
But that will happen in my opinion. And I think the relationship will be much more similar than different to what it was and as I said before. In the meantime, it's a big world. And we've pivoted, and we're doing some really cool things around the world to make sure that we continue to enhance our network effect and deliver more hotels and more fees."

So even in normal times, that ownership was down to 7% to 8% of our overall EBITDA, something like that in 2019. And we've been saying for a long time that if we think about our portfolio, it's about 60 hotels, primarily leases, about 20 of them were strategic. We'll be in those leases no matter what. 
Over time, they have good coverage. They're important hotels. We've got 20 at the bottom where there's sort of legacy -- they are legacy deals that we inherited, fixed lease payments in markets that aren't as robust. Those, we will exit no matter what, when the leases are up. And then there's about 20 that are in the middle where when the leases roll, we sit down with the landlord. And if we can work out an arrangement that we think makes sense for us to continue, we continue. If we don't, we get out. 
And we've sort of been rolling our way out of 3 to 4 of them a year. We think it's actually probably more like 6 to 8 of them this year that we'll transition out of, either transitioning them to management agreements or franchise agreements or just getting out.

In the last cycle, it got to something in the 40% range of overall deliveries, probably doesn't get -- and we think we've said this publicly as well. It probably doesn't get back to that level this cycle just because the denominator likely won't contract that dramatically. But we do think conversions will continue to be a bigger contributor. It will be a little bit lumpy. A lot of them are larger hotels.

Just like we're seeing in the U.S., even though we don't have much inbound travel going on, we don't have any outbound going on. And so I think in the end, Europe's opportunity for the early stages of recovery are robust. 
For the same reason, while they're not going to have inbound from China or other markets, they're not going to have any outbound. And Europeans like to travel, particularly in the summer like to go on vacations. And when it's open and they can, they will and they'll stay within the confines of either their countries or the region. So I think it's going to be fine. 
Obviously, longer term, as you get to a more stabilized world, you want to open up these travel quarters. We -- I had a meeting with the White House last week, maybe the week before, as I said, with Premier Li of China, the week before that. And we were talking about a lot of topics, but that was a primary topic, both with the Chinese administration and the U.S. administration on trying to figure out how do we figure out as the world is getting vaccinated, and it's a little uneven. But as certain countries are getting heavily vaccinated and getting to a reasonable level of herd immunity, how do we open up safe travel quarters. 
Europe is doing the same thing. Those discussions are ongoing. We're trying to get those discussions going with the U.S. They are obviously already starting to have those discussions with China. And so I don't -- that will take some time. I think it's -- I think you will start to see some bilateral agreements or multilateral agreements in the second half of this year. I think we're at a stage right now where everybody is still focused on vaccination to get their herd immunity. But with the overwhelming amount of supply of vaccines, which aren't all distributed perfectly around the world or even around our country at this point, but the numbers are becoming overwhelming. The surpluses are going to become, as we get into the summer, my sense is overwhelming. And we're going to be able to have a shifting of those resources around the world to the markets most in need as we get into July -- June, July, August, September and into the latter part of the year, that is going to allow for a reasonably -- hopefully, a reasonable trajectory in terms of some of these economies getting to a better place. 
China is obviously already in a reasonably good place. So as the U.S. sort of has a few more months than Europe, I think there are real opportunities to start opening travel quarters. I do think it will happen that way just based on the discussions I'm having with multiple administrations and that our teams are having. I don't think it's going to be like one day, the world is open. Like, yay, everybody -- I think it's going to be agreements between like the U.S. and the U.K., the EU and China, the U.S. and China, that will allow for those quarters to open up, make sure that there's flight capacity, that the regime for vaccination, testing and all that is sort of -- is bolted down. 
So that's a long answer because it needs to be. It's complicated. I think in the second half of the year, my hope is and belief is that you're going to start to see some of those quarters open up. We're pushing everybody really hard. But in the meantime, I think we're fine just because if a quarter is not open, as I said, people are restrained in leaving their country or their territory. And they're going to start traveling when they feel safe, and you're going to keep all that pent-up demand in your local market."

And listen, we talk to them every day, and we operate a lot of properties. It is singularly, at the moment, I wouldn't say the only issue when you're in a global pandemic. There's lots of issues, but it's one of the most important issues because it is very difficult, particularly here in the U.S. to get labor, and it is constraining recovery at certain times because you just can't get -- you can't get enough people to service the properties. 
I do think in the short term, I've already said it, and it's implied in earlier questions, there's going to be wage pressure, wage inflation. I do think it will stabilize and then work itself out as we get later into the year. It's a complex issue that is at the intersection of people being concerned about their health still, particularly in some of the communities that we need to get focused back -- in coming back to work. And that's going to take some time, both vaccination and marketing to a number of those communities, to get vaccinated and getting it done and getting them to a place where they feel safe being in a workplace. So that's part of it. 
And then the other part of it is getting kids back in school because a lot of people in the workforce are taking care of kids. They don't -- there's no day care, the school becomes daycare. And the federal government, for all the right reasons, way back when did a top-up of unemployment insurance and on top of the state unemployment insurance and obviously sent out $1,400 checks. And they did all these things to support people who are in harm's way, all of which made sense at the time. Maybe some of it makes a little bit less sense now in the sense that the demand is there and the jobs are there, yet people don't have as much of a need to come back to it. 
So -- but that, in theory, on September, whatever, 6th, the federal top-up expires. I guess, it could be extended. My impression is it will not be. My hope is it will not be, not because I don't care about the people. I think there's just enough jobs. We literally -- I think, there are 3 million of our, not Hilton, but industry folks still out of work. I think by the time you get to September, October, I think the vast majority of those could easily be reemployed given what I think demand will be in the business. And that's best for everybody, right? It's best for the country. It's best for the individual team members to -- but it's -- that's the convergence of all of that. So I think it's going to be tough. I've been talking to tons of owners. 
I think it will be tough between now and September. I think when we -- by the time you get to September, mass vaccination will hopefully be behind us. Kids will be back in school, and people will feel safe -- that it's safe to go back, and they want to get back and be earning a paycheck. And so I think it will then stabilize as we get into the latter part of the year."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. As I think our second quarter results demonstrate, we continue to make significant progress towards recovery, working hard to serve all of our stakeholders; for our guests to deliver reliable and friendly experiences in a very demanding environment for our team members to maintain an award-winning culture by creating an inclusive, safe and welcoming environment full of opportunities; for our owners to drive value through premium market share and efficient and effective operating models; for our communities to remain a positive force for good at a time when it is needed most. And finally, for our shareholders to maximize profits, free cash flow and overall total returns. 
We're pleased to see that our diligence and determination are beginning to pay off. As much of the world reopens, the pent-up demand for travel we've been anticipating is happening. While the pace of recovery varies and COVID variants remain a risk, we are seeing significant sequential improvement in every major region. 
In the second quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 234% year-over-year. Compared to 2019, RevPAR was down 36%, improving 7 percentage points versus the first quarter with June RevPAR improving 24 percentage points versus the first quarter and down only 29 points versus 2019. 
Additionally, 30% of system-wide comparable hotels exceeded 2019 RevPAR levels in June. Adjusted EBITDA was $400 million, up 684% year-over-year performance was driven by strong leisure demand and rate growth. For the second quarter, U.S. leisure demand exceeded prior peak levels with rates at 90% of prior peaks. This positive momentum continued into July with system-wide and U.S. leisure room nights and rate exceeding 2019 levels. 
Business transient also increased meaningfully throughout the quarter with June RevPAR for the segment increasing 20 percentage points from the first quarter. We saw improving results in small- and medium-sized businesses and positive momentum across larger accounts. In June, business transient room night demand was 70% of 2019 levels with rate over 80% of 2019 levels. We continue to see progress in July with similar room night demand and rates at 90% of 2019 levels. 
Group performance in the quarter also improved sequentially, driven primarily by social groups given seasonally higher leisure demand. Overall group demand increased nearly 20 percentage points sequentially from the first quarter ending June at more than half of 2019 levels. 
Additionally, group bookings for next year are at rates above 2019 peaks. Approximately 99% of our hotels are now open and operating, including some of our largest urban and group properties. In the last few months, we were thrilled to celebrate the reopenings of the Legendary Palmer House Hilton, the Chicago Hilton and the Hilton San Francisco Union Square. 
As government restrictions loosen and more people are vaccinated, we continue to see positive momentum in demand and an increasing ability to push rate. For July month-to-date, system-wide demand is 85% of 2019 levels with rates equal to 2019.
In the U.S., July RevPAR is roughly 85% of 2019 levels. And in China, RevPAR is now above prior peak. With increasing transient bookings, digital traffic and group sales leads, we are optimistic about the forward trends. Turning to development. We delivered another robust quarter of growth with net units increasing 7% year-over-year ahead of expectations due to strong openings in the U.S. and fewer overall removals. 
During the quarter, we added 119 hotels totaling nearly 20,000 rooms and celebrated the 5-year anniversary of Tru with the opening of its 200th property, with nearly 270 hotels in development, Tru continues expanding across the U.S. and Canada as well as moving into new markets in the Caribbean and Latin America. 
We were also thrilled to celebrate the highly anticipated opening of Resorts World Las Vegas last month, marking the first ground-up resort development on the strip in over a decade. The property features 3 of our premium brands, Hilton, Conrad and LXR and adds 3,500 rooms to our portfolio, with expansive meeting and event space, 120,000 square foot casino, 40 world-class food and beverage options and a concert and entertainment venue with capacity for 5,000 attendees, This spectacular property raises the bar for Las Vegas and delivers on our long-standing promise to return to The Strip. 
Along with the recently opened Virgin Hotels Las Vegas Curio, we are now -- we now have more than 30 properties totaling 11,000 rooms across 12 brands in the city. Las Vegas is also the first U.S. market to house all 3 of our luxury brands. 
Earlier this month, we debuted our premier meetings and events focused brands Signia by Hilton with the opening of the Signia Orlando Bonnet Creek. The property will undergo a multiphase transformation featuring the addition of more than 94,000 square feet of multifunctional meeting and event space designed for an elevated meeting experience. In the quarter, we also broke ground on the nearly 1,000 room Signia Atlanta scheduled to open in 2023. Our exceptional brands and industry-leading RevPAR premiums continue to drive a high-quality pipeline. 
In the quarter, we signed nearly 26,000 rooms, up 40% year-over-year and increasing from our first quarter pace given strength in the Americas and Asia Pacific regions. We ended the quarter with approximately 401,000 rooms in development, more than half of which are under construction. We had a record number of conversion signings in the quarter, representing 40 hotels and accounting for approximately 30% of our total signings, including the Conrad Gielaguna Sardinia, the Conrad Shanghai, which will be our largest Conrad in Asia with more than 725 rooms, and the Hotel One LXR located Jeff steps away from Seattle's iconic Pike Place market. 
Further expanding our all-inclusive and luxury portfolios, we announced the signing of 3 beachfront resorts in Mexico earlier this month. The Hilton Virta Riviere, all-inclusive resort; the Hilton's Loom, all-inclusive resort; and the Conrad Tulum, will add more than 1,500 rooms to our existing 70 hotel portfolio in Mexico, demonstrating our commitment to continued expansion across the region and growing our all-inclusive resort footprint. Travelers will soon be able to choose from an even wider variety of Hilton branded all-inclusive resorts globally. 
We expect positive development trends to continue and remain confident in our expectations to deliver mid-single-digit net unit growth over the next several years. For 2021, we expect net unit growth in the 5% to 5.5% range, above prior expectations given the pace of openings year-to-date. Delivering on guest desire for more flexibility in their travel experience and solving a long-time travel frustration. Last month, we launched confirmed connecting rooms, a first in the industry, this innovative technology enables guests to easily book and instantly confirm at least 2 connecting rooms. As families and friends begin to reunite, reconnect and travel again, we're excited to create a seamless travel experience from booking through stay. 
We continue to prioritize unique opportunities to engage our nearly 120 million Honors members, driving value for them through our enhanced partnerships and points redemption offerings. In the quarter, membership grew 10% year-over-year. On average, our premium members are staying with us even more frequently than in 2019. For the quarter, Honors members accounted for 58% of occupancy, reaching a high of 61% in May, only 2% below May of 2019. 
As we head into the back half of the year, we know it's critical to lead with our culture, which was recently earned -- which recently earned us the #1 spot on Diversity Inc.'s list of top 50 companies for diversity. We were also thrilled to invite all of our team members to return to our headquarters last week. The energy and excitement in the office is palpable, and we're thrilled to be back fostering a collaborative environment which allows for innovative thinking as we remain focused on our strategic priorities and the bright future ahead. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kevin to give you more details on our results for the quarter."

During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 233.8% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis as recovery accelerated driven by strong global vaccine rollouts, relaxed government restriction",642,"Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 233.8% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis as recovery accelerated driven by strong global vaccine rollouts, relaxed government restrictions and surging leisure demand, particularly in the U.S. 
As Chris mentioned, system-wide RevPAR was down 36.1% compared to 2019. Performance was largely balanced between occupancy and rate growth. Adjusted EBITDA was $400 million in the second quarter, and those results reflect relaxed travel restrictions and strengthening global demand. Management and franchise fees grew 220% and demonstrating the resiliency of our fee-based business model. 
Additionally, results were helped by continued cost control at both the corporate and property levels. Our ownership portfolio posted a loss for the quarter due to the more challenged demand environment throughout Europe and Japan and related suspensions of hotel operations. Fixed operating costs further weighed on performance. 
Overall, the ownership segment performed better than expected, largely due to continued cost control. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $0.56. 
Turning to our regional performance. Second quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR grew 234% year-over-year and was down 31% versus 2019. Demand improved sequentially throughout the quarter with occupancy averaging roughly 70% in June. Strong leisure demand, combined with improving business transient trends drove rate improvement across the U.S. with weekend ADR finishing June, down mid-single digits as compared to 2019 rate and weekday rates down in the high single digits. 
In the Americas outside the U.S., second quarter RevPAR increased 390% year-over-year and was down 54% versus 2019 While limited international travel weighed on overall performance, easing restrictions and strong leisure demand drove improving trends in June. 
In Europe, RevPAR grew 470% year-over-year and was down 72% versus 2019. While the region saw month-over-month improvement, rising COVID cases and prolonged travel restrictions, continued to weigh on performance. 
In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR increased 287% year-over-year and was down 35% versus 2019. Performance benefited from strong domestic leisure demand with rate now nearly recovered to 2019 levels in July. 
In the Asia Pacific region, second quarter RevPAR grew 143% year-over-year and was down 33% versus 2019. RevPAR in China was down less than 9% as compared to 2019 with rising COVID cases in June temporarily disrupting strong performance trends in April and May. 
However, as Chris mentioned, China has since rebounded with RevPAR now trending above 2019 levels. In the rest of the Asia Pacific region, performance was tempered due to lockdowns in India and continued travel restrictions across Japan. 
Turning to development. As Chris mentioned, in the second quarter, we grew net units 7%. Our pipeline grew sequentially, totaling 401,000 rooms at the end of the quarter with 62% of pipeline rooms located outside the U.S. Despite the challenges brought about by the pandemic, developer appetite for Hilton brands remained strong across the globe. As travel restrictions ease, regions prepare for recovery and owners focus on growth opportunities, development activity and interest is gaining momentum. 
For the full year, we expect signings to increase in the high single to low double-digit range year-over-year. We expect net unit growth of 5% to 5.5%. 
Turning to the balance sheet. During the quarter, we fully repaid the outstanding $1.2 billion balance on our revolving credit facility. As we look ahead, we remain confident in our balance sheet and financial flexibility as we move forward into the recovery and move closer towards our target leverage. Further details on our second quarter can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning.

Good question, and happy to give a little bit more color. If you think about around the world on the development side, I think so goes the recovery sort of so goes the development is probably the simplest way to think about it. So",702,"Yes. Stephen, thank you. Good question, and happy to give a little bit more color. If you think about around the world on the development side, I think so goes the recovery sort of so goes the development is probably the simplest way to think about it. So versus our earlier expectations and why we're a bit more optimistic, obviously, and have raised our outlook for the year is largely driven by what we were seeing in faster recovery in the U.S. and faster recovery in Asia, really China. And I'd say those are sort of the largest drivers. If you think about recovery, that's where -- as we suggested in the prepared comments, that's where we see the steepest slope of recovery Europe is obviously -- we knew would be lagging and isn't contributing as much as the U.S. and China is at this point. But obviously, our expectation there is as the U.K. and Europe continue to open, we'll see a meaningful uptick there. So I think it's pretty much that simple slope of recovery steeper, more activity on the development side in terms of both signings and openings, people are back at it and picking up steam. 
On the conversions, I'd say just modestly better. We -- as you would note from prior calls, we've been -- We've had high expectations for conversions. We have some great conversion brands. The system is performing at the highest levels from a market share point of view that it's ever performed in our history. And I think that's a great leading indicator for opportunities to convince folks who are independent to come into the fold as well as folks that have weaker brands that are looking for a better performance to come into the fold, both of which are happening at a little bit better than our expectations. And so while we had -- we expected things to pick up in the conversion area. I would say, this year and then leading into next because a lot of -- some of the signings will take some time. Most of them have pretty quickly, but some of them will take some time in terms of CapEx work, property improvement programs and the like. It's modestly better than what were pretty high expectations. 
In terms of the financing environment, I mean, there's a lot to discuss. I think -- so we can get to lots of other questions. I think the simple answer is it's improving. I mean the world is a big place. So again, following the slope of recovery, the U.S. and China, I would say the financing markets are recovering most rapidly because markets are efficient. When performance is starting to really pick up and not just from an occupancy, but you're getting back to rate levels very rapidly, probably more rapidly than I've ever seen in my 40 years of doing this. What happens is the lender community starts to have more confidence. Rates are obviously hyper low and have been low and lenders need yield. And so the more comfort they get the recoveries a foot and that there's going to be a recovery back to where we were and then beyond, the more they're willing to take the risk, go a little bit further out on the risk spectrum and underwrite it. 
And so you're seeing pretty robust financing markets in China. The U.S. is still has a ways to go. I mean you can look at the data out there, it's not anywhere near where it was, but it's improving. And my expectation is as you get into the fall, and I'm sure we'll talk about this, I'll leave it for other questions. And our belief, my belief is that we're going to continue to have very, very strong recovery in the fall and into next year, you're going to continue to see a gradual increase in financing that's available certainly here in the U.S. I think Europe will take a little longer. So a ways to go, I'm not saying it's back anywhere near where it was. It's a long way off. But of sort of off the floors of what we had seen last year."

We -- if you look at the numbers, we had a little bit higher key money in the quarter than we would typically have. What I would say is I don't see anything that -- I don't think anything is changing materially, meaning still over 90% of the deals that we are doing are dry deals. We're not spending -- we're not using the balance sheet anyway. So there's not any material shift, given what's going on in the broader macro environment, the financing markets. Nothing material that shifted. The reason you're seeing a little bit heavier key money spend right now is a super positive story in the sense that both things that we've been working on for a long time and/or opportunities that have arisen because of the pandemic have sort of come together in an unusual way this year. So example, some of the bigger key money expenditures are iconic assets for our portfolio largely resort-oriented that we've been working on that will be generational. They'll be in the system for decades and decades and decades. So the Walter Pastoria in Monarch Beach and Laguna. I've literally been working on that deal one way or another for 20 years, I think. between host and here. And that's in the system, an incredible addition to the Waldorf brand. 
Resorts World, which I talked about in my prepared comments, 3,500 rooms on The Strip. We're basically the only major player on The Strip with a massive meetings platform and 3,500 rooms. We've been working on that for a number of years. Not a crazy amount of key money by any means. But relative to our normal expenditures significant. 
And then the deals that I talked about in Mexico, the 3 deals, 1,500 rooms, in Puerto Baarda. And then in Tulum, these are incredible assets that were either existing in the 1 case in PV was an existing hotel that was operating with another brand. And in the case of Tulum, was developed literally over 20 years to get the entitlements with another brand. And because of COVID and what has happened in the industry presented an opportunity for us. And so that allowed us to enter the zone on hotels that would have taken us a decade to sort of pull together and in a matter of 6 or 12 months, we're going to have these purpose-built incredible hotels in the system. And so that's -- I know a long answer, but I view all of those, and then there's some others that I'm not that I'm not even mentioning, but those are the big ones as like incredible progress for us in all inclusive in resorts and in luxury. Those deals just don't come around that often. We're getting a few more of them now, as I said, aided by COVID. So maybe the -- I would say, our spending overall is going to be up probably this year and next year relative to 2020, but 2020 was a depressed year. If you look at it versus our normal run rate like '17, '18 and '19, honestly, I think our overall CapEx is sort of going to be within the ranges that we would have been. But again, I don't see anything -- we don't see anything material. We still think over 90% of our deals are going to be dry. And when we have these really unique opportunities, even with key money, they're very nice returns for us, and they're incredibly, I think, strategic and important to the system."

And we have obviously talked a bunch about it. We, ultimately, that's a decision we'll go to our board with. We have an upcoming meeting. We've had broader dialogue, but we haven't pinned it down. But I said on the last call, that I was pretty confident that we would be reinstituting return of capital program next year. I still feel that way. Obviously, the slope of the recovery is even steeper. So I would say the update to that would be -- I feel confident that we're going to do in the first half of next year. the exact date and time to be determined when we talk to our Board. But I think you should read the results of second quarter, you should read the commentary that Kevin and I gave in our prepared comments, plus everything you're hopefully going to get in color to say that we're very optimistic. We know we're not -- we read the papers, I talk to a lot of people. We're not oblivious to the delta variant and things that are going on. in the world, but we're confident because we think we will power through that. The trends that we see real time are very strong and improving. We feel really good about that going to happen in the fall. And so yes, we -- every quarter that goes by, I think we feel better and better about where the recovery is going. And so that should ultimately translate into our feeling better about starting to return capital because we'll be generating real significant free cash flow. In my mind next year, and we do not need to hoard it, our belief has always been that, as I said in my prior answer, we're going to be able to keep growing with very little use of our own balance sheet. And so we're going to give it back to folks. So my expectation is in the first half of next year, that program will resume, and we'll be having some discussion with our Board in the very near future."

So I'll give you I mean we do have some data points and some -- and I'll give you my opinion on top of it. I mean, we've obviously seen, as Kevin and I both described in the nuggets that we gave in our comments that you wouldn't find in the press release, we've seen really nice recovery and that recovery has been across the board. Obviously, the greatest strength in leisure, but significant pickup in business travel and significant pickup while further to go in the group side. And we continue to see that notwithstanding the delta variant and all the things going on, like I got just last night, as an example, system-wide U.S., occupancy was 74%. -- trailing 7 days, 74%. That's with the urban market. That's with some urban hotels not even open and those are in the comp set. And with all of our -- so all of the urban hotels, obviously, the urban environment has been lagging a little bit. So what that says to you, like last night, if we're running 74%, that's not leisure. I mean while we have a leisure-oriented hotels, we have a lot of business-oriented hotels. And so mid-week occupancies at that level are definitely reflective of business travel being back. And we've seen it, literally, it's funny sort of post Memorial Day I mean, you just saw the shift. You just saw a shift where weekday occupancies went up 10% or 20% at any given night, went up 10 or 20 percentage points. and that was business travel, dominated by small and medium-sized businesses, by the way. But even pre-COVID, keep in mind, 80% of our business travel was small and medium-sized business, right? So that's sort of currently what's going on. I know your question is forward looking, and I promise you I'm going to get to that. I think the trajectory, my own view, and I think the data sort of supports this as you get into August, what's going to happen is you're going to continue to have massive surge in leisure travel because everybody wants to get out, notwithstanding, again, the delta variance and the like. We've not seen impact in sort of consumer behavior from that. So I think you're going to have a continued very good strength in the leisure. I do think in August, you'll -- as you always do, you will see business transient fall off a little bit, right, just because people are going to be like they always do, they're going to be not traveling for business as much and going on more vacations, and it's sort of the last 2 [indiscernible] before maybe a lot of people going back to work and the kids are going fine, they're going back to school and all that fun stuff. But when you get to the fall, and limited -- we have limited data, obviously, this far out. So this is -- I gave you data points that I have real time today. When you get 60, 90 days out, business transient stats, a lot of the bookings haven't occurred. So this is where it gets into my view of what I think will happen. I think you get after Labor Day, I do believe -- I'm not a health expert, but I'm talking to a lot of I do believe we will have powered through the Delta thing, if you look at the stats on hospitalization and the like, they're really not, not terrible. If you look at what's happened in the U.K. and we're sort of 3 or 4 weeks behind them. The patterns there right now are quite good. They have infection rates down 50% on a trailing 12 day basis over there. So I think there's a lot of reasons to be optimistic that we sort of power through that. And when we get to the fall, here's what I think we do know, kids are going back to school. I mean, we'll debate whether they were in master or not, some places, yes, but they're going back to school, I'm pretty confident in that. And offices are opening. I mean they may open different times. Some people you're reading you're going to push it a month or whatever. Obviously, I said we're open. We're open and operating here at our -- at all of our headquarters. But you're going to have people back at work, which means with kids in school, with baby sitters and with people in the office, you're going to have more propensity to want to travel. And when we talk to customers, again, I can't give you the booking data because it's too far out, when we talk to customers, anecdotally, it supports all of that, that when you get into the fall, people are going to be traveling. There's both pent-up demand, okay, if things they've been needing to do, and then there's just demand generally to -- for folks to be able to run their businesses. And so I think as you get into the fall, you're going to see the natural reduction in the leisure as we always do because now kids are in school, they weren't last year. Kids are in school, people are back in the office at don't have as much time to go on vacation. I do believe, again, I can't prove it, but my belief is leisure will be elevated for a while because we're still living in a bit of a hybrid world. But I think business transient will come back. Group will obviously take a little longer gestation period, but group will definitely be coming back, the booking trends into the third, particularly the fourth quarter are much better than they've been. 
And I think we're motoring forward. In terms of -- last time I believe I said that I think we'd be back to sort of 70% by the end of the year of '19 levels. And obviously, I feel better. So while we're not giving guidance, so I'm not going to do it. We're not ready to start doing that. There's still enough uncertainty where we want to wait, we do, do forecast, okay? I mean we're not -- it's not [indiscernible] mock here. We are looking at our numbers. 
And I'd say our view is demand levels probably -- RevPAR levels are probably in the U.S. and globally somewhere circa 80% versus the 70% I thought in our current thinking demand levels probably back to 85%. So we're getting there. And we're -- I mean, again, much -- I said last time, recovery has been much steeper than we thought. I say it again today. Just things have been coming back more quickly than we would have thought. We knew they'd come back. Obviously, you all know I've been optimistic about the recovery, but it's even better than I would have thought. I think one of the most surprising things, although it shouldn't be to any of us because as I kid our team, the laws of economics are alive and well. And the most surprising thing is how quickly rate comes back. But that's -- again, that's just demand, right? We're pricing demand, we're being really smart about it. But I do believe when this -- when we look back on this recovery, the most unusual thing relative to any other period of my almost 40 years of doing this will be just a rapid return of rate."

It takes time to plan it. They want to sort of get through their budget season before they know how much money they have. But I'm not worried about the volumes next year. Again, they're a bit -- they're not where we were at '19. They're close, but they're not there, but the rates above. And so what I've been -- honestly, what I've been saying to our teams is be really careful like we -- there's going to be a monumental amount of demand. We don't want to give it away. We want to make sure that we're pricing. Even though we're not at the volumes now, my expectation very strongly is it's all going to fill in, it just takes it a little bit longer given what's the reason for this recession being a health issue and sort of getting through the final stages of that, in my opinion, is required before you really get the momentum on the volume. And so that's why rates are up is because we're being super disciplined recognizing that there's a limited amount of meeting space, there's going to be a guarantee amount of demand. and we can be a bit patient, I think, given what's going on."

I think this year, it will be that or maybe even a little bit higher given sort of the number of signings we had in the second quarter. And so that's -- I think that's a good way to think about it. And look, we are doing more conversions. Very happy with the convergence in the second quarter, really nice mix between hard brands, soft brands, conversions from independents, conversions from other brands regionally. So very happy with that. But that said, our pace of deliveries of new builds is going up as well.

The idea of -- I'll do the third one next, the idea of '22 being affected, not as much.

It's a great question. Labor shortage is a real issue. Probably the single biggest issue that we're dealing with it is definitely not just for Hilton, but industry. all service industries and manufacturing and a lot of your supply chain",520,"Yes, thanks, Rick. It's a great question. Labor shortage is a real issue. Probably the single biggest issue that we're dealing with it is definitely not just for Hilton, but industry. all service industries and manufacturing and a lot of your supply chain issues that you're reading about every day. All of this is sort of interconnected to not having enough labor. At a high level, I think it will largely resolve itself over the next couple of quarters in the sense that I think there are a lot of complex reasons behind it. Some of it is obviously health. People still don't feel like, particularly with the Delta variant now that they should go back to work, some people because they're worried about their health as already been -- we haven't had kids in schools, so we don't effectively have day care. They're women in the workforce or where it's been most dramatically impacted because they have to stay home to take care of kids. And then some of the government programs that were really important last year in the depths of this crisis have -- aren't as important right now when there's a ton of opportunity for employment and that is unemployment insurance of the federal top-up, but that goes away in early September. So I think when you get kids back in school, we get past these late hopefully, the last wave with Delta and unemployment insurance goes away in the early fall. I think you're going to start to see a significant easing of the issues on the labor side. 
In terms of what its impact on margins, given that we're able to -- while there are service issues, all of us are having, we're obviously working awfully hard to deliver great service. And I think we are doing a very good job given the difficult circumstances. We are doing it with less labor. And so ironically, given demand and given the ability to price the demand, margins are , in many cases, unbelievably high because you're getting effectively rates that are consistent with what you had before, and you can't get the labor, so you just have less cost. That obviously is a temporary thing. You're going to have more labor ultimately in the hotels. 
Having said that, long term, we've done a bunch of things in the crisis in terms of testing and learning on different ways to change the operating model, particularly as it relates to housekeeping and food and beverage and then a whole host of other smaller things where we think we can deliver great experience for our customers. and do it more efficiently. And so I think when it all gets flushed through, and we're on the other side of this and through the stresses and strains on the labor issues we're talking about, I think we have developed a plan to have higher-margin businesses across all the major brands. And so yes, it's a big issue. We're spending a lot of time on it, but I do -- as the old adage goes, this, too, I think, shall pass."

I would say sort of atmospherically, I think it's a relatively small percentage of our portfolio.

But I'm not -- I'm just giving you the atmosphere, I don't -- we don't -- I don't have our data on it. I think that it is an issue but not a significant issue. 
And by the way, it's helping to a degree, it's also helping with rate because in some markets where they can't, they're reducing capacity and driving rate, which, by the way, back to Bill Crow, when we're done with it, maybe we can declare victory that we were actually really smart about not only rate recovery, but sort of how we manage occupancy versus rate to drive the best profitability. 
So in the hotels where they are having issues in many of them, and I can think of a few who I just talked to are having great success in sort of moderating occupancy levels down and then driving it on the top line. 
And net-net, they're making more money than if they had the incremental labor and they opened up the capacity. They're just -- their profitability is higher. So it's not all a bad story. Long term, obviously, the labor issues we have to sort -- I mean I already gave my answer. I do think they'll sort. There are a bunch of things we're doing to make sure that our system has unique opportunities to access labor and ultimately, to deliver the kind of service we want to deliver, we do need to get more labor in the hotels. But at the moment, from an owner point of view, in many cases, there some are limiting capacity, but I think it's a relatively small percentage."

So all the things we talked about, there's nothing structural there. It's just it's behind. It obviously was loss-making this quarter. It probably will be loss-making next quarter just because of the level of recovery and what's going to be needed in those parts of the world. And we think it's sort of breakeven-ish in Q4, we'll see what happens. Again, it's dependent on recovery and the world opening up a little bit. And then the last thing I'd say is, obviously, it's going to grow more quickly than the core business.

Well, over the next year, it's probably harder to judge over the next several years, obviously, our objective is to continue to enhance the value proposition for honors, such that, as I've been saying for a long time, you're sort of crazy not to be a member of honors. -- you get all the technology, you get a little bit of a discounted rate. You get the points, you can use the points to shop on Amazon by a concert ticket Live Nation, go travel the world and get rooms or food and beverage or a spa treatment or whatever, it's very much an opportunity to sort of create value. 
And if you're not an Honors member and you're staying with your sort of silly, I mean, just because you're effectively giving away value. And so that happens to be true. Obviously, we've been trying to, over the years, as I've talked about many times on these calls, sort of go high and low, make sure that for our most frequent travelers, it's a really relevant program. which I think we've done, but infrequent travelers as well. And that's probably been what's most game-changing for us, and I think it's helped us sort of over the last 5 years, lead the industry in percentage of occupancy represented by loyalty, which is we've made it relevant to somebody that travels 2 or 3 days a year and not just 60 or 100 days a year because it's a currency effectively, and there's a value proposition that works for them. 
And so being specific about it, we want to continue that. I mean my own view is we were running in the 60s pre-COVID. My goals are much higher for that pre-COVID, and I'm not setting up. I mean COVID set us back. But I think COVID also provided opportunities. And as you pointed out, in May, we were effectively only a couple of points different than we were in '19. Why would that be when our core traveler is not back. Well, I think it's 2 things. One, in May and June, our core travelers started to come back. Number two, we worked really hard in how we sort of shifted our upper funnel and lower funnel strategies for marketing to attract customers into the system that were traveling during COVID that weren't our core customers. 
And so we were able to get a bunch of those folks to say, ""Gosh, I would like to be an Honors member and sign up,"" and then realize this is a really good value proposition. So the whole thing during COVID has been to basically say, let's go really hard after the customer that maybe wasn't our core, wasn't An honors member, make sure they really understand the value proposition and then keep them in the system. And then when our core customer comes back, obviously, we believe we've got a great value proposition to understand. And when you put one and one together, you hope to get 3. And so the objective would be not to get back to where we were because that wasn't the objective pre-COVID is to get significantly beyond that. 
Why? Because we believe it's a better experience for our customer. Like the more -- the better the value proposition, the happier they are, the better experience with the technology, the happier they are from an ownership and system point of view, we lower our distribution costs. It's the lowest distribution change and the lowest cost distribution channel we have. 
So for all the right reasons, we want to continue to build very direct relationships. And my belief is when you wake up in 2 or 3 years, while COVID has obviously been a difficult time for everybody in the industry, including us, I do think it afforded us an opportunity to accelerate some of those efforts."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. As I think our second quarter results demonstrate, we continue to make significant progress towards recovery, working hard to serve all of our stakeholders; for our guests to deliver reliable and friendly experiences in a very demanding environment,; for our team members to maintain an award-winning culture by creating an inclusive, safe and welcoming environment full of opportunities; for our owners to drive value through premium market share and efficient and effective operating models; for our communities to remain a positive force for good at a time when it is needed most; and finally, for our shareholders to maximize profits, free cash flow and overall total returns.  
We're pleased to see that our diligence and determination are beginning to pay off. As much of the world reopens, the pent-up demand for travel we've been anticipating is happening. While the pace of recovery varies and COVID variants remain a risk, we are seeing significant sequential improvement in every major region.  
In the second quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 234% year-over-year. Compared to 2019, RevPAR was down 36%, improving 17 percentage points versus the first quarter, with June RevPAR improving 24 percentage points versus the first quarter and down only 29 points versus 2019.  
Additionally, 30% of system-wide comparable hotels exceeded 2019 RevPAR levels in June. Adjusted EBITDA was $400 million, up 684% year-over-year. Performance was driven by strong leisure demand and rate growth. For the second quarter, U.S. leisure demand exceeded prior peak levels, with rates at 90% of prior peaks. This positive momentum continued into July with system-wide and U.S. leisure room nights and rate exceeding 2019 levels.  
Business transient also increased meaningfully throughout the quarter, with June RevPAR for the segment increasing 20 percentage points from the first quarter. We saw improving results in small- and medium-sized businesses and positive momentum across larger accounts. In June, business transient room night demand was 70% of 2019 levels, with rate over 80% of 2019 levels. We continue to see progress in July with similar room night demand and rates at 90% of 2019 levels.  
Group performance in the quarter also improved sequentially, driven primarily by social groups given seasonally higher leisure demand. Overall, group demand increased nearly 20 percentage points sequentially from the first quarter, ending June at more than half of 2019 levels.  
Additionally, group bookings for next year are at rates above 2019 peaks. Approximately 99% of our hotels are now open and operating, including some of our largest urban and group properties. In the last few months, we were thrilled to celebrate the reopenings of the legendary Palmer House Hilton, the Chicago Hilton and the Hilton San Francisco Union Square.  
As government restrictions loosen and more people are vaccinated, we continue to see positive momentum in demand and an increasing ability to push rate. For July month-to-date, system-wide demand is 85% of 2019 levels, with rates equal to 2019. 
In the U.S., July RevPAR is roughly 85% of 2019 levels. And in China, RevPAR is now above prior peak. With increasing transient bookings, digital traffic and group sales leads, we are optimistic about the forward trends. 
Turning to development. We delivered another robust quarter of growth, with net units increasing 7% year-over-year ahead of expectations due to strong openings in the U.S. and fewer overall removals. During the quarter, we added 119 hotels totaling nearly 20,000 rooms and celebrated the 5-year anniversary of Tru with the opening of its 200th property. With nearly 270 hotels in development, Tru continues expanding across the U.S. and Canada as well as moving into new markets in the Caribbean and Latin America.  
We were also thrilled to celebrate the highly anticipated opening of Resorts World Las Vegas last month, marking the first ground-up resort development on the strip in over a decade. The property features 3 of our premium brands, Hilton, Conrad and LXR and adds 3,500 rooms to our portfolio, with expansive meeting and event space, 120,000 square foot casino, 40 world-class food and beverage options and a concert and entertainment venue with capacity for 5,000 attendees. This spectacular property raises the bar for Las Vegas and delivers on our long-standing promise to return to The Strip.  
Along with the recently opened Virgin Hotels Las Vegas Curio, we are now -- we now have more than 30 properties totaling 11,000 rooms across 12 brands in the city. Las Vegas is also the first U.S. market to house all 3 of our luxury brands.  
Earlier this month, we debuted our premier meetings and events focused brands Signia by Hilton, with the opening of the Signia Orlando Bonnet Creek. The property will undergo a multiphase transformation featuring the addition of more than 94,000 square feet of multifunctional meeting and event space designed for an elevated meeting experience. In the quarter, we also broke ground on the nearly 1,000 room Signia Atlanta scheduled to open in 2023. Our exceptional brands and industry-leading RevPAR premiums continue to drive a high-quality pipeline.  
In the quarter, we signed nearly 26,000 rooms, up 40% year-over-year and increasing from our first quarter pace given strength in the Americas and Asia Pacific regions. We ended the quarter with approximately 401,000 rooms in development, more than half of which are under construction. We had a record number of conversion signings in the quarter, representing 40 hotels and accounting for approximately 30% of our total signings, including the Conrad Chia Laguna, Sardinia, the Conrad Shanghai, which will be our largest Conrad in Asia with more than 725 rooms, and the Hotel 1000 LXR located just steps away from Seattle's iconic Pike Place Market.  
Further expanding our all-inclusive and luxury portfolios, we announced the signing of 3 beachfront resorts in Mexico earlier this month: The Hilton Vallarta Riviera All-Inclusive Resort; the Hilton Tulum All-Inclusive Resort; and the Conrad Tulum, will add more than 1,500 rooms to our existing 70 hotel portfolio in Mexico, demonstrating our commitment to continued expansion across the region and growing our all-inclusive resort footprint. Travelers will soon be able to choose from an even wider variety of Hilton-branded all-inclusive resorts globally.  
We expect the positive development trends to continue and remain confident in our expectations to deliver mid-single-digit net unit growth over the next several years. For 2021, we expect net unit growth in the 5% to 5.5% range, above prior expectations given the pace of openings year-to-date. Delivering on guest desire for more flexibility in their travel experience and solving a long-time travel frustration, last month, we launched confirmed connecting rooms, a first in the industry, this innovative technology enables guests to easily book and instantly confirm at least 2 connecting rooms. As families and friends begin to reunite, reconnect and travel again, we're excited to create a seamless travel experience from booking through stay.  
We continue to prioritize unique opportunities to engage our nearly 120 million Honors members, driving value for them through our enhanced partnerships and points redemption offerings. In the quarter, membership grew 10% year-over-year. On average, our premium members are staying with us even more frequently than in 2019. For the quarter, Honors members accounted for 58% of occupancy, reaching a high of 61% in May, only 2% below May of 2019.  
As we head into the back half of the year, we know it's critical to lead with our culture, which was recently earned -- which recently earned us the #1 spot on DiversityInc's list of top 50 companies for diversity. We were also thrilled to invite all of our team members to return to our headquarters last week. The energy and excitement in the office is palpable, and we're thrilled to be back fostering a collaborative environment which allows for innovative thinking as we remain focused on our strategic priorities and the bright future ahead.  
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kevin to give you more details on our results for the quarter."

During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 233.8% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis as recovery accelerated driven by strong global vaccine rollouts, relaxed government restriction",622,"Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 233.8% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis as recovery accelerated driven by strong global vaccine rollouts, relaxed government restrictions and surging leisure demand, particularly in the U.S.  
As Chris mentioned, system-wide RevPAR was down 36.1% compared to 2019. Performance was largely balanced between occupancy and rate growth. Adjusted EBITDA was $400 million in the second quarter, and those results reflect relaxed travel restrictions and strengthening global demand. Management and franchise fees grew 220%, demonstrating the resiliency of our fee-based business model.  
Additionally, results were helped by continued cost control at both the corporate and property levels. Our ownership portfolio posted a loss for the quarter due to the more challenged demand environment throughout Europe and Japan and related suspensions of hotel operations. Fixed operating costs further weighed on performance. Overall, the ownership segment performed better than expected, largely due to continued cost control for the quarter, diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $0.56.  
Turning to our regional performance. Second quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR grew 234% year-over-year and was down 31% versus 2019. Demand improved sequentially throughout the quarter, with occupancy averaging roughly 70% in June. Strong leisure demand, combined with improving business transient trends drove rate improvement across the U.S. with weekend ADR finishing June, down mid-single digits as compared to 2019 rate and weekday rates down in the high single digits.  
In the Americas outside the U.S., second quarter RevPAR increased 390% year-over-year and was down 54% versus 2019. While limited international travel weighed on overall performance, easing restrictions and strong leisure demand drove improving trends in June.  
In Europe, RevPAR grew 470% year-over-year and was down 72% versus 2019. While the region saw month-over-month improvement, rising COVID cases and prolonged travel restrictions continued to weigh on performance.  
In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR increased 287% year-over-year and was down 35% versus 2019. Performance benefited from strong domestic leisure demand, with rate now nearly recovered to 2019 levels in July.  
In the Asia Pacific region, second quarter RevPAR grew 143% year-over-year and was down 33% versus 2019. RevPAR in China was down less than 9% as compared to 2019, with rising COVID cases in June temporarily disrupting strong performance trends in April and May.  
However, as Chris mentioned, China has since rebounded with RevPAR now trending above 2019 levels. In the rest of the Asia Pacific region, performance was tempered due to lockdowns in India and continued travel restrictions across Japan.  
Turning to development. As Chris mentioned, in the second quarter, we grew net units 7%. Our pipeline grew sequentially, totaling 401,000 rooms at the end of the quarter, with 62% of pipeline rooms located outside the U.S. Despite the challenges brought about by the pandemic, developer appetite for Hilton brands remained strong across the globe. As travel restrictions ease, regions prepare for recovery and owners focus on growth opportunities, development activity and interest is gaining momentum.  
For the full year, we expect signings to increase in the high single to low double-digit range year-over-year. We expect net unit growth of 5% to 5.5%.  
Turning to the balance sheet. During the quarter, we fully repaid the outstanding $1.2 billion balance on our revolving credit facility. As we look ahead, we remain confident in our balance sheet and financial flexibility as we move forward into the recovery and move closer towards our target leverage. Further details on our second quarter can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning.  
This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. [Operator Instructions].

Good question, and happy to give a little bit more color. If you think about around the world, on the development side, I think so goes the recovery sort of so goes the development is probably the simplest way to think about it. S",703,"Yes. Stephen, thank you. Good question, and happy to give a little bit more color. If you think about around the world, on the development side, I think so goes the recovery sort of so goes the development is probably the simplest way to think about it. So versus our earlier expectations and why we're a bit more optimistic, obviously, and have raised our outlook for the year is largely driven by what we were seeing in faster recovery in the U.S. and faster recovery in Asia, really China. And I'd say those are sort of the largest drivers. 
If you think about recovery, that's where -- as we suggested in the prepared comments, that's where we see the steepest slope of recovery. Europe is obviously -- we knew would be lagging and isn't contributing as much as the U.S. and China is at this point. But obviously, our expectation there is as the U.K. and Europe continue to open, we'll see a meaningful uptick there. So I think it's pretty much that simple slope of recovery steeper, more activity on the development side in terms of both signings and openings, people are back at it and picking up steam. 
On the conversions, I'd say just modestly better. We -- as you would note from prior calls, we've been -- we've had high expectations for conversions. We have some great conversion brands. The system is performing at the highest levels from a market share point of view than it's ever performed in our history, and I think that's a great leading indicator for opportunities to convince folks who are independent to come into the fold as well as folks that have weaker brands that are looking for a better performance to come into the fold, both of which are happening at a little bit better than our expectations. And so while we had -- we expected things to pick up in the conversion area. I would say, this year and then leading into next because a lot of -- some of the signings will take some time. Most of them have pretty quickly, but some of them will take some time in terms of CapEx work, property improvement programs and the like. It's modestly better than what were pretty high expectations. 
In terms of the financing environment, I mean, there's a lot to discuss. I think -- so we can get to lots of other questions. I think the simple answer is it's improving. I mean the world is a big place. So again, following the slope of recovery, the U.S. and China, I would say, the financing markets are recovering most rapidly because markets are efficient. And performance is starting to really pick up and not just from an occupancy, but you're getting back to rate levels very rapidly, probably more rapidly than I've ever seen in my 40 years of doing this. 
What happens is the lender community starts to have more confidence. Rates are obviously hyper low and have been low and lenders need yield. And so the more comfort they get, that recovery is afoot and that there's going to be a recovery back to where we were and then beyond, the more they're willing to take the risk, go a little bit further out on the risk spectrum and underwrite it. 
And so you're seeing pretty robust financing markets in China. The U.S. is still -- has a ways to go. I mean you can look at the data out there, it's not anywhere near where it was, but it's improving. And my expectation is as you get into the fall, and I'm sure we'll talk about this, I'll leave it for other questions. And our belief, my belief is that we're going to continue to have very, very strong recovery in the fall and into next year, you're going to continue to see a gradual increase in financing that's available, certainly, here in the U.S. I think Europe will take a little longer. So a ways to go. I'm not saying it's back anywhere near where it was. It's a long way off. But of sort of off the floors of what we had seen last year."

We -- if you look at the numbers, we had a little bit higher key money in the quarter than we would typically have. What I would say is I don't see anything that -- I don't think anything is changing materially, meaning, still",596,"Yes, that's a good question. We -- if you look at the numbers, we had a little bit higher key money in the quarter than we would typically have. What I would say is I don't see anything that -- I don't think anything is changing materially, meaning, still over 90% of the deals that we are doing are dry deals. We're not spending -- we're not using the balance sheet anyway. So there's not any material shift, given what's going on in the broader macro environment, the financing markets. Nothing material that shifted. 
The reason you're seeing a little bit heavier key money spend right now is a super positive story in the sense that both things that we've been working on for a long time and/or opportunities that have arisen because of the pandemic have sort of come together in an unusual way this year. So example, some of the bigger key money expenditures are iconic assets for our portfolio largely resort-oriented that we've been working on that will be generational. They'll be in the system for decades and decades and decades. So the Waldorf Astoria in Monarch Beach and Laguna, I've literally been working on that deal one way or another for 20 years, I think, between host and here. And that's in the system, an incredible addition to the Waldorf brand. 
Resorts World, which I talked about in my prepared comments, 3,500 rooms on The Strip. We're basically the only major player on The Strip with a massive meetings platform and 3,500 rooms. We've been working on that for a number of years. Not a crazy amount of key money by any means, but relative to our normal expenditures, is significant. 
And then the deals that I talked about in Mexico, the 3 deals, 1,500 rooms, in Puerto Vallarta and then in Tulum, these are incredible assets that were either existing in the one case, and PV was an existing hotel that was operating with another brand. And in the case of Tulum, was developed literally over 20 years to get the entitlements with another brand. And because of COVID and what has happened in the industry, presented an opportunity for us. And so that allowed us to enter the zone on hotels that would have taken us a decade to sort of pull together, and in a matter of 6 or 12 months, we're going to have these purpose-built incredible hotels in the system. 
And so that's, I know, a long answer, but I view all of those, and then there's some others that I'm not going to be mentioning. But those are the big ones that's like incredible progress for us in all-inclusive, in resorts and in luxury. And those deals just don't come around that often. We're getting a few more of them now, as I said, aided by COVID. So maybe there -- I would say, our spending overall is going to be up probably this year and next year relative to 2020, but 2020 was a depressed year. If you look at it versus our normal run rate like '17, '18 and '19, honestly, I think our overall CapEx is sort of going to be within the ranges that we would have been. But again, I don't see anything -- we don't see anything material. We still think over 90% of our deals are going to be dry. And when we have these really unique opportunities, even with key money, they're very nice returns for us, and they're incredibly, I think, strategic and important to the system."

We've had broader dialogue, but we haven't pinned it down. But I said on the last call that I was pretty confident that we would be reinstituting return of capital program next year. I still feel that way. Obviously, the slope of the recovery is even steeper. So I would say the update to that would be, I feel confident that we're going to do in the first half of next year. The exact date and time to be determined when we talk to our Board. 
But I think you should read the results of second quarter, you should read the commentary that Kevin and I gave in our prepared comments, plus everything, you're hopefully going to get in color to say that we're very optimistic. We know we're not -- we read the papers, I talk to a lot of people. We're not oblivious to the delta variant and things that are going on in the world, but we're confident because we think we will power through that. The trends that we see real time are very strong and improving. We feel really good about that going to happen in the fall. And so yes, we -- every quarter that goes by, I think we feel better and better about where the recovery is going. And so that should ultimately translate into our feeling better about starting to return capital because we'll be generating real significant free cash flow. In my mind next year, and we do not need to hoard it, our belief has always been that, as I said in my prior answer, we're going to be able to keep growing with very little use of our own balance sheet. And so we're going to give it back to folks. So my expectation is in the first half of next year, that program will resume, and we'll be having some discussion with our Board in the very near future."

That's the $64,000 question I think everybody is trying to figure out. So I'll give you -- I mean we do have some data points and some -- and I'll give you my opinion on top of it. I mean, we've obviously seen, as Kevin and I b",1262,"Yes, totally fair question. That's the $64,000 question I think everybody is trying to figure out. So I'll give you -- I mean we do have some data points and some -- and I'll give you my opinion on top of it. I mean, we've obviously seen, as Kevin and I both described in the nuggets that we gave in our comments that you wouldn't find in the press release, we've seen really nice recovery, and that recovery has been across the board. Obviously, the greatest strength in leisure, but significant pickup in business travel and significant pickup while -- further to go in the group side. And we continue to see that, notwithstanding the delta variant and all the things going on. Like I got just last night, as an example, system-wide U.S., occupancy was 74% Trailing 7 days, 74%. That's with the urban markets, with some urban hotels not even open and those are in the comp set. And with all of our -- so all of the urban hotels, obviously, the urban environment has been lagging a little bit. 
So what that says to you, like last night, if we're running 74%, that's not leisure. I mean while we have a leisure-oriented hotels, we have a lot of business-oriented hotels. And so mid-week occupancies at that level are definitely reflective of business travel being back. And we've seen it, literally, it's funny sort of post Memorial Day I mean, you just saw the shift. You just saw a shift where weekday occupancies went up 10% or 20%, at any given night, went up 10 or 20 percentage points. And that was business travel, dominated by small and medium-sized businesses, by the way. 
But even pre-COVID, keep in mind, 80% of our business travel was small and medium-sized business, right? So that's sort of currently what's going on. I know your question is forward looking, and I promise you I'm going to get to that. I think the trajectory, my own view, and I think the data sort of supports this, as you get into August, what's going to happen is you're going to continue to have massive surge in leisure travel because everybody wants to get out, notwithstanding, again, the delta variants and the like. We've not seen impact in sort of consumer behavior from that. So I think you're going to have continued very good strength in the leisure. 
I do think in August, you'll -- as you always do, you will see business transient fall off a little bit, right, just because people are going to be, like they always do, they're going to be not traveling for business as much and going on more vacations. And it's sort of the last hurrah before maybe a lot of people going back to work. And the kids are finally going back to school and all that fun stuff. 
But when you get to the fall, and limited -- we have limited data, obviously, this far out. So this is -- I gave you data points that I have real time today. When you get 60, 90 days out, business transient stats, a lot of the bookings haven't occurred. So this is where it gets into my view of what I think will happen. I think you get after Labor Day, I do believe -- I'm not a health expert, but I'm talking to a lot of them. I do believe we will have powered through the Delta thing, if you look at the stats on hospitalization and the like, they're really not, not terrible. 
If you look at what's happened in the U.K. and we're sort of 3 or 4 weeks behind them, the patterns there right now are quite good. They have infection rates down 50% on a trailing 12 day basis over there. So I think there's a lot of reasons to be optimistic that we sort of power through that. And when we get to the fall, here's what I think we do know, kids are going back to school. I mean, we'll debate whether they're wearing masks or not. Some places, yes, but they're going back to school, and I'm pretty confident in that. 
And offices are opening. I mean they may open different times. Some people, you're reading, you're going to push it a month or whatever. Obviously, I said we're open. We're open and operating here at our -- at all of our headquarters. But you're going to have people back at work, which means with kids in school, with baby sitters and with people in the office, you're going to have more propensity to want to travel. 
And when we talk to customers, again, I can't give you the booking data because it's too far out. When we talk to customers, anecdotally, it supports all of that, that when you get into the fall, people are going to be traveling. There's both pent-up demand, okay, if things they've been needing to do, and then there's just demand, generally, to -- for folks to be able to run their businesses. And so I think as you get into the fall, you're going to see the natural reduction in the leisure, as we always do, because now kids are in school. They weren't last year. Kids are in school, people are back in the office, they don't have as much time to go on vacation. 
I do believe, again, I can't prove it, but my belief is leisure will be elevated for a while because we're still living in a bit of a hybrid world. But I think business transient will come back. Group will obviously take a little longer gestation period, but group will definitely be coming back, the booking trends into the third, particularly the fourth quarter are much better than they've been. 
And I think we're motoring forward. In terms of -- last time, I believe I said that I think we'd be back to sort of 70% by the end of the year, of '19 levels. And obviously, I feel better. So while we're not giving guidance, so I'm not going to do it. We're not ready to start doing that. There's still enough uncertainty, we want to wait. We do, do forecast, okay? I mean we're not -- it's not [indiscernible] here. We are looking at our numbers. 
And I'd say our view is demand levels probably -- RevPAR levels are probably in the U.S. and globally somewhere circa 80% versus the 70% I thought. In our current thinking, demand levels probably back to 85%. So we're getting there. And we're -- I mean, again, much -- I said last time, recovery has been much steeper than we thought. I say it again today. Just things have been coming back more quickly than we would have thought. We knew they'd come back. Obviously, you all know I've been optimistic about the recovery, but it's even better than I would have thought. 
I think one of the most surprising things, although it shouldn't be to any of us because as I kid our team, the laws of economics are alive and well. And the most surprising thing is how quickly rate comes back. But that's -- again, that's just demand, right? We're pricing demand, we're being really smart about it. But I do believe when this -- when we look back on this recovery, the most unusual thing, relative to any other period of my almost 40 years of doing this, will be just a rapid return of rate."

What I said is that all of our bookings for 2022 are at rates that are greater than 2019. So to be specific, rate. I didn't say volume. Volume is still a bit off just because it takes time to build the book. So my expectation is we get closer to next year and in the next year. In the year for the -- later in this year, particularly when you get past this Delta wave and then in the year, for the year, we'll be a barn burner year, bigger than anything we've ever seen in the year for the year simply because people have to meet. It takes time to plan it. They want to sort of get through their budget season before, they know how much money they have. 
But I'm not worried about the volumes next year. Again, they're a bit -- they're not where we were at '19. They're close, but they're not there, but the rate is above. And so what I've been -- honestly, what I've been saying to our teams is be really careful, like we -- there's going to be a monumental amount of demand, we don't want to give it away. We want to make sure that we're pricing. Even though we're not at the volumes now, my expectation, very strongly, is it's all going to fill in. It just takes it a little bit longer, given what's the reason for this recession being a health issue. And sort of getting through the final stages of that, in my opinion, is required before you really get the momentum on the volume. And so that's why rates are up is because we're being super disciplined, recognizing that there's a limited amount of meeting space, there's going to be a gargantuan amount of demand, and we can be a bit patient, I think, given what's going on."

I'll try to go in order. I think on the conversion front, openings were lower. I don't remember the exact percentage, but they were circa 10% of openings for the quarter. And that was just timing. I'd say, last year, we were sort of 19%, 20% of openings. I think this year, it will be that or maybe even a little bit higher given sort of the number of signings we had in the second quarter. And so that's -- I think that's a good way to think about it. 
And look, we are doing more conversions. Very happy with the conversions in the second quarter, really nice mix between hard brands, soft brands, conversions from independents, conversions from other brands regionally. So very happy with that. But that said, our pace of deliveries of new builds is going up as well. So it's sort of hard -- it's a little bit harder for that percentage to move. And of course, that's all baked into our outlook. 
The idea of -- I'll do the third one next, the idea of '22 being affected, not as much. I mean, I think '22 is going to be about what we expect, maybe a little bit of timing pull forward, replaced by a little bit more conversions. So 2022 is about the same as we thought. And then, yes, you picked up on, we said 4% to 5% for the next several years, we were not pointing to any one specific year when we said 4% to 5%. And now we're saying mid-single digits, which, of course, 4% to 5% is mid-single digits.

It's a great question. Labor shortage is a real issue, probably the single biggest issue that we're dealing with that is definitely not just for Hilton, but industry -- all service industries and manufacturing and a lot of your supply chain issues that you're reading about every day. All of this is sort of interconnected to not having enough labor. At a high level, I think it will largely resolve itself over the next couple of quarters in the sense that I think there are a lot of complex reasons behind it. Some of it is obviously health. People still don't feel like, particularly with the Delta variant now that they should go back to work, some people, because they're worried about their health as already `been -- we haven't had kids in schools, so we don't effectively have day care. There are women in the workforce or where it's been most dramatically impacted because they have to stay home to take care of kids. 
And then some of the government programs that were really important last year in the depths of this crisis have -- aren't as important right now when there's a ton of opportunity for employment and that is unemployment insurance of the federal top-up, but that goes away in early September. So I think when you get kids back in school, we get past these -- hopefully, the last wave with Delta and unemployment insurance goes away in the early fall, I think you're going to start to see a significant easing of the issues on the labor side. 
In terms of what -- its impact on margins, given that we're able to -- while there are service issues all of us are having, we're obviously working awfully hard to deliver great service. And I think we are doing a very good job given the difficult circumstances. We are doing it with less labor. And so ironically, given demand and given the ability to price the demand, margins are, in many cases, unbelievably high because you're getting, effectively, rates that are consistent with what you had before, and you can't get the labor, so you just have less cost. That obviously is a temporary thing. You're going to have more labor ultimately in the hotels. 
Having said that, long term, we've done a bunch of things in the crisis in terms of testing and learning on different ways to change the operating model, particularly as it relates to housekeeping and food and beverage and then a whole host of other smaller things where we think we can deliver great experience for our customers and do it more efficiently. And so I think when it all gets flushed through, and we're on the other side of this and through the stresses and strains on the labor issues we're talking about, I think we have developed a plan to have higher-margin businesses across all the major brands. And so yes, it's a big issue. We're spending a lot of time on it, but I do -- as the old adage goes, this, too, I think, shall pass."

But I'm not -- I'm just giving you the atmosphere, I don't -- we don't -- I don't have our data on it. I think that it is an issue but not a significant issue. 
And by the way, it's helping, to a degree -- it's also helping with rate because in some markets where they can't, they're reducing capacity and driving rate, which, by the way, back to Bill Crow, when we're done with it, maybe we can declare victory that we were actually really smart about not only rate recovery, but sort of how we manage occupancy versus rate to drive the best profitability. 
So in the hotels where they are having issues, in many of them, and I can think of a few who I just talked to, are having great success in sort of moderating occupancy levels down and then driving it on the top line. 
And net-net, they're making more money than if they had the incremental labor and they opened up the capacity. They're just -- their profitability is higher. So it's not all a bad story. Long term, obviously, the labor issues we have to sort -- I mean I already gave my answer. I do think they'll sort. There are a bunch of things we're doing to make sure that our system has unique opportunities to access labor and, ultimately, deliver the kind of service we want to deliver, we do need to get more labor in the hotels.

And that's all while business transient is still, I think, 30 points off. I think that usually over-indexes to brand direct. So just curious how you think this direct contribution evolves through the pandemic. Usually, there's a narrative that OTAs take share, but it seems like your direct business is really impressive. How do you think it evolves over the course of the next year?"

Well, over the next year, it's probably harder to judge. Over the next several years, obviously, our objective is to continue to enhance the value proposition for Honors, such that, as I've been saying for a long time, you're sort of crazy not to be a member of Honors.  You get all the technology, you get a little bit of a discounted rate. You get the points. You can use the points to shop on Amazon, buy a concert ticket at Live Nation, go travel the world and get rooms or food and beverage or a spa treatment or whatever. It's very much an opportunity to sort of create value. 
And if you're not an Honors member and you're staying with us, you're sort of silly, I mean, just because you're effectively giving away value. And so that happens to be true. Obviously, we've been trying to, over the years, as I've talked about many times on these calls, sort of go high and low, make sure that for our most frequent travelers, it's a really relevant program, which I think we've done, but infrequent travelers as well. And that's probably been what's most game-changing for us, and I think it's helped us, sort of over the last 5 years, lead the industry in percentage of occupancy represented by loyalty, which is we've made it relevant to somebody that travels 2 or 3 days a year and not just 60 or 100 days a year because it's a currency effectively, and there's a value proposition that works for them. 
And so being specific about it, we want to continue that. I mean my own view is we were running in the 60s pre-COVID. My goals are much higher for that pre-COVID, and I'm not letting up. I mean COVID set us back, but I think COVID also provided opportunities. And as you pointed out, in May, we were effectively only a couple of points different than we were in '19. Why would that be when our core traveler is not back? Well, I think it's 2 things. One, in May and June, our core travelers started to come back. Number two, we worked really hard in how we sort of shifted our upper funnel and lower funnel strategies for marketing to attract customers into the system that were traveling during COVID that weren't our core customers. 
And so we were able to get a bunch of those folks to say, ""Gosh, I would like to be an Honors member"" and sign up, and then realize this is a really good value proposition. So the whole thing during COVID has been to basically say, let's go really hard after the customer that maybe wasn't our core, wasn't an Honors member, make sure they really understand the value proposition and then keep them in the system. And then when our core customer comes back, obviously, we believe we've got a great value proposition and they're staying. And when you put one and one together, you hope to get 3. And so the objective would be not to get back to where we were, because that wasn't the objective pre-COVID. It's to get significantly beyond that. 
Why? Because we believe it's a better experience for our customer. Like the more -- the better the value proposition, the happier they are. The better experience with the technology, the happier they are. From an ownership and system point of view, we lower our distribution costs. It's the lowest distribution channel -- the lowest cost distribution channel we have. 
So for all the right reasons, we want to continue to build very direct relationships. And my belief is when you wake up in 2 or 3 years, while COVID has obviously been a difficult time for everybody in the industry, including us, I do think it afforded us an opportunity to accelerate some of those efforts."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. As I think our second quarter results demonstrate, we continue to make significant progress towards recovery, working hard to serve all of our stakeholders; for our guests to deliver reliable and friendly experiences in a very demanding environment,; for our team members to maintain an award-winning culture by creating an inclusive, safe and welcoming environment full of opportunities; for our owners to drive value through premium market share and efficient and effective operating models; for our communities to remain a positive force for good at a time when it is needed most; and finally, for our shareholders to maximize profits, free cash flow and overall total returns. 
We're pleased to see that our diligence and determination are beginning to pay off. As much of the world reopens, the pent-up demand for travel we've been anticipating is happening. While the pace of recovery varies and COVID variants remain a risk, we are seeing significant sequential improvement in every major region. 
In the second quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 234% year-over-year. Compared to 2019, RevPAR was down 36%, improving 17 percentage points versus the first quarter, with June RevPAR improving 24 percentage points versus the first quarter and down only 29 points versus 2019. 
Additionally, 30% of system-wide comparable hotels exceeded 2019 RevPAR levels in June. Adjusted EBITDA was $400 million, up 684% year-over-year. Performance was driven by strong leisure demand and rate growth. For the second quarter, U.S. leisure demand exceeded prior peak levels, with rates at 90% of prior peaks. This positive momentum continued into July with system-wide and U.S. leisure room nights and rate exceeding 2019 levels. 
Business transient also increased meaningfully throughout the quarter, with June RevPAR for the segment increasing 20 percentage points from the first quarter. We saw improving results in small and medium-sized businesses and positive momentum across larger accounts. In June, business transient room night demand was 70% of 2019 levels, with rate over 80% of 2019 levels. We continue to see progress in July with similar room night demand and rates at 90% of 2019 levels. 
Group performance in the quarter also improved sequentially, driven primarily by social groups given seasonally higher leisure demand. Overall, group demand increased nearly 20 percentage points sequentially from the first quarter, ending June at more than half of 2019 levels. 
Additionally, group bookings for next year are at rates above 2019 peaks. Approximately 99% of our hotels are now open and operating, including some of our largest urban and group properties. In the last few months, we were thrilled to celebrate the reopenings of the legendary Palmer House Hilton, the Chicago Hilton and the Hilton San Francisco Union Square. 
As government restrictions loosen and more people are vaccinated, we continue to see positive momentum in demand and an increasing ability to push rate. For July month-to-date, system-wide demand is 85% of 2019 levels, with rates equal to 2019. In the U.S., July RevPAR is roughly 85% of 2019 levels. And in China, RevPAR is now above prior peaks. With increasing transient bookings, digital traffic and group sales leads, we are optimistic about the forward trends. 
Turning to development. We delivered another robust quarter of growth, with net units increasing 7% year-over-year ahead of expectations due to strong openings in the U.S. and fewer overall removals. During the quarter, we added 119 hotels, totaling nearly 20,000 rooms and celebrated the 5-year anniversary of Tru with the opening of its 200th property. With nearly 270 hotels in development, Tru continues expanding across the U.S. and Canada as well as moving into new markets in the Caribbean and Latin America. 
We were also thrilled to celebrate the highly anticipated opening of Resorts World Las Vegas last month, marking the first ground-up resort development on The Strip in over a decade. The property features 3 of our premium brands, Hilton, Conrad and LXR and adds 3,500 rooms to our portfolio, with expansive meeting and event space, 120,000 square foot casino, 40 world-class food and beverage options and a concert and entertainment venue with capacity for 5,000 attendees. This spectacular property raises the bar for Las Vegas and delivers on our long-standing promise to return to The Strip. 
Along with the recently opened Virgin Hotels Las Vegas Curio, we are now -- we now have more than 30 properties, totaling 11,000 rooms across 12 brands in the city. Las Vegas is also the first U.S. market to house all 3 of our luxury brands. 
Earlier this month, we debuted our premier meetings and events focused brands Signia by Hilton, with the opening of the Signia Orlando Bonnet Creek. The property will undergo a multiphase transformation featuring the addition of more than 94,000 square feet of multifunctional meeting and event space designed for an elevated meeting experience. In the quarter, we also broke ground on the nearly 1,000 room Signia Atlanta scheduled to open in 2023. Our exceptional brands and industry-leading RevPAR premiums continue to drive a high-quality pipeline. 
In the quarter, we signed nearly 26,000 rooms, up 40% year-over-year and increasing from our first quarter pace given strength in the Americas and Asia Pacific regions. We ended the quarter with approximately 401,000 rooms in development, more than half of which are under construction. We had a record number of conversion signings in the quarter, representing 40 hotels and accounting for approximately 30% of our total signings, including the Conrad Chia Laguna, Sardinia, the Conrad Shanghai, which will be our largest Conrad in Asia with more than 725 rooms, and the Hotel 1000 LXR located just steps away from Seattle's iconic Pike Place Market. 
Further expanding our all-inclusive and luxury portfolios, we announced the signing of 3 beachfront resorts in Mexico earlier this month: The Hilton Vallarta Riviera All-Inclusive Resort; the Hilton Tulum All-Inclusive Resort; and the Conrad Tulum, will add more than 1,500 rooms to our existing 70 hotel portfolio in Mexico, demonstrating our commitment to continued expansion across the region and growing our all-inclusive resort footprint. Travelers will soon be able to choose from an even wider variety of Hilton-branded all-inclusive resorts globally. 
We expect positive development trends to continue and remain confident in our expectations to deliver mid-single-digit net unit growth over the next several years. For 2021, we expect net unit growth in the 5% to 5.5% range, above prior expectations, given the pace of openings year-to-date. 
Delivering on guest desire for more flexibility in their travel experience and solving a long-time travel frustration, last month, we launched confirmed connecting rooms, a first in the industry, this innovative technology enables guests to easily book and instantly confirm at least 2 connecting rooms. As families and friends begin to reunite, reconnect and travel again, we're excited to create a seamless travel experience from booking through stay. 
We continue to prioritize unique opportunities to engage our nearly 120 million Honors members, driving value for them through our enhanced partnerships and points redemption offerings. In the quarter, membership grew 10% year-over-year. On average, our premium members are staying with us even more frequently than in 2019. For the quarter, Honors members accounted for 58% of occupancy, reaching a high of 61% in May, only 2% below May of 2019. 
As we head into the back half of the year, we know it's critical to lead with our culture, which was recently earned -- which recently earned us the #1 spot on DiversityInc's list of top 50 companies for diversity. We were also thrilled to invite all of our team members to return to our headquarters last week. The energy and excitement in the office is palpable, and we're thrilled to be back fostering a collaborative environment which allows for innovative thinking as we remain focused on our strategic priorities and the bright future ahead. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kevin to give you more details on our results for the quarter."
29470,1672705823,2373384,"Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 233.8% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis as recovery accelerated driven by strong global vaccine rollouts, relaxed government restriction",622,"Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 233.8% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis as recovery accelerated driven by strong global vaccine rollouts, relaxed government restrictions and surging leisure demand, particularly in the U.S. 
As Chris mentioned, system-wide RevPAR was down 36.1% compared to 2019. Performance was largely balanced between occupancy and rate growth. Adjusted EBITDA was $400 million in the second quarter, and those results reflect relaxed travel restrictions and strengthening global demand. Management and franchise fees grew 220%, demonstrating the resiliency of our fee-based business model. 
Additionally, results were helped by continued cost control at both the corporate and property levels. Our ownership portfolio posted a loss for the quarter due to the more challenged demand environment throughout Europe and Japan and related suspensions of hotel operations. Fixed operating costs further weighed on performance. Overall, the ownership segment performed better than expected, largely due to continued cost control. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $0.56. 
Turning to our regional performance. Second quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR grew 234% year-over-year and was down 31% versus 2019. Demand improved sequentially throughout the quarter, with occupancy averaging roughly 70% in June. Strong leisure demand, combined with improving business transient trends drove rate improvement across the U.S. with weekend ADR finishing June, down mid-single digits as compared to 2019 rate and weekday rates down in the high single digits. 
In the Americas outside the U.S., second quarter RevPAR increased 390% year-over-year and was down 54% versus 2019. While limited international travel weighed on overall performance, easing restrictions and strong leisure demand drove improving trends in June. 
In Europe, RevPAR grew 470% year-over-year and was down 72% versus 2019. While the region saw month-over-month improvement, rising COVID cases and prolonged travel restrictions continued to weigh on performance. 
In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR increased 287% year-over-year and was down 35% versus 2019. Performance benefited from strong domestic leisure demand, with rate now nearly recovered to 2019 levels in July. 
In the Asia Pacific region, second quarter RevPAR grew 143% year-over-year and was down 33% versus 2019. RevPAR in China was down less than 9% as compared to 2019, with rising COVID cases in June temporarily disrupting strong performance trends in April and May. 
However, as Chris mentioned, China has since rebounded with RevPAR now trending above 2019 levels. In the rest of the Asia Pacific region, performance was tempered due to lockdowns in India and continued travel restrictions across Japan. 
Turning to development. As Chris mentioned, in the second quarter, we grew net units 7%. Our pipeline grew sequentially, totaling 401,000 rooms at the end of the quarter, with 62% of pipeline rooms located outside the U.S. Despite the challenges brought about by the pandemic, developer appetite for Hilton brands remained strong across the globe. As travel restrictions ease, regions prepare for recovery and owners focus on growth opportunities, development activity and interest is gaining momentum. 
For the full year, we expect signings to increase in the high single to low double-digit range year-over-year. We expect net unit growth of 5% to 5.5%. 
Turning to the balance sheet. During the quarter, we fully repaid the outstanding $1.2 billion balance on our revolving credit facility. As we look ahead, we remain confident in our balance sheet and financial flexibility as we move forward into the recovery and move closer towards our target leverage. Further details on our second quarter can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning.

Good question, and happy to give a little bit more color. If you think about around the world, on the development side, I think so goes the recovery sort of so goes the development is probably the simplest way to think about it. S",702,"Yes. Stephen, thank you. Good question, and happy to give a little bit more color. If you think about around the world, on the development side, I think so goes the recovery sort of so goes the development is probably the simplest way to think about it. So versus our earlier expectations and why we're a bit more optimistic, obviously, and have raised our outlook for the year is largely driven by what we were seeing in faster recovery in the U.S. and faster recovery in Asia, really China. And I'd say those are sort of the largest drivers. 
If you think about recovery, that's where -- as we suggested in the prepared comments, that's where we see the steepest slope of recovery. Europe is obviously -- we knew would be lagging and isn't contributing as much as the U.S. and China is at this point. But obviously, our expectation there is as the U.K. and Europe continue to open, we'll see a meaningful uptick there. So I think it's pretty much that simple. Slope of recovery steeper, more activity on the development side in terms of both signings and openings, people are back at it and picking up steam. 
On the conversions, I'd say just modestly better. We -- as you would note from prior calls, we've been -- we've had high expectations for conversions. We have some great conversion brands. The system is performing at the highest levels from a market share point of view than it's ever performed in our history, and I think that's a great leading indicator for opportunities to convince folks who are independent to come into the fold as well as folks that have weaker brands that are looking for a better performance to come into the fold, both of which are happening at a little bit better than our expectations. And so while we had -- we expected things to pick up in the conversion area, I would say, this year and then leading into next because a lot of -- some of the signings will take some time. Most of them have pretty quickly, but some of them will take some time in terms of CapEx work, property improvement programs and the like. It's modestly better than what were pretty high expectations. 
In terms of the financing environment, I mean, there's a lot to discuss. I think -- so we can get to lots of other questions. I think the simple answer is it's improving. I mean the world is a big place. So again, following the slope of recovery, the U.S. and China, I would say, the financing markets are recovering most rapidly because markets are efficient. And performance is starting to really pick up and not just from an occupancy, but you're getting back to rate levels very rapidly, probably more rapidly than I've ever seen in my 40 years of doing this. 
What happens is the lender community starts to have more confidence. Rates are obviously hyper low and have been low and lenders need yield. And so the more comfort they get, that recovery is afoot and that there's going to be a recovery back to where we were and then beyond, the more they're willing to take the risk, a little bit further down on the risk spectrum and underwrite it. 
And so you're seeing pretty robust financing markets in China. The U.S. is still -- has ways to go. I mean you can look at the data out there, it's not anywhere near where it was, but it's improving. And my expectation is as you get into the fall, and I'm sure we'll talk about this, I'll leave it for other questions. And our belief, my belief is that we're going to continue to have very, very strong recovery in the fall and into next year, you're going to continue to see a gradual increase in financing that's available, certainly, here in the U.S. I think Europe will take a little longer. So a ways to go. I'm not saying it's back anywhere near where it was. It's a long way off. But of -- sort of off the floors of what we had seen last year."

What I would say is, I don't see anything that -- I don't think anything is changing materially, meaning, stil",595,"Yes, that's a good question. We -- if you look at the numbers, we had a little bit higher key money in the quarter than we would typically have. What I would say is, I don't see anything that -- I don't think anything is changing materially, meaning, still over 90% of the deals that we are doing are dry deals. We're not spending -- we're not using the balance sheet anyway. So there's not any material shift, given what's going on in the broader macro environment, the financing markets. Nothing material that shifted. 
The reason you're seeing a little bit heavier key money spend right now is a super positive story in the sense that both things that we've been working on for a long time and/or opportunities that have arisen because of the pandemic have sort of come together in an unusual way this year. So example, some of the bigger key money expenditures are iconic assets for our portfolio largely resort-oriented that we've been working on that will be generational. They'll be in the system for decades and decades and decades. So the Waldorf Astoria in Monarch Beach and Laguna, I've literally been working on that deal one way or another for 20 years, I think, between host and here. And that's in the system, an incredible addition to the Waldorf brand. 
Resorts World, which I talked about in my prepared comments, 3,500 rooms on The Strip. We're basically the only major player on The Strip with a massive meetings platform and 3,500 rooms. We've been working on that for a number of years. Not a crazy amount of key money by any means, but relative to our normal expenditures, significant. 
And then the deals that I talked about in Mexico, the 3 deals, 1,500 rooms, in Puerto Vallarta and then in Tulum, these are incredible assets that were either existing in the one case, in PV, was an existing hotel that was operating with another brand. And in the case of Tulum, was developed literally over 20 years to get the entitlements with another brand. And because of COVID and what has happened in the industry, presented an opportunity for us. And so that allowed us to enter the zone on hotels that would have taken us a decade to sort of pull together, and in a matter of 6 or 12 months, we're going to have these purpose-built incredible hotels in the system. 
And so that's, I know, a long answer, but I view all of those, and then there's some others that I'm not going to be mentioning. But those are the big ones that's like incredible progress for us in all-inclusive, in resorts and in luxury. And those deals just don't come around that often. We're getting a few more of them now, as I said, aided by COVID. So maybe there -- I would say, our spending overall is going to be up probably this year and next year relative to 2020, but 2020 was a depressed year. 
If you look at it versus our normal run rate like '17, '18 and '19, honestly, I think our overall CapEx is sort of going to be within the ranges that we would have been. But again, I don't see anything -- we don't see anything material. We still think over 90% of our deals are going to be dry. And when we have these really unique opportunities, even with key money, they're very nice returns for us, and they're incredibly, I think, strategic and important to the system."

I know that's on everybody's mind. And we have obviously talked a bunch about it. We, ultimately, that's a decision we'll go to our board with. We have an upcoming meeting. We've had broader dialogue, but we haven't pinned it down. But I said on the last call that I was pretty confident that we would be reinstituting return of capital program next year. I still feel that way. Obviously, the slope of the recovery is even steeper. So I would say the update to that would be, I feel confident that we're going to do in the first half of next year. The exact date and time to be determined when we talk to our Board. 
But I think you should read the results of second quarter, you should read the commentary that Kevin and I gave in our prepared comments, plus everything, you're hopefully going to get in color to say that we're very optimistic. We know we're not -- we read the papers. I talk to a lot of people. We're not oblivious to the Delta variant and things that are going on in the world, but we're confident because we think we will power through that. The trends that we see real time are very strong and improving. We feel really good about that going to happen in the fall. And so yes, we -- every quarter that goes by, I think we feel better and better about where the recovery is going. 
And so that should ultimately translate into our feeling better about starting to return capital because we'll be generating real significant free cash flow. In my mind next year, and we do not need to hoard it, our belief has always been that, as I said in my prior answer, we're going to be able to keep growing with very little use of our own balance sheet. And so we're going to give it back to folks. So my expectation is in the first half of next year, that program will resume, and we'll be having some discussion with our Board in the very near future."

So I'll give you -- I mean we do have some data points and some -- and I'll give you my opinion on top of it. I mean, we've obviously seen, as Kevin and I both described in the nuggets that we gave in our comments that you wouldn't find in the press release, we've seen really nice recovery, and that recovery has been across the board. Obviously, most -- the greatest strength in leisure, but significant pickup in business travel and significant pickup while -- further to go in the group side. And we continue to see that, notwithstanding the Delta variant and all the things going on. Like I got just last night, as an example, system-wide U.S., occupancy was 74% Trailing 7 days, 74%. That's with the urban markets -- that’s with some urban hotels not even open and those are in the comp set. And with all of our -- so all of the urban hotels, obviously, the urban environment has been lagging a little bit. 
So what that says to you, like last night, if we're running 74%, that's not leisure. I mean while we have a leisure-oriented hotels, we have a lot of business-oriented hotels. And so mid-week occupancies at that level are definitely reflective of business travel being back. And we've seen it literally -- it's funny sort of post Memorial Day. I mean you just saw the shift. You just saw a shift where weekday occupancies went up 10% or 20%, at any given night, went up 10 or 20 percentage points. And that was business travel, dominated by small and medium-sized businesses, by the way. 
But even pre-COVID, keep in mind, 80% of our business travel was small and medium-sized business, right? So that's sort of currently what's going on. I know your question is forward looking, and I promise you I'm going to get to that. I think the trajectory, my own view, and I think the data sort of supports this, as you get into August, what's going to happen is you're going to continue to have massive surge in leisure travel because everybody wants to get out, notwithstanding, again, the Delta variants and the like. We've not seen impact in sort of consumer behavior from that. So I think you're going to have continued very good strength in the leisure. 
I do think in August, you'll -- as you always do, you will see business transient fall off a little bit, right, just because people are going to be, like they always do, they're going to be not traveling for business as much and going on more vacations. And it's sort of the last hurrah before maybe a lot of people going back to work. And the kids are finally going back to school and all that fun stuff. 
But when you get to the fall, and limited -- we have limited data, obviously, this far out. So this is -- I gave you data points that I have real time today. When you get 60, 90 days out, business transient stats, a lot of the bookings haven't occurred. So this is where it gets into my view of what I think will happen. I think you get after Labor Day, I do believe -- I'm not a health expert, but I'm talking to a lot of them. I do believe we will have powered through the Delta thing, if you look at the stats on hospitalization and the like, they're really not, not terrible. 
If you look at what's happened in the U.K. and we're sort of 3 or 4 weeks behind them, the patterns there right now are quite good. They have infection rates down 50% on a trailing 12-day basis over there. So I think there's a lot of reasons to be optimistic that we sort of power through that. And when we get to the fall, here's what I think we do know, kids are going back to school. I mean, we'll debate whether they're wearing masks or not. Some places, yes, but they're going back to school, and I'm pretty confident in that. 
And offices are opening. I mean they may open different times. Some people, you're reading they’re going to push it a month or whatever. Obviously, I said we're open. We're open and operating here at our -- at all of our headquarters. But you're going to have people back at work, which means with kids in school, with babysitters and with people in the office, you're going to have more propensity to want to travel. 
And when we talk to customers, again, I can't give you the booking data because it's too far out. When we talk to customers, anecdotally, it supports all of that that when you get into the fall, people are going to be traveling. There's both pent-up demand, okay, if things they've been needing to do, and then there's just demand, generally, to -- for folks to be able to run their businesses. And so I think as you get into the fall, you're going to see the natural reduction in the leisure, as we always do, because now kids are in school. They weren't last year. Kids are in school, people are back in the office, they don't have as much time to go on vacation. 
I do believe, again, I can't prove it, but my belief is leisure will be elevated for a while because we're still living in a bit of a hybrid world. But I think business transient will come back. Group will obviously take a little longer gestation period, but group will definitely be coming back, the booking trends into the third, particularly the fourth quarter are much better than they've been. 
And I think we're motoring forward. In terms of -- last time, I believe I said that I think we'd be back to sort of 70% by the end of the year, of '19 levels. And obviously, I feel better. So while we're not giving guidance, so I'm not going to do it. We're not ready to start doing that. There's still enough uncertainty, we want to wait. We do forecast, okay? I mean we're not -- it's not Camp Runamuck here. We are looking at our numbers. 
And I'd say our view is demand levels probably -- RevPAR levels are probably in the U.S. and globally somewhere circa 80% versus the 70% I thought. In our current thinking, demand levels probably back to 85%. So we're getting there. And we're -- I mean, again, much -- I said last time, recovery has been much steeper than we thought. I say it again today. Just things have been coming back more quickly than we would have thought. We knew they'd come back. Obviously, you all know I've been optimistic about the recovery, but it's even better than I would have thought. 
I think one of the most surprising things, although it shouldn't be to any of us because as I kid our team, the laws of economics are alive and well. And the most surprising thing is how quickly rate comes back. But that's -- again, that's just demand, right? We're pricing demand, we're being really smart about it. But I do believe when this -- when we look back on this recovery, the most unusual thing, relative to any other period of my almost 40 years of doing this will be just a rapid return of rate."

What I said is that all of our bookings for 2022 are at rates that are greater than 2019. So to be specific, rate. I didn't say volume.

So my expectation is we get closer to next year and into next year -- in the year for the -- later in this year, particularly when you get past this Delta wave and then in the year, for the year, we'll be a barn burner year, bigger than anything we've ever seen in the year for the year simply because people have to meet. It takes time to plan it. They want to sort of get through their budget season before they know how much money they have. 
But I'm not worried about the volumes next year. Again, they're a bit -- they're not where we were at '19. They're close, but they're not there, but the rate is above. And so what I've been -- honestly, what I've been saying to our teams is be really careful, like we -- there's going to be a monumental amount of demand, we don't want to give it away. We want to make sure that we're pricing. Even though we're not at the volumes now, my expectation, very strongly, is it's all going to fill in. It just takes it a little bit longer, given what's the reason for this recession being a health issue. And sort of getting through the final stages of that, in my opinion, is required before you really get the momentum on the volume. And so that's why rates are up is because we're being super disciplined, recognizing that there's a limited amount of meeting space, there's going to be a gargantuan amount of demand, and we can be a bit patient, I think, given what's going on."

So I'm wondering with the higher unit growth rate here in '21, does that carry through to sort of continued acceleration into '22?

I'll try to go in order. I think on the conversion front, openings were lower. I don't remember the exact percentage, but they were circa 10% of openings for the quarter. And that was just timing. I'd say, last year, we were sort of 19%, 20% of openings. I think this year, it will be that or maybe even a little bit higher given sort of the number of signings we had in the second quarter. And so that's -- I think that's a good way to think about it. 
And look, we are doing more conversions. Very happy with the conversions in the second quarter, really nice mix between hard brands, soft brands, conversions from independents, conversions from other brands regionally. So very happy with that. But that said, our pace of deliveries of new builds is going up as well. So it's sort of hard -- it's a little bit harder for that percentage to move. And of course, that's all baked into our outlook. 
The idea of -- I'll do the third one next, the idea of '22 being affected, not as much. I mean, I think '22 is going to be about what we expect, maybe a little bit of timing pull forward, replaced by a little bit more conversions. So 2022 is about the same as we thought. And then, yes, you picked up on, we said 4% to 5% for the next several years, we were not pointing to any one specific year when we said 4% to 5%. And now we're saying mid-single digits, which, of course, 4% to 5% is mid-single digits.

It's a great question. Labor shortage is a real issue, probably the single biggest issue that we're dealing with that is definitely not just for Hilton, but industry -- all service industries and manufacturing and a lot of your supply chain issues that you're reading about every day. All of this is sort of interconnected to not having enough labor. At a high level, I think it will largely resolve itself over the next couple of quarters in the sense that I think there are a lot of complex reasons behind it. Some of it is obviously health. People still don't feel like, particularly with the Delta variant now that they should go back to work, some people, because they're worried about their health because -- we haven't had kids in schools, so we don't effectively have day care. There are women in the workforce where it's been most dramatically impacted because they have to stay home to take care of kids. 
And then some of the government programs that were really important last year in the depths of this crisis have -- aren't as important right now when there's a ton of opportunity for employment and that is unemployment insurance, the federal top-up. But that goes away in early September. So I think when you get kids back in school, we get past these -- hopefully, the last wave with Delta and unemployment insurance goes away in the early fall, I think you're going to start to see a significant easing of the issues on the labor side. 
In terms of what -- its impact on margins, given that we're able to -- while there are service issues all of us are having, we're obviously working awfully hard to deliver great service. And I think we are doing a very good job given the difficult circumstances. We are doing it with less labor. And so ironically, given demand and given the ability to price the demand, margins are, in many cases, unbelievably high because you're getting effectively rates that are consistent with what you had before, and you can't get the labor, so you just have less cost. That obviously is a temporary thing. You're going to have to have more labor ultimately in the hotels. 
Having said that, long term, we've done a bunch of things in the crisis in terms of testing and learning on different ways to change the operating model, particularly as it relates to housekeeping and food and beverage and then a whole host of other smaller things where we think we can deliver great experience for our customers and do it more efficiently. And so I think when it all gets flushed through, and we're on the other side of this and through the stresses and strains on the labor issues we're talking about, I think we have developed a plan to have higher-margin businesses across all the major brands. And so yes, it's a big issue. We're spending a lot of time on it, but I do -- as the old adage goes, this too, I think, shall pass."

I mean I've been doing this a long time, and been through bunches of recessions at this point. And what I'm seeing is very atypical. So -- and I do believe that into the fall and next year, we're going to continue to have robust demand and improvement. So I think the rate story, as I said in my earlier comment, when we look back on it, I think that's going to be the real difference in recovery here, but I don't know about declaring victory.

I would say, sort of atmospherically, I think it's a relatively small percentage of our portfolio.

But I'm not -- I'm just giving you the atmosphere, so I don't -- we don't -- I don't have our data on it. I think that it is an issue but not a significant issue. 
And by the way, it's helping to a degree -- it's also helping with rate because in some markets where they can't, they're reducing capacity and driving rate, which, by the way, back to Bill Crow, when we're done with it, maybe we can declare victory that we were actually really smart about not only rate recovery, but sort of how we manage occupancy versus rate to drive the best profitability. So in the hotels where they are having issues, in many of them, and I can think of a few who I just talked to, are having great success in sort of moderating occupancy levels down and then driving it on the top line. 
And net-net, they're making more money than if they had the incremental labor and they opened up the capacity. They're just -- their profitability is higher. So it's not all a bad story. Long term, obviously, the labor issues we have to sort -- I mean I already gave my answer. I do think they'll sort. There are a bunch of things we're doing to make sure that our system has unique opportunities to access labor and, ultimately, to deliver the kind of service we want to deliver, we do need to get more labor in the hotels. But at the moment, from an owner point of view, in many cases, some are limiting capacity, but I think it's a relatively small percentage."

I think license fees were up something like 80% in the second quarter, but that's obviously a lot less than RevPAR growth at 234%. And so just the math ends up being a little bit less than RevPAR. And so when we -- when we're in this period of RevPAR growth being sort of at these really elevated rates because of the crazy comps, we're going to be a little bit lower than fee growth. On a long-term basis, it should be about 1 to 1. So that's sort of the easiest way I can sort of lay it out. We said it's hard to model though. Sorry about that."

So all the things we talked about, there's nothing structural there. It's just it's behind. It obviously was loss-making this quarter. It probably will be loss-making next quarter just because of the level of recovery and what's going to be needed in those parts of the world. And we think it's sort of breakeven-ish in Q4. We'll see what happens. Again, it's dependent on recovery and the world opening up a little bit. And then the last thing I'd say is, obviously, it's going to grow more quickly than the core business.

Well, over the next year, it's probably harder to judge. Over the next several years, obviously, our objective is to continue to enhance the value proposition for Honors, such that, as I've been saying for a long time, you're sort of crazy not to be a member of Honors. You get all the technology, you get a little bit of a discounted rate. You get the points. You can use the points to shop on Amazon, buy a concert ticket at Live Nation, go travel the world and get rooms or food and beverage or a spa treatment or whatever. It's very much an opportunity to sort of create value. 
And if you're not an Honors member and you're staying with us, you're sort of silly, I mean, just because you're effectively giving away value. And so that happens to be true. Obviously, we've been trying to, over the years, as I've talked about many times on these calls, sort of go high and low, make sure that for our most frequent travelers, it's a really relevant program, which I think we've done, but infrequent travelers as well. And that's probably been what's most game-changing for us, and I think it's helped us, sort of over the last 5 years, lead the industry in percentage of occupancy represented by loyalty, which is we've made it relevant to somebody that travels 2 or 3 days a year and not just 60 or 100 days a year because it's a currency effectively, and there's a value proposition that works for them. 
And so being specific about it, we want to continue that. I mean my own view is we were running in the 60s pre-COVID. My goals are much higher for that pre-COVID, and I'm not letting up. I mean COVID set us back, but I think COVID also provided opportunities. And as you pointed out, in May, we were effectively only a couple of points different than we were in '19. Why would that be when our core traveler is not back? Well, I think it's 2 things. One, in May and June, our core travelers started to come back. Number two, we worked really hard in how we sort of shifted our upper funnel and lower funnel strategies for marketing to attract customers into the system that were traveling during COVID that weren't our core customers. 
And so we were able to get a bunch of those folks to say, ""Gosh, I would like to be an Honors member"" and sign up, and then realize this is a really good value proposition. So the whole thing during COVID has been to basically say, let's go really hard after the customer that maybe wasn't our core, wasn't an Honors member, make sure they really understand the value proposition and then keep them in the system. And then when our core customer comes back, obviously, we believe we've got a great value proposition they understand. And when you put one and one together, you hope to get 3. And so the objective would be not to get back to where we were because that wasn't the objective pre-COVID. It's to get significantly beyond that. 
Why? Because we believe it's a better experience for our customer. Like the more -- the better the value proposition, the happier they are. The better experience with the technology, the happier they are. From an ownership and system point of view, we lower our distribution costs. It's the lowest distribution channel -- the lowest cost distribution channel we have. So for all the right reasons, we want to continue to build very direct relationships. And my belief is when you wake up in 2 or 3 years, while COVID has obviously been a difficult time for everybody in the industry, including us, I do think it afforded us an opportunity to accelerate some of those efforts."

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today.

We're pleased to see that our diligence and determination are beginning to pay off. As much of the world reopens, the pent-up demand for travel we've been anticipating is happening. While the pace of recovery varies and COVID variants remain a risk, we are seeing significant sequential improvement in every major region. 
In the second quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 234% year-over-year. Compared to 2019, RevPAR was down 36%, improving 17 percentage points versus the first quarter, with June RevPAR improving 24 percentage points versus the first quarter and down only 29 points versus 2019. 
Additionally, 30% of system-wide comparable hotels exceeded 2019 RevPAR levels in June. Adjusted EBITDA was $400 million, up 684% year-over-year. Performance was driven by strong leisure demand and rate growth. For the second quarter, U.S. leisure demand exceeded prior peak levels, with rates at 90% of prior peaks. This positive momentum continued into July with system-wide and U.S. leisure room nights and rate exceeding 2019 levels. 
Business transient also increased meaningfully throughout the quarter, with June RevPAR for the segment increasing 20 percentage points from the first quarter. We saw improving results in small and medium-sized businesses and positive momentum across larger accounts. In June, business transient room night demand was 70% of 2019 levels, with rate over 80% of 2019 levels. We continue to see progress in July with similar room night demand and rates at 90% of 2019 levels. 
Group performance in the quarter also improved sequentially, driven primarily by social groups given seasonally higher leisure demand. Overall, group demand increased nearly 20 percentage points sequentially from the first quarter, ending June at more than half of 2019 levels. 
Additionally, group bookings for next year are at rates above 2019 peaks. Approximately 99% of our hotels are now open and operating, including some of our largest urban and group properties. In the last few months, we were thrilled to celebrate the reopenings of the legendary Palmer House Hilton, the Chicago Hilton and the Hilton San Francisco Union Square. 
As government restrictions loosen and more people are vaccinated, we continue to see positive momentum in demand and an increasing ability to push rate. For July month-to-date, system-wide demand is 85% of 2019 levels, with rates equal to 2019. In the U.S., July RevPAR is roughly 85% of 2019 levels. And in China, RevPAR is now above prior peaks. With increasing transient bookings, digital traffic and group sales leads, we are optimistic about the forward trends. 
Turning to development. We delivered another robust quarter of growth, with net units increasing 7% year-over-year ahead of expectations due to strong openings in the U.S. and fewer overall removals. During the quarter, we added 119 hotels, totaling nearly 20,000 rooms and celebrated the 5-year anniversary of Tru with the opening of its 200th property. With nearly 270 hotels in development, Tru continues expanding across the U.S. and Canada as well as moving into new markets in the Caribbean and Latin America. 
We were also thrilled to celebrate the highly anticipated opening of Resorts World Las Vegas last month, marking the first ground-up resort development on The Strip in over a decade. The property features 3 of our premium brands, Hilton, Conrad and LXR and adds 3,500 rooms to our portfolio, with expansive meeting and event space, 120,000 square foot casino, 40 world-class food and beverage options and a concert and entertainment venue with capacity for 5,000 attendees. This spectacular property raises the bar for Las Vegas and delivers on our long-standing promise to return to The Strip. 
Along with the recently opened Virgin Hotels Las Vegas Curio, we are now -- we now have more than 30 properties, totaling 11,000 rooms across 12 brands in the city. Las Vegas is also the first U.S. market to house all 3 of our luxury brands. 
Earlier this month, we debuted our premier meetings and events focused brands Signia by Hilton, with the opening of the Signia Orlando Bonnet Creek. The property will undergo a multiphase transformation featuring the addition of more than 94,000 square feet of multifunctional meeting and event space designed for an elevated meeting experience. In the quarter, we also broke ground on the nearly 1,000 room Signia Atlanta scheduled to open in 2023. Our exceptional brands and industry-leading RevPAR premiums continue to drive a high-quality pipeline. 
In the quarter, we signed nearly 26,000 rooms, up 40% year-over-year and increasing from our first quarter pace given strength in the Americas and Asia Pacific regions. We ended the quarter with approximately 401,000 rooms in development, more than half of which are under construction. We had a record number of conversion signings in the quarter, representing 40 hotels and accounting for approximately 30% of our total signings, including the Conrad Chia Laguna, Sardinia, the Conrad Shanghai, which will be our largest Conrad in Asia with more than 725 rooms, and the Hotel 1000 LXR located just steps away from Seattle's iconic Pike Place Market. 
Further expanding our all-inclusive and luxury portfolios, we announced the signing of 3 beachfront resorts in Mexico earlier this month: The Hilton Vallarta Riviera All-Inclusive Resort; the Hilton Tulum All-Inclusive Resort; and the Conrad Tulum, will add more than 1,500 rooms to our existing 70 hotel portfolio in Mexico, demonstrating our commitment to continued expansion across the region and growing our all-inclusive resort footprint. Travelers will soon be able to choose from an even wider variety of Hilton-branded all-inclusive resorts globally. 
We expect positive development trends to continue and remain confident in our expectations to deliver mid-single-digit net unit growth over the next several years. For 2021, we expect net unit growth in the 5% to 5.5% range, above prior expectations, given the pace of openings year-to-date. 
Delivering on guest desire for more flexibility in their travel experience and solving a long-time travel frustration, last month, we launched confirmed connecting rooms, a first in the industry, this innovative technology enables guests to easily book and instantly confirm at least 2 connecting rooms. As families and friends begin to reunite, reconnect and travel again, we're excited to create a seamless travel experience from booking through stay. 
We continue to prioritize unique opportunities to engage our nearly 120 million Honors members, driving value for them through our enhanced partnerships and points redemption offerings. In the quarter, membership grew 10% year-over-year. On average, our premium members are staying with us even more frequently than in 2019. For the quarter, Honors members accounted for 58% of occupancy, reaching a high of 61% in May, only 2% below May of 2019. 
As we head into the back half of the year, we know it's critical to lead with our culture, which was recently earned -- which recently earned us the #1 spot on DiversityInc's list of top 50 companies for diversity. We were also thrilled to invite all of our team members to return to our headquarters last week. The energy and excitement in the office is palpable, and we're thrilled to be back fostering a collaborative environment which allows for innovative thinking as we remain focused on our strategic priorities and the bright future ahead. 
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Kevin to give you more details on our results for the quarter."

During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 233.8% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis as recovery accelerated driven by strong global vaccine rollouts, relaxed government restrictions and surging leisure demand, particularly in the U.S. 
As Chris mentioned, system-wide RevPAR was down 36.1% compared to 2019. Performance was largely balanced between occupancy and rate growth. Adjusted EBITDA was $400 million in the second quarter, and those results reflect relaxed travel restrictions and strengthening global demand. Management and franchise fees grew 220%, demonstrating the resiliency of our fee-based business model. 
Additionally, results were helped by continued cost control at both the corporate and property levels. Our ownership portfolio posted a loss for the quarter due to the more challenged demand environment throughout Europe and Japan and related suspensions of hotel operations. Fixed operating costs further weighed on performance. Overall, the ownership segment performed better than expected, largely due to continued cost control. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share adjusted for special items was $0.56. 
Turning to our regional performance. Second quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR grew 234% year-over-year and was down 31% versus 2019. Demand improved sequentially throughout the quarter, with occupancy averaging roughly 70% in June. Strong leisure demand, combined with improving business transient trends drove rate improvement across the U.S. with weekend ADR finishing June, down mid-single digits as compared to 2019 rate and weekday rates down in the high single digits. 
In the Americas outside the U.S., second quarter RevPAR increased 390% year-over-year and was down 54% versus 2019. While limited international travel weighed on overall performance, easing restrictions and strong leisure demand drove improving trends in June. 
In Europe, RevPAR grew 470% year-over-year and was down 72% versus 2019. While the region saw month-over-month improvement, rising COVID cases and prolonged travel restrictions continued to weigh on performance. 
In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR increased 287% year-over-year and was down 35% versus 2019. Performance benefited from strong domestic leisure demand, with rate now nearly recovered to 2019 levels in July. 
In the Asia Pacific region, second quarter RevPAR grew 143% year-over-year and was down 33% versus 2019. RevPAR in China was down less than 9% as compared to 2019, with rising COVID cases in June temporarily disrupting strong performance trends in April and May. 
However, as Chris mentioned, China has since rebounded with RevPAR now trending above 2019 levels. In the rest of the Asia Pacific region, performance was tempered due to lockdowns in India and continued travel restrictions across Japan. 
Turning to development. As Chris mentioned, in the second quarter, we grew net units 7%. Our pipeline grew sequentially, totaling 401,000 rooms at the end of the quarter, with 62% of pipeline rooms located outside the U.S. Despite the challenges brought about by the pandemic, developer appetite for Hilton brands remained strong across the globe. As travel restrictions ease, regions prepare for recovery and owners focus on growth opportunities, development activity and interest is gaining momentum. 
For the full year, we expect signings to increase in the high single to low double-digit range year-over-year. We expect net unit growth of 5% to 5.5%. 
Turning to the balance sheet. During the quarter, we fully repaid the outstanding $1.2 billion balance on our revolving credit facility. As we look ahead, we remain confident in our balance sheet and financial flexibility as we move forward into the recovery and move closer towards our target leverage. Further details on our second quarter can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning. 
This completes our prepared remarks. We would now like to open the line for any questions you may have. [Operator Instructions]. 
Chad, can we have our first question, please?"

Good question, and happy to give a little bit more color. If you think about around the world, on the development side, I think so goes the recovery sort of so goes the development is probably the simplest way to think about it. S",702,"Yes. Stephen, thank you. Good question, and happy to give a little bit more color. If you think about around the world, on the development side, I think so goes the recovery sort of so goes the development is probably the simplest way to think about it. So versus our earlier expectations and why we're a bit more optimistic, obviously, and have raised our outlook for the year is largely driven by what we were seeing in faster recovery in the U.S. and faster recovery in Asia, really China. And I'd say those are sort of the largest drivers. 
If you think about recovery, that's where -- as we suggested in the prepared comments, that's where we see the steepest slope of recovery. Europe is obviously -- we knew would be lagging and isn't contributing as much as the U.S. and China is at this point. But obviously, our expectation there is as the U.K. and Europe continue to open, we'll see a meaningful uptick there. So I think it's pretty much that simple. Slope of recovery steeper, more activity on the development side in terms of both signings and openings, people are back at it and picking up steam. 
On the conversions, I'd say just modestly better. We -- as you would note from prior calls, we've been -- we've had high expectations for conversions. We have some great conversion brands. The system is performing at the highest levels from a market share point of view than it's ever performed in our history, and I think that's a great leading indicator for opportunities to convince folks who are independent to come into the fold as well as folks that have weaker brands that are looking for a better performance to come into the fold, both of which are happening at a little bit better than our expectations. And so while we had -- we expected things to pick up in the conversion area, I would say, this year and then leading into next because a lot of -- some of the signings will take some time. Most of them have pretty quickly, but some of them will take some time in terms of CapEx work, property improvement programs and the like. It's modestly better than what were pretty high expectations. 
In terms of the financing environment, I mean, there's a lot to discuss. I think -- so we can get to lots of other questions. I think the simple answer is it's improving. I mean the world is a big place. So again, following the slope of recovery, the U.S. and China, I would say, the financing markets are recovering most rapidly because markets are efficient. And performance is starting to really pick up and not just from an occupancy, but you're getting back to rate levels very rapidly, probably more rapidly than I've ever seen in my 40 years of doing this. 
What happens is the lender community starts to have more confidence. Rates are obviously hyper low and have been low and lenders need yield. And so the more comfort they get, that recovery is afoot and that there's going to be a recovery back to where we were and then beyond, the more they're willing to take the risk, a little bit further down on the risk spectrum and underwrite it. 
And so you're seeing pretty robust financing markets in China. The U.S. is still -- has ways to go. I mean you can look at the data out there, it's not anywhere near where it was, but it's improving. And my expectation is as you get into the fall, and I'm sure we'll talk about this, I'll leave it for other questions. And our belief, my belief is that we're going to continue to have very, very strong recovery in the fall and into next year, you're going to continue to see a gradual increase in financing that's available, certainly, here in the U.S. I think Europe will take a little longer. So a ways to go. I'm not saying it's back anywhere near where it was. It's a long way off. But of -- sort of off the floors of what we had seen last year."

We -- if you look at the numbers, we had a little bit higher key money in the quarter than we would typically have. What I would say is, I don't see anything that -- I don't think anything is changing materially, meaning, still over 90% of the deals that we are doing are dry deals. We're not spending -- we're not using the balance sheet anyway. So there's not any material shift, given what's going on in the broader macro environment, the financing markets. Nothing material that shifted. 
The reason you're seeing a little bit heavier key money spend right now is a super positive story in the sense that both things that we've been working on for a long time and/or opportunities that have arisen because of the pandemic have sort of come together in an unusual way this year. So example, some of the bigger key money expenditures are iconic assets for our portfolio largely resort-oriented that we've been working on that will be generational. They'll be in the system for decades and decades and decades. So the Waldorf Astoria in Monarch Beach and Laguna, I've literally been working on that deal one way or another for 20 years, I think, between host and here. And that's in the system, an incredible addition to the Waldorf brand. 
Resorts World, which I talked about in my prepared comments, 3,500 rooms on The Strip. We're basically the only major player on The Strip with a massive meetings platform and 3,500 rooms. We've been working on that for a number of years. Not a crazy amount of key money by any means, but relative to our normal expenditures, significant. 
And then the deals that I talked about in Mexico, the 3 deals, 1,500 rooms, in Puerto Vallarta and then in Tulum, these are incredible assets that were either existing in the one case, in PV, was an existing hotel that was operating with another brand. And in the case of Tulum, was developed literally over 20 years to get the entitlements with another brand. And because of COVID and what has happened in the industry, presented an opportunity for us. And so that allowed us to enter the zone on hotels that would have taken us a decade to sort of pull together, and in a matter of 6 or 12 months, we're going to have these purpose-built incredible hotels in the system. 
And so that's, I know, a long answer, but I view all of those, and then there's some others that I'm not going to be mentioning. But those are the big ones that's like incredible progress for us in all-inclusive, in resorts and in luxury. And those deals just don't come around that often. We're getting a few more of them now, as I said, aided by COVID. So maybe there -- I would say, our spending overall is going to be up probably this year and next year relative to 2020, but 2020 was a depressed year. 
If you look at it versus our normal run rate like '17, '18 and '19, honestly, I think our overall CapEx is sort of going to be within the ranges that we would have been. But again, I don't see anything -- we don't see anything material. We still think over 90% of our deals are going to be dry. And when we have these really unique opportunities, even with key money, they're very nice returns for us, and they're incredibly, I think, strategic and important to the system."

I know that's on everybody's mind. And we have obviously talked a bunch about it. We, ultimately, that's a decision we'll go to our board with. We have an upcoming meeting. We've had broader dialogue, but we haven't pinned it down. But I said on the last call that I was pretty confident that we would be reinstituting return of capital program next year. I still feel that way. Obviously, the slope of the recovery is even steeper. So I would say the update to that would be, I feel confident that we're going to do in the first half of next year. The exact date and time to be determined when we talk to our Board. 
But I think you should read the results of second quarter, you should read the commentary that Kevin and I gave in our prepared comments, plus everything, you're hopefully going to get in color to say that we're very optimistic. We know we're not -- we read the papers. I talk to a lot of people. We're not oblivious to the Delta variant and things that are going on in the world, but we're confident because we think we will power through that. The trends that we see real time are very strong and improving. We feel really good about that going to happen in the fall. And so yes, we -- every quarter that goes by, I think we feel better and better about where the recovery is going. 
And so that should ultimately translate into our feeling better about starting to return capital because we'll be generating real significant free cash flow. In my mind next year, and we do not need to hoard it, our belief has always been that, as I said in my prior answer, we're going to be able to keep growing with very little use of our own balance sheet. And so we're going to give it back to folks. So my expectation is in the first half of next year, that program will resume, and we'll be having some discussion with our Board in the very near future."

So I'll give you -- I mean we do have some data points and some -- and I'll give you my opinion on top of it. I mean, we've obviously seen, as Kevin and I both described in the nuggets that we gave in our comments that you wouldn't find in the press release, we've seen really nice recovery, and that recovery has been across the board. Obviously, most -- the greatest strength in leisure, but significant pickup in business travel and significant pickup while -- further to go in the group side. And we continue to see that, notwithstanding the Delta variant and all the things going on. Like I got just last night, as an example, system-wide U.S., occupancy was 74% Trailing 7 days, 74%. That's with the urban markets -- that’s with some urban hotels not even open and those are in the comp set. And with all of our -- so all of the urban hotels, obviously, the urban environment has been lagging a little bit. 
So what that says to you, like last night, if we're running 74%, that's not leisure. I mean while we have a leisure-oriented hotels, we have a lot of business-oriented hotels. And so mid-week occupancies at that level are definitely reflective of business travel being back. And we've seen it literally -- it's funny sort of post Memorial Day. I mean you just saw the shift. You just saw a shift where weekday occupancies went up 10% or 20%, at any given night, went up 10 or 20 percentage points. And that was business travel, dominated by small and medium-sized businesses, by the way. 
But even pre-COVID, keep in mind, 80% of our business travel was small and medium-sized business, right? So that's sort of currently what's going on. I know your question is forward looking, and I promise you I'm going to get to that. I think the trajectory, my own view, and I think the data sort of supports this, as you get into August, what's going to happen is you're going to continue to have massive surge in leisure travel because everybody wants to get out, notwithstanding, again, the Delta variants and the like. We've not seen impact in sort of consumer behavior from that. So I think you're going to have continued very good strength in the leisure. 
I do think in August, you'll -- as you always do, you will see business transient fall off a little bit, right, just because people are going to be, like they always do, they're going to be not traveling for business as much and going on more vacations. And it's sort of the last hurrah before maybe a lot of people going back to work. And the kids are finally going back to school and all that fun stuff. 
But when you get to the fall, and limited -- we have limited data, obviously, this far out. So this is -- I gave you data points that I have real time today. When you get 60, 90 days out, business transient stats, a lot of the bookings haven't occurred. So this is where it gets into my view of what I think will happen. I think you get after Labor Day, I do believe -- I'm not a health expert, but I'm talking to a lot of them. I do believe we will have powered through the Delta thing, if you look at the stats on hospitalization and the like, they're really not, not terrible. 
If you look at what's happened in the U.K. and we're sort of 3 or 4 weeks behind them, the patterns there right now are quite good. They have infection rates down 50% on a trailing 12-day basis over there. So I think there's a lot of reasons to be optimistic that we sort of power through that. And when we get to the fall, here's what I think we do know, kids are going back to school. I mean, we'll debate whether they're wearing masks or not. Some places, yes, but they're going back to school, and I'm pretty confident in that. 
And offices are opening. I mean they may open different times. Some people, you're reading they’re going to push it a month or whatever. Obviously, I said we're open. We're open and operating here at our -- at all of our headquarters. But you're going to have people back at work, which means with kids in school, with babysitters and with people in the office, you're going to have more propensity to want to travel. 
And when we talk to customers, again, I can't give you the booking data because it's too far out. When we talk to customers, anecdotally, it supports all of that that when you get into the fall, people are going to be traveling. There's both pent-up demand, okay, if things they've been needing to do, and then there's just demand, generally, to -- for folks to be able to run their businesses. And so I think as you get into the fall, you're going to see the natural reduction in the leisure, as we always do, because now kids are in school. They weren't last year. Kids are in school, people are back in the office, they don't have as much time to go on vacation. 
I do believe, again, I can't prove it, but my belief is leisure will be elevated for a while because we're still living in a bit of a hybrid world. But I think business transient will come back. Group will obviously take a little longer gestation period, but group will definitely be coming back, the booking trends into the third, particularly the fourth quarter are much better than they've been. 
And I think we're motoring forward. In terms of -- last time, I believe I said that I think we'd be back to sort of 70% by the end of the year, of '19 levels. And obviously, I feel better. So while we're not giving guidance, so I'm not going to do it. We're not ready to start doing that. There's still enough uncertainty, we want to wait. We do forecast, okay? I mean we're not -- it's not Camp Runamuck here. We are looking at our numbers. 
And I'd say our view is demand levels probably -- RevPAR levels are probably in the U.S. and globally somewhere circa 80% versus the 70% I thought. In our current thinking, demand levels probably back to 85%. So we're getting there. And we're -- I mean, again, much -- I said last time, recovery has been much steeper than we thought. I say it again today. Just things have been coming back more quickly than we would have thought. We knew they'd come back. Obviously, you all know I've been optimistic about the recovery, but it's even better than I would have thought. 
I think one of the most surprising things, although it shouldn't be to any of us because as I kid our team, the laws of economics are alive and well. And the most surprising thing is how quickly rate comes back. But that's -- again, that's just demand, right? We're pricing demand, we're being really smart about it. But I do believe when this -- when we look back on this recovery, the most unusual thing, relative to any other period of my almost 40 years of doing this will be just a rapid return of rate."

It takes time to plan it. They want to sort of get through their budget season before they know how much money they have. 
But I'm not worried about the volumes next year. Again, they're a bit -- they're not where we were at '19. They're close, but they're not there, but the rate is above. And so what I've been -- honestly, what I've been saying to our teams is be really careful, like we -- there's going to be a monumental amount of demand, we don't want to give it away. We want to make sure that we're pricing. Even though we're not at the volumes now, my expectation, very strongly, is it's all going to fill in. It just takes it a little bit longer, given what's the reason for this recession being a health issue. And sort of getting through the final stages of that, in my opinion, is required before you really get the momentum on the volume. And so that's why rates are up is because we're being super disciplined, recognizing that there's a limited amount of meeting space, there's going to be a gargantuan amount of demand, and we can be a bit patient, I think, given what's going on."

I think last quarter, you had said that 2022 might be kind of in the 4% to 5% range, but maybe lower than this year, just given that there was some kind of construction catch up this year. So I'm wondering with the higher unit growth rate here in '21, does that carry through to sort of continued acceleration into '22? Or in fact, is it bringing forward some things you thought would open in '22 that kind of bring forward into '21, and so maybe we'd still see that slightly lower rate closer to 4% next year than the 5% for '22?"

I'll try to go in order. I think on the conversion front, openings were lower. I don't remember the exact percentage, but they were circa 10% of openings for the quarter. And that was just timing. I'd say, last year, we were sort of 19%, 20% of openings. I think this year, it will be that or maybe even a little bit higher given sort of the number of signings we had in the second quarter. And so that's -- I think that's a good way to think about it. 
And look, we are doing more conversions. Very happy with the conversions in the second quarter, really nice mix between hard brands, soft brands, conversions from independents, conversions from other brands regionally. So very happy with that. But that said, our pace of deliveries of new builds is going up as well. So it's sort of hard -- it's a little bit harder for that percentage to move. And of course, that's all baked into our outlook. 
The idea of -- I'll do the third one next, the idea of '22 being affected, not as much. I mean, I think '22 is going to be about what we expect, maybe a little bit of timing pull forward, replaced by a little bit more conversions. So 2022 is about the same as we thought. And then, yes, you picked up on, we said 4% to 5% for the next several years, we were not pointing to any one specific year when we said 4% to 5%. And now we're saying mid-single digits, which, of course, 4% to 5% is mid-single digits. So it's about the same, but I think what you're hearing is a little bit more optimism about the future of net unit growth given what's been going on lately."

It's a great question. Labor shortage is a real issue, probably the single biggest issue that we're dealing with that is definitely not just for Hilton, but industry -- all service industries and manufacturing and a lot of your supply chain issues that you're reading about every day. All of this is sort of interconnected to not having enough labor. At a high level, I think it will largely resolve itself over the next couple of quarters in the sense that I think there are a lot of complex reasons behind it. Some of it is obviously health. People still don't feel like, particularly with the Delta variant now that they should go back to work, some people, because they're worried about their health because -- we haven't had kids in schools, so we don't effectively have day care. There are women in the workforce where it's been most dramatically impacted because they have to stay home to take care of kids. 
And then some of the government programs that were really important last year in the depths of this crisis have -- aren't as important right now when there's a ton of opportunity for employment and that is unemployment insurance, the federal top-up. But that goes away in early September. So I think when you get kids back in school, we get past these -- hopefully, the last wave with Delta and unemployment insurance goes away in the early fall, I think you're going to start to see a significant easing of the issues on the labor side. 
In terms of what -- its impact on margins, given that we're able to -- while there are service issues all of us are having, we're obviously working awfully hard to deliver great service. And I think we are doing a very good job given the difficult circumstances. We are doing it with less labor. And so ironically, given demand and given the ability to price the demand, margins are, in many cases, unbelievably high because you're getting effectively rates that are consistent with what you had before, and you can't get the labor, so you just have less cost. That obviously is a temporary thing. You're going to have to have more labor ultimately in the hotels. 
Having said that, long term, we've done a bunch of things in the crisis in terms of testing and learning on different ways to change the operating model, particularly as it relates to housekeeping and food and beverage and then a whole host of other smaller things where we think we can deliver great experience for our customers and do it more efficiently. And so I think when it all gets flushed through, and we're on the other side of this and through the stresses and strains on the labor issues we're talking about, I think we have developed a plan to have higher-margin businesses across all the major brands. And so yes, it's a big issue. We're spending a lot of time on it, but I do -- as the old adage goes, this too, I think, shall pass."

I would say, sort of atmospherically, I think it's a relatively small percentage of our portfolio.

But I'm not -- I'm just giving you the atmosphere, so I don't -- we don't -- I don't have our data on it. I think that it is an issue but not a significant issue. 
And by the way, it's helping to a degree -- it's also helping with rate because in some markets where they can't, they're reducing capacity and driving rate, which, by the way, back to Bill Crow, when we're done with it, maybe we can declare victory that we were actually really smart about not only rate recovery, but sort of how we manage occupancy versus rate to drive the best profitability. So in the hotels where they are having issues, in many of them, and I can think of a few who I just talked to, are having great success in sort of moderating occupancy levels down and then driving it on the top line. 
And net-net, they're making more money than if they had the incremental labor and they opened up the capacity. They're just -- their profitability is higher. So it's not all a bad story. Long term, obviously, the labor issues we have to sort -- I mean I already gave my answer. I do think they'll sort. There are a bunch of things we're doing to make sure that our system has unique opportunities to access labor and, ultimately, to deliver the kind of service we want to deliver, we do need to get more labor in the hotels.

Well, over the next year, it's probably harder to judge. Over the next several years, obviously, our objective is to continue to enhance the value proposition for Honors, such that, as I've been saying for a long time, you're sort of crazy not to be a member of Honors. You get all the technology, you get a little bit of a discounted rate. You get the points. You can use the points to shop on Amazon, buy a concert ticket at Live Nation, go travel the world and get rooms or food and beverage or a spa treatment or whatever. It's very much an opportunity to sort of create value. 
And if you're not an Honors member and you're staying with us, you're sort of silly, I mean, just because you're effectively giving away value. And so that happens to be true. Obviously, we've been trying to, over the years, as I've talked about many times on these calls, sort of go high and low, make sure that for our most frequent travelers, it's a really relevant program, which I think we've done, but infrequent travelers as well. And that's probably been what's most game-changing for us, and I think it's helped us, sort of over the last 5 years, lead the industry in percentage of occupancy represented by loyalty, which is we've made it relevant to somebody that travels 2 or 3 days a year and not just 60 or 100 days a year because it's a currency effectively, and there's a value proposition that works for them. 
And so being specific about it, we want to continue that. I mean my own view is we were running in the 60s pre-COVID. My goals are much higher for that pre-COVID, and I'm not letting up. I mean COVID set us back, but I think COVID also provided opportunities. And as you pointed out, in May, we were effectively only a couple of points different than we were in '19. Why would that be when our core traveler is not back? Well, I think it's 2 things. One, in May and June, our core travelers started to come back. Number two, we worked really hard in how we sort of shifted our upper funnel and lower funnel strategies for marketing to attract customers into the system that were traveling during COVID that weren't our core customers. 
And so we were able to get a bunch of those folks to say, ""Gosh, I would like to be an Honors member"" and sign up, and then realize this is a really good value proposition. So the whole thing during COVID has been to basically say, let's go really hard after the customer that maybe wasn't our core, wasn't an Honors member, make sure they really understand the value proposition and then keep them in the system. And then when our core customer comes back, obviously, we believe we've got a great value proposition they understand. And when you put one and one together, you hope to get 3. And so the objective would be not to get back to where we were because that wasn't the objective pre-COVID. It's to get significantly beyond that. 
Why? Because we believe it's a better experience for our customer. Like the more -- the better the value proposition, the happier they are. The better experience with the technology, the happier they are. From an ownership and system point of view, we lower our distribution costs. It's the lowest distribution channel -- the lowest cost distribution channel we have. So for all the right reasons, we want to continue to build very direct relationships. And my belief is when you wake up in 2 or 3 years, while COVID has obviously been a difficult time for everybody in the industry, including us, I do think it afforded us an opportunity to accelerate some of those efforts."

We are pleased to report another quarter of very solid results that demonstrate continued recovery and the resiliency of our business model. 
Increases in vaccination rates and consumer spending, coupled with improving business activity, continued to drive solid travel demand throughout the summer and into the fall. As global borders reopen and the travel environment recovers, we remain extremely encouraged by people's desire to travel and connect more than ever before. 
In the third quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 99% year-over-year. Compared to 2019, RevPAR was down roughly 19%, improving 17 percentage points versus the second quarter, with system-wide rates down just 2.5% versus 2019. Adjusted EBITDA totaled approximately $519 million, up 132% year-over-year and down 14% versus 2019. Performance was primarily driven by strong leisure trends, with leisure room nights roughly in line with 2019 level, with leisure rates exceeding 2019 levels. 
Business travel continued to gain momentum, with midweek occupancy and rates improving meaningfully versus the second quarter. In the quarter, business transient room nights were roughly 75% of prior peak levels. 
Group continued to lag, but showed significant sequential improvement versus second quarter, boosted by strength in social events. For the quarter, group RevPAR was approximately 60% of 2019 levels, improving 21 percentage points from the second quarter. 
Overall system-wide RevPAR versus 2019 peaked in July at 85%, with rates just shy of prior peaks. As expected, recovery slowed modestly later in the quarter due to typical seasonality and customer mix shift, but overall trends remain solid. Both August and September RevPAR achieved roughly 80% of 2019 levels, driven by continued strength in leisure and upticks in business travel post Labor Day as offices and schools reopen. These trends improved modestly into October, with month-to-date RevPAR at approximately 84% of 2019 levels and rates in the U.S. nearly back to prior peaks. Roughly 40% of system-wide hotels have exceeded 2019 RevPAR levels in October month-to-date. Additionally, bookings for all future periods are just 8% below 2019. With loosening travel restrictions and strong nonresidential fixed investment forecast, we remain optimistic for future travel demand. 
TSA reported third quarter travel numbers, were nearly 80% of 2019, with demand picking up further following the announcements of the U.S. border reopening and the lift of the international travel ban for vaccinated travelers. Additionally, studies show that nearly 70% of U.S. businesses are back on the road, up 28 points from the end of the second quarter. With roughly 80% of our typical corporate mix coming from small- and medium-sized businesses and with the lagging recovery of larger corporate travel, we've taken the opportunity to continue our work from before COVID to further increase our focus on this segment of demand. This demand is [ higher ], the more resilient -- the resilient, which has helped us to recover more quickly in business transient and should drive rate compression in the future as larger corporate travel picks up. 
On the group side, our position for the rest of the year remains fairly steady, with forward booking sentiment improving as variant concerns taper. Additionally, the recent reopenings of some of our large urban properties, like the New York Hilton Midtown, increased our confidence in our positioning as group recovers. 
Turning to development. We added nearly 100 hotels and 15,000 rooms across all major regions and delivered strong net unit growth of 6.6% in the third quarter. Conversions represented roughly 1/3 of openings. Year-to-date, we've added more than 42,000 net rooms globally, higher than all our major branded competitors. 
Our performance reflects the success of our disciplined growth strategy, the strength of our brands, network effect and commercial engines across the world. It also illustrates our increasing confidence in a strong recovery in global tourism in the months and years to come. 
During the quarter, we launched our large-scale franchise model in China, enabling independent owners to explore franchising opportunities with our Hilton Garden Inn brand, with a prototype developed specifically for the Chinese market. To date, we have signed more than 100 deals to develop Hilton Garden properties in China, strengthening our confidence in the long-term growth of our focused service brands and our ability to cater to a growing middle class. 
Following our recently announced exclusive license agreement with Country Garden, we were thrilled to open our first Home2 suites in China, with plans to grow to more than 1,000 properties. We look forward to leveraging our partnership to capture the rapidly growing demand for mid-scale hotels in China. 
We also celebrated the opening of our 500th Home2 Suites following the brand's launched just 10 years ago, making it one of the fastest-growing brands in industry history, and boasting the industry's largest pipeline in North America with more than 400 hotels in development. 
Our luxury and lifestyle footprints also continued to expand globally with the debut of the Canopy by Hilton in Spain and the highly anticipated opening of the Mango House, LXR and the Say Shells. Marking another important milestone in its global expansion, LXR celebrated its debut in Asia Pacific with the opening of the Roku Kyoto. 
In the quarter, we signed nearly 24,000 rooms, up approximately 40% year-over-year, driven by strength in the Americas and Asia Pacific regions. Driving our positive momentum in luxury, we announced the signing of the Conrad Los Angeles, the brand's first property in California. The 300-room hotel's expected to open in 2022 as part of the Grand L.A. mixed-use development. With approximately 404,000 rooms in development, more than half of which are under construction, we expect positive development trends to continue, driven by both new development and conversion opportunities. 
For the full year, we expect net unit growth in the 5% to 5.5% range, and we continue to expect mid-single-digit growth for the next several years. 
For our guests, flexibility has always been important, but the pandemic has made choice and control even more critical. We were excited to launch several new commercial programs and loyalty extensions, including the launch of digital key share, a first for a major hospitality company. This feature allows more than one guest to have access to their room's digital key. Additional technology enhancements have enabled our Elite Honors members to begin enjoying automatic room upgrades. Gold and Diamond members may be notified of a complementary upgrade prior to arrival, enabling guests to choose their upgraded room directly by using the Hilton Honors app. We continue to focus on new opportunities to further engage our 123 million Honors members and are thrilled to see engagement is nearly back to 2019 levels. In the quarter, membership grew 11% year-over-year. Honors members accounted for 59% of occupancy, with the U.S. at 66%, just 2 points below 2019 levels. 
During the pandemic, approximately 23 million U.S. households brought home a new pet, including my own. And like so many others, my family loves traveling with our new dog, Miller. In the coming months, Homewood Suites will join Home2 in becoming 100% pet-friendly in the U.S., with plans for all limited service brands to be pet-friendly by the first quarter of next year. 
And thanks to our exciting partnership with Mars Petcare, we're offering new pet focused programming and benefits. Our guests are eager to travel with their pretty little friends. And by making that simpler, we're able to capture demand and bring new business into the system. 
As the global travel environment improves, I continue to be impressed by our team members' dedication to providing exceptional experiences to our guests. That's why I am particularly proud that last week, we were named the #3 World's Best Workplace by Fortune and Great Place to Work. After 6 consecutive years of being ranked, Hilton was the only hospitality company on the list. We truly believe that Hilton continues to be an engine of opportunity for all of our stakeholders around the world and are very optimistic for the future. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin for a few more details on our results in the quarter."

During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 98.7% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis as the recovery continued to accelerate, driven by strong leisure demand, particularly in the U.S. and across Europe. Performance was driven by both occupancy and rate growth. As Chris mentioned, system-wide RevPAR was down 18.8% compared to 2019. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $519 million in the third quarter, up 132% year-over-year. Results reflect the broader recovery in travel demand. Management and franchise fees grew 93%, driven by strong RevPAR improvement and Honors license fees. Additionally, results were helped by continued cost control at both the corporate and property levels. 
Our ownership portfolio performed better than expected in the third quarter, driven by the accelerating recovery in Europe, the Tokyo Olympics and ongoing cost controls. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share, adjusted for special items, was $0.78. 
Turning to our regional performance. 
Third quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR grew 105% year-over-year and was down 14% versus 2019. Robust leisure demand and improving business transient trends drove strong performance in July. Trends modestly slowed later in the quarter due to seasonality. U.S. occupancy averaged nearly 70% for the quarter, with overall rate largely in line with 2019 levels. 
In the Americas outside the U.S., third quarter RevPAR increased 168% year-over-year and was down 30% versus 2019. The region benefited from easing travel restrictions and strong leisure demand over the summer period. Canada also saw a noticeable step-up in demand in August after reopening their borders to vaccinated Americans. 
In Europe, RevPAR grew 142% year-over-year and was down 35% versus 2019. Travel demand accelerated across the region in the third quarter as vaccination rates increased and international travel restrictions loosen. 
In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR increased 110% year-over-year and was down 29% versus 2019. Performance benefited from strong domestic leisure demand and international inbound travel from Europe. 
In the Asia Pacific region, third quarter RevPAR grew 5% year-over-year and was down 41% versus 2019. RevPAR in China was down 25% as compared to 2019 as a rise in COVID cases led to reimpose restrictions and lockdowns across the country. China has recovered steadily into October, with occupancy nearing 60% for the month. In the rest of the Asia Pacific region, prolonged lockdowns in Australia and New Zealand offset upside from the Tokyo Olympics. 
Turning to development. As Chris mentioned, in the third quarter, we grew net units 6.6%. Our pipeline grew sequentially, totaling 404,000 rooms at the end of the quarter, with 62% of pipeline rooms located outside the U.S. Development activity continues to gain momentum across the globe as the recovery progresses, a testament to the confidence owners and developers have in our strong commercial engines and industry-leading brands. For the full year, we now expect signings to increase in the mid to high teens range year-over-year and expect net unit growth of 5% to 5.5%. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $8.9 billion of long-term debt and $1.4 billion in total cash and cash equivalents. We're proud of the financial flexibility we demonstrated over the past 18 months. And looking ahead, we remain confident in our balance sheet management as we continue to progress through the recovery and move closer towards our target leverage. 
Further details on our third quarter can be found in the earnings release we issued earlier this morning.

I mean great question, Carlo, and obviously, one everybody is interested in So maybe I'll talk about all the segments a little bit because it's hard to do one without the others. So as you know, to grossly oversimplify, which I'd like to do occasiona",692,"Yes. I mean great question, Carlo, and obviously, one everybody is interested in So maybe I'll talk about all the segments a little bit because it's hard to do one without the others. So as you know, to grossly oversimplify, which I'd like to do occasionally I -- the way I would see it is as we have been seeing through the third quarter and what I think we'll see in the fourth quarter is a continued uptick in business transient travel. I think that will come from all segments of business strange. But again, probably continue to be led this -- in this year in the fourth quarter by small and medium SME, small and medium enterprises. I don't think you'll see a huge pickup, but I think you'll see a modest pickup. 
At the same time, just because people are increasingly back in offices and kids are definitely mostly, if not entirely, back in school, I think you'll see a little bit of a tick down in leisure business. Now the weekends will continue to rage. I think, the weekends have been extraordinary. But the midweek leisure travel will continue to tick down. And I think those 2 will largely offset each other in the fourth quarter. 
I think group will remain pretty consistent. Obviously, we had a big uptick in the summer and then Delta variant sort of slid out the momentum a little bit on group. People think there's advanced planning. People have to spend money. And so while there's plenty of group occurring, it's really largely sports and social at this point. I think that continues about like what we've seen in the third quarter into the fourth because people are -- all the pent-up demand is there, but people are sort of advanced planning more into next year just to sort of finally get through Delta, and hopefully, to the endemic stage of COVID, which sort of feels like is we're in the process of doing as we speak. 
As we think about 2022 with all those segments, what I would say is, I think leisure will remain elevated relative to historical standards. Obviously, my belief is kids will still be back in school. More offices are going to open. So mid-week, we'll get back to more normalized levels. But I think the weekends, people want to be out. That turns out they didn't like being locked in their closets and basements and the attics so they're going to want to get out. And we've seen this pattern of very high demand on weekends. I think that will continue. And so I think on the margin, leisure will be -- continue to be stronger than we've historically seen sort of in pre-COVID times. I think business transient will continue to move up. You'll continue to see great strength in small and medium enterprises, which aren't fully back to pre-COVID, but getting pretty close. And my own belief is you'll start to see the large corporate step into the game. I mean they're already in the game, but they're still sort of like 40% off of '19 levels. I think you'll see a step change in the large corporates which will contribute along with SMEs to continued upticks in business transient. 
And then I think group is clearly going to be better next year than this year. I think reality is the first quarter probably is typically a slow group quarter. I don't think it will be different in that way. I think people are going to want to sort of clear the mechanism of getting past the winter just -- cause concerns of flu seasons and all that given what we've all been through. But I think as you get into Qs 2, 3 and 4, both booked business and realized business on the group side are going to be better. 
So I think 2022 is sizing up to be -- I think the fourth quarter is sizing up to be fairly similar to the third quarter. And I think 2022 is sizing up to be another big step forward on recovery to more normalized times."

Another we've spent a lot of time looking at that through the last couple of quarters and very recently. Here's what I'd say. I gave you a sense so I won't repeat what both Kevin and I said about NUG. Kevin, we both talked about it this year. I gave",647,"Yes. Another we've spent a lot of time looking at that through the last couple of quarters and very recently. Here's what I'd say. I gave you a sense so I won't repeat what both Kevin and I said about NUG. Kevin, we both talked about it this year. I gave you a sense in our prepared comments that we think we'll be in the mid-single-digits for the next couple of years. Obviously, that requires a lot of work. It requires signing deals, starting construction that then ultimately it lands in our NUG numbers. 
I think when you look back 2 years from now at this period of time, I am of the mind and reasonably confident that what you will see is the trough in deal signings was last year. As Kevin mentioned, we're going to be up in the mid- to high single-digits in signings this year, we think. I mean, we're not done with the year. We always have a good flurry of activity at the end, but we got a lot of it on the books. And so we're pretty darn confident we're going to be up nicely. And I don't see why next year, given what's going on in the environment in terms of particularly operating recovery, pricing power which I'm sure we'll come to, I'll do it maybe in another question, that we're going to see more deals signed next year. So I think last year was probably, in my mind, the trough for signings. I think this year, for those same exact reasons, will be the trough in construction starts. 
Starts always will lag the signings a little bit. We're definitely going to be a little bit modestly down in signings this year after being down last year. Our expectation is that will turn around next year. And that's why we think we'll be sort of in the mid-single-digits for a couple of years and then back on track being in the 6% to 7% range just, because starting this year, we're signing more. Starting next year, we're starting more. We're obviously filling in a lot. You saw in the second quarter, 1/3 of our NUG was conversion. So we're filling in. And so between all of those factors, we think, ultimately, when we get out past a couple of years, we're back. The goal is to be back in the 6% to 7%. And I think given what I see in the environment, that we feel pretty good about that. 
I mean -- and I'll probably stop there with the only comment being things are going to come back faster than prior recoveries here. And that's because the thing that's very different than every other cycle I've seen in my 40 years, and I'll leave it at this, and somebody I'm sure I have a question, is just pricing power. I mean the reality is, typically, it's like a grind to build back occupancy and rate lags significantly. Rate is leading the charge, and that obviously flows really nicely. We've done a bunch of things, as you know. And we've talked about a lot to create higher margin businesses out of all of these brands. And when you flush all that through, even with labor costs up and all of those fun things, these are higher-margin businesses. And part of this is just we're in an inflationary environment. And guess what? We can reprice our product every second of every day. We're a very good hedge in that way to inflation. And we're being very thoughtful about how we're pricing our product. And so I think when we all look back on it, this will be a faster recovery on the development side than we've seen in prior cycles. And the -- so I think we're going to be back in -- on a very nice trajectory next year."

But I guess my twist would be, could you give us a little color specifically on the business pricing side? I think we all see that the leisure rates are exceptional. And so maybe your thoughts on how long leisure can continue pricing like it is, your thoughts on the recovery of business pricing. And then any headwind from large corporates? You've done a great job of delineating small and large. So how much of a headwind is large corporate? Does that price any differently? Is that a factor at all?"

So I guess I shouldn't be surprised of getting asked. Listen, you embedded in the question is part of the answer. But obviously, we feel -- first of all, let me not be pedantic, but say what I say a lot when I'm asked this question. The laws of economics are alive and well, right? And that's what's going on. Why is leisure so strong in rate? Why are we able to price above historically high levels? Because there are crazy amounts of demand. Like our weekend demand is off the charts. We're running 85% to 90% system-wide in the U.S. on the weekends. And we're pricing over '19 levels, obviously, because we have a lot of demand. 
I do think that will -- that leisure pricing power will continue because, what I said before, I believe that leisure demand is going to remain at elevated levels, particularly on the weekends, and that that's going to give us nice pricing power. Even though, obviously, the recovery in business transient has lagged, as I said in the quarter, we were 75%, but it's sort of a tale of 2 cities, which is, I implied it a little bit. You have the big corporates which are still 40% off. But then you have small and medium which are only maybe 10%. You could even argue maybe 5% or 10% off. And so we have a fair amount of pricing power in the biggest piece -- in the biggest segments, and they are less price sensitive. So broadly, your biggest -- it's not everybody. Your biggest corporate customers can end up with sort of off bar, 10% or 20%. Small and medium might end up at 5% or 7%. So that's why we were working so hard on accessing more of that demand base pre-COVID and has helped us during COVID. 
And so when you put it all together and you look at like even in the quarter, we're at 90% of 2000 -- in business transient combined, we're already at 90% of 2019 levels even though we still have a ways to go to build back demand. So I feel it's a long way to it. I feel pretty good about where that's going because we're going to keep pushing on small and medium. That's almost back. My guess is that will exceed prior levels. And then the corporates are going to come in. And that's going to allow us to put more on the top of the funnel to price -- have more demand, allows us to price more aggressively. 
I think when it's all said and done, if we were 80-20 before, and I don't know exactly where it will be, but my suspect we will probably never go back to 80-20 in reality because we have been successful at finding other segments that we think are going to be there. They're going to be more resilient and they're going to be higher priced. So my guess is we will be managing to probably a 90-10 world or something like that. But we do think pricing power is not in business transient what it is in leisure, but it's not far off. 
And then group, group is sort of in the year, for the year, similar to business transient. But as you look forward, because there's so much pent-up demand, and as I've talked about at least on the last call, we're actually pricing already over '19 levels. So there's pricing power. And you'd say, well, wow, if group is still way off from a consumer revenue point of view, what's going on? Well, what's going on is group is very -- the one segment that books [ wane ] advance. And there's a limited amount of meeting space in the world and in the United States. We happen to have a lot of it. I mean, there are a few of us that are very big players in that space. A lot of people want it. And so the reality is, again, laws of economics are alive and well. People want it. There's not that enough of it. You have huge pent-up demand that's sort of getting all -- events that didn't happen, that need to happen, new events. And that's pushing into next year. 
And so even though in the moment, group revenues aren't what they were, on a forward-looking basis, there is a good amount of pricing power, which is why on a -- all of our advanced bookings in the next year are pricing over '19 levels at this point. 
So again, back to the debate I put out there, I guess it's unusual. Like I hate to admit how long I've been doing this, but a long time. I guess I said it before. But it just hasn't really happened this way. Now there are a lot of reasons. We're better, right? We got much more sophisticated revenue management systems. We're much more on top of it, I think, than we've ever been. Obviously, we're in a more inflationary environment broadly. Thank you, Federal Reserve and the U.S. Congress, for fiscal and monetary stimulus. We could debate transitory or otherwise. But those things are translating into broadly a more highly inflationary environment. And that applies to us too, and that obviously is helping from a pricing power point of view."

We've done 2. The one you mentioned with Plateno was the Hampton Inn. And then more recently, I mentioned in my comments, we just actually opened our first Home2 Sweets by Hilton in China, on the road to doing 1,000 of them with Country Garden, one of the largest players in China, which is another master license agreement. So we've done those 2. 
Never say never. I'm not saying. But the idea was to really help -- get help from very large local players that knew had a -- garner scale very quickly to help build our network effect in China and then ultimately come back in with our other brands and do it ourselves. And so that's exactly what we're doing with Hilton Garden Inn. We obviously have a massive franchise system here in the United States, and frankly, in Europe now, where the bulk of the business here is franchised. Increasingly, I think we're now -- the majority of the business in Europe is franchised. It's been a much smaller part of the business in China and in Asia Pacific so we historically haven't had the same level of resources. 
And so what we've done during COVID is made some strategic investments to build out more infrastructure so that we can take other brands in our -- of our 18 brand -- a family of brands and do it ourselves. And so we're trying to be very sort of balanced and balance all the risks associated with our expansion around the world. And we think it's great to work with third-parties. We love the Country Garden folks and Plateno. They've been incredibly important partners, will continue to be for a long, long time. But it's also important that we have that skill set ourselves in franchising. Is it -- while it's similar in China, it's not exactly the same. And so we've learned a lot and I think built a -- we're building a good infrastructure and a good muscle set to be able to take a bunch of other brands and do just what we've done here in the U.S., Europe and other places."

It's -- I mean I had a hard time hearing some of that, but I think I [indiscernible] labor costs and what owners are telling us. It's obviously been a big issue and one that we spent a lot of time on, a complex issue in terms of what's sort of underneath the problem. 
What I would say is, obviously, there is no one owner group. The different owners and different parts of the country and the world, for that matter, have different views. But if I sort of homogenize it all, which is hard to do, but if I do it in my head, I would say, while it's still a very difficult issue, we've started to see easing in terms of access to labor. I think we have ways to go. There are a bunch of things we're doing to help from a technology point of view to access pools of labor that maybe we hadn't accessed historically. But broadly, more labor is coming back in. And some of those pressures are easing. Obviously, labor is more expensive pretty much everywhere. I think that's a reality. Where it settles out, I think it's a little early to know. But I think it is sort of settling down as people are gradually coming back into the workforce. 
I think the end of the question, which is a really important one, which I sort of touched on earlier in one of my other filibusters, was how is it going to look for owners on the other side? And again, it's hard -- some owners -- it depends on location, product, 1,000 factors. But broadly -- and we're already seeing it. I think I said this. Broadly, I think when we get to the other side of this, across the system, margins are going to be higher. And you know why. With input costs going up, labor costs going up and all of those fun things, they're going to be -- margins are going to be higher because rate is going to be a lot higher, ultimately, when we get past this for all the reasons I talked about in terms of the pricing power that we have and the broader inflationary environment. That's very helpful to the business. At the same time, particularly in the mega categories, which is where the bulk of the hotels are with our ownership community, we did a bunch of really important work and did a lot of testing and learning and made a bunch of changes in the hotels, in the end, we think, to create a better experience for our customers, but to do it in a more efficient way to drive higher margins. 
So we're pretty confident. And we have pretty good evidence, which I'll talk about that even with the -- when labor comes back and you have to pay labor more, given where rate structures are going to be in most places and given the efficiencies that we've been able to garner, that these are -- our owners are going to end up with higher margin businesses. And by the way, many, many of them. Not all of them. So for those that haven't gotten there that are listening, keep the faith. But many, many owners are already there. 
Some of it is unsustainable, meaning part of it is they can't get enough labor, and so they don't have enough people so their labor costs are unusually low. But even in places where they are able to get the labor back for the reasons I described, meaning more efficiencies on our standards and pricing power on the top line, they're driving very good margins. And so we've had -- the owners are -- have been in pain. I don't want to minimize it. There's still many of them in a lot of pain. But we're doing our level best to get them to the other side and make sure their businesses are stronger, both because that's what we should do as a fiduciary to them. But also, ultimately, if we want to continue to be able to grow, we have to give them an investment alternative that continues to make sense from a return point of view. And so we're hyper focused on it. And I would say, I feel really good. As I said, I think the development cycle will flip faster than we've seen in prior cycles for these reasons. I just think that the economics, the laws of economics are live and well. I said it now twice or 3x, that if people can get great returns because of the conditions, macro and micro, macro world going on micro, the things we're doing, then they're going to want to build us more hotels. And obviously, with the signings being up in the mid -- double -- mid-teens to plus, we think that's pretty good prima facie evidence that that's what's going on."

I think we have 20-something, 25 to 30 new countries embedded in the pipeline that we don't have today, right? So we're always trying to enter new markets. I'm not sure really anything of that -- any of that has been opened up by the pandemic. I think it's just sort of the course of the growth of our business over time. 
And then trajectory really has a lot to do with how places are coming out of the pandemic. Meaning we've been -- even though there's been spikes up and down in RevPAR in China, for instance, as they go into lockdowns, the development trajectory there has actually continued to be pretty solid and continued to improve. But in places like Europe where, traditionally, it's more of a face-to-face development environment, the less people have been able -- the less our teams and the owners have been able to get on planes and move around country to country, those signings have lagged a little bit. So I actually see that as a tailwind coming out of the pandemic, whereas there's a lot of pent-up demand for development in EMEA broadly. And I think that it's just going to require a little bit more mobility to surface that. But the rest of it is just, over time, as Chris has talked about this, as you have a rapidly developing middle class, with more demand for mid-market products, you're going to see a little bit more of that demand over time. I mean the full service business is not dead by any means. But you're just going to see on the margin, the capital flows more to the limited service hotels. So we're going to do more deals where the capital flows. And then as we bring franchising, which has been very successful for us, Chris went through it so I won't go through it again, but as we bring franchising to different parts of the world, particularly Asia Pacific, we're just going to do more franchise deals over time. You're not going to see, I don't think big step changes. You're just going to see a gradual growth over time in more limited service mix and more franchise mix. Did that cover all the parts?"

So while more offices are going to open through the rest of this year and into next year. 
What we've seen in the pattern of leisure during the midweek, it's our -- we've sort of washed out a large part of that already. I may be wrong, but I believe the weekends are going to remain strong, simply because I still think, if you look at the $3 trillion of incremental savings during COVID, there's a long way to go to spend at all. And I think people still want to do -- they want the experiences that they were starved for. And now it gets concentrated more on weekends, which is what we're seeing now. I believe that will continue. I don't -- -- so the net of it is, I -- my view, just to be clear, is that relative to a normalized like '19 level of leisure demand, I think we're getting back more towards that, with a little bit better because I think the weekends are going to be a little bit better. I'm not -- I agree with you. I don't think that the mid-week leisure is going to be raging. And that's not sort of built into my expectations. 
In terms of outbound, yes, the world is opening up. But then there's inbound, too, particularly for the cities that -- the big cities, top 25 markets that historically depend on 20% of their business from inbound international travel, they've had 0. And starting next week or week after, the floodgates are going to open on that. So yes, you're going to have some people going out there, but you're going to have a lot of people that want to come see America that is going to offset that. And particularly with the top 25 markets, broadly, but particularly in the top 25 markets that are going to come in. 
Again, we're still in the middle of budgets. And we're still debating all of this and where it ends up. There's -- I'm giving you my opinion and my sense of it. I think leisure will remain -- when we wake up next year and the following year and you compare it to the amount of leisure business that we did, which was probably 25% or 30% of our overall segmentation pre-COVID, I think it will be higher than that. And I think it will be higher than that because people want to get out more. There's plenty of incremental savings in the world that has not gotten anywhere close to being spent. And the weekend business, while we were doing better on weekends than we had historically, I think it will stay even more elevated than that."

But to repeat what I said last time, we are very interested in getting back to returning capital. We firmly believe in our capital allocation strategy pre-COVID, which was, we were producing a lot of free cash flow that we didn't -- we can continue to grow the business in an industry-leading way without the use of much of it. And we wanted, as a result, to give it back to our shareholders because there was no reason for us to hoard it or do dumb things with it. And disciplined capital allocation, we believe, is a hallmark of long term, delivering great returns for shareholders. 
Our -- my belief hasn't been changed through COVID. The only thing that changed is we didn't have a lot of free cash flow during the heat of the crisis. We are obviously getting past that. We are cash flow positive. We want to just give it a little bit more time, as I said on the last call, sort of finish out the year. And if things go as we expect and consistent with what we have been seeing, we're going to reinstate a return of capital program in the first half of next year. And my guess is it will look quite similar. I mean, we're still having that discussion with our Board, who obviously has a -- as I say it, but I think if I had to pick a line, I think it will look a lot like what we were doing pre-COVID. And we're very focused on it and very anxious to get back to it. And so I direct you, I would say first half of next year."

I think what we said, Patrick, is that in the context of when RevPAR levels are elevated, the RevPAR growth is elevated the way it is. It will be in that zone. I think it should be, obviously, 90% of the business is from fees, that should be about 1 to 1 as things normalize. We think we can do a little bit better with net unit growth, cost discipline, license fees, things like that. Maybe a little bit better than 1 to 1 over time. But I think the 1.3x is more of when RevPAR is elevated. 
And then no change -- short answer is no change in our views on G&A, right? We've been very disciplined. I think we -- what we've said to you guys is that cash G&A ought to be down this year in the mid- to high teens from 2019 levels. We actually might do a little bit better than that this year because we've got pretty good cost discipline. GAAP is different, but you got a lot of moving pieces. Particularly in the third quarter this year, we're lapping over some of the write-downs of stock comp from last year. 
And then going forward, again, no real change. I think we all understand that, with more business activity, it's going to come a little bit more expense. And just like we're in an inflationary environment that's going to help on the revenue side, we're going to be paying people a little bit more along the way. But we do think we're going to maintain discipline. The changes that we've made to our structure are going to hold going forward. And we feel -- still feel the same way."

I don't feel really a lot different than I did pre-COVID. I mean, we believe there's an efficient frontier. And we've calculated it as best we can by individual market property, what -- based on what they can deliver at that price point versus what we can deliver, how do we deliver the highest index, the highest revenue for the lowest distribution cost. And we do believe, and that's why we've had a good relationship with the OTAs, that they play a part in that. It's traditionally been in the sort of 10% or 12% range, and that's historically where we've been. During COVID, that went up. But if we wanted it to go up. We partnered, I think, quite successfully with our partners knowing that the biggest segment of demand that was out there for most of COVID was lower rated leisure, which is what they are particularly good at, nonloyalty -- nonloyal type customer base. And so it crept up a bit, but not too terribly much. And we've already seen that sort of peak and start to come down. And so while we'll look at the efficient frontier as we always do periodically, and maybe if you think leisure is going to be a little bit higher component overall, maybe it goes up a little but not much, and it didn't move that much. 
So the net of all that is, I think when we wake up in a couple of years, it will look an awful lot like it did before. And we obviously feel good about the contractual terms that we have with the OTAs now and our ability to continue to have attractive terms going forward. 
As it relates to Honors, the My Honors team is probably listening, and they may need a diaper for this. But we're -- we maxed out in the 63%, 64% system-wide. And we're already in the U.S., as I mentioned in my prepared comments, not that far off of that. Globally, we're coming back as our more of -- #1, we've accessed more travelers that weren't loyal. So some of these leisure travelers that we didn't have access to, we've now access. And more of our core customer is getting back on the road. We're getting back to normal. But I'm not going to put a number out there because I'll give a heart -- my team will have a heart attack. But I believe that there is a lot of room to grow. I think the super majority -- if we're doing our job, the super majority of our customers want to be Honors members. It's a proposition that they get benefits that you just don't get, and they're meaningful. You can go through them, they get discounts, they get technology, they get experiences money can't buy. They get points that are a currency. They can shop on Amazon, and lift and buy tickets at [ 5 ] nation. And there is no reason as we continue coming out of this to actively engage with our customer base. Where it shouldn't be -- we shouldn't be able to push it meaningfully higher than where we kept -- where we maxed out before. Now that will take time. And so to My Honors team, don't freak out. We're going to give you the time. But our goal is there, which I'm not going to state publicly, are meaningfully higher than where we were, which, by the way, is meaningfully higher than any of our competitors."

We are pleased to report another quarter of very solid results that demonstrate continued recovery and the resiliency of our business model. 
Increases in vaccination rates and consumer spending, coupled with improving business activity, continued to drive solid travel demand throughout the summer and into the fall. As global borders reopen and the travel environment recovers, we remain extremely encouraged by people's desire to travel and connect more than ever before. 
In the third quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 99% year-over-year. Compared to 2019, RevPAR was down roughly 19%, improving 17 percentage points versus the second quarter, with system-wide rates down just 2.5% versus 2019. Adjusted EBITDA totaled approximately $519 million, up 132% year-over-year and down 14% versus 2019. Performance was primarily driven by strong leisure trends with leisure room nights roughly in line with 2019 level, with leisure rates exceeding 2019 levels. 
Business travel continued to gain momentum with midweek occupancy and rates improving meaningfully versus the second quarter. In the quarter, business transient room nights were roughly 75% of prior peak levels. Group continued to lag but showed significant sequential improvement versus the second quarter, boosted by strength in social events. For the quarter, group RevPAR was approximately 60% of 2019 levels, improving 21 percentage points from the second quarter.
Overall system-wide RevPAR versus 2019 peaked in July at 85% with rates just shy of prior peaks. As expected, recovery slowed modestly later in the quarter due to typical seasonality and customer mix shift, but overall trends remained solid. Both August and September RevPAR achieved roughly 80% of 2019 levels, driven by continued strength in leisure and upticks in business travel post-Labor Day as offices and schools reopen. These trends improved modestly into October with month-to-date RevPAR at approximately 84% of 2019 levels and rates in the U.S. nearly back to prior peaks. Roughly 40% of system-wide hotels have exceeded 2019 RevPAR levels in October month-to-date. 
Additionally, bookings for all future periods are just 8% below 2019. With loosening travel restrictions and strong nonresidential fixed investment forecast, we remain optimistic for future travel demand.
TSA reported third quarter travel numbers were nearly 80% of 2019 with demand picking up further following the announcements of the U.S. border reopening and the lift of the international travel ban for vaccinated travelers. Additionally, studies show that nearly 70% of U.S. businesses are back on the road, up 28 points from the end of the second quarter. With roughly 80% of our typical corporate mix coming from small- and medium-sized businesses and with the lagging recovery of larger corporate travel, we've taken the opportunity to continue our work from before COVID to further increase our focus on this segment of demand. This demand is higher rated, the more resilient -- resilient, which has helped us recover more quickly in business transient and should drive rate compression in the future as larger corporate travel picks up. 
On the group side, our position for the rest of the year remains fairly steady with forward booking sentiment improving as variant concerns taper. Additionally, the recent reopenings of some of our large urban properties, like the New York Hilton Midtown, increased our confidence in our positioning as group recovers. 
Turning to development. We added nearly 100 hotels and 15,000 rooms across all major regions and delivered strong net unit growth of 6.6% in the third quarter. Conversions represented roughly 1/3 of openings. Year-to-date, we've added more than 42,000 net rooms globally, higher than all our major branded competitors. 
Our performance reflects the success of our disciplined growth strategy, the strength of our brands, network effect and commercial engines across the world. It also illustrates our increasing confidence in a strong recovery in global tourism in the months and years to come. 
During the quarter, we launched our large-scale franchise model in China, enabling independent owners to explore franchising opportunities with our Hilton Garden Inn brand with a prototype developed specifically for the Chinese market. To date, we have signed more than 100 deals to develop Hilton Garden properties in China, strengthening our confidence in the long-term growth of our focused service brands and our ability to cater to a growing middle class. 
Following our recently announced exclusive license agreement with Country Garden, we were thrilled to open our first Home2 Suites in China with plans to grow to more than 1,000 properties. We look forward to leveraging our partnership to capture the rapidly growing demand for mid-scale hotels in China. 
We also celebrated the opening of our 500th Home2 Suites following the brand's launch just 10 years ago, making it one of the fastest-growing brands in industry history and boasting the industry's largest pipeline in North America with more than 400 hotels in development. 
Our luxury and lifestyle footprints also continued to expand globally with the debut of the Canopy by Hilton in Spain and the highly anticipated opening of the Mango House LXR in the Seychelles. Marking another important milestone in its global expansion, LXR celebrated its debut in Asia Pacific with the opening of the ROKU KYOTO. 
In the quarter, we signed nearly 24,000 rooms, up approximately 40% year-over-year, driven by strength in the Americas and Asia Pacific regions. Driving our positive momentum in luxury, we announced the signing of the Conrad Los Angeles, the brand's first property in California. The 300-room hotel is expected to open in 2022 as part of The Grand LA mixed-use development. With approximately 404,000 rooms in development, more than half of which are under construction, we expect positive development trends to continue, driven by both new development and conversion opportunities. For the full year, we expect net unit growth in the 5% to 5.5% range, and we continue to expect mid-single-digit growth for the next several years. 
For our guests, flexibility has always been important, but the pandemic has made choice and control even more critical. We were excited to launch several new commercial programs and loyalty extensions, including the launch of Digital Key Share, a first for a major hospitality company. This feature allows more than one guest to have access to their room's digital key. 
Additional technology enhancements have enabled our elite Honors members to begin enjoying automatic room upgrades. Gold and Diamond members may be notified of a complementary upgrade prior to arrival, enabling guests to choose their upgraded room directly by using the Hilton Honors app. We continue to focus on new opportunities to further engage our 123 million Honors members and are thrilled to see engagement is nearly back to 2019 levels. In the quarter, membership grew 11% year-over-year. Honors members accounted for 59% of occupancy with the U.S. at 66%, just 2 points below 2019 levels. 
During the pandemic, approximately 23 million U.S. households brought home a new pet, including my own. And like so many others, my family loves traveling with our new dog, Miller. In the coming months, Homewood Suites will join Home2 in becoming 100% pet-friendly in the U.S. with plans for all limited service brands to be pet-friendly by the first quarter of next year. And thanks to our exciting partnership with Mars Petcare, we're offering new pet-focused programming and benefits. Our guests are eager to travel with their furry little friends. And by making that simpler, we're able to capture demand and bring new business into the system. 
As the global travel environment improves, I continue to be impressed by our team members' dedication to providing exceptional experiences to our guests. That's why I am particularly proud that, last week, we were named the #3 World's Best Workplace by Fortune and Great Place to Work. After 6 consecutive years of being ranked, Hilton was the only hospitality company on the list. We truly believe that Hilton continues to be an engine of opportunity for all of our stakeholders around the world and are very optimistic for the future. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin for a few more details on our results in the quarter."

During the quarter, system-wide RevPAR grew 98.7% versus the prior year on a comparable and currency-neutral basis as the recovery continued to accelerate, driven by strong leisure demand, particularly in the U.S. and across Europe. Performance was driven by both occupancy and rate growth. As Chris mentioned, system-wide RevPAR was down 18.8% compared to 2019. Adjusted EBITDA was $519 million in the third quarter, up 132% year-over-year. Results reflect the broader recovery in travel demand. Management and franchise fees grew 93%, driven by strong RevPAR improvement and Honors license fees. Additionally, results were helped by continued cost control at both the corporate and property levels. Our ownership portfolio performed better than expected in the third quarter, driven by the accelerating recovery in Europe, the Tokyo Olympics and ongoing cost controls. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share, adjusted for special items, was $0.78. 
Turning to our regional performance. Third quarter comparable U.S. RevPAR grew 105% year-over-year and was down 14% versus 2019. Robust leisure demand and improving business transient trends drove strong performance in July. Trends modestly slowed later in the quarter due to seasonality. U.S. occupancy averaged nearly 70% for the quarter with overall rate largely in line with 2019 levels. 
In the Americas outside the U.S., third quarter RevPAR increased 168% year-over-year and was down 30% versus 2019. The region benefited from easing travel restrictions and strong leisure demand over the summer period. Canada also saw a noticeable step-up in demand in August after reopening their borders to vaccinated Americans. 
In Europe, RevPAR grew 142% year-over-year and was down 35% versus 2019. Travel demand accelerated across the region in the third quarter as vaccination rates increased and international travel restrictions loosened. 
In the Middle East and Africa region, RevPAR increased 110% year-over-year and was down 29% versus 2019. Performance benefited from strong domestic leisure demand and international inbound travel from Europe. 
In the Asia Pacific region, third quarter RevPAR grew 5% year-over-year and was down 41% versus 2019. RevPAR in China was down 25% as compared to 2019 as a rise in COVID cases led to reimposed restrictions and lockdowns across the country. China has recovered steadily into October with occupancy nearing 60% for the month. In the rest of the Asia Pacific region, prolonged lockdowns in Australia and New Zealand offset upside from the Tokyo Olympics. 
Turning to development. As Chris mentioned, in the third quarter, we grew net unit 6.6%. Our pipeline grew sequentially, totaling 404,000 rooms at the end of the quarter with 62% of pipeline rooms located outside the U.S. Development activity continues to gain momentum across the globe as the recovery progresses, a testament to the confidence owners and developers have in our strong commercial engines and industry-leading brands. For the full year, we now expect signings to increase in the mid- to high teens range year-over-year and expect net unit growth of 5% to 5.5%. 
Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $8.9 billion of long-term debt and $1.4 billion in total cash and cash equivalents. We're proud of the financial flexibility we demonstrated over the past 18 months. And looking ahead, we remain confident in our balance sheet management as we continue to progress through the recovery and move closer towards our target leverage.

So maybe I'll talk about all the segments a little bit because it's hard to do one without the others. So as you know, to grossly oversimplify, which you know I like to do occasionally, the way I would see it is, as we have been seeing through the third quarter and what I think we'll see in the fourth quarter is a continued uptick in business transient travel, I think that will come from all segments of business strange. But again, probably continue to be led this -- in this year in the fourth quarter by small and medium SME, small and medium enterprises. I don't think you'll see a huge pickup, but I think you'll see a modest pickup. 
At the same time, just because people are increasingly back in offices and kids are definitely, mostly, if not entirely, back in school, I think you'll see a little bit of a tick-down in leisure business. Now the weekends will continue to rage, I think. The weekends have been extraordinary, but the midweek leisure travel will continue to tick down. And I think those 2 will largely offset each other in the fourth quarter. 
I think group will remain pretty consistent. Obviously, we had a big uptick in the summer, and then Delta variant sort of slid out the momentum a little bit on group. People think -- there's advanced planning. People have to spend money. And so while there's plenty of group occurring, it's really largely sports and social. At this point, I think that continues about -- like what we've seen in the third quarter into the fourth because people are -- all the pent-up demand is there, but people are sort of advanced planning more into next year, just to sort of finally get through Delta and hopefully to the endemic stage of COVID, which sort of feels like is we're in the process of doing as we speak. 
As we think about 2022 with all those segments, what I would say is I think leisure will remain elevated relative to historical standards. Obviously, my belief is kids will still be back in school. More offices are going to open. So midweek, we'll get back to more normalized levels. But I think the weekends, people want to be out. Turns out they didn't like being locked in their closets and basements and attics, and so they're going to want to get out. And we've seen this pattern of very high demand on weekends. I think that will continue. And so I think on the margin, leisure will be -- continue to be stronger than we've historically seen sort of in pre-COVID times. 
I think business transient will continue to move up. You'll continue to see great strength in small and medium enterprises, which aren't fully back to pre-COVID but getting pretty close. And my own belief is you'll start to see the large corporates step into the game. I mean they're already in the game, but they're still sort of like 40% off of '19 levels. I think you'll see a step change in the large corporates which will contribute, along with SMEs, to continued upticks in business transient.
And then I think group is clearly going to be better next year than this year. I think reality is the first quarter probably is typically a slow group quarter. I don't think it will be different in that way. I think people are going to want to sort of clear the mechanism of getting past the winter, just because concerns of flu seasons and all that, given what we've all been through. But I think as you get into Qs 2, 3 and 4, both booked business and realized business on the group side are going to be better. 
So I think 2022 is sizing up to be -- I think the fourth quarter is sizing up to be fairly similar to the third quarter, and I think 2022 is sizing up to be another big step forward on recovery to more normalized times."

Another we've spent a lot of time looking at that through the last couple of quarters and very recently. Here's what I'd say. I gave you a sense, so I won't repeat what both Kevin and I said about NUG. Kevin, we both talked about it this year. I gave",646,"Yes. Another we've spent a lot of time looking at that through the last couple of quarters and very recently. Here's what I'd say. I gave you a sense, so I won't repeat what both Kevin and I said about NUG. Kevin, we both talked about it this year. I gave you a sense in our prepared comments that we think we'll be in the mid-single-digits for the next couple of years. Obviously, that requires a lot of work. It requires signing deals, starting construction that then ultimately it lands in our NUG numbers.
I think when you look back 2 years from now at this period of time, I am of the mind and reasonably confident that what you will see is the trough in deal signings was last year. As Kevin mentioned, we're going to be up in the mid- to high single-digits in signings this year, we think. I mean we're not done with the year. We always have a good flurry of activity at the end, but we got a lot of it on the books, and so we're pretty damn confident we're going to be up nicely. And I don't see why next year, given what's going on in the environment in terms of -- particularly operating recovery, pricing power, which I'm sure we'll come to, I'll do it maybe in another question, that we're going to see more deals signed next year. 
So I think last year was probably, in my mind, the trough for signings. I think this year, for those same exact reasons, will be the trough in construction starts. Starts always will lag the signings a little bit. We're definitely going to be a little bit modestly down in signings this year after being down last year. Our expectation is that will turn around next year, and that's why we think we'll be sort of in the mid-single-digits for a couple of years and then back on track being in the 6% to 7% range, just because, starting this year, we're signing more. Starting next year, we're starting more. We're obviously filling in a lot. You saw in the second quarter, 1/3 of our NUG was conversion, so we're filling in. And so between all of those factors, we think, ultimately, when we get out past a couple of years, we're back. The goal is to be back in the 6% to 7%. And I think given what I see in the environment that we feel pretty good about that. 
I mean -- and I'll probably stop there with the only comment being things are going to come back faster than prior recoveries here, and that's because the thing that's very different than every other cycle I've seen in my 40 years, and I'll leave it at this, and somebody, I'm sure, will have a question, is just pricing power. I mean the reality is, typically, it's like a grind to build back occupancy, and rate lags significantly. Rate is leading the charge, and that, obviously, flows really nicely. We've done a bunch of things, as you know, and we've talked about a lot to create higher-margin businesses out of all of these brands. And when you flush all that through, even with labor costs up and all of those fun things, these are higher-margin businesses. And part of this is just we're in an inflationary environment. And guess what? We can reprice our product every second of every day. We're a very good hedge in that way to inflation, and we're being very thoughtful about how we're pricing our product. 
And so I think when we all look back on it, this will be a faster recovery on the development side than we've seen in prior cycles. And -- so I think we're going to be back in -- on a very nice trajectory next year."

And so maybe your thoughts on how long leisure can continue pricing like it is, your thoughts on the recovery of business pricing. And then any headwind from large corporates? You've done a great job of delineating small and large, so how much of a headwind is large corporate? Does that price any differently? Is that a factor at all?"

But obviously, we feel -- first of all, let me not be pedantic but say what I say a",906,"Yes. A great question. Yes, I did sort of serve that up. So I guess I shouldn't be surprised I'm getting asked. Listen, you embedded in the question is part of the answer. But obviously, we feel -- first of all, let me not be pedantic but say what I say a lot when I'm asked this question. The laws of economics are alive and well, right? And that's what's going on. Why is leisure so strong in rate? Why are we able to price above historically high levels? Because there are crazy amounts of demand. Like our weekend demand is off the chart. We're running 85% to 90% system-wide in the U.S. on the weekends, and we're pricing over '19 levels, obviously, because we have a lot of demand. 
I do think that will -- that leisure pricing power will continue because, what I said before, I believe that leisure demand is going to remain at elevated levels, particularly on the weekends, and that that's going to give us nice pricing power. Even though, obviously, the recovery in business transient has lagged, as I said in the quarter, we were 75%, but it's sort of a tale of 2 cities, which is I implied it a little bit. You have -- the big corporates which are still 40% off, but then you have small and medium which are only maybe 10%. You could even argue maybe 5% or 10% off. And so we have a fair amount of pricing power in the biggest piece -- in the biggest segments, and they are less price sensitive. 
So broadly, your biggest -- it's not everybody. Your biggest corporate customers can end up with sort of off bar, 10% or 20%. Small and medium might end up at 5% or 7%. So that's why we were working so hard on accessing more of that demand base pre-COVID and has helped us during COVID. 
And so when you put it all together and you look at like even in the quarter, we're at 90% of -- in business transient combined, we're already at 90% of 2019 levels, even though we still have a ways to go to build back demand. So I feel -- it's a long ways to go. I feel pretty good about where that's going because we're going to keep pushing on small and medium. That's almost back. My guess is that will exceed prior levels. And then the corporates are going to come in. And that's going to allow us to put more on the top of the funnel to price -- have more demand, allows us to price more aggressively. 
I think when it's all said and done, if we were 80-20 before, and I don't know exactly where it will be, but my suspect we will probably never go back to 80-20 in reality because we have been successful at finding other segments that we think are going to be there. They're going to be more resilient, and they're going to be higher priced. So my guess is we will be managing to probably a 90-10 world or something like that. But we do think pricing power is not in business transient what it is in leisure, but it's not far off. 
And then group, group is sort of in the year, for the year similar to business transient. But as you look forward, because there's so much pent-up demand, and as I've talked about at least on the last call, we're actually pricing already over '19 levels. So there's pricing power. And you'd say, well, ""Wow, if group is still way off from a consumer revenue point of view, what's going on?"" Well, what's going on is group is very -- the one segment that books weigh in advance, and there's a limited amount of meeting space in the world and in the United States. We happen to have a lot of it. I mean there are a few of us that are very big players in that space. A lot of people want it. And so the reality is, again, laws of economics are alive and well. People want it. There's not enough of it. You have huge pent-up demand that's sort of getting all -- events that didn't happen, that need to happen, new events. And that's pushing into next year. 
And so even though, in the moment, group revenues aren't what they were, on a forward-looking basis, there is a good amount of pricing power, which is why on a -- all of our advanced bookings in the next year are pricing over '19 levels at this point. 
So again, back to the bait I put out there, I guess, it's unusual. Like I hate to admit how long I've been doing this but a long time. I guess I said it before. But it just hasn't really happened this way. Now there are a lot of reasons. We're better, right? We got much more sophisticated revenue management systems. We're much more on top of it, I think, than we've ever been. Obviously, we're in a more inflationary environment broadly. Thank you, Federal Reserve and the U.S. Congress, for fiscal and monetary stimulus. We could debate transitory or otherwise, but those things are translating into, broadly, a more highly inflationary environment. And that applies to us, too, and that obviously is helping from a pricing power point of view."

And then more recently, I mentioned in my comments, we just actually opened our first Home2 Suites by Hilton in China on the road to doing 1,000 of them with Country Garden, one of the largest players in China, which is another master license agreement. So we've done those 2. 
Never say never. I'm not saying -- but the idea was to really help -- get help from very large local players that knew how to garner scale very quickly to help build our network effect in China and then ultimately come back in with our other brands and do it ourselves. And so that's exactly what we're doing with Hilton Garden Inn. We obviously have a massive franchise system here in the United States and frankly in Europe now, where the bulk of the business here is franchised. Increasingly, I think we're now -- the majority of the business in Europe is franchised. It's been a much smaller part of the business in China and in Asia Pacific, so we historically haven't had the same level of resources. 
And so what we've done during COVID is made some strategic investments to build out more infrastructure so that we can take other brands in our -- of our 18 brand -- a family of brands and do it ourselves. 
And so we're trying to be very sort of balanced and balance all the risks associated with our expansion around the world, and we think it's great to work with third parties. We love the Country Garden folks and Plateno. They've been incredibly important partners, will continue to be for a long, long time. But it's also important that we have that skill set ourselves in franchising. Is it -- while it's similar in China, it's not exactly the same. And so we've learned a lot and I think built a -- we're building a good infrastructure and a good muscle set to be able to take a bunch of other brands and do just what we've done here in the U.S., Europe and other places."

Smedes, I had a hard time hearing some of that, but I think I captured it, the labor costs and what owners are telling us. It's obviously been a big issue and one that we spent a lot of time on, a complex issue in terms of what's sort of underneath the problem. 
What I would say is, obviously, there is no one owner group. The different owners in different parts of the country and the world, for that matter, have different views. But if I sort of homogenize it all, which is hard to do, but if I do it in my head, I would say while it's still a very difficult issue, we've started to see easing in terms of access to labor. I think we have ways to go. There are a bunch of things we're doing to help from a technology point of view to access pools of labor that maybe we hadn't accessed historically. But broadly, more labor is coming back in, and some of those pressures are easing. Obviously, labor is more expensive pretty much everywhere. I think that's a reality. Where it settles out, I think it's a little early to know, but I think it is sort of settling down as people are gradually coming back into the workforce. 
I think the end of the question, which is a really important one, which I sort of touched on earlier in one of my other filibusters, was how is it going to look for owners on the other side? And again, it's hard -- some owners -- depends on location, product, 1,000 factors. But broadly -- and we're already seeing it. I think I said this. Broadly, I think when we get to the other side of this, across the system, margins are going to be higher, and you know why. With input costs going up, labor costs going up and all of those fun things, they're going to be -- margins are going to be higher because rate is going to be a lot higher ultimately when we get past this for all the reasons I talked about in terms of the pricing power that we have and the broader inflationary environment. That's very helpful to the business. 
At the same time, particularly in the mega categories, which is where the bulk of the hotels are with our ownership community, we did a bunch of really important work and did a lot of testing and learning and made a bunch of changes in the hotels. In the end, we think, to create a better experience for our customers, but to do it in a more efficient way to drive higher margins. So we're pretty confident. And we have pretty good evidence, which I'll talk about that, even with the -- when labor comes back and you have to pay labor more, given where rate structures are going to be in most places and given the efficiencies that we've been able to garner, that these are -- our owners are going to end up with higher-margin businesses. 
And by the way, many, many of them, not all of them. So for those that haven't gotten there that are listening, keep the faith. But many, many owners are already there. Some of it is unsustainable, meaning part of it is they can't get enough labor, and so they don't have enough people, so their labor costs are unusually low. But even in places where they are able to get the labor back for the reasons I described, meaning more efficiencies on our standards and pricing power on the top line, they're driving very good margins. 
And so we've had -- the owners are -- have been in pain. I don't want to minimize it. There's still many of them in a lot of pain, but we're doing our level best to get them to the other side and make sure their businesses are stronger, both because that's what we should do, as a fiduciary to them, but also, ultimately, if we want to continue to be able to grow, we have to give them an investment alternative that continues to makes sense from a return point of view. And so we're hyper focused on it. 
And I would say, I feel really good. As I said, I think the development cycle will flip faster than we've seen in prior cycles for these reasons. I just think that the economics -- the laws of economics are alive and well. I've said it now twice or three times, that if people can get great returns because of the conditions, macro and micro, macro world going on micro the things we're doing, then they're going to want to build us more hotels. And obviously, with the signings being up in the mid -- double -- mid-teens to plus, we think that's pretty good prima facie evidence that that's what's going on."

I think we have 20 something -- 25 to 30 new countries embedded in the pipeline that we don't have today, right? So we're always trying to enter new markets. I'm not sure really anything of that -- any of that has been opened up by the pandemic. I think it's just sort of the course of the growth of our business over time.
And then trajectory really has a lot to do with how places are coming out of the pandemic, meaning we've been -- even though there's been spikes up and down in RevPAR in China, for instance, as they go into lockdowns, the development trajectory there has actually continued to be pretty solid and continued to improve. But in places like Europe where, traditionally, it's more of a face-to-face development environment, the less people have been able -- the less our teams and the owners have been able to get on planes and move around country to country, those signings have lagged a little bit. So I actually see that as a tailwind coming out of the pandemic, whereas there's a lot of pent-up demand for development in EMEA broadly. And I think that it's just going to require a little bit more mobility to surface that. 
But the rest of it is just, over time, as Chris has talked about this, as you have a rapidly developing middle class with more demand for mid-market products, you're going to see a little bit more of that demand over time. I mean the full-service business is not dead by any means. But you're just going to see, on the margin, the capital flows more to the limited-service hotels. So we're going to do more deals where the capital flows. 
And then as we bring franchising, which has been very successful for us -- Chris went through it, so I won't go through it again. But as we bring franchising to different parts of the world, particularly Asia Pacific, we're just going to do more franchise deals over time. You're not going to see, I don't think, big step changes. You're just going to see a gradual growth over time in more limited-service mix and more franchise mix. Did that cover all the parts?"

Two, the first quarter is never a big group quarter. So you put those 2 things together, and it trends heavily to Qs 2, 3 and 4. 
We're in the 75%, 80% on the books, which is about consistent with where we were in the last quarter. And what happened is, I think if you hadn't had the Delta variant spike, we'd probably be somewhat further along. But you had the Delta variant sort of slow -- they cooled off the advanced bookings on the group side, which have now picked back up. 
The other thing going on, of course, is we want to -- we do believe there's going to be a lot of group potential, particularly in Qs 2, 3 and 4. And we don't want to commit. There's a level of -- lack of desire on our part to commit too much space when we know that there'll be a lot of pricing power, so it's sort of a bit of a delicate balancing act."

So we basically were funding from our balance sheet the -- all the commercial engines and the websites and all the funded part of the business. And so those things really are giant co-ops. They're going to break even over time. 
So now what you're seeing is revenues -- and by the way, all the fees, all the sources of funds for those programs are funded as a percentage of revenue. So as revenue is climbing, our receipts are going up. And we will ultimately bring those funds back to breakeven, and we will recover those deficits. And at the moment, you're seeing it as surpluses. But I wouldn't necessarily think of it as clawbacks. Those funds run surpluses and deficits from time to time. So I think you'll see it run a surplus for a little while. And yes, the cash is commingled. But it's our owner's money at the end of the day, and we spend it all on them."

You heard my views, so you can -- we can have a debate about it, but I don't think so for the following reason. I think the midweek is already being bled out now, so I don't -- I think most people -- most kids are back in school. It's in truncate's mobility even if people are in the office, so while more offices are going to open through the rest of this year and into next year. What we've seen in the pattern of leisure during the midweek, it's our -- we've sort of washed out a large part of that already. I may be wrong, but I believe the weekends are going to remain strong, simply because I still think, if you look at the $3 trillion of incremental savings during COVID, there's a long way to go to spend it all. And I think people still want to do -- they want the experiences that they were starved for, and now it gets concentrated more on weekends, which is what we're seeing now. I believe that will continue. 
I don't -- so the net of it is, my view, just to be clear, is that relative to a normalized like '19 level of leisure demand, I think we're getting back more towards that with a little bit better because I think the weekends are going to be a little bit better. I'm not -- I agree with you. I don't think that the midweek leisure is going to be raging, and that's not sort of built into my expectations.
In terms of outbound, yes, the world is opening up. But then there's inbound, too. Particularly for the cities that -- the big cities, top 25 markets that historically depend on 20% of their business from inbound international travel, they've had 0. And starting next week or week after, the floodgates are going to open on that. So yes, you're going to have some people going outbound, but you're going to have a lot of people that want to come see America that is going to offset that and particularly with the top 25 markets, broadly, but particularly in the top 25 markets that are going to come in. 
Again, we're still in the middle of budgets, and we're still debating all of this and where it ends up. There's -- I'm giving you my opinion and my sense of it. I think leisure will remain -- when we wake up next year and the following year, and you compare it to the amount of leisure business that we did, which was probably 25% or 30% of our overall segmentation pre-COVID, I think it will be higher than that. And I think it will be higher than that because people want to get out more. There's plenty of incremental savings in the world that has not gotten anywhere close to being spent. And the weekend business, while we were doing better on weekends than we had historically, I think it will stay even more elevated than that."

But to repeat what I said last time, we are very interested in getting back to returning capital. We firmly believe in our capital allocation strategy pre-COVID, which was we were producing a lot of free cash flow that we didn't -- we can continue to grow the business in an industry-leading way without the use of much of it. And we wanted, as a result, to give it back to our shareholders because there was no reason for us to hoard it or do dumb things with it. And disciplined capital allocation, we believe, is a hallmark of long term, delivering great returns for shareholders. 
Our -- my belief hasn't been changed through COVID. The only thing that changed is we didn't have a lot of free cash flow during the heat of the crisis. We are obviously getting past that. We are cash flow positive. We want to just give it a little bit more time, as I said on the last call, sort of finish out the year. And if things go as we expect and consistent with what we have been seeing, we're going to reinstate a return of capital program in the first half of next year. And my guess is it will look quite similar. I mean, we're still having that discussion with our Board who obviously has a say in it. But I think if I had to pick a line, I think it will look a lot like what we were doing pre-COVID. And we're very focused on it and very anxious to get back to it.

We think we can do a little bit better with net unit growth, cost discipline, license fees, things like that, maybe a little bit better than 1:1 over time. But I think the 1.3x is more of when RevPAR is elevated. 
And then no change -- short answer is no change in our views on G&A, right? We've been very disciplined. I think we -- what we've said to you guys is that cash G&A ought to be down this year in the mid- to high teens from 2019 levels. We actually might do a little bit better than that this year because we've got pretty good cost discipline. GAAP is different, but you got a lot of moving pieces. Particularly in the third quarter this year, we're lapping over some of the write-downs of stock comp from last year.
And then going forward, again, no real change. I think we all understand that, with more business activity is going to come a little bit more expense. And just like we're in an inflationary environment that's going to help on the revenue side, we're going to be paying people a little bit more along the way. But we do think we're going to maintain discipline. The changes that we've made to our structure are going to hold going forward, and we feel -- still feel the same way."

I don't feel really a lot different than I did pre-COVID. I mean we believe there's an efficient frontier, and we've calculated it as best we can by individual market property, what -- based on what they can deliver at that price point versus what we can deliver, how do we deliver the highest index -- the highest revenue for the lowest distribution cost. And we do believe, and that's why we've had a good relationship with the OTAs, that they play a part in that. It's traditionally been in the sort of 10% or 12% range, and that's historically where we've been. During COVID, that went up. 
But if -- we wanted it to go up. We partnered, I think, quite successfully with our OTA partners, knowing that the biggest segment of demand that was out there for most of COVID was lower-rated leisure, which is what they are particularly good at, non-loyalty -- nonloyal-type customer base. And so it has crept -- it crept up a bit but not too terribly much, and we've already seen that sort of peak and start to come down. 
And so while we'll look at the efficient frontier as we always do periodically and maybe if you think leisure is going to be a little bit higher component overall, maybe it goes up a little, but not much, and it didn't move that much. So the net of all that is I think when we wake up in a couple of years, it will look an awful lot like it did before. And we obviously feel good about the contractual terms that we have with the OTAs now and our ability to continue to have attractive terms going forward. 
As it relates to Honors, the -- my Honors team is probably listening, and they may need a diaper for this. But we're -- we maxed out in the 63%, 64% system-wide. And we're already in the U.S., as I mentioned in my prepared comments, not that far off of that. Globally, we're coming back as our more of -- number one, we've accessed more travelers that weren't loyal. So some of these leisure travelers that we didn't have access to, we've now accessed. And more of our core customer is getting back on the road. We're getting back to normal. 
But I'm not going to put a number out there because I'll give a heart -- my team will have a heart attack. But I believe that there is a lot of room to grow. I think the super majority -- if we're doing our job, the super majority of our customers want to be Honors members. It's a proposition that they get benefits that you just don't get, and they're meaningful. And you can go through them. They get discounts. They get technology. They get experiences money can't buy. They get points that are currency. They can shop on Amazon and Lyft and buy tickets at Live Nation. And there is no reason, as we continue coming out of this, to actively engage with our customer base, where it shouldn't be -- we shouldn't be able to push it meaningfully higher than where we kept -- where we maxed out before. 
Now that will take time. And so to my Honors team, don't freak out. We're going to give you the time. But our goals there, which I'm not going to state publicly, are meaningfully higher than where we were, which, by the way, is meaningfully higher than any of our competitors already."
