Welcome to our fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. I'd like to remind you that an earnings call press release and slide presentation related to the call are available on our website at www.dentsplysirona.com. 
Before we begin, please take a moment to read the forward-looking statements in our earnings press release. During today's call, we make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about future performance and financial results. We base these statements and certain assumptions and expectations on future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions. 
In today's conference call, our remarks will be based on non-GAAP financial results. We believe that non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about financial performance of our business, enable the comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independently of business performance and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business. Please refer to our press release for the reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results. 
And with that, I'd like to now turn the call over to Don Casey, our Chief Executive Officer. Don?"

It's hard to imagine that a year ago, on this call, we first started discussing the COVID-19 pandemic. And as we enter 2021, it is still a challenge that creates some level of uncertainty. But over the course of the year, there have been many lessons for Dentsply Sirona, and the experience has hopefully prepared us for the coming year and beyond. 
As we provide a final look at 2020, a few things really stand out. The first is the resilience of the dental market and how committed the dental community is to serving their patients. 
The second is how strong the underlying Dentsply Sirona business is. This is illustrated by the improvement in our results over the last 2 quarters. 
Learning new and different ways to do business has been another key lesson. Whether it was a virtual DS World, creating digital KOL forms or having our global R&D teams collaborate without physically being together, there is vital learning here that we will apply going forward. 
And finally, we have always talked about how our people are our most important asset. Well, 2020 certainly highlighted that. Every day, our team stayed focused on our customers and their patients despite dealing with professional and personal challenges that we all faced during the year. I want to thank them for their commitment and professionalism. 
Moving on. Today, we want to cover 4 things. The first is our fourth quarter results. After that, we will provide some guidance for 2021, and we will then provide some perspective on our priorities going forward, and we will finish with a discussion around our ESG plans. 
Moving now to Slide 6. We are pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter. Revenues were $1.1 billion, down 3.3% on an organic basis. This is a sequential improvement versus quarters 2 and 3 and reflects a gradual recovery in the dental market. 
In the fourth quarter, we remain disciplined around spending, and these cost-containment efforts helped deliver a solid margin performance. Operating margin reached 23.2%, up 320 basis points versus year ago. This results in an adjusted non-GAAP EPS of $0.87, up 19.2% versus the prior year. Other actions taken by the team helped generate healthy cash flow from operations of $263 million. 
To provide the details of our performance for the quarter, I will now turn the call over to Jorge."
27504,703381251,2226815,"DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Mar 01, 2021",2021-03-01,"Earnings Calls","DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Don, and good morning.

In the fourth quarter, we delivered strong results and exceeded our internal expectations in many categories. The steps we've taken to improve our business continue to generate positive financial outcomes despite the difficult environment created by the evolving global pandemic. 
Sequentially, during the fourth quarter, we delivered improvements on almost every key financial metric versus the third quarter. We capitalized on the gradual recovery in customer demand and commitment to cost discipline across the enterprise. While we remain cautious, our fourth quarter performance has given us good momentum going into fiscal 2021. 
Let's look at Q4 in more detail. Organic revenue decline of 3.3% versus last year was an improvement sequentially as compared to the 8.8% decline experienced in the third quarter. Consumables posted organic growth of 1.1% in the fourth quarter versus last year. We delivered strong Consumables growth in Europe and the U.S., offset by declines in other geographies. As expected, Technologies & Equipment organic sales declined 6.2% versus last year, primarily as a result of the difficult comparison for the CAD/CAM business relative to Q4 2019. 
Gross profit was $613 million or 56.7% of sales, a better-than-expected outcome, given this quarter's lower volume levels as compared to last year. The gross margin reduction was primarily due to the lower sales levels and negative absorption. It was partially offset by productivity and cost savings initiatives. 
SG&A decreased $58 million or 13.8% versus the prior year. SG&A as a percent of sales declined 430 basis points year-over-year. The reduction in SG&A reflects volume-related decreases and improvements in productivity and operational agility. Examples of volume-related expenses include travel, commissions, advertising and promotions. Also, we have been very prudent with nonessential and discretionary spending categories. 
Operating profit grew over 13% to $251 million versus last year. It represents a margin expansion of 320 basis points to 23.2%. Our margin rate benefited from strong Consumables sales and as just mentioned, the impact from permanent, discretionary and volume-related spend reductions. 
Also, keep in mind that the typically strong Q4 sales volume create significant operating leverage that enhances margin. The results from the actions taken during 2020 give us confidence to expand our investments in R&D and customer experience to deliver sustainable growth. I will refer to these investments later in my presentation. 
Moving on. Net interest and other expense increased $5 million, reflecting higher levels of debt versus last year and the closing out of certain net investment hedges. The non-GAAP tax rate in the fourth quarter was 21%, a decrease compared to 25.1% in the prior year, which was a function of the changes in the U.S. versus non-U.S. pretax income mix. This lower rate added approximately $0.05 to fourth quarter 2020 non-GAAP EPS as compared to last year. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.87, up 19.2% versus the prior year quarter. 
Moving on to fourth quarter Consumables segment results. We are pleased with the Consumables business performance in the fourth quarter. Organic sales were $449 million, an increase of 1.1% versus the prior year. Growth was strong in Europe and the U.S., partially offset by a decline in rest of the world. 
Sales in Restorative and Preventive show a strong organic growth, offset by a decrease in Lab. Our efforts on retail-focused programs is a driver of improved Consumables sales performance in the U.S. We are gaining traction on the execution of initiatives such as a shift in promotional strategies to strengthen relationships with dentists, delivering clinically relevant products with strong incentives. 
Moving on to Technologies & Equipment performance. Heading into the fourth quarter, we indicated a tough comparison in this segment versus the prior year due to many factors, including DS World sales, the Primescan upgrade cycle and the uncertainty from COVID. As expected, Technologies & Equipment organic sales declined 6.2% versus the prior year, but grew sequentially from Q3 2020 to Q4 2020. 
Within this segment, our clear aligners and health care businesses performed very well during the quarter. Of note, our team was able to transition the DS World event into a fully interactive virtual experience in Q4. Although we are pleased with the results of the virtual DS World event and the strong participation, we have announced our intention of returning to a hybrid live event in 2021. 
On Slide 11, you can see our financial performance by region during the fourth quarter. U.S. sales of $359 million declined 8.7% compared to the prior year. Organic sales declined 7.3% driven by CAD/CAM and imaging. 
European sales were $448 million, up 3% compared to the prior year. Organic sales increased 0.4%. Strong growth in Consumables was partially offset by the COVID-19 related impacts on Technologies & Equipment. 
Rest of the world sales were $275 million, down 2.8%. The South American market continues to experience COVID-related declines, especially in Brazil. 
Moving on to cash flows. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we had a strong operating cash flow of $263 million, bringing the full year 2020 cash flow to $635 million. Full year 2020 delivered $548 million of free cash flow, an increase of 7% versus last year. 
We returned a total of $228 million to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks and deployed $1.1 billion to fund acquisitions. The company finished 2020 with strong liquidity available, comprising $438 million of cash and committed credit facilities of another $1.1 billion. 
Now let me provide an update on 2 strategic initiatives we discussed in prior quarters. First, we completed the actions required to exit the traditional ortho and the analog lab businesses as planned. Both businesses accounted for approximately $175 million of sales in 2019. These exits enhance our ability to focus on growth areas. 
Second, we remain on track to achieve our long-term cost savings objective of $250 million. We delivered another $70 million of savings in fiscal 2020. That brings the total cost savings to $160 million since the announcement of the restructuring in 2018. 
Consistent with the plan, we expect the restructuring to cost a total of $375 million. To date, we have spent approximately $310 million, $120 million of which is noncash. 
Before we turn the page into 2021, I want to take a moment to thank every single associate at Dentsply Sirona for the tremendous commitment to deliver results under the very difficult circumstances during 2020. 
Now let me turn to our financial expectations for 2021. We are monitoring the markets where we operate very closely. Our research indicates that the gradual rate of recovery in dental appears to continue. Dentist offices remain open. Importantly, patient confidence is improving with the vaccine rollouts. 
However, COVID-19 continues to represent a lingering uncertainty, which makes medium- to long-term planning very difficult. After thoughtful consideration and acknowledging the level of difficulty to forecast accurately in the current environment, we have decided to share our key planning assumptions for fiscal year 2021. 
We're optimistic about the long-term prospects of the dental industry. There are several categories with high-growth profile -- high-growth profiles, while others are more moderate but with great cash flow. The intrinsic resilience of the dental category provides some stability in the short term and the possibility of a stronger demand in the second half of 2021 relative to the first half. 
We're expecting fiscal 2021 reported sales to be in the range of $4 billion to $4.3 billion. This range equates to a reported sales growth rate of approximately 20% to 30%. From an organic sales perspective, the range provided equates to an organic growth rate of approximately 15% to 25%. The difference between reported and organic sales is primarily explained by the acquisitions of Byte and Datum, the disposition of traditional ortho, analog lab, other smaller portfolio-shaping activities and FX. 
The recovery of the dental market and the success of the vaccine rollout will influence, to a large extent, at one end -- what end of the range we deliver results. As communicated in January, we expect our clear aligner business to reach an annual run rate of $300 million by the end of 2021. We're excited about the growth contribution of this franchise going forward. 
We plan to increase our investments related to strategic growth initiatives. Targeted R&D investments are increasing to approximately $160 million in 2021. Other areas of significant investments not reported in R&D include clear aligners acceleration, e-commerce and other digital platforms. 
On the SG&A front, Byte and Datum combined contribute approximately $90 million in incremental SG&A in 2021. Operating income margin for 2021 is expected to be 20% or higher, with a stronger performance in the second half of the year. Our margin expansion remains steady, and we continue to aim for 22% operating profit margin by the end of fiscal '22. 
We expect the non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 23% and 24%. Our estimate for share count is approximately 221 million. That brings our non-GAAP EPS expectations for 2021 to a range of $2.60 to $2.80. Our capital expenditures estimate for 2021 is $160 million. Despite the near-term challenges presented by COVID-19, we are mindful of the targets we set. And we remain focused on achieving our 2021 objectives and expect to remain on track to reach our longer-term targets. 
Before I turn the call over to Don, I want to make a comment about the first quarter of 2021. Please remember that the first quarter of the fiscal year has been historically the lowest quarter in sales. And consequently, operating income margin has been several points lower sequentially. We expect that trend to continue this year. This seasonality effect is factored into our planning assumptions for the full fiscal year. 
With that, I will now turn the call back to Don."

To give additional perspective on 2021, it might be helpful to provide some detail around our strategy and operating priorities going forward. Moving to Slide 15. Over the past 2 years, the company is focu",1533,"Thank you, Jorge, and we will move to Slide 14. To give additional perspective on 2021, it might be helpful to provide some detail around our strategy and operating priorities going forward. 
Moving to Slide 15. Over the past 2 years, the company is focused on delivering against the restructuring outlined in late 2018. Despite the pandemic, Dentsply Sirona has made solid progress across most areas against the goals outlined in that restructuring. The plan was built around improving growth, driving margin and simplifying the organization. And while there is still work to do, our leadership team is committed to meeting those goals in the original time frame. 
As we get toward the conclusion of the restructuring, though, it now becomes important to lay out a strategy for how we will grow Dentsply Sirona in the future. As we have refined our growth strategy over the past few years, it is important to recognize that the dental market continues to evolve. 
Increasingly, our customers are looking for comprehensive solutions and improved workflows that deliver better patient outcomes and improve the financial health of their practices. Dentsply Sirona is uniquely suited to deliver this for our customers. 
Our company has an unmatched installed base of digital dental products, including both digital impressions and a complete range of x-ray imaging products. We have deep expertise in treatment planning and workflow management. And Dentsply Sirona has a full portfolio of essential consumer products that are critical components of many procedures. Putting all of this together, we will distinct -- putting all of this together will distinguish us going forward and provide sustainable differentiation. 
For 2021 and beyond, our operational priorities will remain consistent around delivering growth, improving margin and building a scaled, efficient company. Specific targets include organic growth of 4% to 5% plus going forward. As Jorge said, we are committed to improving our margin, achieving our 22% goal by the end of 2022. And our efforts around organization simplification will allow us to deliver the cost-saving target of $250 million through the end of the restructuring plan. Doing all this will allow us to target double-digit adjusted EPS growth and create sustainable value for our shareholders. 
Moving to Slide 16. Let's look at these priorities in more depth, starting with growing revenues. As I mentioned earlier, Dentsply Sirona is well positioned going forward to grow our revenues through a combination of organic and inorganic opportunities, all built on a foundation of global commercial excellence. 
Starting with organic growth. Over the last 3 years, the company has made significant improvements to our R&D program. Major changes have involved implementing a portfolio management approach to allow us to maximize the impact of our spending by focusing on fewer, bigger products in essential areas. 
A second major shift is having our innovation efforts focused on procedures rather than products. This allows -- this aligns us with how our customers think and will allow us to offer more comprehensive solutions. 
And as those changes have become more ingrained and show promise for the future, in 2021, we are increasing our investment in R&D significantly. This is highlighted by the creation of a new Consumables Innovation Center to be opened this year in Charlotte. 
As you can see on Slide 17, despite the pandemic Dentsply Sirona was able to continue accelerating our new product activity. We've been pleased with the response, in particular to Axeos, Primemill and Surefil one. Looking out to 2021, we are excited about the portfolio we will be bringing to the market, including important new introductions in the endo and implant areas. 
Moving now to Slide 18. In addition to our investment in organic programs, when appropriate, we will look to acquisitions to support critical growth priorities like clear aligners and implants. As we announced in early January, Dentsply Sirona acquired Byte, a direct-to-consumer clear aligner company. It's been great to welcome this outstanding team to Dentsply Sirona. 
The acquisition gives us significant scale in the critical clear aligner market as well as important new capabilities. These capabilities include the ability to communicate directly with patients. We believe it will be important for Dentsply Sirona to help generate patient traffic for dentists across multiple procedures in the future. This business carried good momentum from the fourth quarter into the new year, and the integration of the Byte business is on track. 
As we mentioned earlier, we believe that we will exit 2021 with $200 million-plus run rates. And as Jorge has mentioned, combined with SureSmile, our clear aligner franchise is expected to achieve a run rate of $300 million by the end of the year. The deal is expected to be accretive to our long-term financial targets and non-GAAP EPS in 2021. 
Moving to Slide 19. In late January, Dentsply Sirona acquired Datum, an Israeli biomedical company for a little over $100 million. Datum expands our biomaterial portfolio with the OSSIX brands with its GLYMATRIX technology. 
The implant category has been shifting to meet the patient need for fewer visits and more rapid results. This has led to an expansion of procedures using immediate load implants. In these procedures, bone growth factors like OSSIX can provide important benefits. We believe this acquisition gives Dentsply Sirona a terrific brand with an excellent technology that will help improve our performance in the implant category. 
Moving to Slide 20. Over the past 15 months, the company has also made major efforts to improve our global commercial capabilities. These have included pursuing a comprehensive sales effectiveness program in multiple countries. We have also shifted our promotional spending to focus more on programs like One DS that creates demand at the retail level. The team has also enhanced our digital clinical education capabilities, and we reached over 1 million visitors this year. All of this has improved the effectiveness of our global commercial capabilities. 
Now on Slide 21. Along with driving revenue growth, the company is focused on improving our margin in multiple areas. One highlight that has been discussed is spending discipline. Our team has shown steady progress in this area over the last few years, but the pandemic has shown there are new, more efficient ways to manage the business. It's important to apply the lessons learned in 2020 going forward. 
Our supply chain has made excellent progress across the board, highlighted by reducing our manufacturing footprint from 42 facilities in 2018 to 29 now. There has been strong progress in SKU rationalization and inventory management. Yet even with this success, there are still opportunities in several places as we get better using our scale in areas like procurement and logistics. 
And finally, we remain committed to portfolio management. The exit of the traditional ortho and analog lab businesses has helped simplify the organization and improve both margin and operating efficiency. This will remain an important part of our discipline around margin improvement going forward. 
Moving now to Slide 22. We believe a key ingredient of the -- of a successful business strategy going forward is to establish a comprehensive framework to manage ESG objectives. A strong ESG program can facilitate top line growth and reduce cost. It can contribute to reducing legal and regulatory risk while improving employee engagement. 
As a result, getting ESG right has become a business imperative for Dentsply Sirona. As a global leader in the dental health segment, we are striving to become an ESG leader as well. ESG objectives are aligned with our purpose and mission of improving access to quality health care globally. 
Every day, the almost 15,000 employees of Dentsply Sirona work to improve the lives of people all around the world, including the communities we serve while continuing to deliver value for our shareholders. We will achieve this by investing in our people as well as leveraging our R&D and innovation capabilities to leave a lasting impact on society. 
While Dentsply Sirona has always had multiple activities in this area, we felt it was time to create a more comprehensive framework to measure ourselves and communicate our results. Last year, our cross-functional ESG Committee was established, composed of our most senior leaders. This team is tasked with developing the necessary internal controls, data management and frameworks for ESG reporting. 
In addition to the senior leaders, we have added internal subject matter experts, outside resources and consult regularly with companies advanced in ESG practices. The committee is in the process of developing an ESG implementation plan with specific objectives, and we look forward to sharing the plan and our progress going forward. 
Moving to Slide 23. In conclusion, there's still uncertainty around how the pandemic will impact 2021, but we feel, absent a major setback, the dental market will improve throughout the year. Our solid results in the fourth quarter have shown the resilience of our underlying business and the commitment of our people. 
While we are cautious around 2021, we expect to see improvement as we go through the year. We believe that Dentsply Sirona has a clear strategy and is well positioned to drive revenue, improve our margins and deliver sustainable value for our shareholders. 
And with that, I will now turn the call back over to Kari."

What is the relevant comparison? Is it '19 or is it '20? Look, with the pandemic still lingering through this quarter and while we're optimistic about vaccines, we think that there's still going to be an impact that we",545,"Yes. Thanks, Nate. It's interesting. What is the relevant comparison? Is it '19 or is it '20? Look, with the pandemic still lingering through this quarter and while we're optimistic about vaccines, we think that there's still going to be an impact that we'll see in our business in places like Latin America and others. So we're kind of really looking at the guidance versus 2020 as kind of the relevant discussion. 
Look, in terms of what we expect over the course of the year, we see a gradual improvement. If you look at the ADA surveys and a lot of our survey work, you see, particularly like in the North American market, we think offices are operating 80%, 85%. There's been some compensation on the part of the dentists by looking at higher value procedures. So revenue has stayed up. We've actually seen, in some cases, dentists beginning to add fee -- fees for PPE to compensate for that. 
But our expectation based on our tracking studies that talk directly to patients, we see patient optimism starting to increase. And we think that will manifest itself kind of gradually over the course of the year. So we think the exit rate for the total category in the back half of 2021 will be better than the front half. 
Just in terms of how does our portfolio stack up, Nate, look, I think other people are better qualified to answer how different people's portfolios are going to stack up. I would tell you this, as we kind of look at it, we start with our strategy, which we really think -- let's think about workflows and what workflows are important to us. Clear aligners is clearly an area that we've spent a lot of effort on, and we obviously feel very, very good about that. 
If you look at the implant and endo procedures, we believe that we have a good formula for growth right now. And I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we anticipate some launches in the back half of 2021 that should accelerate momentum. Stuff like Datum, we believe, gives us a reason to really go in with new news in the implant market. 
And in terms of Consumables, look, some of that's going to be directly related to how fast kind of rest of the world comes up. As you know, Nate, our portfolio is not really heavily focused on PPE. We tend to think much more around like the resto, endo and lab businesses, which are -- some of that's a function of what are we able to do competitively to gain share. We feel that we've been very competitive in the fourth quarter. And look, as the market comes back, particularly on a global basis, we're optimistic that we're going to see some improvement there. 
On the last issue, we really have spent a lot of time over the last year shifting our promotional strategy, which is really very much more focused on retail and how do we drive retail consumption at the dentist office level. So that's one of the last reasons we feel that there's going to be continuing improvement over the course of the year around our Consumable business. So I hope that's helpful, Nate."

I mean, basically, you were in full -- in the critical North American market, you were in the middle of a Primescan upgrade, and you launched Primemill, and we had the One DS program. So we knew that was going to be a pretty steep hill decline. 
Relative to our expectations, particularly without having a live DS World, the T&E segment actually performed pretty well. And as we look out to the first quarter, now let's remember the first quarter for us typically is slow. It's the smallest quarter over the course of the year, and obviously, T&E is a big part of that. 
But I would tell you the thing that has impressed us is that the -- if you really go back to the second quarter, I think in the North American, European markets, in particular, the dentists really were kind of, okay, what are -- when the pandemic kind of eases up, what are we going to do? And we've seen a lot of dentists that have really taken a step to say, ""Hey, look, I want to get into implants. I want to do more clear aligners,"" which requires them to kind of up their diagnostic game, whether that's through like more 2D, 3D cone beam or whether that's getting what we think is a best-in-class scanner with Primescan. 
And we've seen underlying demand pretty good. I mean, if you actually -- one of the reasons we say that is if you look at how like North America performed comparative to Europe on some of like the CAD/CAM and the CEREC businesses, where you didn't have the impact of the DS World, you saw what we think was pretty solid demand for T&E. 
And we feel, as we come into this quarter, we're not getting ahead of ourselves, but we feel that underlying interest in our products has been pretty good. And with Primemill now coming, we feel that we've got a pretty winning but portfolio."

Look, the Consumable market is kind of hard to parse apart because there's not a clean comparison as what is Consumables because you've got some people who report big PPE numbers and whatnot. When we talk about",517,"Yes. Glen, first, thanks for the question. Look, the Consumable market is kind of hard to parse apart because there's not a clean comparison as what is Consumables because you've got some people who report big PPE numbers and whatnot. 
When we talk about Consumables and us, it's really about like resto, lab and endo for us. And what we saw was in the fourth quarter, we had a good performance in the U.S. in particular, and we think that's been a result of a lot of the work that we had been doing around the promotional strategies. We're not quite as exposed as some of our other competitors may be areas in Asia Pacific that have returned from the pandemic a little bit faster. So in all, we were pretty happy with how Consumables performed. 
Now go below that a little bit. I mean, when -- and it was really funny. If you go back a year on this call because we report relatively late in the cycle, we were really the first people that were talking about an impact on coronavirus in the dental category. And one of the things we said is as dentists started heading into that kind of March uncertainty and April uncertainty, it's -- the easiest spigot to turn off was Consumables. Hey, we're not going to build inventory there. 
And we do think that while the ADA is saying 80, 80, 80-plus we do think that there was some benefits to not only the things we were doing, but there was some restocking as traffic begins to return to somewhat more normal levels. So -- and then, look, the promotional programs, we've said this, and I wish it was easy to just do that all in 1 quarter. 
But as we roll our promotional strategies around One DS and other things around the world, basically what we're saying is, ""Hey, look, anything we want to do is got to be focused on driving innovation directly at the dentist and create promotional strategies like One DS that actually allow us to leverage technology and equipment, something like a Primescan launch with our Consumables."" And as we roll that out, that represents a shift. I mean, if we were to look at, say, the U.S. market 18 months ago, we would be running 9, 10 to 15 promotional programs, which we've now swept into one. 
And some of that was focused on things that may not necessarily be as retail focused. Do we want to do a 2-for-1 promotion, which involves different kind of promotional strategies? So look, bottom line, we think the Consumable market, I -- whether it's growing or not, it certainly improved sequentially for the third consecutive quarter. 
We think our -- the strategy that we're pursuing around Consumables is the right thing, which is one of the reasons we're happy with the performance in the U.S. and Europe. And then as we go forward, we're optimistic that our innovation as well as our promotional strategy is going to allow us to see Consumables trend in the right direction."

Jorge, it's the second quarter in a row of margins coming in, I think, much better than everyone was expecting. And looking at your long-term guidance, it's almost hard for us to see how margins could go down so much from this point as fiscal '21. 
I know you talked about investing in innovation, new product launches. But on the other side of that, you're raising your cost savings targets and things like that. And so how should we think about that cadence in the margin? Because it feels like you have to take a pretty big dip from where you were in the second half of 2020 to kind of make sense of that guidance for fiscal '21?"

The first I would say is you can't compare just Q4 with the average operating profit margin for the fiscal year. Because as you know, Q4 is typically the strongest from a sales perspective. That creates operating leverage, and it really helps the margin in that quarter. 
By the same token, you can't use, for example, Q1 as a good proxy for the average rate for the year because Q1 is the lowest quarter. So you have to think about how those numbers average out throughout the year. 
The mix in the quarter in Q4 was very good. We just talked about Consumables, and Consumables performed really well in the U.S. and in Europe. We're not only -- it was not only the U.S., but the U.S. and Europe had a good quarter from a Consumables perspective, and that is a good margin business. 
Then when you go down to expenses, on the expenses side, there are probably 3 main buckets, right? One is the cost takeout that we're doing structurally. And that is reflected in the guidance. It's reflected in the steady progression that we have delivered over the last several quarters and what we're projecting for '21. So there's going to be a significant amount of cost that is out on a permanent basis. 
There is -- there are 2 other buckets. One is spend that is volume-related. And as we increase volume, there is some variable cost that will be added to the equation. And we didn't have that in Q4 or Q3 because we are running at a lower-than-normal levels in volume. So that is important. 
There is discretionary spend and some other spend that as our volume grows, we probably will start spending some -- in some of those buckets again. And then finally, the investments, and I mentioned investments. And we are -- when you look at the long-term target that we have for top line and for gross margin and for margin expansion, they require some investments. And I can give you a list of things that we are working on. There is stuff that we're doing from an e-commerce platform. We're investing more in R&D. Our R&D target for this year is $160 million. That is a substantially higher number than what we saw in 2020 and in 2019. 
We are working on investments in other digital platforms. The modernization of the enterprise to make our customer experience much better requires some investments. Sales to cash is one area where we are -- we definitely need to improve for the benefit of our customers. So when we add all of those things, that explains some of the decline. 
And then finally, very important, we are adding -- as part of the acquisitions of Byte and Datum, as I indicated in my prepared remarks, there is about $90 million of incremental SG&A that is going into our numbers in 2021. So with all of that, you get to the 20 -- and we're saying we're aiming for at least 20% with the second half of the year been stronger. We expect we will exit '21 at the 21% margin level. So that's how you walk from the Q4 number to the average and the exit rate for '21."

Erin, it's our objective to deliver a pretty steady stream of innovation. Look, in 2020, particularly in the second quarter, what we did was really kind of pull back and make sure we were focusing on kind of the big, really essential products. But as we've made all these changes really in kind of late '18 into '19, talk about portfolio, talking about moving to a procedure approach. We've got new leadership in R&D, and we're just taking a different approach. 
And the productivity we've seen, we thought we had a pretty good year in '19, where despite the pandemic, pretty happy with some pretty major products coming out in 2020. And what we know that we have in -- coming in 2021, we felt that the R&D organization is really efficient, and we're making further changes. 
I mean, we're super excited about creating a new innovation center that will focus on our Consumable and implants business. It's 60,000 square foot facility that we're going to be opening this year in Charlotte as kind of emblematic of how we're taking this cross-product procedure approach. So getting up to the $160 million that Jorge mentioned to me is just terrific spending because it's going to allow us to deliver innovation. 
Now, look, it's not going to be perfect every year. It's going to be on a glide path. But we think that kind of step-up in spending should enable us to deliver a stepped-up productivity from our organic efforts. So again, I'd love to say innovation is going to, hey, we're going to launch 2 in this quarter, 2 in that quarter, 2 in the next quarter. Some of that's going to be really timed off when the innovation comes. 
And just the last point, Erin, I'd add, as we -- I just mentioned in my prepared remarks, increasingly, we're really thinking about our digital footprint whether that's a huge installed base on the x-ray side or a very, very strong base on the CEREC side. How do we combine that in a way that allows dentists to really think about more complex workflows? And as a result, you start looking at all the software in the company. And as you want that to start working together, that's an area that we're extremely excited about. Our customers, some of the stuff we've shown our customers gets them -- gets their blood flowing, and that's another area that we're investing in. So I was telling our Board of Directors that, ""Boy, it would be great if we're able to increase our R&D spending because that's the, in my opinion, the most efficient way for us generate organic growth going down in the future."""

The feedback from the dental community is almost exactly what we expected based on all the survey work we had done during the diligence process, which is dentists that are doing clear aligners think having another major entry in the clear aligner space is going to put more marketing emphasis and drive, in general, more patient traffic. So they're pretty positive. 
I think some general dentists that aren't necessarily doing clear aligner work today potentially look at that as competitive. I think a lot of that will dissipate when we bring the Byte program out to them. 
I mean basically, when we show them a concept where we're taking the hundreds of thousands, close to 1 million unique visitors that come into Byte, not all of them are going to be available for class 1 treatment. And we believe that gives us an opportunity to direct patient traffic at our network. So we believe that as we bring that story out and provide details, it's going to be pretty positive. 
And then the last discussion that we've seen is people ask us the question, ""Well, if the dentists are negative about it, is there going to be any deleterious impact on purchase intent for Dentsply Sirona products?"" And a couple of things I'd point out. 
The first is we tend to be a house of brands as opposed to a branded house. So whether or not people know a Cavitron is a Dentsply Sirona product is actually one of the things I'm working to fix long term, but it's kind of hard to single out Dentsply Sirona products. And that's -- it's really funny. It's a blip that comes, and then it kind of goes away. So I would tell you that we're pretty happy with the response of the general dental population to Byte. That's question one. 
Question two, since we've had it, does it require any new investment or stuff like this? We have done a pretty thorough amount of diligence, and we kind of knew what it was going to take. Obviously, a start-up company, we're looking forward to the integration of like finance, QARA, some supply chain stuff. And that's really gone according to plan. 
We haven't seen any areas that require major investment. If anything, today, we're more excited about Byte than we were in January when we made the announcement."

We added Datum, which we think is an important adjacency product. If you look at it, Elizabeth, we have between Atlantis and Datum, we think we have 2 really good adjacencies that allow us to be in a much better position today than we were even a year ago to go in and really make some noise around implants. 
We think our implant business will grow in 2021. So we feel good about that. And long term, we believe as digital dentistry and workflow management becomes increasingly important, we're very, very well positioned between the diagnostic expertise of our X-ray portfolio, which is critical around implants. We think our product portfolio will be rounding that out over the course of this year. And we think we've got great adjacencies that will allow us to be very, very competitive. 
And last, it's interesting. I -- we mentioned the sales force effectiveness program, and it's interesting. We don't really get a whole heck of a lot of questions on it, even though it represents about 1/3 of the people that work in Dentsply Sirona. And the thing that we've been doing in our sales force effectiveness program is really how do we go in and focus on, say, if it's a high-volume implant doc, how do we really make sure that we're bringing all of the resources of Dentsply Sirona to that doc. 
And we feel pretty good about the work we've done in the U.S., and we've now rolled that -- we're in the process of rolling that out to 10 more countries.

And then in the back half of the year, a lot of the stuff that we are working on in late '19 and through 2020 will come to fruition. And then the step-up in R&D investment, you almost have to think of that in a bifurcated way. The first is software is increasingly important to us, and that comes out a little bit faster. And then products that are 510(k) or longer-term clinical or have longer-term clinical requirements, that's obviously going to come out a little bit later.

One area where there was less color was just around the gross margin expectations for '21. Curious to hear more about the puts and takes that can cause variability there. As we think about the gross margins exiting 2020 at just under 57%, is that a good run rate to use for '21 overall? 
And then just quickly on the R&D, the $160 million expense in '21, can you just tell us roughly what the R&D expense was for 2020, just to give us a sense for the comparison?"

And going forward, we are going to be very, very transparent about our R&D spend, and you'll see -- you guys will see that on the face of the financials. With respect to gross margin, gross margin fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter, similar to operating profit margin. Our expectation is that we will steadily increase gross margin a little bit as well. Some of the cost savings as part of the $250 million target are coming from gross margin improvements. 
We continue to do a lot of work from a manufacturing facility optimization. There is indirect procurement initiatives that we have. And there is a number of other things within COGS that should help our gross margin. I don't expect to see a significant change going into 2021, but we should have some small improvement there."

So we look at Datum as it's a great technology. I mean, we believe it's clinically superior to anything else in the marketplace. Being able to go in with a relevant kind of piece of news about, hey, as you think about immediate load systems, one of the best ways to accelerate healing is to use OSSIX.

Before we begin, please take a moment to read the forward-looking statements in our earnings press release.

We base these statements and certain assumptions and expectations on future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties.

We believe that non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about financial performance of our business, enable the comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independently of business performance and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.

It's hard to imagine that a year ago, on this call, we first started discussing the COVID-19 pandemic. And as we enter 2021, it is still a challenge that creates some level of uncertainty. But over the course of the year, there have been many lessons for Dentsply Sirona, and the experience has hopefully prepared us for the coming year and beyond.
As we provide a final look at 2020, a few things really stand out. The first is the resilience of the dental market and how committed the dental community is to serving their patients. The second is how strong the underlying Dentsply Sirona business is. This is illustrated by the improvement in our results over the last 2 quarters. Learning new and different ways to do business has been another key lesson. Whether it was a virtual DS World, creating digital KOL forms or having our global R&D teams collaborate without physically being together. There is vital learning here that we will apply going forward. And finally, we have always talked about how our people are our most important asset. Well, 2020 certainly highlighted that. Every day, our team stayed focused on our customers and their patients despite dealing with professional and personal challenges that we all faced during the year. I want to thank them for their commitment and professionalism.
Moving on. Today, we want to cover 4 things. The first is our fourth quarter results. After that, we will provide some guidance for 2021, and we will then provide some perspective on our priorities going forward, and we will finish with a discussion around our ESG plans. 
Moving now to Slide 6. We are pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter. Revenues were $1.1 billion, down 3.3% on an organic basis. This is a sequential improvement versus quarters 2 and 3 and reflects a gradual recovery in the dental market. In the fourth quarter, we remained disciplined around spending, and these cost-containment efforts helped deliver a solid margin performance. Operating margin reached 23.2%, up 320 basis points versus year ago. This results in an adjusted non-GAAP EPS of $0.87, up 19.2% versus the prior year. Other actions taken by the team helped generate healthy cash flow from operations of $263 million.
To provide the details of our performance for the quarter, I will now turn the call over to Jorge."

In the fourth quarter, we delivered strong results and exceeded our internal expectations in many categories.

In the fourth quarter, we delivered strong results and exceeded our internal expectations in many categories. The steps we've taken to improve our business continue to generate positive financial outcomes despite the difficult environment created by the evolving global pandemic. Sequentially, during the fourth quarter, we delivered improvements on almost every key financial metric versus the third quarter. We capitalized on the gradual recovery in customer demand and commitment to cost discipline across the enterprise. While we remain cautious, our fourth quarter performance has given us good momentum going into fiscal 2021.
Let's look at Q4 in more detail. Organic revenue decline of 3.3% versus last year was an improvement sequentially as compared to the 8.8% decline experienced in the third quarter. Consumables posted organic growth of 1.1% in the fourth quarter versus last year. We delivered strong Consumables growth in Europe and the U.S., offset by declines in other geographies. As expected, Technologies & Equipment organic sales declined 6.2% versus last year, primarily as a result of the difficult comparison for the CAD/CAM business relative to Q4 2019. 
Gross profit was $613 million or 56.7% of sales, a better-than-expected outcome, given this quarter's lower volume levels as compared to last year. The gross margin reduction was primarily due to the lower sales levels and negative absorption. It was partially offset by productivity and cost savings initiatives.
SG&A decreased $58 million or 13.8% versus the prior year. SG&A as a percent of sales declined 430 basis points year-over-year. The reduction in SG&A reflects volume-related decreases and improvements in productivity and operational agility. Examples of volume-related expenses include travel, commissions, advertising and promotions. Also, we have been very prudent with nonessential and discretionary spending categories. 
Operating profit grew over 13% to $251 million versus last year. It represents a margin expansion of 320 basis points to 23.2%. Our margin rate benefited from strong Consumables sales and, as just mentioned, the impact from permanent, discretionary and volume-related spend reductions. Also, keep in mind that the typically strong Q4 sales volume create significant operating leverage that enhances margin. The results from the actions taken during 2020 give us confidence to expand our investments in R&D and customer experience to deliver sustainable growth. I will refer to these investments later in my presentation.
Moving on. Net interest and other expense increased $5 million, reflecting higher levels of debt versus last year and the closing out of certain net investment hedges. The non-GAAP tax rate in the fourth quarter was 21%, a decrease compared to 25.1% in the prior year, which was a function of the changes in the U.S. versus non-U.S. pretax income mix. This lower rate added approximately $0.05 to fourth quarter 2020 non-GAAP EPS as compared to last year. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.87, up 19.2% versus the prior year quarter.
Moving on to fourth quarter Consumables segment results. We are pleased with the Consumables business performance in the fourth quarter. Organic sales were $449 million, an increase of 1.1% versus the prior year. Growth was strong in Europe and the U.S., partially offset by a decline in rest of the world. Sales in Restorative and Preventive show a strong organic growth, offset by a decrease in lab. Our efforts on retail-focused programs is a driver of improved Consumables sales performance in the U.S. We are gaining traction on the execution of initiatives such as a shift in promotional strategies to strengthen relationships with dentists, delivering clinically relevant products with strong incentives. 
Moving on to Technologies & Equipment performance. Heading into the fourth quarter, we indicated a tough comparison in this segment versus the prior year due to many factors, including DS World sales, the Primescan upgrade cycle and the uncertainty from COVID. As expected, Technologies & Equipment organic sales declined 6.2% versus the prior year, but grew sequentially from Q3 2020 to Q4 2020. Within this segment, our clear aligners and health care businesses performed very well during the quarter. Of note, our team was able to transition the DS World event into a fully interactive virtual experience in Q4. Although we are pleased with the results of the virtual DS World event and the strong participation, we have announced our intention of returning to a hybrid live event in 2021. 
On Slide 11, you can see our financial performance by region during the fourth quarter. U.S. sales of $359 million declined 8.7% compared to the prior year. Organic sales declined 7.3% driven by CAD/CAM and Imaging. European sales were $448 million, up 3% compared to the prior year. Organic sales increased 0.4%. Strong growth in Consumables was partially offset by the COVID-19-related impacts on Technologies & Equipment. Rest of the World sales were $275 million, down 2.8%. The South American market continues to experience COVID-related declines, especially in Brazil.
Moving on to cash flows. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we had a strong operating cash flow of $263 million, bringing the full year 2020 cash flow to $635 million. Full year 2020 delivered $548 million of free cash flow, an increase of 7% versus last year. We returned a total of $228 million to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks and deployed $1.1 billion to fund acquisitions. The company finished 2020 with strong liquidity available, comprising $438 million of cash and committed credit facilities of another $1.1 billion.
Now let me provide an update on 2 strategic initiatives we discussed in prior quarters. First, we completed the actions required to exit the traditional ortho and the analog lab businesses as planned. Both businesses accounted for approximately $175 million of sales in 2019. These exits enhance our ability to focus on growth areas. Second, we remain on track to achieve our long-term cost savings objective of $250 million. We delivered another $70 million of savings in fiscal 2020. That brings the total cost savings to $160 million since the announcement of the restructuring in 2018. Consistent with the plan, we expected restructuring to cost a total of $375 million. To date, we have spent approximately $310 million, $120 million of which is noncash. Before we turn the page into 2021, I want to take a moment to thank every single associate at Dentsply Sirona for the tremendous commitment to deliver results under very difficult circumstances during 2020.
Now let me turn to our financial expectations for 2021. We are monitoring the markets where we operate very closely. Our research indicates that the gradual rate of recovery in dental appears to continue. Dentist offices remain open. Importantly, patient confidence is improving with the vaccine rollouts. However, COVID-19 continues to represent a lingering uncertainty, which makes medium- to long-term planning very difficult. After thoughtful consideration and acknowledging the level of difficulty to forecast accurately in the current environment, we have decided to share our key planning assumptions for fiscal year 2021. We're optimistic about the long-term prospects of the dental industry. There are several categories with high-growth profile -- high-growth profiles, while others are more moderate but with great cash flow. The intrinsic resilience of the dental category provides some stability in the short term and the possibility of a stronger demand in the second half of 2021 relative to the first half.
We're expecting fiscal 2021 reported sales to be in the range of $4 billion to $4.3 billion. This range equates to a reported sales growth rate of approximately 20% to 30%. From an organic sales perspective, the range provided equates to an organic growth rate of approximately 15% to 25%. The difference between reported and organic sales is primarily explained by the acquisitions of BYTE and Datum, the disposition of traditional ortho, analog lab, other smaller portfolio-shaping activities and FX. The recovery of the dental market and the success of the vaccine rollout will influence, to a large extent, at one end -- what end of the range we deliver results. 
As communicated in January, we expect our clear aligner business to reach an annual run rate of $300 million by the end of 2021. We're excited about the growth contribution of this franchise going forward. We plan to increase our investments related to strategic growth initiatives. Targeted R&D investments are increasing to approximately $160 million in 2021. Other areas of significant investments not reported in R&D include clear aligners acceleration, e-commerce and other digital platforms. 
On the SG&A front, BYTE and Datum combined contribute approximately $90 million in incremental SG&A in 2021. Operating income margin for 2021 is expected to be 20% or higher with a stronger performance in the second half of the year. Our margin expansion remains steady, and we continue to aim for 22% operating profit margin by the end of fiscal '22. We expect the non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 23% and 24%. Our estimate for share count is approximately 221 million. That brings our non-GAAP EPS expectations for 2021 to a range of $2.60 to $2.80. Our capital expenditures estimate for 2021 is $160 million. Despite the near-term challenges presented by COVID-19, we are mindful of the targets we set, and we remain focused on achieving our 2021 objectives and expect to remain on track to reach our longer-term targets.
Before I turn the call over to Don, I want to make a comment about the first quarter of 2021. Please remember that the first quarter of the fiscal year has been historically the lowest quarter in sales and consequently, operating income margin has been several points lower sequentially. We expect that trend to continue this year. This seasonality effect is factored into our planning assumptions for the full fiscal year.
With that, I will now turn the call back to Don."

To give additional perspective on 2021, it might be helpful to provide some detail around our strategy and operating priorities going forward.Moving to Slide 15. Over the past 2 years, the company is focus",1535,"Thank you, Jorge, and we will move to Slide 14. To give additional perspective on 2021, it might be helpful to provide some detail around our strategy and operating priorities going forward.
Moving to Slide 15. Over the past 2 years, the company is focused on delivering against the restructuring outlined in late 2018. Despite the pandemic, Dentsply Sirona has made solid progress across most areas against the goals outlined in that restructuring. The plan was built around improving growth, driving margin and simplifying the organization. And while there is still work to do, our leadership team is committed to meeting those goals in the original time frame. As we get toward the conclusion of the restructuring, though, it now becomes important to lay out a strategy for how we will grow Dentsply Sirona in the future. As we have refined our growth strategy over the past few years, it is important to recognize that the dental market continues to evolve. Increasingly, our customers are looking for comprehensive solutions and improved workflows that deliver better patient outcomes and improve the financial health of their practices. Dentsply Sirona is uniquely suited to deliver this for our customers. 
Our company has an unmatched installed base of digital dental products, including both digital impressions and a complete range of x-ray imaging products. We have deep expertise in treatment planning and workflow management, and Dentsply Sirona has a full portfolio of essential consumer products that are critical components of many procedures. Putting all of this together, we will distinct -- putting all of this together will distinguish us going forward and provide sustainable differentiation. 
For 2021 and beyond, our operational priorities will remain consistent around delivering growth, improving margin and building a scaled, efficient company. Specific targets include organic growth of 4% to 5% plus going forward. As Jorge said, we are committed to improving our margin, achieving our 22% goal by the end of 2022, and our efforts around organization simplification will allow us to deliver the cost-saving target of $250 million through the end of the restructuring plan. Doing all this will allow us to target double-digit adjusted EPS growth and create sustainable value for our shareholders. 
Moving to Slide 16. Let's look at these priorities in more depth, starting with growing revenues. As I mentioned earlier, Dentsply Sirona is well positioned going forward to grow our revenues through a combination of organic and inorganic opportunities, all built on a foundation of global commercial excellence. 
Starting with organic growth. Over the last 3 years, the company has made significant improvements to our R&D program. Major changes have involved implementing a portfolio management approach to allow us to maximize the impact of our spending by focusing on fewer, bigger products in essential areas. A second major shift is having our innovation efforts focused on procedures rather than products. This allows -- this aligns us with how our customers think and will allow us to offer more comprehensive solutions. And as those changes have become more engrained and show promise for the future, in 2021, we are increasing our investment in R&D significantly. This is highlighted by the creation of a new Consumables Innovation Center to be opened this year in Charlotte. 
As you can see on Slide 17, despite the pandemic, Dentsply Sirona was able to continue accelerating our new product activity. We've been pleased with the response, in particular to Axeos, Primemill and SureFil one. Looking out to 2021, we are excited about the portfolio we will be bringing to the market, including important new introductions in the endo and implant areas. 
Moving now to Slide 18. In addition to our investment in organic programs, when appropriate, we will look to acquisitions to support critical growth priorities, like clear aligners and implants. As we announced in early January, Dentsply Sirona acquired BYTE, a direct-to-consumer clear aligner company. It has been great to welcome this outstanding team to Dentsply Sirona. The acquisition gives us significant scale in the critical clear aligner market as well as important new capabilities. These capabilities include the ability to communicate directly with patients. We believe it will be important for Dentsply Sirona to help generate patient traffic for dentists across multiple procedures in the future. This business carried good momentum from the fourth quarter into the new year, and the integration of the BYTE business is on track. As we mentioned earlier, we believe that we will exit 2021 with $200 million plus run rates. And as Jorge has mentioned, combined with SureSmile, our clear aligner franchise is expected to achieve a run rate of $300 million by the end of the year. The deal is expected to be accretive to our long-term financial targets and non-GAAP EPS in 2021.
Moving to Slide 19. In late January, Dentsply Sirona acquired Datum, an Israeli biomedical company, for a little over $100 million. Datum expands our biomaterial portfolio with the OSSIX brands with its GLYMATRIX technology. The implant category has been shifting to meet the patient need for fewer visits and more rapid results. This has led to an expansion of procedures using immediate load implants. In these procedures, bone growth factors, like OSSIX, can provide important benefits. We believe this acquisition gives Dentsply Sirona a terrific brand with an excellent technology that will help improve our performance in the implant category.
Moving to Slide 20. Over the past 15 months, the company has also made major efforts to improve our global commercial capabilities. These have included pursuing a comprehensive sales effectiveness program in multiple countries. We have also shifted our promotional spending to focus more on programs like One DS that creates demand at the retail level. The team has also enhanced our digital clinical education capabilities, and we reached over 1 million visitors this year. All of this has improved the effectiveness of our global commercial capabilities.
Now on Slide 21. Along with driving revenue growth, the company is focused on improving our margin in multiple areas. One highlight that has been discussed is spending discipline. Our team has shown steady progress in this area over the last few years, but the pandemic has shown there are new, more efficient ways to manage the business. It's important to apply the lessons learned in 2020 going forward. Our supply chain has made excellent progress across the board, highlighted by reducing our manufacturing footprint from 42 facilities in 2018 to 29 now. There has been strong progress in SKU rationalization and inventory management. Yet even with this success, there are still opportunities in several places as we get better using our scale in areas like procurement and logistics. And finally, we remain committed to portfolio management. The exit of the traditional ortho and analog lab businesses has helped simplify the organization and improve both margin and operating efficiency. This will remain an important part of our discipline around margin improvement going forward. 
Moving now to Slide 22. We believe a key ingredient of the -- of a successful business strategy going forward is to establish a comprehensive framework to manage ESG objectives. A strong ESG program can facilitate top line growth and reduce cost. It can contribute to reducing legal and regulatory risk while improving employee engagement. As a result, getting ESG right has become a business imperative for Dentsply Sirona. As a global leader in the dental health segment, we are striving to become an ESG leader as well. ESG objectives are aligned with our purpose and mission of improving access to quality health care globally. Every day, the almost 15,000 employees of Dentsply Sirona work to improve the lives of people all around the world, including the communities we serve, while continuing to deliver value for our shareholders. We will achieve this by investing in our people as well as leveraging our R&D and innovation capabilities to leave a lasting impact on society.
While Dentsply Sirona has always had multiple activities in this area, we felt it was time to create a more comprehensive framework to measure ourselves and communicate our results. Last year, our cross-functional ESG Committee was established, composed of our most senior leaders. This team is tasked with developing the necessary internal controls, data management and frameworks for ESG reporting. In addition to the senior leaders, we have added internal subject matter experts, outside resources and consult regularly with companies advanced in ESG practices. The committee is in the process of developing an ESG implementation plan with specific objectives, and we look forward to sharing the plan and our progress going forward.
Moving to Slide 23. In conclusion, there's still uncertainty around how the pandemic will impact 2021, but we feel, absent a major setback, the dental market will improve throughout the year. Our solid results in the fourth quarter have shown the resilience of our underlying business and the commitment of our people. While we are cautious around 2021, we expect to see improvement as we go through the year. We believe that Dentsply Sirona has a clear strategy and is well positioned to drive revenue, improve our margins and deliver sustainable value for our shareholders. 
And with that, I will now turn the call back over to Kari."

What is the relevant comparison? Is it '19 or is it '20? Look, with the pandemic still lingering through this quarter and while we're optimistic about vaccines, we think that there's still going to be an impact that we",544,"Yes. Thanks, Nate. It's interesting. What is the relevant comparison? Is it '19 or is it '20? Look, with the pandemic still lingering through this quarter and while we're optimistic about vaccines, we think that there's still going to be an impact that we'll see in our business in places like Latin America and others. So we're kind of really looking at the guidance versus 2020 as kind of the relevant discussion. Look, in terms of what we expect over the course of the year, we see a gradual improvement. If you look at the ADA surveys and a lot of our survey work, you see particularly like in the North American market, we think offices are operating 80%, 85%. There's been some compensation on the part of the dentists by looking at higher-value procedures. So revenue has stayed up. We've actually seen, in some cases, dentists beginning to add fee -- fees for PPE to compensate for that. But our expectation based on our tracking studies that talk directly to patients, we see patient optimism starting to increase. And we think that will manifest itself kind of gradually over the course of the year. So we think the exit rate for the total category in the back half of 2021 will be better than the front half.
Just in terms of how does our portfolio stack up, Nate, look, I think other people are better qualified to answer how different people's portfolios are going to stack up. I would tell you this, as we kind of look at it, we start with our strategy, which we really think -- let's think about workflows and what workflows are important to us. Clear aligners is clearly an area that we've spent a lot of effort on, and we obviously feel very, very good about that. If you look at the implant and endo procedures, we believe that we have a good formula for growth right now. And I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we anticipate some launches in the back half of 2021 that should accelerate momentum. Stuff like Datum, we believe, gives us a reason to really go in with new news in the implant market. And in terms of Consumables, look, some of that's going to be directly related to how fast kind of Rest of the World comes up. As you know, Nate, our portfolio is not really heavily focused on PPE. We tend to think much more around like the resto, endo and lab businesses, which are -- some of that's a function of what are we able to do competitively to gain share. We feel that we've been very competitive in the fourth quarter. And look, as the market comes back, particularly on a global basis, we're optimistic that we're going to see some improvement there. 
On the last issue, we really have spent a lot of time over the last year shifting our promotional strategy, which is really very much more focused on retail and how do we drive retail consumption at the dentist office level. So that's one of the last reasons we feel that there's going to be continuing improvement over the course of the year around our Consumable business. So I hope that's helpful, Nate."

I mean, basically, you were in full -- in the critical North American market, you were in the middle of a Primescan upgrade, and you launched Primemill, and we had the One DS program. So we knew that was going to be a pretty steep hill decline. Relative to our expectations, particularly without having a live DS World, the T&E segment actually performed pretty well. And as we look out to the first quarter, now let's remember, the first quarter for us typically is slow. It's the smallest quarter over the course of the year, and obviously, T&E is a big part of that. But I would tell you the thing that has impressed us is that the -- if you really go back to the second quarter, I think in the North American, European markets, in particular, the dentists really were kind of, okay, what are -- when the pandemic kind of eases up, what are we going to do. And we've seen a lot of dentists that have really taken a step to say, ""Hey, look, I want to get into implants. I want to do more clear aligners,"" which requires them to kind of up their diagnostic game, whether that's through like more 2D, 3D cone beam or whether that's getting what we think is a best-in-class scanner with Primescan. 
And we've seen underlying demand pretty good. I mean, if you actually -- one of the reasons we say that is if you look at how, like, North America performed comparative to Europe on some of like the CAD/CAM and the CEREC businesses, where you didn't have the impact of the DS World, you saw what we think was pretty solid demand for T&E. And we feel, as we come into this quarter, we're not getting ahead of ourselves, but we feel that underlying interest in our products has been pretty good. And with Primemill now coming, we feel that we've got a pretty winnable portfolio."

Look, the Consumable market is kind of hard to parse apart because there's not a clean comparison as what is Consumables because you've got some people who report big PPE numbers and whatnot. When we talk about C",514,"Yes. Glen, first, thanks for the question. Look, the Consumable market is kind of hard to parse apart because there's not a clean comparison as what is Consumables because you've got some people who report big PPE numbers and whatnot. When we talk about Consumables and us -- it's really about like resto, lab and endo for us. And what we saw was, in the fourth quarter, we had a good performance in the U.S. in particular, and we think that's been a result of a lot of the work that we had been doing around the promotional strategies. We're not quite as exposed as some of our other competitors may be to areas in Asia Pacific that have returned from the pandemic a little bit faster. So in all, we were pretty happy with how Consumables performed.
Now go below that a little bit. I mean, when -- and it was really funny. If you go back a year on this call because we report relatively late in the cycle, we were really the first people that were talking about an impact on coronavirus in the dental category. And one of the things we said is as dentists started heading into that kind of March uncertainty and April uncertainty, it's -- the easiest spigot to turn off was Consumables. Hey, we're not going to build inventory there. And we do think that while the ADA is saying 80-plus, we do think that there was some benefits to not only the things we were doing, but there was some restocking as traffic begins to return to somewhat more normal levels. So -- and then, look, the promotional programs, we've said this, and I wish it was easy to just do that all in 1 quarter. 
But as we roll our promotional strategies around One DS and other things around the world, basically what we're saying is, ""Hey, look, anything we want to do has got to be focused on driving innovation directly at the dentist and create promotional strategies like One DS that actually allow us to leverage technology and equipment, something like a Primescan launch with our Consumables."" And as we roll that out, that represents a shift. I mean, if we were to look at, say, the U.S. market 18 months ago, we would be running 9, 10 to 15 promotional programs, which we've now swept into one. And some of that was focused on things that may not necessarily be as retail-focused. Do we want to do a 2-for-1 promotion, which involves different kind of promotional strategies? So look, bottom line, we think the Consumable market, whether it's growing or not, it certainly improved sequentially for the third consecutive quarter. 
We think our -- the strategy that we're pursuing around Consumables is the right thing, which is one of the reasons we're happy with the performance in the U.S. and Europe. And then as we go forward, we're optimistic that our innovation as well as our promotional strategy is going to allow us to see Consumables trend in the right direction."

The first I would say is you can't compare just Q4 with the average operating profit margin for the fiscal year. Because as you know, Q4 is typically the strongest from a sales perspective. That creates operating leverage, and it really helps the margin in that quarter. By the same token, you can't use, for example, Q1 as a good proxy for the average rate for the year because Q1 is the lowest quarter. So you have to think about how those numbers average out throughout the year. The mix in the quarter -- in Q4 was very good. We just talked about Consumables, and Consumables performed really well in the U.S. and in Europe. We're not only -- it was not only the U.S., but the U.S. and Europe had a good quarter from a Consumables perspective, and that is a good margin business. 
Then when you go down to expenses, on the expenses side, there are probably 3 main buckets, right? One is the cost takeout that we're doing structurally. And that is reflected in the guidance. It's reflected in the steady progression that we have delivered over the last several quarters and what we're projecting for '21. So there's going to be a significant amount of cost that is out on a permanent basis. There is -- there are 2 other buckets. One is spend that is volume-related. And as we increase volume, there is some variable cost that will be added to the equation. And we didn't have that in Q4 or Q3 because we are running at a lower-than-normal levels in volume. So that is important. There is discretionary spend and some other spend that, as our volume grows, we probably will start spending some -- in some of those buckets again. 
And then finally, the investments, and I mentioned investments. And we are -- when you look at the long-term target that we have for top line and for gross -- and for margin expansion, they require some investments. And I can give you a list of things that we are working on. There is stuff that we're doing from an e-commerce platform. We're investing more in R&D. Our R&D target for this year is $160 million. That is a substantially higher number than what we saw in 2020 and in 2019. We are working on investments in other digital platforms. The modernization of the enterprise to make our customer experience much better requires some investments. Sales to cash is one area where we are -- we definitely need to improve for the benefit of our customers. So when we add all of those things, that explains some of the decline.
And then finally, very important, we are adding -- as part of the acquisitions of BYTE and Datum, as I indicated in my prepared remarks, there is about $90 million of incremental SG&A that is going into our numbers in 2021. So with all of that, you get to the 20 -- and we're saying we're aiming for at least 20% with the second half of the year being stronger. We expect we will exit '21 at the 21% margin level. So that's how you walk from the Q4 number to the average and the exit rate for '21."

Erin, it's our objective to deliver a pretty steady stream of innovation. Look, in 2020, particularly in the second quarter, what we did was really kind of pull back and make sure we were focusing on kind of the big, really essential products. But as we've made all these changes really in kind of late '18 into '19, talk about portfolio, talking about moving to a procedure approach, we've got new leadership in R&D, and we're just taking a different approach. And the productivity we've seen, we thought we had a pretty good year in '19, where, despite the pandemic, pretty happy with some pretty major products coming out in 2020. And what we know that we have in -- coming in 2021, we felt that the R&D organization is really efficient, and we're making further changes. I mean, we're super excited about creating a new innovation center that will focus on our Consumable and implants business. It's 60,000 square foot facility that we're going to be opening this year in Charlotte as kind of emblematic of how we're taking this cross-product procedure approach. So getting up to the $160 million that Jorge mentioned, to me, is just terrific spending because it's going to allow us to deliver innovation. 
Now, look, it's not going to be perfect every year. It's going to be on a glide path. But we think that kind of step-up in spending should enable us to deliver a stepped-up productivity from our organic efforts. So again, I'd love to say innovation is going to, hey, we're going to launch 2 in this quarter, 2 in that quarter, 2 in the next quarter. Some of that's going to be really timed off when the innovation comes. 
And just the last point, Erin, I'd add, as we -- I just mentioned in my prepared remarks, increasingly, we're really thinking about our digital footprint whether that's a huge installed base on the x-ray side or a very, very strong base on the CEREC side. How do we combine that in a way that allows dentists to really think about more complex workflows? And as a result, you start looking at all the software in the company. And as you want that to start working together, that's an area that we're extremely excited about. Our customers, some of the stuff we've shown our customers, gets them -- gets their blood flowing, and that's another area that we're investing in. So I was telling our Board of Directors that, ""Boy, it would be great if we're able to increase our R&D spending because that's the, in my opinion, the most efficient way for us generate organic growth going down in the future."""

The feedback from the dental community is almost exactly what we expected based on all the survey work we had done during the diligence process, which is dentists that are doing clear aligners think having another major entry in the clear aligner space is going to put more marketing emphasis and drive, in general, more patient traffic. So they're pretty positive. I think some general dentists that aren't necessarily doing clear aligner work today potentially look at that as competitive. I think a lot of that will dissipate when we bring the BYTE program out to them. I mean basically, when we show them a concept, where we're taking the hundreds of thousands, close to 1 million unique visitors that come into BYTE, not all of them are going to be available for class 1 treatment. And we believe that gives us an opportunity to direct patient traffic at our network. So we believe that as we bring that story out and provide details, it's going to be pretty positive. 
And then the last discussion that we've seen is people ask us the question, ""Well, if the dentists are negative about it, is there going to be any deleterious impact on purchase intent for Dentsply Sirona products?"" And a couple of things I'd point out. The first is we tend to be a house of brands as opposed to a branded house. So whether or not people know a Cavitron is a Dentsply Sirona product is actually one of the things I'm working to fix long term, but it's kind of hard to single out Dentsply Sirona products. And that's -- it's really funny. It's a blip that comes and then it kind of goes away. So I would tell you that we're pretty happy with the response of the general dental population to BYTE. That's question one. 
Question two, since we've had it, does it require any new investment or stuff like this? We have done a pretty thorough amount of diligence, and we kind of knew what it was going to take. Obviously, a start-up company, we're looking forward to the integration of like finance, QA, RA, some supply chain stuff. And that's really gone according to plan. We haven't seen any areas that require major investment. If anything, today, we're more excited about BYTE than we were in January when we made the announcement."

I would tell you, the time that we've spent during the pandemic and looking at how we see the market evolving, we've improved our portfolio. I think we're optimistic about the things we're bringing to market over the course of this year. We added Datum, which we think is an important adjacency product. If you look at it, Elizabeth, we have -- between Atlantis and Datum, we think we have 2 really good adjacencies that allow us to be in a much better position today than we were even a year ago to go in and really make some noise around implants. 
We think our implant business will grow in 2021. So we feel good about that. And long term, we believe as digital dentistry and workflow management becomes increasingly important, we're very, very well positioned between the diagnostic expertise of our X-ray portfolio, which is critical around implants. We think our product portfolio will be rounding that out over the course of this year. And we think we've got great adjacencies that will allow us to be very, very competitive. And last, it's interesting. I -- we mentioned the sales force effectiveness program, and it's interesting. We don't really get a whole heck of a lot of questions on it, even though it represents about 1/3 of the people that work in Dentsply Sirona. And the thing that we've been doing in our sales force effectiveness program is really how do we go in and focus on, say, if it's a high-volume implant doc, how do we really make sure that we're bringing all of the resources of Dentsply Sirona to that doc. 
And we feel pretty good about the work we've done in the U.S., and we've now rolled that -- we're in the process of rolling that out to 10 more countries. So again, getting our commercial sales force effectiveness program rolled out, we think, is going to be helpful. So long term, we think there's nothing but upside on our implant business."

And we think that's going to give us some pretty good momentum through the beginning of the year. And then in the back half of the year, a lot of the stuff that we are working on in late '19 and through 2020 will come to fruition. And then the step-up in R&D investment, you almost have to think of that in a bifurcated way. 
The first is software is increasingly important to us, and that comes out a little bit faster. And then products that are 510(k) or longer-term clinical -- or have longer-term clinical requirements, that's obviously going to come out a little bit later. But I think one of the accomplishments that I'm proudest of the team that they made over the course of the last year and plus, I mean, I really feel like our R&D engine is where we need it to be. And I think it's focused on a broader idea of like how do we win in a procedure, starting from a diagnosis going to a treatment plan and delivering great Consumables that are all synced up is the right way to go.

With respect to gross margin, gross margin fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter, similar to operating profit margin. Our expectation is that we will steadily increase gross margin a little bit as well. Some of the cost savings as part of the $250 million target are coming from gross margin improvements. We continue to do a lot of work from a manufacturing facility optimization.

Tycho, it's interesting as patients have looked at implants, I think the biggest trends they've said they want faster results, which is resulting in a lot of kind of more immediate load implant systems. And when you do immediate load, one of the things that gives dentists a fair amount of confidence is putting in some kind of a bone growth factor around the immediate load screw to kind of accelerate the healing process. So we look at Datum as it's a great technology. I mean, we believe it's clinically superior to anything else in the marketplace. Being able to go in with a relevant kind of piece of news about, hey, as you think about immediate load systems, one of the best ways to accelerate healing is to use OSSIX. So that's kind of how we're thinking about it. Now obviously, as we need to update our portfolio, we've been -- we've tended over the last 8 years to have been much more of a parallel wall implant system company. And we have, we think, a clear opportunity to begin to expand our portfolio to allow us to compete more aggressively in the faster-growing immediate load space."

We are pleased with our performance this quarter. The dental market continues to show a gradual recovery, highlighting its underlying strength and attractiveness.

Now moving to Slide 6. We are pleased with our performance in the first quarter. Revenues reached $1.027 billion, up 12.1% on an organic basis. In the first quarter, we continued to be disciplined around expenses, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 21.3%, up 630 basis points versus the prior year. 
Adjusted non-GAAP EPS in was $0.72, up 67% versus last year. Other actions taken by the team helped generate positive cash flow from operations of $49 million. To provide details of our performance for the quarter, I will now turn the call over to Jorge."

Good morning, and thanks for joining us. As a reminder, my remarks this morning will be based on non-GAAP financial results. Let me start with a few overall comments.

As a reminder, my remarks this morning will be based on non-GAAP financial results. 
Let me start with a few overall comments. In the first quarter, we delivered strong results, reflecting growth on both Consumables and Technologies & Equipment. These results were ahead of our internal financial expectations. owing to a stronger-than-anticipated recovery in global dental demand. We expect the macro environment to remain uncertain, but our focus on execution and our ability to adapt ensure that we will be well positioned against multiple scenarios. 
We are seeing the global dental markets gain traction, and our teams are executing well, utilizing the strength of our portfolio for the benefit of our customers. Q1 performance confirms the momentum in our business and provides a solid starting point for the fiscal year. 
Let's look at Q1 in more detail. As Don mentioned, the business delivered strong organic revenue growth of 12.1% versus last year. Our reported growth was 17.5%. Consumables posted organic growth of 21.2% in the first quarter versus last year. 
As a reminder, our PPE business is immaterial. Sales across all product categories rebounded in the quarter. These results reinforce our view of dentistry as a necessity with resilient underlying growth trends. 
Technologies & Equipment organic sales grew 5.8% versus last year, led by Equipment and Imaging and implants. Gross profit was $611 million or 59.5% of sales. This strong outcome was primarily driven by favorable mix. While we saw higher shipping costs, our execution and supply chain initiatives largely offset the impact. It is likely that higher shipping costs and other inflationary items in the supply chain will persist for the next few quarters. 
Our teams will continue to address these challenges as effectively as possible. Before I start discussing the specific SG&A numbers, I would like to underline a presentation change that you will see going forward. As we continue to ramp up investments for innovation and growth, we will report R&D spend on our P&L separately from SG&A. You will see, in our quarterly results, we've made this change on the face of our financial statements. 
Spending on R&D was up 8.8% in the quarter to $37 million, and we would expect to see this trend continue as we progress throughout -- through the year. As we invest more significantly in R&D, we are making sure we have the right mechanisms to maximize the benefit of the spend by ensuring alignment with the strategic priorities and a strong return on investment. We are focused on scale innovation that has the ability to drive a meaningful growth impact for the business and many opportunities remain. 
Regarding SG&A in Q1, our teams demonstrated a strong operating discipline across the enterprise. As a percent of sales, SG&A declined 350 basis points to 34.6% versus last year. On an absolute basis, SG&A increased by $22 million or 6.6% versus the prior year. The reduction in the Q1 SG&A ratio reflects benefits from volume-related operating leverage, improvement in productivity and benefits from our 3-year restructuring projects. 
Also, we were cautious on our investment spend approach in the first quarter. Going forward, we will accelerate the pace of those investments, which we will discuss later. While we have been measured on our spending in certain categories, we are ramping up investments in sales and marketing resources, R&D and digital infrastructure to support our medium- and long-term growth plans. 
Operating profit grew over 67.2% compared to last year to $219 million. It represents a margin expansion of 630 basis points to 21.3%. As explained earlier, our margin rate benefited from the gross profit margin on sales mix, combined with operating leverage and investment spending increasing at a lower rate than our sales growth. 
Moving on, net interest and other expense increased $9 million, reflecting higher levels of debt versus last year. The non-GAAP tax rate in the first quarter was 22.9%, a decrease compared to 24.6% in the prior year quarter, which was a function of the changes in the U.S. versus non-U.S. pretax income mix. 
Non-GAAP EPS was $0.72, up 67.4% versus the prior year quarter. The Consumables business performed -- the Consumable business performance in the first quarter was strong. Sales were $430 million, an increase of 21.5% versus the prior year. 
Growth was the strongest in Rest of the World and grew double digits in both the U.S. and Europe. Sales grew in all categories, led by Endo and Restorative. The Consumables market has been resilient and is recovering well. 
These results also reflect the ongoing progress optimizing promotional strategies and improving demand creation tools. We are strengthening our relationships with dentists, delivering clinically relevant products with strong incentives for them. We are, of course, also seeing a rebound in dealer orders as they ramp up purchases to meet anticipated demand. Currency favorably impacted sales by 4.6%, offset by a reduction of 4.3% due to divestitures and discontinued products. 
Moving on to the Technologies & Equipment segment results. T&E sales grew 14.8% versus the prior year. The launch of our new Axeos Imaging unit is going very well. As expected, digital dentistry was negatively impacted by the difficult CAD/CAM comp in Q1, resulting from the strong sales in early 2020. 
Our Clear Aligners franchise performed very well in the quarter, and the overall SureSmile and Bite teams are excited about the growth trajectory. Our estimates indicate that our clear aligner portfolio will deliver in excess of $300 million in annual run rate sales in the fourth quarter of 2021. Currency favorably impacted sales by 5.7% and as well as the benefit from acquisitions of 8.6%, offset by a reduction of 5.3% due to divestitures and discontinued products. 
On Slide 11, you can see our organic revenue performance by region during the first quarter. U.S. sales were $347 million, representing growth of 15.7% versus last year. Organic sales growth was 4.8%, with strong Consumable sales offsetting a decline in Technologies & Equipment. European sales were $418 million, a growth of 12.1% versus last year. Organic growth was 8.1% compared to the prior year, driven mostly by strong Endo sales. 
Rest of the World sales were $262 million, a growth of 30.3% versus last year. Organic sales growth was 30.8%, reflecting the recovery in demand. 
Next, I'd like to cover cash flows. In the first quarter of 2021, our operating cash flow was $49 million, a $59 million improvement versus last year. We returned a total of $112 million to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks and deployed $92 million to fund the acquisition of Datum. The company finished this first quarter with strong cash on hand of $318 million and committed credit facilities of another $1 billion. Approximately $350 million of short-term credit facilities expired in April and were not renewed. Our strong balance sheet and credit metrics provide a solid foundation for a balanced capital allocation. We will continue to return cash to shareholders while appropriately investing for growth in the business. 
Now let me provide an update on our financial expectations for 2021. We are pleased to see a faster-than-anticipated market recovery in the first quarter. We are seeing healthy demand continuing into the second quarter, driven by positive momentum in patient confidence and procedure volumes with the vaccine rollouts. These positive trends provide us with optimism for the rest of the year. At the same time, we remain cautious given the market conditions in certain geographies. While there may be near-term volatility, the long-term underlying growth dynamics of the dental market remain intact. 
Based on that, we are revising our outlook for fiscal 2021. We are now expecting fiscal 2021 reported sales to be in the $4.1 billion to $4.3 billion range. This range equates to a reported sales growth rate of approximately 23% to -- 23% to 30%. From an organic sales perspective, the range provided equates to an organic growth rate of approximately 18% to 25%. 
Our new non-GAAP EPS range for fiscal '21 is now $2.75 to $2.90 compared to our prior outlook of $2.60 to $2.80. This full year outlook includes the shift of investment spend of approximately $0.05 from Q1 into the remainder of the year. 
There are 2 risks to this outlook that are worth highlighting: COVID-19 and potential supply disruptions regarding shipping costs and availability of certain semiconductors. We are mindful of the lessons learned about this virus, especially considering that some countries are experiencing increases in cases, with governments intervening with restrictions. 
Before I turn the call back to Don, we would like to share a quick update on our efforts around ESG. We continue to believe a strong ESG program can facilitate top line growth and reduce costs. It can contribute to reducing legal and regulatory risks, while improving employee engagement. In close collaboration with our Board of Directors, I'm chairing an effort with members of a cross-functional team to ensure that our ESG objectives are aligned with our purpose and mission of improving access to oral health care globally. 
In April, we posted our first-ever sustainability flag sheet and environmental scorecard. They are available for review on the Sustainability section on our website. We are measuring and analyzing our ESG data and excited to share more of our findings with you as we develop and track additional metrics. 
Finally, I want to thank our almost 15,000 associates around the globe for their great ongoing dedication and results. With that, I will now turn the call back to Don."

I would now like to provide some perspective around 2021 and beyond, by outlining our strategy and operating priorities. 
Let's move to Slide 15. Our strategy and priorities have been consistent over the past 3 years. We believe that Dentsply Sirona will grow long term by delivering superior integrated workflows built on diagnostic excellence, easy-to-use treatment planning and essential products that improve outcomes for patients and dental professionals. 
Our priors are driving revenue growth, improving margins and creating a simplified organization that takes advantage of scale. There's still a lot of work to be done, but our team is confident that the margin and cost-saving goals we have outlined in the past will be delivered. For us, the focus now really turns to accelerating growth. Our strategy has been refined to reflect the continued evolution of the dental space. There has been a strong growth in specific segments of the market. highlighted by aesthetic areas like clear aligners and implants. Many of these higher-growth areas have been enabled by digital dentistry, driving good growth there. Dentists and DSOs increasingly look to enhance their practices by participating in these higher-growth areas that involve more complex procedures. This leads to an increased willingness to invest in equipment and training both areas where Dentsply Sirona is a leader. Products like 2D and 3D imaging become essential to improving their diagnostic capabilities. 
More practices are also recognizing the utility of incorporating digital scanners as an essential part of their office workflow. These more sophisticated digital devices, when combined with increasingly easy-to-use treatment planning, lets dentists offer things like clear aligners, implants or complex restorations to their patients. This is better for the patient and better for the economics and efficiency of the practice. 
Dentsply Sirona is uniquely suited to thrive in this market. We have both Imaging and digital impression businesses that form the foundation of the digital ecosystem. When combined with our treatment center business, we have one of the largest installed bases of digital assets in all of dental, a critical cornerstone for our strategy going forward. The company has deep expertise in treatment planning and workflow management with well-recognized names like SureSmile, Sidexis, Atlantis, SIMPLANT and CEREC. And Dentsply Sirona has a full portfolio of essential consumable products that are critical components in many major procedures. The large installed digital base powered by a suite of treatment planning and other workflow tools, combined with these essential products, make us very optimistic that we can deliver real solutions to our customers. 
In addition to delivering against that strategy, we will measure our success by meeting or exceeding critical targets that we have set for ourselves. Our growth is now targeted at 4% to 5% plus going forward. We are committed to improving our margin to reach the '22 goal by the end of 2020. Our efforts around organization simplification and scale will allow us to hit the cost-saving target of $250 million through the end of the restructuring plan. Delivering on our growth, margin and organizational saving goals will allow us to target double-digit adjusted EPS growth and create sustainable value for our shareholders. 
Moving to Slide 16. There are 3 components of our growth plans, organic innovation, acquisitions and improving our global commercial capabilities. We are investing increased time, financial resources and human capital to accelerate our organic innovation. 
Our innovation approach has been revamped to focus on procedures and workflows versus individual product. This allows us to better meet our customer needs. 
As Jorge said, R&D investment has been increased significantly in 2021, and we expect that trend to continue into the future. The increased resources will be directed to critical procedure workflows in faster-growing areas like clear aligners, implants, restorations and endodontics. 
To further demonstrate our commitment to innovation, I mentioned during our last call, a new consumables innovation center will be opened this year in Charlotte to complement our other Centers of Excellence around the world. Our portfolio work will also give Dentsply Sirona a greater exposure to faster-growing parts of the market while eliminating slower growth, less profitable areas. 
In the past 12 months, analog lab and the traditional orthodontic businesses were exited. We deployed capital and added BYTE and Datum to boost our clear aligner and implant platforms, respectively, increasing our presence in higher growth categories. Our team also has a good pipeline of opportunities to continue enhancing our workflow solutions and digital technologies. 
Critical to innovation is the ability to rapidly scale and globalize it. Dentsply Sirona has an extensive network of over 5,000 commercial people in over 100 countries that will allow us to take full advantage of our innovation pipeline. There have been several investments made to enhance our commercial effectiveness. These investments include tools like salesforce.com globally. We have improved our training program to allow Dentsply Sirona to approach our customers as one company with comprehensive solutions. And our sales force excellence program is being rolled out globally over the remainder of this year. As Jorge mentioned, there's also been good progress made on shifting our promotional program to be more retail demand focused. In addition, all these efforts are supported by an extensive clinical education program that has engaged over 1 million dental professionals over the last year. 
The highlight of our clinical education efforts in 2021 will be DS World, a major event in the U.S. We have announced that this event will be a hybrid this year with a major live as well as online component. 
On Slide 17, our major introductions over the past few years are displayed. We are seeing the benefits of those efforts in 2021 with products like SureFil 1, Primemill, Axeos and a major SureSmile software upgrade. The team is also very excited about our back half of 2021, where we will see major launches in several critical areas, including implants and endodontics. 
Moving to Slide 18. Strategic acquisitions are important to our overall growth plan. As we've now had BYTE for about 5 months, we are very happy to report that the integration is on track. BYTE is performing well, and we believe it has a very bright future. That business is expected to be accretive to our long-term financial targets and non-GAAP EPS in 2021. 
The acquisition has also given our clear aligner business important critical mass in areas like supply chain and R&D. We continue to expect our total clear aligner business to exceed a $300 million run rate by the end of 2021. We're also pleased with the integration of the Datum acquisition as well. This is helping improve our critical implant platform. 
Moving to Slide 19. In closing, the dental market continues to demonstrate resilience and the strong underlying fundamentals that make it attractive. We are pleased with our performance this quarter. It should be noted that there remains some uncertainty around the continued impact of the pandemic and the recovery will not be uniform across the globe. 
Despite all this, though, we expect to see a continued gradual improvement in the overall dental market. As the recovery continues, the company expects to increase investment to support our growth initiatives throughout the year to drive growth rate. We believe that there are many lessons learned during the pandemic that will help us operate more efficiently going forward. And like we've seen this quarter, Dentsply Sirona is well positioned to capitalize on the continued recovery. 
And with that, I will turn the call back to Kari. 
Thank you."

It sounds like the market improved kind of more than you anticipated, and you definitely highlighted the broad-based strength that you saw in the quarter. How do you think this plays out over the balance of the year? It doesn't look like you've really changed your revenue assumptions for future quarters despite the strength you've seen in the first quarter. So just -- can you help us think about just revenue cadence over the balance of the year?"

Listen, if you go back, we -- a quarter ago, we decided to provide guidance because we believe in our ability to execute, and we were optimistic about the recovery in the dental markets. 
I think Q1 confirmed that. It came in a little bit better than what we thought. Clearly, that gives us confidence for the rest of the year. As a result, we actually increased the bottom of the range of our revenue by $100 million when you think about it. And our -- the better-than-expected revenue for us in the first quarter was not $100 million. It was less than that. 
So we are reflecting our higher level of confidence in the rest of the year based on that change, and also all the other changes that we did with our guidance. We still think that the second half of the year is going to be a little bit higher than the first half. That is consistent with historical patterns. I think in the past, if you go back several years, what you see is that the first half is typically 47% of the total year. 
This time, we think the first half is going to be a little bit higher than that, but not much higher. So all of the risks and opportunities that we talk about in our prepared remarks, are factor into that. But net-net, we are more optimistic about the revenue for the year. That's why we are raising our overall guidance. There are risks that we have to be mindful of, but we are optimistic about the future."

As you know, we don't guide gross margin rate because, similar to SG&A, both fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. We had a great mix. Consumables -- the consumables growth of 21.5%, that certainly contributed significantly to the strong margin rate in the quarter. 
So there are other things going on with the gross margin rate. So those are temporary in nature or fluctuating in nature, if you will. In our gross margin rate, we are also seeing the benefits of many of the restructuring initiatives and portfolio optimization initiatives that we have executed over the last couple of years. So I think that is very important. But we prefer to think in terms of the operating profit margin because it captures the fluctuations in gross margin and SG&A at the same time. 
And what I can tell you is, based on the good margin rate -- gross margin rate in Q1, based on our expectations for the rest of the year, we are very much on track to delivering the 21% operating profit margin that we have committed to delivering at the end of this year. So that is, for us, the most important metric. As things move around, there will be fluctuations between gross margin and SG&A, but again, targeting a good strong 21% operating profit margin."

I would tell you the One DS program is performing like we had hoped As we get into the back half of the year, we'll probably tweak that again to reflect what did we learn in the first half of the year. So we think there's some opportunities there. You correctly captured the fact that we're beginning to do the trade-in program around the world. And then whether it's directly digital or not, the clear aligner business is really an important component of that. We've been very happy with how SureSmile has been performing. I mean obviously, BYTE has been a terrific addition. And we think, obviously, we are very happy with how that's performing and the runway in front of that. 
But a SureSmile is tightly integrated with Primescan, and we feel that, that integration really lets dentist practice clear aligners pretty easily. We're pretty optimistic that, that business is gaining steam, and we think that's going to be a nice addition and a nice way to accelerate our presence with CEREC. 
So look, as you think about the cadence, I'm not going to tell you quarter to quarter to quarter, but I certainly think the back half, we're pretty excited about what we're offering, and we're excited about the promotional juice that we have. And we think as SureSmile gets bigger and stronger, that's an obvious benefit. That reflects what we think will reflect well on Primescan."

So our research when we were looking at BYTE, they told us there were going to be some people who like BYTE and some people don't. I mean the people who are in the clear aligner business think having another clear aligner brand that's driving general patient demand is a good thing. People who don't necessarily like clear aligners, whether they're going through the dentist office or not, don't. 
We haven't seen a whole lot of movement from that. But that being said, look, we're 5 months in, and they're seeing good benefit on SureSmile. We continue to improve things like customer service and delivery times, and we actually opened a large manufacturing facility that's really beginning to benefit us on the SureSmile side. And they're excited about what that means. And most of them are taking a wait and see when are you guys going to begin to bring a BYTE offering into the dentist office. For us, it's less about the BYTE offering than it is about the BYTE patients who aren't necessarily eligible for a Class 1 treatment -- beyond a Class I treatment. 
Again, if we get 1 million unique visitors into the BYTE universe, and half of them are eligible for Class 1, where the other half going? How we deliver on that becomes a really important part of how we think about BYTE. But it's not top of mind when we go into most on this office, and we're excited. 
Look, we've been working hard on how that integration is going to work in front of the dentist. And again, we're pretty excited about what that can be. And just a little side note. One thing we mentioned when we did the acquisition, critical mass in R&D and critical mass and supply chain is important, and we're seeing that. 
All of a sudden, if there's an innovation that you could bring to BYTE, can you bring that to SureSmile? Can we learn something from BYTE to put on SureSmile? Or stuff that we can learn from SureSmile and put on BYTE, and that's going on, and that's proved beneficial to us. And look, we -- as you can tell, we're reaffirming the fact that we think our clear aligner franchise is going to be delivering on run rate basis in excess of $300 million as we exit the year. So we're -- you can tell we're pretty bullish on our clear aligner business."

First, look, the ADA came out yesterday and was talking, they're kind of at that magic 90% level. I would tell you, we tend to think the more productive practices may be a little bit higher than that. I'd also tell you, it's different in different parts of the world. If you look at Asia Pacific, you look at China, Japan, they're a little bit depressed, but they're better than what we see in North America. And then Europe is a little bit uneven. 
There are parts of Europe that are kind of in -- above the 90% level. But there's no place around the world right now that we see absolute patient volume traffic exceeding pre pandemic levels. In some places, it gets close. That being said, the thing that's really kind of continued driving a lot of volume for us and others, you look like the implant businesses across all the dental competitors. You can see that more complex procedures continue to be a trend that you see. 
And the dentists we talk to -- and it's nice, by the way, we're starting to be able to talk to a lot more people face-to-face, is that they learned. I mean they learned during -- over the last year that I can do clear aligners, I can do a little bit more complex implants. And we feel that's a really good trend for us long term because the minute they recognize that they need to add and stay doing these more complex procedures, because it's generating a higher revenue per patient than what they saw pre pandemic, they tend to be pretty interested in digital equipment. So we like that. 
And then just in terms of dealer orders, Tycho, it's interesting. I would tell you the -- we all learned over the course of the pandemic how much inventory do we really need. I tend to think the dealers, while they're getting a little bit more aggressive right now. I don't think that the absolute level of inventory they're going to hold is going to go back to pre pandemic levels. It might get near, but they've learned we're a pretty efficient supplier. How much do they need to carry upfront. And I don't want to speak for those guys, but I -- what we're seeing is, yes, we're good orders. How much are they going to come back? All the way back? We don't know. But we're very happy with what the trend we're seeing right now."

We said last quarter that Q1 is typically, from a revenue perspective, the weakest quarter. And we also said that the operating profit margin was going to be a few points below what we experienced in Q4. As we said in our prepared remarks, and I think you have seen this across the board, the industry overall bounced back faster than what we were expecting in the first quarter. And as we were planning for spending patterns and investments in the first quarter, we were cautious and we thought that we needed to manage investment for a certain amount of revenue. And as we were getting closer to the end of the quarter, we realized the industry was coming back faster. 
So as a result of that, I think the margin rate in Q1 was much higher than what you would normally see in a typical first quarter. We clearly continue to see the benefits from structural changes that we have made as well. So we are very much on track to achieving the savings that we committed to delivering by the end of '21, beginning of '22. 
In the first quarter, we realized further savings in the restructuring plan of close to $16 million. And the company continues to operate very lean and efficiently. I think there's typical expenses that we used to incur that -- because people are not traveling and events are very limited. None of that spend is happening yet. And so all of those factors contributed to a very strong operating profit margin rate in the quarter. 
As we look forward, we believe we will maintain a healthy margin rate. We're very much on track to get into the 21% rate by the end of this year. We will have to make some investments that we didn't make in the first quarter. I mentioned in my prepared remarks how we shifted -- we are shifting at least $0.05 from the first quarter into the remainder of the year. And those 5 pennies are very specifically linked to projects that we know we are already executing on, but they were not executed entirely in the first quarter. 
So that's how I would describe the performance from a rate perspective. I think the second part of your question was about the 2 segments and how the rates -- the margin rate for both segments. Clearly, the operating leverage that we have in Consumables is much, much higher than Technology & Equipment. The mix in Q1 was very strong on the Consumables side, and that certainly helped tremendously with the strong gross margin rate and operating profit margin rate. 
As we go throughout the year, we expect Consumables to remain healthy. But as Don indicated, actually in the prior question, the cadence of our Technology & Equipment should improve throughout the year. And that kind of balances the mix and the rate a little bit. So hopefully, that answers your question."

So that's 1 of the reasons we kind of bifurcated our approach with Primescan, there was -- obviously, there's a full chairside, but we were selling a unit that didn't come with the software that let it become instantly chairside, and we've seen good growth there. 
So the art form for us is how do we continue driving our DI presence aggressively and then over time, shift those people up to chairside. So as we look out over 2021 and probably beyond that, we expect to see the DI side of the business growing faster than the chairside. But then what we're effectively doing is creating an installed base where we can go right back in and sell them -- the advantage of chairside right after that. So it -- you may see a little bit of a lag in how fast chairside grows. 
But in aggregate, we expect CEREC to grow quite nicely over the course of 2021 and beyond."

We tend to -- we've been doing well in kind of these midsized DSOs. But we've been very competitive in some of the larger DSOs with both -- some of our digital entries around Primescan as well as SureSmile.

But not -- no big change in strategy, and we feel we've done pretty well in DSOs without necessarily calling okay, what went on at Aspen, what went on Heartland, bang, bang, bang all the way down the line.

As I indicated before, margins are going to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter depending on mix, depending on the cadence of investments and other things. Overall, what we're expecting and that's what we're reflecting in our numbers is that we will be around the 21% level for the remainder of the year. We're trying to balance a number of things for us. Starting with the top line, we want to make -- we want to deliver in the short term, which we are. We also want to make investments to ensure that we actually hit the 4% to 5% top line growth rate that we're targeting. So that's going to require investments, and they will happen throughout the year. 
Our restructuring projects continue to deliver. Those will -- some of them require investments that have paybacks a few quarters later. So all of those things contribute to some fluctuation throughout the year. If Q4 turns out to be a very high quarter from a revenue perspective, it's possible that the operating profit margin will be over 21%. On average, that's what we are modeling for the year, and that is consistent with our goals for this year and is consistent with our goal of achieving 22% as we go into '22. So to get to 22% next year, there are some investments we have to make this year. And so we have to balance all of those priorities for the company."

We were kind of in a little bit of a unique situation where we had a very strong DS World in Q4 2019, and we were somewhat limited from a supply chain perspective. So there was a lot of movement from Q4 into Q1, creating a pretty tough comp for us. All that being said, relative to where we are in the recovery and what we're seeing in terms of interest from dentists literally on a global basis, we feel digital dentistry is doing pretty well. And we feel that, again, the thing that we've seen coming out of the pandemic is a lot more interest in, I would say, more complex procedures with 2D, 3D. Remember, digital dentistry isn't just all CEREC. For us, it also talk about imaging 2D, 3D and cone beam. You're seeing a lot more interest in complex procedure and the digital assets make that diagnosis. a lot easier and the treatment planning works pretty well for those guys. 
So overall, look, as you see clear aligners, as you see implants move, a lot of that's being powered by these much more sophisticated digital diagnosis and treatment planning. And as a result, you're seeing good solid demand in digital dentistry. And some of that's obscured in our case, around a comp that was specifically unique to Q1 2020."

So yes, it's really important to us as we think about how do we maintain high Net Promoter Scores and how do we create the brands that we feel we want, which in our mind is, again, we're reaching out to a segment of the population that has not necessarily come into the dentist office and tends to be a little younger, and they don't necessarily have a specific relationship with a dentist. So we -- as we think about how do we attract those patients correctly, put them in, are they eligible for Class I, and we want to maintain a really strong relationship with that patient, and we do. We've got a fantastic operation out in Salt Lake City. It's one of the treats that we -- when we go visit our t9 team, we get to go out there.

Is there some upside? Perhaps. But it's early to start counting on things like that. We need to keep working on the integration. Integrating new companies, especially companies that are relatively young, takes time, and it takes investment and it takes a lot of effort from the entire organization.

In terms of Primemill, look, we're really early in Primemill. I mean kind of the bummer for us is we launched it and then we go into the pandemic. But the economics of full chairside dentistry still are very, very attractive to the individual dentists, and that's something that we absolutely sell. So one of the reasons we're as comfortable as we say we are in terms of let's drive some DI is because that's a great upgrade opportunity in our mind. Let the dentist get comfortable with DI and then let's go sell them on the benefits of chairside. So we're very bullish on Primemill. I mean first -- and I know, Jeff, we actually had the opportunity to actually show you this. I mean look, we're basically scanning and delivering a really accurate, well-made crown in under an hour. with full chairside with Primemill, given the speed. 
And now that we've got our blocks and we're super excited about what that means as a total integrated system. So look, I would tell you, Primemill, very early game, very early in the process. We are very, very bullish on what Primemill can be. And look, if this winds up that we expand our overall digital footprint starting with the scan by 15%, 20% over time. And they don't necessarily buy mills the first time. Believe me, there will be somebody knocking on their door to sell them a Primemill not too far down the line because the economics are really, really compelling.

We believe that non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about financial performance of our business, enable the comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independently of business performance and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business. Please refer to our press release for the reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results.
And with that, I'd like to now turn the call over to Don Casey, our Chief Executive Officer."

I hope you're all safe and well.
We are pleased with our performance this quarter. Dental market continues to show a gradual recovery, highlighting its underlying strength and attractiveness. Dentists have shown real resilience and a commitment to their patients during the pandemic and now in the recovery. And we are very proud of how our team has continued to support our customers as patient volumes have improved. I want to thank all the Dentsply Sirona employees around the globe. Their performance has been remarkable. They've kept our workplaces safe and operating. They've delivered for our customers, and have kept making progress on key company initiatives. It is a privilege to be part of this organization.
On today's call, Jorge and I will focus on 3 things. The first is our results for the quarter. That will be followed by a revised guidance for 2021, and we will finish the call updating our operating priorities with a focus on our long-term growth plans.
Now moving to Slide 6. We are pleased with our performance in the first quarter. Revenues reached $1.027 billion, up 12.1% on an organic basis. In the first quarter, we continued to be disciplined around expenses, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 21.3%, up 630 basis points versus the prior year.
Adjusted non-GAAP EPS in was $0.72, up 67% versus last year. Other actions taken by the team helped generate positive cash flow from operations of $49 million.
To provide details of our performance for the quarter, I will now turn the call over to Jorge."

As a reminder, my remarks this morning will be based on non-GAAP financial results.
Let me start with a few overall comments. In the first quarter, we delivered strong results, reflecting growth on both Consumables and Technologies & Equipment. These results were ahead of our internal financial expectations, owing to a stronger-than-anticipated recovery in global dental demand. We expect the macro environment to remain uncertain, but our focus on execution and our ability to adapt ensure that we will be well positioned against multiple scenarios.
We are seeing the global dental markets gain traction, and our teams are executing well, utilizing the strength of our portfolio for the benefit of our customers. Q1 performance confirms the momentum in our business and provides a solid starting point for the fiscal year.
Let's look at Q1 in more detail. As Don mentioned, the business delivered strong organic revenue growth of 12.1% versus last year. Our reported growth was 17.5%. Consumables posted organic growth of 21.2% in the first quarter versus last year.
As a reminder, our PPE business is immaterial. Sales across all product categories rebounded in the quarter. These results reinforce our view of dentistry as a necessity with resilient underlying growth trends.
Technologies & Equipment organic sales grew 5.8% versus last year, led by Equipment, Imaging and implants. Gross profit was $611 million or 59.5% of sales. This strong outcome was primarily driven by favorable mix. While we saw higher shipping costs, our execution and supply chain initiatives largely offset the impact. It is likely that higher shipping costs and other inflationary items in the supply chain will persist for the next few quarters. Our teams will continue to address these challenges as effectively as possible.
Before I start discussing the specific SG&A numbers, I would like to underline a presentation change that you will see going forward. As we continue to ramp up investments for innovation and growth, we will report R&D spend on our P&L separately from SG&A. You will see, in our quarterly results, we've made this change on the face of our financial statements.
Spending on R&D was up 8.8% in the quarter to $37 million, and we would expect to see this trend continue as we progress through the year. As we invest more significantly in R&D, we are making sure we have the right mechanisms to maximize the benefit of the spend by ensuring alignment with the strategic priorities and a strong return on investment. We are focused on scale innovation that has the ability to drive a meaningful growth impact for the business and many opportunities remain.
Regarding SG&A in Q1, our teams demonstrated a strong operating discipline across the enterprise. As a percent of sales, SG&A declined 350 basis points to 34.6% versus last year. On an absolute basis, SG&A increased by $22 million or 6.6% versus the prior year. The reduction in the Q1 SG&A ratio reflects benefits from volume-related operating leverage, improvement in productivity and benefits from our 3-year restructuring projects.
Also, we were cautious on our investment spend approach in the first quarter. Going forward, we will accelerate the pace of those investments, which we will discuss later. While we have been measured on our spending in certain categories, we are ramping up investments in sales and marketing resources, R&D and digital infrastructure to support our medium- and long-term growth plans.
Operating profit grew over 67.2% compared to last year to $219 million. It represents a margin expansion of 630 basis points to 21.3%. As explained earlier, our margin rate benefited from the gross profit margin on sales mix, combined with operating leverage and investment spending increasing at a lower rate than our sales growth.
Moving on, net interest and other expense increased $9 million, reflecting higher levels of debt versus last year. The non-GAAP tax rate in the first quarter was 22.9%, a decrease compared to 24.6% in the prior year quarter, which was a function of the changes in the U.S. versus non-U.S. pretax income mix.
Non-GAAP EPS was $0.72, up 67.4% versus the prior year quarter. The Consumables business performed -- the Consumable business performance in the first quarter was strong. Sales were $430 million, an increase of 21.5% versus the prior year.
Growth was the strongest in Rest of the World and grew double digits in both the U.S. and Europe. Sales grew in all categories, led by Endo and Restorative. The Consumables market has been resilient and is recovering well.
These results also reflect the ongoing progress optimizing promotional strategies and improving demand creation tools. We are strengthening our relationships with dentists, delivering clinically relevant products with strong incentives for them. We are, of course, also seeing a rebound in dealer orders as they ramp up purchases to meet anticipated demand. Currency favorably impacted sales by 4.6%, offset by a reduction of 4.3% due to divestitures and discontinued products.
Moving on to the Technologies & Equipment segment results. T&E sales grew 14.8% versus the prior year. The launch of our new Axeos imaging unit is going very well. As expected, digital dentistry was negatively impacted by the difficult CAD/CAM comp in Q1, resulting from the strong sales in early 2020.
Our Clear Aligners franchise performed very well in the quarter, and the overall SureSmile and Byte teams are excited about the growth trajectory. Our estimates indicate that our clear aligners portfolio will deliver in excess of $300 million in annual run rate sales in the fourth quarter of 2021. Currency favorably impacted sales by 5.7% as well as the benefit from acquisitions of 8.6%, offset by a reduction of 5.3% due to divestitures and discontinued products.
On Slide 11, you can see our organic revenue performance by region during the first quarter. U.S. sales were $347 million, representing growth of 15.7% versus last year. Organic sales growth was 4.8%, with strong Consumables sales offsetting a decline in Technologies & Equipment. European sales were $418 million, a growth of 12.1% versus last year. Organic growth was 8.1% compared to the prior year, driven mostly by strong Endo sales. Rest of the World sales were $262 million, a growth of 30.3% versus last year. Organic sales growth was 30.8%, reflecting the recovery in demand.
Next, I'd like to cover cash flows. In the first quarter of 2021, our operating cash flow was $49 million, a $59 million improvement versus last year. We returned a total of $112 million to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks and deployed $92 million to fund the acquisition of Datum. The company finished this first quarter with strong cash on hand of $318 million and committed credit facilities of another $1 billion. Approximately $350 million of short-term credit facilities expired in April and were not renewed. Our strong balance sheet and credit metrics provide a solid foundation for a balanced capital allocation. We will continue to return cash to shareholders while appropriately investing for growth in the business.
Now let me provide an update on our financial expectations for 2021. We were pleased to see a faster-than-anticipated market recovery in the first quarter. We are seeing healthy demand continuing into the second quarter, driven by positive momentum in patient confidence and procedure volumes with the vaccine rollouts. These positive trends provide us with optimism for the rest of the year. At the same time, we remain cautious given the market conditions in certain geographies. While there may be near-term volatility, the long-term underlying growth dynamics of the dental market remain intact.
Based on that, we are revising our outlook for fiscal 2021. We are now expecting fiscal 2021 reported sales to be in the $4.1 billion to $4.3 billion range. This range equates to a reported sales growth rate of approximately 23% to 30%. From an organic sales perspective, the range provided equates to an organic growth rate of approximately 18% to 25%.
Our new non-GAAP EPS range for fiscal '21 is now $2.75 to $2.90 compared to our prior outlook of $2.60 to $2.80. This full year outlook includes the shift of investment spend of approximately $0.05 from Q1 into the remainder of the year.
There are 2 risks to this outlook that are worth highlighting: COVID-19 and potential supply disruptions regarding shipping costs and availability of certain semiconductors. We are mindful of the lessons learned about this virus, especially considering that some countries are experiencing increases in cases, with governments intervening with restrictions.
Before I turn the call back to Don, we would like to share a quick update on our efforts around ESG. We continue to believe a strong ESG program can facilitate top line growth and reduce costs. It can contribute to reducing legal and regulatory risks, while improving employee engagement. In close collaboration with our Board of Directors, I'm chairing an effort with members of a cross-functional team to ensure that our ESG objectives are aligned with our purpose and mission of improving access to oral health care globally.
In April, we posted our first-ever sustainability flag sheet and environmental scorecard. They are available for review on the Sustainability section on our website. We are measuring and analyzing our ESG data. I'm excited to share more of our findings with you as we develop and track additional metrics.
Finally, I want to thank our almost 15,000 associates around the globe for their great ongoing dedication and results.
With that, I will now turn the call back to Don."

Our strategy and priorities have been consistent over the past 3 years. We believe that Dentsp",1250,"Thanks, Jorge. I would now like to provide some perspective around 2021 and beyond, by outlining our strategy and operating priorities.
Let's move to Slide 15. Our strategy and priorities have been consistent over the past 3 years. We believe that Dentsply Sirona will grow long term by delivering superior integrated workflows built on diagnostic excellence, easy-to-use treatment planning and essential products that improve outcomes for patients and dental professionals.
Our priorities are driving revenue growth, improving margins and creating a simplified organization that takes advantage of scale. There's still a lot of work to be done, but our team is confident that the margin and cost-saving goals we have outlined in the past will be delivered. For us, the focus now really turns to accelerating growth.
Our strategy has been refined to reflect the continued evolution of the dental space. There has been a strong growth in specific segments of the market, highlighted by aesthetic areas like clear aligners and implants. Many of these higher-growth areas have been enabled by digital dentistry, driving good growth there. Dentists and DSOs increasingly look to enhance their practices by participating in these higher-growth areas that involve more complex procedures. This leads to an increased willingness to invest in equipment and training both areas where Dentsply Sirona is a leader. Products like 2D and 3D imaging become essential to improving their diagnostic capabilities.
More practices are also recognizing the utility of incorporating digital scanners as an essential part of their office workflow. These more sophisticated digital devices, when combined with increasingly easy-to-use treatment planning, lets dentists offer things like clear aligners, implants or complex restorations to their patients. This is better for the patient and better for the economics and efficiency of the practice.
Dentsply Sirona is uniquely suited to thrive in this market. We have both Imaging and digital impression businesses that form the foundation of the digital ecosystem. When combined with our treatment center business, we have one of the largest installed bases of digital assets in all of dental, a critical cornerstone for our strategy going forward.
The company has deep expertise in treatment planning and workflow management with well-recognized names like SureSmile, Sidexis, Atlantis, SIMPLANT and CEREC. And Dentsply Sirona has a full portfolio of essential consumable products that are critical components in many major procedures. The large installed digital base powered by a suite of treatment planning and other workflow tools, combined with these essential products, make us very optimistic that we can deliver real solutions to our customers.
In addition to delivering against that strategy, we will measure our success by meeting or exceeding critical targets that we have set for ourselves. Our growth is now targeted at 4% to 5% plus going forward. We are committed to improving our margin to reach the '22 goal by the end of 2020. Our efforts around organization simplification and scale will allow us to hit the cost-saving target of $250 million through the end of the restructuring plan. Delivering on our growth, margin and organizational saving goals will allow us to target double-digit adjusted EPS growth and create sustainable value for our shareholders.
Moving to Slide 16. There are 3 components of our growth plans: organic innovation, acquisitions and improving our global commercial capabilities. We are investing increased time, financial resources and human capital to accelerate our organic innovation. Our innovation approach has been revamped to focus on procedures and workflows versus individual product. This allows us to better meet our customer needs.
As Jorge said, R&D investment has been increased significantly in 2021, and we expect that trend to continue into the future. The increased resources will be directed to critical procedure workflows in faster-growing areas like clear aligners, implants, restorations and endodontics.
To further demonstrate our commitment to innovation, I mentioned during our last call, a new consumables innovation center will be opened this year in Charlotte to complement our other centers of excellence around the world. Our portfolio work will also give Dentsply Sirona a greater exposure to faster-growing parts of the market while eliminating slower growth, less profitable areas.
In the past 12 months, analog lab and the traditional orthodontic businesses were exited. We deployed capital and added Byte and Datum to boost our clear aligner and implant platforms, respectively, increasing our presence in higher growth categories. Our team also has a good pipeline of opportunities to continue enhancing our workflow solutions and digital technologies.
Critical to innovation is the ability to rapidly scale and globalize it. Dentsply Sirona has an extensive network of over 5,000 commercial people in over 100 countries that will allow us to take full advantage of our innovation pipeline. There have been several investments made to enhance our commercial effectiveness. These investments include tools like salesforce.com globally. We have improved our training program to allow Dentsply Sirona to approach our customers as one company with comprehensive solutions. And our sales force excellence program is being rolled out globally over the remainder of this year.
As Jorge mentioned, there's also been good progress made on shifting our promotional program to be more retail demand focused. In addition, all these efforts are supported by an extensive clinical education program that has engaged over 1 million dental professionals over the last year.
The highlight of our clinical education efforts in 2021 will be DS World, a major event in the U.S. We have announced that this event will be a hybrid this year with a major live as well as online component.
On Slide 17, our major introductions over the past few years are displayed. We are seeing the benefits of those efforts in 2021 with products like SureFil one, Primemill, Axeos and a major SureSmile software upgrade. The team is also very excited about our back half of 2021, where we will see major launches in several critical areas, including implants and endodontics.
Moving to Slide 18. Strategic acquisitions are important to our overall growth plan. As we've now had Byte for about 5 months, we are very happy to report that the integration is on track. Byte is performing well, and we believe it has a very bright future. That business is expected to be accretive to our long-term financial targets and non-GAAP EPS in 2021.
The acquisition has also given our clear aligner business important critical mass in areas like supply chain and R&D. We continue to expect our total clear aligner business to exceed a $300 million run rate by the end of 2021. We're also pleased with the integration of the Datum acquisition as well. This is helping improve our critical implant platform.
Moving to Slide 19. In closing, the dental market continues to demonstrate resilience and the strong underlying fundamentals that make it attractive. We are pleased with our performance this quarter. It should be noted that there remains some uncertainty around the continued impact of the pandemic and the recovery will not be uniform across the globe.
Despite all this, though, we expect to see a continued gradual improvement in the overall dental market. As the recovery continues, the company expects to increase investment to support our growth initiatives throughout the year to drive growth rate. We believe that there are many lessons learned during the pandemic that will help us operate more efficiently going forward. And as we've seen this quarter, Dentsply Sirona is well positioned to capitalize on the continued recovery.
And with that, I will turn the call back to Kari. Thank you."

Listen, if you go back, we -- a quarter ago, we decided to provide guidance because we believe in our ability to execute, and we were optimistic about the recovery in the dental markets.
I think Q1 confirmed that. It came in a little bit better than what we thought. Clearly, that gives us confidence for the rest of the year. As a result, we actually increased the bottom of the range of our revenue by $100 million when you think about it. And our -- the better-than-expected revenue for us in the first quarter was not $100 million. It was less than that.
So we are reflecting our higher level of confidence in the rest of the year based on that change, and also all the other changes that we did with our guidance. We still think that the second half of the year is going to be a little bit higher than the first half. That is consistent with historical patterns. I think in the past, if you go back several years, what you see is that the first half is typically 47% of the total year.
This time, we think the first half is going to be a little bit higher than that, but not much higher. So all of the risks and opportunities, that we talk about in our prepared remarks, are factor into that. But net-net, we are more optimistic about the revenue for the year. That's why we are raising our overall guidance. There are risks that we have to be mindful of, but we are optimistic about the future."

Consumables -- the consumables growth of 21.5%, that certainly contributed significantly to the strong margin rate in the quarter.
So there are other things going on with the gross margin rate. So those are temporary in nature or fluctuating in nature, if you will. In our gross margin rate, we are also seeing the benefits of many of the restructuring initiatives and portfolio optimization initiatives that we have executed over the last couple of years. So I think that is very important. But we prefer to think in terms of the operating profit margin because it captures the fluctuations in gross margin and SG&A at the same time.
And what I can tell you is, based on the good margin rate -- gross margin rate in Q1, based on our expectations for the rest of the year, we are very much on track to delivering the 21% operating profit margin that we have committed to delivering at the end of this year. So that is, for us, the most important metric. As things move around, there will be fluctuations between gross margin and SG&A, but again, targeting a good strong 21% operating profit margin."

I mean obviously, Byte has been a terrific addition. And we think, obviously, we are very happy with how that's performing and the runway in front of that.
But SureSmile is tightly integrated with Primescan, and we feel that, that integration really lets dentist practice clear aligners pretty easily. We're pretty optimistic that, that business is gaining steam, and we think that's going to be a nice addition and a nice way to accelerate our presence with CEREC.
So look, as you think about the cadence, I'm not going to tell you quarter to quarter to quarter, but I certainly think the back half, we're pretty excited about what we're offering, and we're excited about the promotional juice that we have.

But that being said, look, we're 5 months in, and they're seeing good benefit on SureSmile. We continue to improve things like customer service and delivery times, and we actually opened a large manufacturing facility that's really beginning to benefit us on the SureSmile side. And they're excited about what that means. And most of them are taking a wait and see when are you guys going to begin to bring a Byte offering into the dentist office. For us, it's less about the Byte offering than it is about the Byte patients who aren't necessarily eligible for a Class 1 treatment -- beyond a Class I treatment.
Again, if we get 1 million unique visitors into the Byte universe, and half of them are eligible for Class 1, where the other half going? How we deliver on that becomes a really important part of how we think about Byte. But it's not top of mind when we go into most dentists office, and we're excited.
Look, we've been working hard on how that integration is going to work in front of the dentist. And again, we're pretty excited about what that can be. And just a little side note. One thing we mentioned when we did the acquisition, critical mass in R&D and critical mass in supply chain is important, and we're seeing that.
All of a sudden, if there's an innovation that you could bring to Byte, can you bring that to SureSmile? Can we learn something from Byte to put on SureSmile? Is there stuff that we can learn from SureSmile and put on Byte? And that's going on, and that's proved beneficial to us. And look, we -- as you can tell, we're reaffirming the fact that we think our clear aligner franchise is going to be delivering on run rate basis in excess of $300 million as we exit the year. So we're -- you can tell we're pretty bullish on our clear aligner business."

First, look, the ADA came out yesterday and was talking, they're kind of at that magic 90% level. I would tell you, we tend to think the more productive practices may be a little bit higher than that. I'd also tell you, it's different in different parts of the world. If you look at Asia Pacific, you look at China, Japan, they're a little bit depressed, but they're better than what we see in North America. And then Europe is a little bit uneven.
There are parts of Europe that are kind of in above the 90% level. But there's no place around the world right now that we see absolute patient volume traffic exceeding pre-pandemic levels. In some places, it gets close. That being said, the thing that's really kind of continued driving a lot of volume for us and others, you look like the implant businesses across all the dental competitors. You can see that more complex procedures continue to be a trend that you see.
And the dentists we talk to -- and it's nice, by the way, we're starting to be able to talk to a lot more people face-to-face, is that they learned. I mean they learned during -- over the last year that I can do clear aligners, I can do a little bit more complex implants. And we feel that's a really good trend for us long term because the minute they recognize that they need to add and stay doing these more complex procedures, because it's generating a higher revenue per patient than what they saw pre pandemic, they tend to be pretty interested in digital equipment. So we like that.
And then just in terms of dealer orders, Tycho, it's interesting. I would tell you the -- we all learned over the course of the pandemic how much inventory do we really need. I tend to think the dealers, while they're getting a little bit more aggressive right now, I don't think that the absolute level of inventory they're going to hold is going to go back to pre-pandemic levels. It might get near, but they've learned. We're a pretty efficient supplier. How much do they need to carry upfront. And I don't want to speak for those guys, but I -- what we're seeing is, yes, we're good orders. How much are they going to come back? All the way back? We don't know. But we're very happy with what the trend we're seeing right now."

We said last quarter that Q1 is typically, from a revenue perspective, the weakest quarter. And we also said that the operating profit margin was going to be a few points below what we experienced in Q4. As we said in our prepared remarks, and I think you have seen this across the board, the industry overall bounced back faster than what we were expecting in the first quarter. And as we were planning for spending patterns and investments in the first quarter, we were cautious and we thought that we needed to manage investment for a certain amount of revenue. And as we were getting closer to the end of the quarter, we realized the industry was coming back faster.
So as a result of that, I think the margin rate in Q1 was much higher than what you would normally see in a typical first quarter. We clearly continue to see the benefits from structural changes that we have made as well. So we are very much on track to achieving the savings that we committed to delivering by the end of '21, beginning of '22.
In the first quarter, we realized further savings in the restructuring plan of close to $16 million. And the company continues to operate very lean and efficiently. I think there's typical expenses that we used to incur that -- because people are not traveling and events are very limited. None of that spend is happening yet. And so all of those factors contributed to a very strong operating profit margin rate in the quarter.
As we look forward, we believe we will maintain a healthy margin rate. We're very much on track to get into the 21% rate by the end of this year. We will have to make some investments that we didn't make in the first quarter. I mentioned in my prepared remarks how we shifted -- we are shifting at least $0.05 from the first quarter into the remainder of the year. And those $0.05 are very specifically linked to projects that we know we are already executing on, but they were not executed entirely in the first quarter. So that's how I would describe the performance from a rate perspective.
I think the second part of your question was about the 2 segments and how the rates -- the margin rate for both segments. Clearly, the operating leverage that we have in Consumables is much, much higher than Technology & Equipment. The mix in Q1 was very strong on the Consumables side, and that certainly helped tremendously with the strong gross margin rate and operating profit margin rate. As we go throughout the year, we expect Consumables to remain healthy. But as Don indicated, actually in the prior question, the cadence of our Technology & Equipment should improve throughout the year. And that kind of balances the mix and the rate a little bit. So hopefully, that answers your question."

Chairside was critical to us, and we continue to believe that it's a differentiator for us over the marketplace. We are seeing a trend where there is more interest in stand-alone DI units, and we felt that we were not competitive 2 years ago. So that's one of the reasons we kind of bifurcated our approach with Primescan, there was -- obviously, there's a full chairside, but we were selling a unit that didn't come with the software that let it become instantly chairside, and we've seen good growth there.
So the art form for us is how do we continue driving our DI presence aggressively and then over time, shift those people up to chairside. So as we look out over 2021 and probably beyond that, we expect to see the DI side of the business growing faster than the chairside. But then what we're effectively doing is creating an installed base where we can go right back in and sell them -- the advantage of chairside right after that. So it -- you may see a little bit of a lag in how fast chairside grows. 
But in aggregate, we expect CEREC to grow quite nicely over the course of 2021 and beyond."

Overall, what we're expecting and that's what we're reflecting in our numbers is that we will be around the 21% level for the remainder of the year. We're trying to balance a number of things for us. Starting with the top line, we want to make -- we want to deliver in the short term, which we are. We also want to make investments to ensure that we actually hit the 4% to 5% top line growth rate that we're targeting. So that's going to require investments, and they will happen throughout the year.
Our restructuring projects continue to deliver. Those will -- some of them require investments that have paybacks a few quarters later. So all of those things contribute to some fluctuation throughout the year. If Q4 turns out to be a very high quarter from a revenue perspective, it's possible that the operating profit margin will be over 21%. On average, that's what we are modeling for the year, and that is consistent with our goals for this year and is consistent with our goal of achieving 22% as we go into '22. So to get to 22% next year, there are some investments we have to make this year. And so we have to balance all of those priorities for the company."

All that being said, relative to where we are in the recovery and what we're seeing in terms of interest from dentists literally on a global basis, we feel digital dentistry is doing pretty well.
And we feel that -- again, the thing that we've seen coming out of the pandemic is a lot more interest in, I would say, more complex procedures with 2D, 3D. Remember, digital dentistry isn't just all CEREC. For us, it also talk about imaging 2D, 3D and cone beam. You're seeing a lot more interest in complex procedure and the digital assets make that diagnosis a lot easier and the treatment planning works pretty well for those guys. So overall, look, as you see clear aligners, as you see implants move, a lot of that's being powered by these much more sophisticated digital diagnosis and treatment planning. And as a result, you're seeing good solid demand in digital dentistry. And some of that's obscured in our case around a comp that was specifically unique to Q1 2020."

So yes, it's really important to us as we think about how do we maintain high Net Promoter Scores and how do we create the brands that we feel we want, which in our mind is, again, we're reaching out to a segment of the population that has not necessarily come into the dentist office, tends to be a little younger, and they don't necessarily have a specific relationship with a dentist. So we -- as we think about how do we attract those patients, correctly put them in, are they eligible for Class I, and we want to maintain a really strong relationship with that patient, and we do.

In terms of Primemill, look, we're really early in Primemill. I mean kind of the bummer for us is we launched it and then we go into the pandemic. But the economics of full chairside dentistry still are very, very attractive to the individual dentists, and that's something that we absolutely sell. So one of the reasons we're as comfortable as we say we are in terms of let's drive some DI is because that's a great upgrade opportunity in our mind. Let the dentist get comfortable with DI and then let's go sell them on the benefits of chairside. So we're very bullish on Primemill. I mean first -- and I know, Jeff, we actually had the opportunity to actually show you this. I mean look, we're basically scanning and delivering a really accurate, well-made crown in under an hour with full chairside with Primemill, given the speed.
And now that we've got our Tessera blocks in, we're super excited about what that means as a total integrated system. So look, I would tell you, Primemill, very early game, very early in the process. We are very, very bullish on what Primemill can be. And look, if this winds up that we expand our overall digital footprint starting with the scan by 15%, 20% over time. And they don't necessarily buy mills the first time, believe me, there will be somebody knocking on their door to sell them a Primemill not too far down the line because the economics are really, really compelling. And the patient experience for something like single-visit dentistry or 1-hour dentistry, really good."

I would tell you the resto and the preventive businesses have been, we think, doing well. Our endodontic business, which is large and very, very profitable, we've been very happy with the performance over the last 2 quarters. We're very optimistic that we'll pick up some introductions in the back half of this year, which we think will be important to create some momentum on that business.
And then lab has kind of been a little bit of a challenge for us. There's 2 components. One, we kind of got out of the analog lab business, which was a significant piece, which leaves us the digital lab business. We think over time, that's going to allow us to accelerate growth right there. When you look at stuff like our digital denture program, our 3D printing ingredient, Lucitone, we think we have an opportunity to grow there. So in terms of what we do in the first quarter, where did we gain share? One, wouldn't it be great if we all had some syndicated data, so we can answer this question with some degree of precision? But we're happy with how -- we think we held serve on endo. We think we did pretty well on the rest on the resto and preventive businesses. And lab, it's kind of hard to tell, but we were happy with the performance of that business in the quarter."

In terms of the individual promotions by region, look, there are different parts, we're going to respond competitively as we need to. But by and large, one of the things that our Chief Commercial Officer, Walter Petersohn and Jorge have put in place, we have a pretty disciplined approach to pricing. We don't want one region to get to the point where they're creating a great market opportunity that lets things move around the world.
So I would tell you, first, look, we want to be competitive with Axeos. It's a great product, the more places we can sell that to better. Are we -- is there differential promotions? Yes, that goes on typically throughout the entire company.

We are pleased with our performance in the second quarter. As we will detail today, the dental market continues to recover and demonstrate the underlying resilience that makes it attractive long term. 
For the quarter, the company grew both versus 2020 and 2019 as well as sequentially quarter-to-quarter. The team also made progress against our strategic and operational priorities, giving us confidence as we head into the back half of the year. 
The pandemic remains a key consideration for us as we evaluate our performance for the quarter and plan for the remainder of the year. At this point, we feel the market is operating slightly below 2019 levels with a continued recovery expected for the remainder of the year. As we navigate through the newest phase of the pandemic, we are mindful that there are -- continues to be some ongoing impact in certain regions and some stresses to the supply chain. 
One constant throughout all of this, though, has been our team at Dentsply Sirona. Their performance over the past 18 months has been exceptional, and I would like to thank them for their tremendous commitment to our customers as they demonstrate every day. 
On today's call, Jorge and I will talk about our results for the quarter and provide our outlook for the remainder of the year and discuss our growth plans for the back half of 2021 and beyond. Moving now to Slide 6. As I mentioned, our financial performance for the quarter was solid and closes out a strong first half of the year. The results reflect the continued recovery of the market, progress on our growth initiatives and good operating discipline. 
Revenues reached $1.067 billion, up 104.6% on an organic basis. Our operating margin was 20.5% versus minus 8.6% during the prior year. Adjusted non-GAAP EPS was $0.71 compared to a loss of $0.18 last year and cash flow was $214 million. To provide more details around the quarter, I will now turn the call over to Jorge."

As Don said, our second quarter performance rounds out a strong first half of our fiscal year. In Q2, we delivered sequential quarterly revenue growth in both consumables and T&E. We also posted organic sales above pre-COVID levels in 2019. 
Let's look at Q2 in more detail. Versus last year, the business delivered organic revenue growth of 104.6% and reported growth of 117.3%. Compared to the second quarter of 2019, reported sales grew 5.7% and organic sales grew 3.1%. Both segments also grew versus Q2 2019. This performance against the 2019 baseline confirms the steady recovery trend we have seen in 2021. 
Gross profit was $626 million or 58.7% of sales. This strong outcome reflects the continuation of a favorable mix similar to Q1 as well as the overall portfolio optimization work we have done to focus on higher growth, higher-margin businesses. We're also seeing some challenges from a supply chain cost perspective, and our teams are working diligently to address them. 
Before I start discussing SG&A numbers, I would like to remind you that we now report R&D spend separately from SG&A. As we indicated last quarter, we began to ramp on planned SG&A investment spend in the second quarter. 
We tempered certain investments during the height of COVID but we are now accelerating projects as the market further normalizes. We are increasing investments in sales and marketing to support our short- and medium-term growth plans in clear aligners, implants and digital capabilities. 
Sequentially, SG&A increased in absolute dollars but remained relatively flat as a percent of sales. Versus the prior year quarter, SG&A as a percent of sales declined 12.6 percentage points to 34.4%. 
Spending on R&D was up 122.2% in the quarter to $40 million. We expect this level of spend to continue as we are committed to delivering innovation and great solutions to our customers. We are taking a disciplined approach to ensure alignment with our strategic priorities and track return on R&D investment. 
Operating profit was $219 million versus a loss of $42 million last year. The business delivered an operating margin of 20.5%, representing continued margin expansion from the realized benefits of our restructuring program. At the same time, we have been able to make meaningful investments in our business to fund growth initiatives. 
Net interest and other expense was flat versus last year. The non-GAAP tax rate in the second quarter was 23.9%, a decrease compared to 26.8% in the prior year quarter, which was a function of the changes in the U.S. versus non-U.S. pretax income. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.71 versus a loss of $0.18 in the prior year quarter. 
Moving to segment performance. Versus the second quarter of 2020, Consumables and Technologies & Equipment posted organic growth of 135.3% and and 85.2%, respectively. Both segments posted strong growth across all product categories. Consumable sales were $445 million, an increase of 138% versus the prior year. 
Growth was strong across all regions and in all categories, most notably within the endo and rest parts of our portfolio, which represent strategic priorities for our business. Additionally, the rebound in the preventative business, particularly in the U.S., continued in Q2. 
The consumables market has been resilient, and our team is executing well through the recovery. Currency favorably impacted consumables by 11.2%, offset by a reduction of 8.5% due to divestitures and discontinued products. 
Moving on to Technologies & Equipment segment results. T&E sales grew 104.6% versus the prior year, with strong growth coming from all regions and product categories. The growth was driven by digital dentistry and equipment and instruments, which grew well in excess of 100%. 
The T&E segment also includes our health care business, which show a smaller pandemic-related impact than the dental business in Q2 2020 and resulting in a less significant year-on-year growth. 
Within T&E, the launch of our new Axeos imaging unit continues to go very well. We're also seeing a strong momentum in digital dentistry with digital adoption and upgrade cycles fueling growth for Primescan. 
Our Clear Aligners franchise performed very well in the quarter. Sales growth is strong, and we are confident in the team's ability to deliver on the $300 million 2021 exit run rate shared previously. This quarter, we also announced the acquisition of Propel Orthodontics and a strategic partnership with 3Shape, further complementing our clear aligners offering. We expect to see the benefits from these 2 initiatives starting in 2022. 
Currency favorably impacted sales by 10.4% as well as a benefit from acquisitions of 19% and offset by a reduction of 10% due to divestitures and discontinued products. Now turning to financial performance by region during the second quarter. 
U.S. sales were $366 million a growth of 179.4% versus last year. Organic sales growth was 145.8%. We were pleased to see dental sales volumes return close to normal levels in both segments and across all product categories. 
European sales were $431 million, a growth of 99.5% versus last year. Organic growth was 91.8% compared to the prior year. Similar to U.S. sales, all areas in consumables and T&E rebounded well from the low point last year. Rest of the world sales were $270 million, a growth of 87.5% versus last year. 
Organic sales growth was 86.2%, reflecting the recovery in demand across consumables and T&E. The Asia Pacific region, in particular, has been an area of continued growth for our business. Next, I'd like to cover cash flows. 
In the second quarter of 2021, our operating cash flow was $214 million, a $39 million improvement versus last year. The company finished the second quarter with cash on hand of $352 million and committed credit facilities of another $744 million. 
On a year-to-date basis, we deployed more than $241 million to fund strategic acquisitions, including Datum and PROPEL Orthodontics. We also returned a total of $134 million to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. During the second quarter, we increased the quarterly dividend by 10%. 
The Board also authorized an increase to our share repurchase program, bringing the total amount to $1 billion. This is inclusive of the $260 million we had remaining from our previous authorization. Now let me provide an update on our financial expectations for 2021. 
We completed a strong first half of the year. We believe the healthy demand will continue through the second half of the year driven by positive momentum in patient confidence and procedure volumes with the vaccine rollout. Based on that, we are reaffirming our outlook for fiscal 2021. We also expect non-GAAP EPS to be close to the top end of the $2.75 to $2.90 range that we provided last quarter. 
Here are a couple of considerations with respect to our outlook. We have updated our assumption for the euro-U.S. dollar exchange rate for the remainder of the year from $122 million to $118 million. We estimate the impact from this change to be a reduction in projected earnings of approximately $0.05 in the second half of the year. 
Second, this full year outlook includes commitments on investment spend that will be incurred over the remainder of the year. We will continue to operate with a high degree of operational discipline and we'll manage SG&A expenses in line with the pace of the commercial activities. 
Our key 2021 planning assumptions are listed within the supplemental materials posted on the Investors section of our website. There are 2 risks to this outlook that are worth highlighting. COVID-19 and ongoing supply disruptions. We are watching closely how the situation evolves, especially considering the increased number of cases in some countries and the actions taken by governments to reinstate certain restrictions. 
Before I turn the call back to Dan, we would like to share a quick update on our efforts around ESG. During the second quarter of 2021, we published our sustainability fact sheet and environmental scorecard. They are available for review on the Sustainability page of our website. Additionally, in May, we announced a global partnership with FDI, the World Dental Federation as 1 of 5 industry founding partners to lead the new sustainability in density initiative. Also, we are planning to publish our sustainability report in Q3. 
As we look forward in our ESG evolution, there are a few guiding principles we are keeping in mind. First, we believe purpose and economic value intersect in a clear way in our business. Second, we want to be transparent about our progress by increasing the disclosure of key ESG metrics. And third, we are measuring and analyzing our EST data and we'll make sure we adhere to high standards of data integrity. 
With that, I will now turn the call back to Don."

I would now like to provide some perspective around our strategy and priorities for 2021 and beyond. Moving to Slide 16 in the presentation. Our priorities have been consistent for the past 3 years. They are to grow organic revenues 4% t",1620,"Thank you, Jorge. I would now like to provide some perspective around our strategy and priorities for 2021 and beyond. Moving to Slide 16 in the presentation. Our priorities have been consistent for the past 3 years. They are to grow organic revenues 4% to 5% long term through a combination of organic and inorganic activities. The team continues to focus on improving margins and expects to achieve our goal of 22% by the end of 2022. 
Supporting this goal, our efforts to simplify the organization and take better advantage of our scale. This formula leads to our target of delivering consistent double-digit EPS growth. 
Slide 17 in the presentation details our strategy. We believe that Dentsply Sirona will grow long term by delivering superior integrated workflows and critical procedures. These workflows will be built around diagnostic excellence, easy-to-use treatment planning and essential consumable products. When we do this, Dentsply Sirona becomes the essential solution provider that improves outcomes for patients while delivering better efficiency and economics for the dental professional. 
Moving to the next slide. Dentsply Sirona is unique in this space with category-leading brands in both the X-ray imaging and the intraoral scanning spaces. Most companies have one or the other. But we are, by far, the biggest player with both. 
In the imaging space, Dentsply Sirona has a significant installed base comprised of many well-recognized brands that are at the heart of the dental practice. Our imaging brands include Schick, the Orthopos family, Galileo and our new Axeos wide field abuse system. Dentists all over the world recognize these brands for their high quality and innovative features. 
For perspective, our imaging systems combined to take over 400 million digital x-ray images a year. What really differentiates Dentsply Sirona though, is that in addition to our major presence in imaging, we are also a leader in the intraoral scanning space. 
There is already a large and expanding CEREC base that includes Primescan and Omnican inter-oral scanners. While we continue to emphasize the advantage of chairside dentistry. The company is also focused on expanding our presence in the rapidly growing DI space. Our Primescan entry, in addition to being the engine for chairside dentistry offers outstanding performance as a stand-alone scanner. When dental offices start with Primescan, they get a great scanner that is easy to use and extremely accurate. 
But starting with Primescan is only the beginning. Our system offers tremendous versatility that allows for easy upgrading to full chairside capabilities and further opportunities to expand into other procedures such as clear aligners and implants. 
Aesthetic areas like clear aligners, implants and complex restorations have been among the fastest growing in the dental market. These higher-value procedures are made easier and more efficient when using digital tools. And we are the leader in providing these increasingly important treatment planning tools. 
Our well-recognized treatment planning brands include Sidexis, CEREC, SureSmile, Simplant, Atlantis and MGD. All of these treatment planning tools are fully integrated with our digital equipment. To give some context, in a typical year, there will be over 275 million patient cases done in Sidexis and over 4 million cases done through CEREC. The large volume of these cases also provides important fuel for our AI efforts. 
The final element of the strategy is linking the diagnosis and workflow tools with our essential consumables business. every implant and endodontic procedure finishes with a restoration, which is why we are optimistic about our ability to drive consumables in the future. Our 4% to 5% growth target is built on a strong commitment to organic innovation, acquisitions and other inorganic opportunities built on a foundation of global commercial excellence. 
Organic innovation is our lifeblood. And as Jorge mentioned, our investment in R&D has been increased by close to 50%, reaching $160 million in 2021. This investment is helping drive a very robust pipeline for the back half of this year with continued progress in 2022. 
Moving now to Slide 19. In September, we will be launching a comprehensive restage of our implant business. The restage puts together our digital base, historical product strength with other key elements like custom abutments and continuing education and training. The program starts with harmonizing all our implant businesses under the Dentsply Sirona brand name, including our rapidly growing MIS value implant business. 
It will include strong new products, highlighted by prime taper an immediate load implant that will position us very competitively in the marketplace. We will also be updating our well-recognized SIMPLANT treatment planning software and integrating it with CEREC. We're also focusing on our Atlantis custom abutment business, which has very easy to use planning software for custom abutments. 
For perspective, we process well over 0.5 million implant cases through SIMPLANT and Atlantis on an annual basis. For the first time, we are offering a dental scanning program for CEREC, a major development in the implant space. And the dental scan takes advantage of Primescan's unique accuracy and provides a whole new level of detail that makes full arch impact planning easier. 
While we are in the process of rolling out -- We are in the process of rolling out OSSIX bone regeneration brand to further enhance our implant offering and serve the rapidly growing immediate load implant segment in general. All our implant training and continuing education efforts will be harmonized and rebranded to provide a comprehensive implant curriculum for dentists. 
We've been working closely with our global implant KOL community, and they have started gaining experience with the product. The reaction has been very positive. They are very comfortable with the new products in part because they are based on a procedure they know well. The revitalization of our implant business is an important piece of our overall growth strategy. This relaunch will begin in September and continue rolling out globally throughout Q2 2022. Moving now to Slide 20. 
Our endodomic platform is another critical area for us. Beginning in September, we will be launching ProTaper Ultimate as part of a new platform that will include new files of biosymmetric sealer and a new disinfection device. In addition, we will be launching multiple new motor systems in early 2022. The ProTaper Ultimate system really takes performance to the next level. the files have been designed to cut and shape better and faster, requiring less files per procedure. 
The complete system will offer better cleaning and op duration as well. ProTaper Ultimate is the first major platform we have launched in the endo area in several years. It has also been in the hands of our KOLs and has met with a very positive response. There are also several critical software upgrades and launches coming in the back half of 2021. These include a major SureSmile upgrade, 7.7. This upgrade improves the user interface for the GP, simplifying the case review screen and enhancing the order entry process. 
We're also launching CEREC 5.2, a significant upgrade in Primescan that further enhances its speed and ease of use. This CEREC 5.2 upgrade supports the new and dental scanning capability and differentiates Primescan in the marketplace. Early beta testers have indicated that this software upgrade provides a level of performance that makes it feel like a whole new product. There are also multiple new SureSmile product launches coming over the next 2 quarters. These include the introduction of a vPro product as well as whitening in Q4. We with vPro, which came as part of the PROPEL acquisition, SureSmile will be differentiated in the marketplace. All of these new products will be launched at our DS World event in September. 
Moving to the next slide. In addition to our organic innovation program, Jorge detailed some of the strategic acquisitions made over the last several months. All of these are designed to enhance our competitiveness in higher growth, higher margin categories, including clear aligners and implants. I wanted to add to his comments by saying that we are very happy with the Byte acquisition. We've had Byte for close to 8 months and are very pleased with the integration program and excited about its future growth prospects. 
As mentioned earlier, we also closed on PROPEL in Q2, and we recently acquired Datum to provide us with a leading bone growth regeneration product to accelerate our implant businesses. These businesses are off to a strong start and their integrations are on target. 
All of this is powered by our outstanding global commercial team comprised of over 5,000 people. We've been investing in a comprehensive sales force effectiveness program that will be close to completed in our 10 largest countries by the end of this year. Over the past 2 years, the team has also made solid progress against our goal of improving our operating margin and simplifying the organization. 
We've rationalized our manufacturing and supply chain, launched a comprehensive enterprise modernization program around key functions, all while maintaining strong expense discipline. As a result, we will deliver the $250 million savings target end of '22 margin goal on time. 
Moving to Slide 23. In summary, we had a strong first half as the market recovered and the company made progress on key strategic goals. We are reaffirming our 2021 outlook. The dental market continues to show resilience as well as strong underlying fundamentals. We believe that Dentsply Sirona is well positioned to deliver sustainable growth in the future. 
And finally, we are pleased to confirm that DS World will again be welcoming guests to Las Vegas, September 23 through the 25th at Caesars Forum while also offering a hybrid option. It is an excellent way to build momentum in the back half of the year. And with that, we can open the call to questions."

And listen, from a macro perspective, we feel really good about how the business is tracking. The execution by our teams has been solid all year. And the progression of the business, as demonstrated by the last several quarters is consistent. Also, I mean, if you remember, we were the first company that provided guidance at the beginning of this year. And then right after the first quarter, given the performance we had in Q1, we actually raised our guidance in a meaningful way for the rest of the year. Q2, we performed very much according to our expectations. It was a solid quarter, and we believe the second half is going to be better than the first half. But as I pointed out in my prepared remarks, there's a few things to keep in mind, and we talked about this in Q1. First, we have investment spend that we move from Q1 and partially from Q2 into the second half of the year because we didn't spend at the pace we were planning to spend in the first half of the year. So that is important. And those those investments, by the way, are intended to fund very important priorities for us, for example, clear aligners. Our clear aligners business, as we discussed, is growing and we are adding more resources because we are launching aligners in other countries. We are also making investments in our implants. Don talked about what's going on with our implant business, and we continue to make investments in our digital capabilities, both in terms of a go-to-market strategy and products that are important for our customers as well as internal infrastructure. And then I also mentioned this in my prepared remarks, there is an impact from a planning perspective resulting from our change in assumptions relative to the euro exchange rate. So when we provided guidance at the beginning of the year, this was one of the assumptions that I shared with all of you. We said at the time that we were expecting the euro to be at the 1 22 level, and we have not seen that this year. So for the remainder of the year, we decided to change the assumption and now we are using 1 18. That change in assumptions represents about $0.05 in the second half of the year. So when you kind of look at all of those pieces and do the math, I think we feel good about being at the top end of our range. And we always -- we are never satisfied. We always want to do better, and -- but we are really -- we feel good about the consistency in our results and performance this year. So for all those reasons, that's why we have kept the guidance where it is now."

Implants is going to be a big feature of DS World because look, we're really -- we really want to talk about being the first kind of digitally native implant company. So when we start talking about CEREC and the ability to do an dental scan and whatnot, you're going to see a fair amount of integration of our digital technology with easy-to-use treatment planning, principally aimed at the general practitioner as a way of giving them a lot more confidence from stepping up from doing some procedures to making it a regular part of their practice. So yes, you're going to see a fair amount of that at DS World. Look, DS World is going to feature, we think, a pretty exciting lineup of new products, whether it was what we're doing in the endo space. We're really excited about the restage of our implant business. But also, really, I don't want to undersell the CEREC 5.2. I mean the folks who have been using this for a while, really say it's like almost a new product because it cuts the time you need to do a scan. It enhances accuracy and when we're adding specific treatment planning around things like in dental scanning, doing a real integration with SureSmile with 77, we're really trying to make digital workflows at the heart of everything we do."

By the way, Jorge in his prepared remarks called out our Wellspect business, the Healthcare business, which obviously wasn't really impacted by the pandemic. So that's a piece of that business, you kind of have a normal growth rate there compared to the really significant dental growth rates of triple digits. The only other thing I'd point out, Jeff, when you start looking versus 2019, there's 2 points I direct your attention to. The first is, remember, Q1, Q2 in '19, we were coming off the Primescan launch, and we were actually a little bit back ordered in there with a lot of that actually delivered in the first and second quarter. And the second point in that around the consumable business, we had really begun to implement a comprehensive program to change how we promote things and looking to focus much more on 1 DS-type programs that were aimed directly at creating retail demand as opposed to focus on wholesale activity. So there's -- we were working through that specific thing if we hadn't been pandemic, if that's even a word, Jeff, we would have seen that kind of level out through 2020. So you had that distortion associated with the pandemic. And so now when you're looking at '21 versus '19, we're working our way through that comp, which might have been a little bit higher in '19 versus what we're seeing now as we level load and really focus on stuff like One DS as a preferred promotional program."

First, we've been very public about saying we're unhappy with our implant performance. And basically, we said it was -- we thought it was a 2-stage where look, we've got to get back to growth part 1 and then we got to grow with the category or faster than the category and you know this. Historically, we've been really kind of balkanized around our implant approach. We had 4 premium brands between AnkyloXive, Astro and Astra EV. I don't think people really understood we had a very competitive value brand in MIS that's actually been growing at, if not faster than the market. 
The other thing we've never really called out the -- our custom button business, which is -- the branding we have is ATLANTIS, which is, again, growing at, if not faster than market. So when we step back, we said, ""Hey, look, we have a fairly aggressive new product, set of programs and we dovetailed the new products with -- as well as the digital offerings."" We really I think done a nice job upgrading SIMPLANT and integrating it with CEREC. So when we put this all together, we think it gives us the opportunity to reset our brand image and our promise across the marketplace. So I would tell you, I think it's going to be very significant. I mean if we have been growing the -- our implant business, at market levels that would be significantly higher than what we performed at in the last 2 to 3 years. So again, we feel good that this gets us -- it's not going to happen instantly, but we feel good as we start exiting '22, we want to be extremely competitive in this marketplace and growing. And then in terms of Tyco value premium value, it's -- they really kind of go hand in hand. I mean our -- the growth rate of our MIS business has been faster than our premium business. I think with the relaunch, we'll accelerate the premium side and we'd like to see both of them growing at market levels."

So as we look at that business, it's performing above expectations and that has incorporated some changes that we are making. The stuff that we get excited about over time, though is, look, we think Byte continues to represent a great opportunity to bring its underserved population, which a lot of people invite aren't necessarily regular dental customers and how do we bring them into the fold. If somebody just spent close to $2,000 on doing a Byte treatment. We want to help them really understand to continue making sure that they get value out of that procedure. They go see their dentists. Go get a cleaning. And then we're going to be working with the dentist to follow up on things like how do you do a retainer and other things.

It really depends on where they are and what part of the country, how much exposure they have to the south versus the east, west or north. But for all intent and purposes, we think it's a couple of percentage points versus where they are in '19. When we talk to them and whether you talk to kind of the big close to 600, 700 offices or even kind of the large group practices. People, by and large, think the vaccine and the fact that some people haven't been to the dentist in 18 months, they're really kind of trying to get back in is going to lead to a pretty steady recovery. So our expectation is even if the Delta variant kind of forces people to shut down. I think the dental community is learned to deal with that and proactively reach out to their patients and assure them about their safety. 
In terms of dealer inventory, first, we've been super happy with our dealer partners. I mean both the large and small. They've done a really good job in our opinion, on helping us buffer some pretty radical supply chain swing, not supply chain swings, demand swings. If you look at where we were a year ago, it was basically shut down and now we're all the way back to '19. And our customer service levels as we track it, the dentists have been pretty good. I would tell you, they've been challenged to maintain inventory. Obviously, a lot of their planning looks back on kind of a last 6-month, 9-month program, which would incorporate pandemic-related reductions. And we're working with them every day to make sure that they're getting adequate inventory to service the customer needs. And that's an ongoing process.

And overall, with Cabot, there's always concerns about there are certain suppliers and certain parts of the economy that are not back to normal levels from a production standpoint. And so those are things that we are watching closely. And all of our projections, the guidance include the risk as we see it. And -- but again, for the most part, the team so far has done a great job of managing those things. But we think it was -- we thought it was worthwhile mentioning because it's happening across the board."

I mean, first, there's a lot of things that are going to go on with Byte that we're extremely happy with. I mean, we -- first, from a marketing and the U.S. perspective, we expect a market at competitive levels. Some of the things we're beginning to do though is we have been a very paid social kind of focused business. We're looking at bringing other areas in, whether that's search engine optimization or whether that's ReCos, from other places like as we begin to bring this into the dentist office. We've got some great new products coming and some updates around that. Obviously, as PROPEL has become part of our business, we're going to look to continue to differentiate that business by virtue of our vibration technology, which we think is -- it makes the byproduct differentiated in the marketplace. And as we get out 2022, I mean, one of the things that that we get excited about the clear aligner business in general is whether it's the direct to consumer or whether it's through the dentist channel, I mean we're still in the very, very early stages of penetration of this business. I mean if you look at people who would be eligible for a Class 1 treatment, do we think we're a 10% penetration in the U.S.? Probably not. The other opportunities we have with Byte as well as with SureSmile is how do we take this out of the U.S., Jorge mentioned in his prepared remarks that at this point where probably in getting close to 10 countries now with SureSmile, and we're going to look to expand that. And we think Byte has got real application because it's a unique product and it's a unique way to reach potentially underserved populations outside the U.S. So we think it can grow that way. And I've mentioned a couple of times, we really think that we have an outstanding relationship with the dental community all around. And one of the things that we'd like to do is take a lot of the traffic that we're generating with Byte and all these unique visitors. And again, to introduce them to dentists that would be part of our curated network where they would have a prime scan, and we believe that they can really help not only make sure that the treatment that was done with Byte is being held on, give them a cleaning afterwards, give them retainer afterwards. But potentially start a relationship with that dentist because we think less than 80% of the Byte unique visitors have a regular relationship with a specific dentist."

It was interesting last year, where we basically ran the virtual event. One of the things we saw was you didn't necessarily see the urgency to buy around a specific like 2-week period. So we looked at kind of the purchase pattern was spread out over 3 to 4 months. And obviously, when you're doing virtual in the middle of pandemic, we probably didn't get as much of a pop as you might have seen in prior years. Now we believe that we're going to see a very successful DS World this year. We've got some really good new products. We've got excellent promotions in place with our dealer partners. So we think we're going to have a good DS world. Now how does that compare exactly to 2019? Again, it's going to be a little bit hard because we're still working through. This will be probably the first really big dental event held globally, and we're going to see how it works. But we have -- again, we have a -- we think, a very, very full new product lineup. We've got great promotions in place. We're excited. By the way, it's not just the products we have close to 200 continuing education courses. Sign-up for DS World right now has been really positive. It's on track with what we saw in '19. In terms of the new products, we kind of talked I would group them into 3 things. There's the implant, there's the endo. There's the -- and short smile is kind of things that you want to focus on that are specifically product as opposed to some of the software upgrades. Look, the implants, it's not going to be a spike. I mean one of the things we noticed in our equipment business, I mean, you launch a new piece of equipment, there's obviously a big spike with kind of implants endo, we think you're going to see a more gradual impact of those. I mean if we get the whole we get everything out virtually around the world by kind of the end of the first quarter '22. Some of that might spill into the second quarter, things like the endo motors and there's a lot of supplemental implant products that will follow off what we're launching at DS World. So I tend to look at that more as a back half impact from a revenue perspective than even loaded over the course of the year."

We think it's something that we will continue. By the way, PROPEL had sold that beyond the U.S., but we will continue offering that to orthodontists and general dentists as a separate product if they want to combine it with their clear aligners and the app would be available for that. But it's -- the app is pretty cool. It really helps people -- it helps us understand if we need to kind of give a nudge to a potential patient.

We are pleased with our performance in the second quarter. As we will detail today, the dental market continues to recover and demonstrate the underlying resilience that makes it attractive long term.  
For the quarter, the company grew both versus 2020 and 2019 as well as sequentially quarter-to-quarter. The team also made progress against our strategic and operational priorities, giving us confidence as we head into the back half of the year.  
The pandemic remains a key consideration for us as we evaluate our performance for the quarter and plan for the remainder of the year. At this point, we feel the market is operating slightly below 2019 levels with a continued recovery expected for the remainder of the year. As we navigate through the newest phase of the pandemic, we are mindful that there are -- continues to be some ongoing impact in certain regions and some stresses to the supply chain.  
One constant throughout all of this, though, has been our team at Dentsply Sirona. Their performance over the past 18 months has been exceptional, and I would like to thank them for their tremendous commitment to our customers as they demonstrate every day.  
On today's call, Jorge and I will talk about our results for the quarter and provide our outlook for the remainder of the year and discuss our growth plans for the back half of 2021 and beyond. 
Moving now to Slide 6. As I mentioned, our financial performance for the quarter was solid and closes out a strong first half of the year. The results reflect the continued recovery of the market, progress on our growth initiatives and good operating discipline.  
Revenues reached $1.067 billion, up 104.6% on an organic basis. Our operating margin was 20.5% versus minus 8.6% during the prior year. Adjusted non-GAAP EPS was $0.71 compared to a loss of $0.18 last year and cash flow was $214 million. 
To provide more details around the quarter, I will now turn the call over to Jorge."

As a reminder, my remarks today will be based on non-GAAP financial results unless otherwise noted. Please refer to the reconciliation tables at the back of the press release and slides, both of which are posted in the Investors section of our website.  
As Don said, our second quarter performance rounds out a strong first half of our fiscal year. In Q2, we delivered sequential quarterly revenue growth in both Consumables and T&E. We also posted organic sales above pre-COVID levels in 2019. 
Let's look at Q2 in more detail. Versus last year, the business delivered organic revenue growth of 104.6% and reported growth of 117.3%. Compared to the second quarter of 2019, reported sales grew 5.7% and organic sales grew 3.1%. Both segments also grew versus Q2 2019. This performance against the 2019 baseline confirms the steady recovery trend we have seen in 2021.  
Gross profit was $626 million or 58.7% of sales. This strong outcome reflects the continuation of a favorable mix similar to Q1, as well as the overall portfolio optimization work we have done to focus on higher growth, higher-margin businesses. We're also seeing some challenges from a supply chain cost perspective, and our teams are working diligently to address them.  
Before I start discussing SG&A numbers, I would like to remind you that we now report R&D spend separately from SG&A. As we indicated last quarter, we began to ramp on planned SG&A investment spend in the second quarter.  
We tempered certain investments during the height of COVID, but we are now accelerating projects as the market further normalizes. We are increasing investments in sales and marketing to support our short- and medium-term growth plans in clear aligners, implants and digital capabilities.  
Sequentially, SG&A increased in absolute dollars but remained relatively flat as a percent of sales. Versus the prior year quarter, SG&A as a percent of sales declined 12.6 percentage points to 34.4%.  
Spending on R&D was up 122.2% in the quarter to $40 million. We expect this level of spend to continue as we are committed to delivering innovation and great solutions to our customers. We are taking a disciplined approach to ensure alignment with our strategic priorities and track return on R&D investment.  
Operating profit was $219 million versus a loss of $42 million last year. The business delivered an operating margin of 20.5%, representing continued margin expansion from the realized benefits of our restructuring program. At the same time, we have been able to make meaningful investments in our business to fund growth initiatives. 
Net interest and other expense was flat versus last year. The non-GAAP tax rate in the second quarter was 23.9%, a decrease compared to 26.8% in the prior year quarter, which was a function of the changes in the U.S. versus non-U.S. pretax income.  
Non-GAAP EPS was $0.71 versus a loss of $0.18 in the prior year quarter.  
Moving to segment performance. Versus the second quarter of 2020, Consumables and Technologies & Equipment posted organic growth of 135.3% and 85.2%, respectively. Both segments posted strong growth across all product categories. Consumables sales were $445 million, an increase of 138% versus the prior year.  
Growth was strong across all regions and in all categories, most notably within the endo and rest two parts of our portfolio, which represent strategic priorities for our business. Additionally, the rebound in the preventative business, particularly in the U.S., continued in Q2.  
The Consumables market has been resilient, and our team is executing well through the recovery. Currency favorably impacted Consumables by 11.2%, offset by a reduction of 8.5% due to divestitures and discontinued products.  
Moving on to Technologies & Equipment segment results. T&E sales grew 104.6% versus the prior year, with strong growth coming from all regions and product categories. The growth was driven by Digital Dentistry and equipment and instruments, which grew well in excess of 100%.  
The T&E segment also includes our health care business, which show a smaller pandemic-related impact than the dental business in Q2 2020, resulting in a less significant year-on-year growth.  Within T&E, the launch of our new Axeos imaging unit continues to go very well. We're also seeing a strong momentum in Digital Dentistry with digital adoption and upgrade cycles fueling growth for Primescan.  
Our Clear Aligners franchise performed very well in the quarter. Sales growth is strong, and we are confident in the team's ability to deliver on the $300 million 2021 exit run rate shared previously. This quarter, we also announced the acquisition of Propel Orthodontics and a strategic partnership with 3Shape, further complementing our clear aligners offering. We expect to see the benefits from these 2 initiatives starting in 2022. 
Currency favorably impacted sales by 10.4%, as well as a benefit from acquisitions of 19%, offset by a reduction of 10% due to divestitures and discontinued products. 
Now turning to financial performance by region during the second quarter. U.S. sales were $366 million a growth of 179.4% versus last year. Organic sales growth was 145.8%. We were pleased to see dental sales volumes return close to normal levels in both segments and across all product categories.  
European sales were $431 million, a growth of 99.5% versus last year. Organic growth was 91.8% compared to the prior year. Similar to U.S. sales, all areas in Consumables and T&E rebounded well from the low point last year. 
Rest of the world sales were $270 million, a growth of 87.5% versus last year. Organic sales growth was 86.2%, reflecting the recovery in demand across Consumables and T&E. The Asia Pacific region, in particular, has been an area of continued growth for our business. 
Next, I'd like to cover cash flows. In the second quarter of 2021, our operating cash flow was $214 million, a $39 million improvement versus last year. The company finished the second quarter with cash on hand of $332 million and committed credit facilities of another $744 million. 
On a year-to-date basis, we deployed more than $241 million to fund strategic acquisitions, including Datum and Propel Orthodontics. We also returned a total of $134 million to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. During the second quarter, we increased the quarterly dividend by 10%. The Board also authorized an increase to our share repurchase program, bringing the total amount to $1 billion. This is inclusive of the $260 million we had remaining from our previous authorization. 
Now let me provide an update on our financial expectations for 2021. We completed a strong first half of the year. We believe the healthy demand will continue through the second half of the year driven by positive momentum in patient confidence and procedure volumes with the vaccine rollout. Based on that, we are reaffirming our outlook for fiscal 2021. We also expect non-GAAP EPS to be close to the top end of the $2.75 to $2.90 range that we provided last quarter.  
Here are a couple of considerations with respect to our outlook. We have updated our assumption for the euro-U.S. dollar exchange rate for the remainder of the year from 1.22 to 1.18. We estimate the impact from this change to be a reduction in projected earnings of approximately $0.05 in the second half of the year.  
Second, this full year outlook includes commitments on investment spend that will be incurred over the remainder of the year. We will continue to operate with a high degree of operational discipline and we'll manage SG&A expenses in line with the pace of the commercial activities.  
Our key 2021 planning assumptions are listed within the supplemental materials posted on the Investors section of our website. There are 2 risks to this outlook that are worth highlighting. COVID-19 and ongoing supply disruptions. We are watching closely how the situation evolves, especially considering the increased number of cases in some countries and the actions taken by governments to reinstate certain restrictions.  
Before I turn the call back to Don, we would like to share a quick update on our efforts around ESG. During the second quarter of 2021, we published our sustainability fact sheet and environmental scorecard. They are available for review on the Sustainability page of our website. 
Additionally, in May, we announced a global partnership with FDI World Dental Federation, as 1 of 5 industry founding partners to lead the new sustainability in dentistry initiative. Also, we are planning to publish our sustainability report in Q3.  
As we look forward in our ESG evolution, there are a few guiding principles we are keeping in mind. First, we believe purpose and economic value intersect in a clear way in our business. Second, we want to be transparent about our progress by increasing the disclosure of key ESG metrics. And third, we are measuring and analyzing our ESG data, and we'll make sure we adhere to high standards of data integrity.  
With that, I will now turn the call back to Don."

I would now like to provide some perspective around our strategy and priorities for 2021 and beyond. Moving to Slide 16 in the presentation. Our priorities have been consistent for the past 3 years. They are to grow organic revenues 4%",1616,"Thank you, Jorge. I would now like to provide some perspective around our strategy and priorities for 2021 and beyond. 
Moving to Slide 16 in the presentation. Our priorities have been consistent for the past 3 years. They are to grow organic revenues 4% to 5% long term through a combination of organic and inorganic activities. The team continues to focus on improving margins and expects to achieve our goal of 22% by the end of 2022. Supporting this goal are efforts to simplify the organization and take better advantage of our scale. This formula leads to our target of delivering consistent double-digit EPS growth.  
Slide 17 in the presentation details our strategy. We believe that Dentsply Sirona will grow long term by delivering superior, integrated workflows and critical procedures. These workflows will be built around diagnostic excellence, easy-to-use treatment planning and essential consumable products. When we do this, Dentsply Sirona becomes the essential solution provider that improves outcomes for patients while delivering better efficiency and economics for the dental professional.  
Moving to the next slide. Dentsply Sirona is unique in this space with category-leading brands in both the X-ray imaging and the intraoral scanning spaces. Most companies have one or the other. But we are, by far, the biggest player with both.  
In the imaging space, Dentsply Sirona has a significant installed base comprised of many well-recognized brands that are at the heart of the dental practice. Our imaging brands include Schick, the Orthopos family, Galileos and our new Axeos wide field of view system. Dentists all over the world recognize these brands for their high quality and innovative features.  
For perspective, our imaging systems combine to take over 400 million digital x-ray images a year. What really differentiates Dentsply Sirona, though, is that in addition to our major presence in imaging, we are also a leader in the intraoral scanning space.  
There is already a large and expanding CEREC base that includes Primescan and Omnicam intraoral scanners. While we continue to emphasize the advantage of chairside dentistry, the company is also focused on expanding our presence in the rapidly growing DI space. Our Primescan entry, in addition to being the engine for chairside dentistry, offers outstanding performance as a stand-alone scanner. When dental offices start with Primescan, they get a great scanner that is easy to use and extremely accurate.  
But starting with Primescan is only the beginning. Our system offers tremendous versatility that allows for easy upgrading to full chairside capabilities and further opportunities to expand into other procedures such as clear aligners and implants.  
Aesthetics areas like clear aligners, implants and complex restorations have been among the fastest growing in the dental market. These higher-value procedures are made easier and more efficient when using digital tools. And we are the leader in providing these increasingly important treatment planning tools.  
Our well-recognized treatment planning brands include Sidexis, CEREC, SureSmile, SIMPLANT, ATLANTIS and M-Guide. All of these treatment planning tools are fully integrated with our digital equipment. To give some context, in a typical year, there will be over 275 million patient cases done in Sidexis and over 4 million cases done through CEREC. The large volume of these cases also provides important fuel for our AI efforts.  
The final element of the strategy is linking the diagnosis and workflow tools with our essential Consumables business. Every implant and endodontic procedure finishes with a restoration, which is why we are optimistic about our ability to drive Consumables in the future. Our 4% to 5% growth target is built on a strong commitment to organic innovation, acquisitions and other inorganic opportunities built on a foundation of global commercial excellence.  
Organic innovation is our lifeblood. And as Jorge mentioned, our investment in R&D has been increased by close to 50%, reaching $160 million in 2021. This investment is helping drive a very robust pipeline for the back half of this year with continued progress in 2022.  
Moving now to Slide 19. In September, we will be launching a comprehensive restage of our implant business. The restage puts together our digital base, historical product strength with other key elements like custom abutments and continuing education and training. The program starts with harmonizing all our implant businesses under the Dentsply Sirona brand name, including our rapidly growing MIS value implant business.  
It will include strong new products, highlighted by  PrimeTaper, an immediate load implant that will position us very competitively in the marketplace. We will also be updating our well-recognized SIMPLANT treatment planning software and integrating it with CEREC. We're also focusing on our ATLANTIS custom abutment business, which has very easy-to-use planning software for custom abutments.  
For perspective, we process well over 0.5 million implant cases through SIMPLANT and ATLANTIS on an annual basis. For the first time, we are offering a dental scanning program for CEREC, a major development in the implant space. And the dental scan takes advantage of Primescan's unique accuracy and provides a whole new level of detail that makes full arch implant planting easier.  
While we are in the process of rolling out -- we are in the process of rolling out the OSSIX bone regeneration brand to further enhance our implant offering and serve the rapidly growing immediate load implant segment in general. All our implant training and continuing education efforts will be harmonized and rebranded to provide a comprehensive implant curriculum for dentists.  
We've been working closely with our global implant KOL community, and they have started gaining experience with the product. The reaction has been very positive. They are very comfortable with the new products in part because they are based on a procedure they know well. The revitalization of our implant business is an important piece of our overall growth strategy.  
This relaunch will begin in September and continue rolling out globally throughout Q2 2022. 
Moving now to Slide 20. Our endodontic platform is another critical area for us. Beginning in September, we will be launching ProTaper Ultimate as part of a new platform that will include new files, a biosymmetric sealer and a new disinfection device. 
In addition, we will be launching multiple new motor systems in early 2022. The ProTaper Ultimate system really takes performance to the next level. the files have been designed to cut and shape better and faster, requiring less files per procedure. The complete system will offer better cleaning and op duration as well. ProTaper Ultimate is the first major platform we have launched in the endo area in several years. It has also been in the hands of our KOLs and has met with a very positive response. 
There are also several critical software upgrades and launches coming in the back half of 2021. These include a major SureSmile upgrade 7.7. This upgrade improves the user interface for the GP, simplifying the case review screen and enhancing the order entry process.  
We're also launching CEREC 5.2, a significant upgrade in Primescan that further enhances its speed and ease of use. This CEREC 5.2 upgrade supports the new dental scanning capability and differentiates Primescan in the marketplace. Early beta testers have indicated that this software upgrade provides a level of performance that makes it feel like a whole new product. 
There are also multiple new SureSmile product launches coming over the next 2 quarters. These include the introduction of a VPro product as well as whitening in Q4. We with VPro, which came as part of the Propel acquisition, SureSmile will be differentiated in the marketplace. All of these new products will be launched at our DS World event in September.  
Moving to the next slide. In addition to our organic innovation program, Jorge detailed some of the strategic acquisitions made over the last several months. All of these are designed to enhance our competitiveness in higher-growth, higher-margin categories, including clear aligners and implants. I wanted to add to his comments by saying that we are very happy with the BYTE acquisition. We've had BYTE for close to 8 months and are very pleased with the integration program and excited about its future growth prospects.  
As mentioned earlier, we also closed on Propel in Q2, and we recently acquired Datum to provide us with a leading bone growth regeneration product to accelerate our implant businesses. These businesses are off to a strong start and their integrations are on target.  
All of this is powered by our outstanding global commercial team comprised of over 5,000 people. We've been investing in a comprehensive sales force effectiveness program that will be close to completed in our 10 largest countries by the end of this year. 
Over the past 2 years, the team has also made solid progress against our goal of improving our operating margin and simplifying the organization. We've rationalized our manufacturing and supply chain, launched a comprehensive enterprise modernization program around key functions, all while maintaining strong expense discipline. As a result, we will deliver the $250 million savings target end of '22 margin goal on time.  
Moving to Slide 23. In summary, we had a strong first half as the market recovered and the company made progress on key strategic goals. We are reaffirming our 2021 outlook. The dental market continues to show resilience as well as strong underlying fundamentals. We believe that Dentsply Sirona is well positioned to deliver sustainable growth in the future.  
And finally, we are pleased to confirm that DS World will again be welcoming guests to Las Vegas, September 23 through the 25th, at Caesars Forum while also offering a hybrid option. It is an excellent way to build momentum in the back half of the year. 
And with that, we can open the call to questions."

And listen, from a macro perspective, we feel really good about how the business is tracking. The execution by our teams has been solid all year. And the progression of the business, as demonstrated by the last several quarters, is consistent. Also, I mean, if you remember, we were the first company that provided guidance at the beginning of this year. And then right after the first quarter, given the performance we had in Q1, we actually raised our guidance in a meaningful way for the rest of the year. 
Q2, we performed very much according to our expectations. It was a solid quarter, and we believe the second half is going to be better than the first half. But as I pointed out in my prepared remarks, there's a few things to keep in mind, and we talked about this in Q1. First, we have investment spend that we move from Q1 and partially from Q2 into the second half of the year because we didn't spend at the pace we were planning to spend in the first half of the year. So that is important. And those investments, by the way, are intended to fund very important priorities for us, for example, clear aligners. Our clear aligners business, as we discussed, is growing and we are adding more resources because we are launching aligners in other countries. 
We are also making investments in our implants. Don talked about what's going on with our implant business, and we continue to make investments in our digital capabilities, both in terms of a go-to-market strategy and products that are important for our customers as well as internal infrastructure. 
And then I also mentioned this in my prepared remarks, there is an impact from a planning perspective resulting from our change in assumptions relative to the euro exchange rate. So when we provided guidance at the beginning of the year, this was one of the assumptions that I shared with all of you. We said at the time that we were expecting the euro to be at the 1.22 level, and we have not seen that this year. So for the remainder of the year, we decided to change the assumption, and now we are using 1.18. That change in assumptions represents about $0.05 in the second half of the year. 
So when you kind of look at all of those pieces and do the math, I think we feel good about being at the top end of our range. And we always -- we are never satisfied. We always want to do better, and -- but we are really -- we feel good about the consistency in our results and performance this year. So for all those reasons, that's why we have kept the guidance where it is now."

Implants is going to be a big feature of DS World because, look, we really want to talk about being the first kind of digitally native implant company. So when we start talking about CEREC and the ability to do any dental scan and whatnot, you're going to see a fair amount of integration of our digital technology with easy-to-use treatment planning, principally aimed at the general practitioner as a way of giving them a lot more confidence from stepping up from doing some procedures to making it a regular part of their practice. So yes, you're going to see a fair amount of that at DS World. 
Look, DS World is going to feature, we think, a pretty exciting lineup of new products, whether it was what we're doing in the endo space. We're really excited about the restage of our implant business. But also, really, I don't want to undersell the CEREC 5.2. I mean the folks who have been using this for a while really say it's like almost a new product because it cuts the time you need to do a scan. It enhances accuracy and when we're adding specific treatment planning around things like in dental scanning, doing a real integration with SureSmile, with [ 7.7 ]. We're really trying to make digital workflows at the heart of everything we do."

By the way, Jorge in his prepared remarks called out our Wellspect business, the healthcare business, which obviously wasn't really impacted by the pandemic. So that's a piece of that business, you kind of have a normal growth rate there compared to the really significant dental growth rates of triple digits. 
The only other thing I'd point out, Jeff, when you start looking versus 2019, there's 2 points I direct your attention to. The first is, remember, Q1, Q2 in '19, we were coming off the Primescan launch, and we were actually a little bit back ordered in there with a lot of that actually delivered in the first and second quarter. 
And the second point in that around the Consumables business, we had really begun to implement a comprehensive program to change how we promote things and looking to focus much more on One DS-type programs that were aimed directly at creating retail demand as opposed to focus on wholesale activity. So there's -- we were working through that specific thing. If we hadn't been pandemic, if that's even a word, Jeff, we would have seen that kind of level out through 2020. So you had that distortion associated with the pandemic. 
And so now when you're looking at '21 versus '19, we're working our way through that comp, which might have been a little bit higher in '19 versus what we're seeing now as we level load and really focus on stuff like One DS as a preferred promotional program."

And basically, we said it was -- we thought it was a 2-stager, where, look, we've got to get back to growth part 1 and then we got to grow with the category or faster than the category. And you know this. Historically, we've been really kind of balkanized around our implant approach. We had 4 premium brands between  Ankylos, XiVE, Astra and Astra EV. I don't think people really understood we had a very competitive value brand in MIS that's actually been growing at, if not faster, than the market.  
The other thing -- we've never really called out the -- our custom abutments business, which is -- the brand name we have is ATLANTIS, which is, again, growing at, if not faster, than market. 
So when we step back, we said, ""Hey, look, we have a fairly aggressive new product, set of programs and we dovetailed the new products with -- as well as the digital offerings."" We've really, I think, done a nice job upgrading SIMPLANT and integrating it with CEREC. So when we put this all together, we think it gives us the opportunity to reset our brand image and our promise across the marketplace. 
So I would tell you, I think it's going to be very significant. I mean, if we have been growing our implant business at market levels that would be significantly higher than what we performed at in the last 2 to 3 years. So again, we feel good that this gives us -- it's not going to happen instantly, but we feel good as we start exiting '22, we want to be extremely competitive in this marketplace and growing. 
And then in terms of, Tycho, value, premium value, they really kind of go hand in hand. I mean, the growth rate of our MIS business has been faster than our premium business. I think with the relaunch, we'll accelerate the premium side and we'd like to see both of them growing at market levels."

Just a couple of general comments and then you can follow up. The first is BYTE is performing as we expected it to. And one of the things that we were excited about the business is, we thought, as you look at their unique visitors, there's an opportunity to focus on segmenting it, and actually not all unique visitors are made the same. And one of the things that we've been focusing on is doing a better job of targeting over time. 
So as we look at that business, it's performing above expectations and that has incorporated some changes that we are making. The stuff that we get excited about over time, though is, look, we think BYTE continues to represent a great opportunity to bring its underserved population, which a lot of people in BYTE aren't necessarily regular dental customers and how do we bring them into the fold? If somebody just spent close to $2,000 on doing a BYTE treatment, we want to help them really understand to continue making sure that they get value out of that procedure. They go see their dentists. Go get a cleaning. And then we're going to be working with the dentist to follow up on things like how do you do a retainer and other things. 
But if -- again, one of the things we were attracted to around BYTE was really the fact that they were hitting underserved populations that weren't really exposed to dentists and -- but we think we have a unique opportunity, given the role we play to bring them into the dental fold."

It really depends on where they are and what part of the country, how much exposure they have to -- the south versus the east, west or north. But for all intent and purposes, we think it's a couple of percentage points versus where they were in '19. When we talk to them and whether you talk to kind of the big -- close to 600, 700 offices or even kind of the large group practices, people, by and large, think the vaccine and the fact that some people haven't been to the dentist in 18 months, they're really kind of trying to get back in, is going to lead to a pretty steady recovery. So our expectation is even if the delta variant kind of forces people to shut down, I think the dental community is learned to deal with that and proactively reach out to their patients and assure them about their safety.  
In terms of dealer inventory, first, we've been super happy with our dealer partners, I mean, both the large and small. They've done a really good job, in our opinion, on helping us buffer some pretty radical supply chain swing -- not supply chain swings, demand swings. If you look at where we were a year ago, it was basically shut down and now we're all the way back to '19. 
And our customer service levels, as we track it, the dentists have been pretty good. I would tell you, they've been challenged to maintain inventory. Obviously, a lot of their planning looks back on kind of a last 6-month, 9-month program, which would incorporate pandemic-related reductions. And we're working with them every day to make sure that they're getting adequate inventory to service the customer needs. And that's an ongoing process. And obviously, they'd be in a better position to comment on how their aggregate inventory level is. But we're working with them."

We're looking at bringing other areas in, whether that's search engine optimization or whether that's [ recos ] from other places like as we begin to bring this into the dentist office. 
We've got some great new products coming and some updates around that. Obviously, as Propel has become part of our business, we're going to look to continue to differentiate that business by virtue of our vibration technology, which we think is -- it makes the byproduct differentiated in the marketplace. 
And as we get out 2022, I mean, one of the things that we get excited about the clear aligner business in general is whether it's the direct-to-consumer or whether it's through the dentist channel. I mean, we're still in the very, very early stages of penetration of this business. I mean, if you look at people who would be eligible for a class 1 treatment, do we think we're a 10% penetration in the U.S.? Probably not. 
The other opportunities we have with BYTE as well as with SureSmile is how do we take this out of the U.S. Jorge mentioned in his prepared remarks that at this point we're probably getting close to 10 countries now with SureSmile, and we're going to look to expand that. And we think BYTE has got real application because it's a unique product and it's a unique way to reach potentially underserved populations outside the U.S. So we think it can grow that way. 
And I've mentioned a couple of times, we really think that we have an outstanding relationship with the dental community all around. And one of the things that we'd like to do is take a lot of the traffic that we're generating with BYTE and all these unique visitors. And again to introduce them to dentists that would be part of our curated network, where they would have a Primescan, and we believe that they can really help -- not only make sure that the treatment that was done with BYTE is being held on, give them a cleaning afterwards, give them retainer afterwards, but potentially start a relationship with that dentist because we think less than 80% of the BYTE unique visitors have a regular relationship with a specific dentist."

It was interesting last year, where we basically ran the virtual event. One of the things we saw was you didn't necessarily see the urgency to buy around a specific like 2-week period. So we looked at kind of the purchase pattern. It was spread out over 3 to 4 months. And obviously, when you're doing virtual in the middle of pandemic, we probably didn't get as much of a pop as you might have seen in prior years. 
Now we believe that we're going to see a very successful DS World this year. We've got some really good new products. We've got excellent promotions in place with our dealer partners. So we think we're going to have a good DS world. 
Now how does that compare exactly to 2019? Again, it's going to be a little bit hard because we're still working through. This will be probably the first really big dental event held globally, and we're going to see how it works. But we have -- again, we have a -- we think, a very, very full new product lineup. We've got great promotions in place. We're excited. 
By the way, it's not just the products. We have close to 200 continuing education courses. Sign-up for DS World right now has been really positive. It's on track with what we saw in '19. 
In terms of the new products, we kind of talked -- I would group them into 3 things. There's the implant, there's the endo, there's the -- and SureSmile is the kind of things that you want to focus on that are specifically product as opposed to some of the software upgrades. 
Look, the implants, it's not going to be a spike. I mean one of the things we noticed in our Equipment business, I mean, you launch a new piece of equipment, there's obviously a big spike. With kind of implants, endo, we think you're going to see a more gradual impact of those, I mean, if we get the whole -- we get everything out virtually around the world by the end of the first quarter '22. Some of that might spill into the second quarter, things like the endo motors, and there's a lot of supplemental implant products that will follow off what we're launching at DS World. 
So I tend to look at that more as a back half impact from a revenue perspective than even loaded over the course of the year."

Welcome to our second quarter 2021 earnings conference call. I'd like to remind you that an earnings call press release and slide presentation related to the call are available in the Investors section of our website at www.dentsplysirona.com.  
Before we begin, please take a moment to read the forward-looking statements in our earnings press release. During today's call, we make certain predictive statements that reflect our current views about future performance and financial results. We base these statements and certain assumptions and expectations on future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our most recent Form 10-K lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.  
In today's conference call, our remarks will be based on non-GAAP financial results. We believe that non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about financial performance of our business, enable the comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independently of business performance and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business. Please refer to our press release for the reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results.

We are pleased with our performance in the second quarter. As we will detail today, the dental market continues to recover and demonstrate the underlying resilience that makes it attractive long term.  
For the quarter, the company grew both versus 2020 and 2019 as well as sequentially quarter-to-quarter. The team also made progress against our strategic and operational priorities, giving us confidence as we head into the back half of the year.  
The pandemic remains a key consideration for us as we evaluate our performance for the quarter and plan for the remainder of the year. At this point, we feel the market is operating slightly below 2019 levels with a continued recovery expected for the remainder of the year. As we navigate through the newest phase of the pandemic, we are mindful that there are -- continues to be some ongoing impact in certain regions and some stresses to the supply chain.  
One constant throughout all of this, though, has been our team at Dentsply Sirona. Their performance over the past 18 months has been exceptional, and I would like to thank them for their tremendous commitment to our customers as they demonstrate every day.  
On today's call, Jorge and I will talk about our results for the quarter and provide our outlook for the remainder of the year and discuss our growth plans for the back half of 2021 and beyond. 
Moving now to Slide 6. As I mentioned, our financial performance for the quarter was solid and closes out a strong first half of the year. The results reflect the continued recovery of the market, progress on our growth initiatives and good operating discipline.  
Revenues reached $1.067 billion, up 104.6% on an organic basis. Our operating margin was 20.5% versus minus 8.6% during the prior year. Adjusted non-GAAP EPS was $0.71 compared to a loss of $0.18 last year and cash flow was $214 million. 
To provide more details around the quarter, I will now turn the call over to Jorge."

As a reminder, my remarks today will be based on non-GAAP financial results unless otherwise noted. Please refer to the reconciliation tables at the back of the press release and slides, both of which are posted in the Investors section of our website.  
As Don said, our second quarter performance rounds out a strong first half of our fiscal year. In Q2, we delivered sequential quarterly revenue growth in both Consumables and T&E. We also posted organic sales above pre-COVID levels in 2019. 
Let's look at Q2 in more detail. Versus last year, the business delivered organic revenue growth of 104.6% and reported growth of 117.3%. Compared to the second quarter of 2019, reported sales grew 5.7% and organic sales grew 3.1%. Both segments also grew versus Q2 2019. This performance against the 2019 baseline confirms the steady recovery trend we have seen in 2021.  
Gross profit was $626 million or 58.7% of sales. This strong outcome reflects the continuation of a favorable mix similar to Q1 as well as the overall portfolio optimization work we have done to focus on higher growth, higher-margin businesses. We're also seeing some challenges from a supply chain cost perspective, and our teams are working diligently to address them.  
Before I start discussing SG&A numbers, I would like to remind you that we now report R&D spend separately from SG&A. As we indicated last quarter, we began to ramp on planned SG&A investment spend in the second quarter.  
We tempered certain investments during the height of COVID, but we are now accelerating projects as the market further normalizes. We are increasing investments in sales and marketing to support our short- and medium-term growth plans in clear aligners, implants and digital capabilities.  
Sequentially, SG&A increased in absolute dollars but remained relatively flat as a percent of sales. Versus the prior year quarter, SG&A as a percent of sales declined 12.6 percentage points to 34.4%.  
Spending on R&D was up 122.2% in the quarter to $40 million. We expect this level of spend to continue as we are committed to delivering innovation and great solutions to our customers. We are taking a disciplined approach to ensure alignment with our strategic priorities and track return on R&D investment.  
Operating profit was $219 million versus a loss of $42 million last year. The business delivered an operating margin of 20.5%, representing continued margin expansion from the realized benefits of our restructuring program. At the same time, we have been able to make meaningful investments in our business to fund growth initiatives. 
Net interest and other expense was flat versus last year. The non-GAAP tax rate in the second quarter was 23.9%, a decrease compared to 26.8% in the prior year quarter, which was a function of the changes in the U.S. versus non-U.S. pretax income.  
Non-GAAP EPS was $0.71 versus a loss of $0.18 in the prior year quarter.  
Moving to segment performance. Versus the second quarter of 2020, Consumables and Technologies & Equipment posted organic growth of 135.3% and 85.2%, respectively. Both segments posted strong growth across all product categories. Consumables sales were $445 million, an increase of 138% versus the prior year.  
Growth was strong across all regions and in all categories, most notably within the endo and resto parts of our portfolio, which represent strategic priorities for our business. Additionally, the rebound in the preventative business, particularly in the U.S., continued in Q2. 
The Consumables market has been resilient, and our team is executing well through the recovery. Currency favorably impacted Consumables by 11.2%, offset by a reduction of 8.5% due to divestitures and discontinued products.  
Moving on to Technologies & Equipment segment results. T&E sales grew 104.6% versus the prior year, with strong growth coming from all regions and product categories. The growth was driven by Digital Dentistry and equipment and instruments, which grew well in excess of 100%.  
The T&E segment also includes our health care business, which show a smaller pandemic-related impact than the dental business in Q2 2020, resulting in a less significant year-on-year growth.  Within T&E, the launch of our new Axeos imaging unit continues to go very well. We're also seeing a strong momentum in Digital Dentistry with digital adoption and upgrade cycles fueling growth for Primescan.  
Our Clear Aligners franchise performed very well in the quarter. Sales growth is strong, and we are confident in the team's ability to deliver on the $300 million 2021 exit run rate shared previously. This quarter, we also announced the acquisition of Propel Orthodontics and a strategic partnership with 3Shape, further complementing our clear aligners offering. We expect to see the benefits from these 2 initiatives starting in 2022. 
Currency favorably impacted sales by 10.4% as well as a benefit from acquisitions of 19%, offset by a reduction of 10% due to divestitures and discontinued products. 
Now turning to financial performance by region during the second quarter. U.S. sales were $366 million a growth of 179.4% versus last year. Organic sales growth was 145.8%. We were pleased to see dental sales volumes return close to normal levels in both segments and across all product categories.  
European sales were $431 million, a growth of 99.5% versus last year. Organic growth was 91.8% compared to the prior year. Similar to U.S. sales, all areas in Consumables and T&E rebounded well from the low point last year. 
Rest of the world sales were $270 million, a growth of 87.5% versus last year. Organic sales growth was 86.2%, reflecting the recovery in demand across Consumables and T&E. The Asia Pacific region, in particular, has been an area of continued growth for our business. 
Next, I'd like to cover cash flows. In the second quarter of 2021, our operating cash flow was $214 million, a $39 million improvement versus last year. The company finished the second quarter with cash on hand of $332 million and committed credit facilities of another $744 million. 
On a year-to-date basis, we deployed more than $241 million to fund strategic acquisitions, including Datum and Propel Orthodontics. We also returned a total of $134 million to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. During the second quarter, we increased the quarterly dividend by 10%. The Board also authorized an increase to our share repurchase program, bringing the total amount to $1 billion. This is inclusive of the $260 million we had remaining from our previous authorization. 
Now let me provide an update on our financial expectations for 2021. We completed a strong first half of the year. We believe the healthy demand will continue through the second half of the year driven by positive momentum in patient confidence and procedure volumes with the vaccine rollout. Based on that, we are reaffirming our outlook for fiscal 2021. We also expect non-GAAP EPS to be close to the top end of the $2.75 to $2.90 range that we provided last quarter.  
Here are a couple of considerations with respect to our outlook. We have updated our assumption for the euro-U.S. dollar exchange rate for the remainder of the year from 1.22 to 1.18. We estimate the impact from this change to be a reduction in projected earnings of approximately $0.05 in the second half of the year.  
Second, this full year outlook includes commitments on investment spend that will be incurred over the remainder of the year. We will continue to operate with a high degree of operational discipline, and we'll manage SG&A expenses in line with the pace of the commercial activities.  
Our key 2021 planning assumptions are listed within the supplemental materials posted on the Investors section of our website. There are 2 risks to this outlook that are worth highlighting. COVID-19 and ongoing supply disruptions. We are watching closely how the situation evolves, especially considering the increased number of cases in some countries and the actions taken by governments to reinstate certain restrictions.  
Before I turn the call back to Don, we would like to share a quick update on our efforts around ESG. During the second quarter of 2021, we published our sustainability fact sheet and environmental scorecard. They are available for review on the Sustainability page of our website. 
Additionally, in May, we announced a global partnership with FDI World Dental Federation, as 1 of 5 industry founding partners to lead the new sustainability in dentistry initiative. Also, we are planning to publish our sustainability report in Q3.  
As we look forward in our ESG evolution, there are a few guiding principles we are keeping in mind. First, we believe purpose and economic value intersect in a clear way in our business. Second, we want to be transparent about our progress by increasing the disclosure of key ESG metrics. And third, we are measuring and analyzing our ESG data, and we'll make sure we adhere to highest standards of data integrity. 
With that, I will now turn the call back to Don."

I would now like to provide some perspective around our strategy and priorities for 2021 and beyond. Moving to Slide 16 in the presentation. Our priorities have been consistent for the past 3 years. They are to grow organic revenues 4%",1623,"Thank you, Jorge. I would now like to provide some perspective around our strategy and priorities for 2021 and beyond. 
Moving to Slide 16 in the presentation. Our priorities have been consistent for the past 3 years. They are to grow organic revenues 4% to 5% long term through a combination of organic and inorganic activities. The team continues to focus on improving margins and expects to achieve our goal of 22% by the end of 2022. Supporting this goal are efforts to simplify the organization and take better advantage of our scale. This formula leads to our target of delivering consistent double-digit EPS growth.  
Slide 17 in the presentation details our strategy. We believe that Dentsply Sirona will grow long term by delivering superior, integrated workflows in critical procedures. These workflows will be built around diagnostic excellence, easy-to-use treatment planning and essential consumable products. When we do this, Dentsply Sirona becomes the essential solution provider that improves outcomes for patients while delivering better efficiency and economics for the dental professional. 
Moving to the next slide. Dentsply Sirona is unique in this space with category-leading brands in both the x-ray imaging and the intraoral scanning spaces. Most companies have one or the other. But we are, by far, the biggest player with both. 
In the imaging space, Dentsply Sirona has a significant installed base comprised of many well-recognized brands that are at the heart of the dental practice. Our imaging brands include Schick, the Orthopos family, Galileos and our new Axeos wide field of view system. Dentists all over the world recognize these brands for their high quality and innovative features.  
For perspective, our imaging systems combine to take over 400 million digital x-ray images a year. What really differentiates Dentsply Sirona, though, is that in addition to our major presence in imaging, we are also a leader in the intraoral scanning space.  
There is already a large and expanding CEREC base that includes Primescan and Omnicam intraoral scanners. While we continue to emphasize the advantage of chairside dentistry, the company is also focused on expanding our presence in the rapidly growing DI space. Our Primescan entry, in addition to being the engine for chairside dentistry, offers outstanding performance as a stand-alone scanner. When dental offices start with Primescan, they get a great scanner that is easy to use and extremely accurate.  
But starting with Primescan is only the beginning. Our system offers tremendous versatility that allows for easy upgrading to full chairside capabilities and further opportunities to expand into other procedures such as clear aligners and implants.  
Aesthetics areas like clear aligners, implants and complex restorations have been among the fastest growing in the dental market. These higher-value procedures are made easier and more efficient when using digital tools. And we are the leader in providing these increasingly important treatment planning tools.  
Our well-recognized treatment planning brands include Sidexis, CEREC, SureSmile, SIMPLANT, Atlantis and M-Guide. All of these treatment planning tools are fully integrated with our digital equipment. To give some context, in a typical year, there will be over 275 million patient cases done in Sidexis and over 4 million cases done through CEREC. The large volume of these cases also provides important fuel for our AI efforts. 
The final element of the strategy is linking the diagnosis and workflow tools with our essential Consumables business. Every implant and endodontic procedure finishes with a restoration, which is why we are optimistic about our ability to drive Consumables in the future. Our 4% to 5% growth target is built on a strong commitment to organic innovation, acquisitions and other inorganic opportunities built on a foundation of global commercial excellence.  
Organic innovation is our lifeblood. And as Jorge mentioned, our investment in R&D has been increased by close to 50%, reaching $160 million in 2021. This investment is helping drive a very robust pipeline for the back half of this year with continued progress in 2022.  
Moving now to Slide 19. In September, we will be launching a comprehensive restage of our implant business. The restage puts together our digital base, historical product strength with other key elements like custom abutments and continuing education and training. The program starts with harmonizing all our implant businesses under the Dentsply Sirona brand name, including our rapidly growing MIS value implant business.  
It will include strong new products, highlighted by Prime Taper, an immediate load implant that will position us very competitively in the marketplace. We will also be updating our well-recognized SIMPLANT treatment planning software and integrating it with CEREC. We're also focusing on our Atlantis Custom Abutment business, which has very easy-to-use planning software for custom abutments. 
For perspective, we process well over 0.5 million implant cases through SIMPLANT and Atlantis on an annual basis. For the first time, we are offering an edentulous scanning program for CEREC, a major development in the implant space. The edentulous scan takes advantage of Primescan's unique accuracy and provides a whole new level of detail that makes full arch implant planting easier. 
While we are in the process of rolling out -- we are in the process of rolling out the OSSIX bone regeneration brand to further enhance our implant offering and serve the rapidly growing immediate load implant segment in general. All our implant training and continuing education efforts will be harmonized and rebranded to provide a comprehensive implant curriculum for dentists.  
We've been working closely with our global implant KOL community, and they have started gaining experience with the product. The reaction has been very positive. They are very comfortable with the new products in part because they are based on a procedure they know well. The revitalization of our implant business is an important piece of our overall growth strategy.  
This relaunch will begin in September and continue rolling out globally throughout Q2 2022. 
Moving now to Slide 20. Our endodontic platform is another critical area for us. Beginning in September, we will be launching ProTaper Ultimate as part of a new platform that will include new files, a bio ceramic (sic) [ bio ceramic sealant ] sealer and a new disinfection device. 
In addition, we will be launching multiple new motor systems in early 2022. The ProTaper Ultimate system really takes performance to the next level. the files have been designed to cut and shape better and faster, requiring less files per procedure. The complete system will offer better cleaning and op duration as well. ProTaper Ultimate is the first major platform we have launched in the endo area in several years. It has also been in the hands of our KOLs and it was met with a very positive response. 
There are also several critical software upgrades and launches coming in the back half of 2021. These include a major SureSmile upgrade 7.7. This upgrade improves the user interface for the GP, simplifying the case review screen and enhancing the order entry process.  
We're also launching CEREC 5.2, a significant upgrade in Primescan that further enhances its speed and ease of use. This CEREC 5.2 upgrade supports the new edentulous scanning capability and differentiates Primescan in the marketplace. Early beta testers have indicated that this software upgrade provides a level of performance that makes it feel like a whole new product. 
There are also multiple new SureSmile product launches coming over the next 2 quarters. These include the introduction of a VPro product as well as whitening in Q4. With VPro, which came as part of the Propel acquisition, SureSmile will be differentiated in the marketplace. All of these new products will be launched at our DS World event in September.
Moving to the next slide. In addition to our organic innovation program, Jorge detailed some of the strategic acquisitions made over the last several months. All of these are designed to enhance our competitiveness in higher-growth, higher-margin categories, including clear aligners and implants. I wanted to add to his comments by saying that we are very happy with the BYTE acquisition. We've had BYTE for close to 8 months and are very pleased with the integration program and excited about its future growth prospects.  
As mentioned earlier, we also closed on Propel in Q2, and we recently acquired Datum to provide us with a leading bone growth regeneration product to accelerate our implant businesses. These businesses are off to a strong start and their integrations are on target.  
All of this is powered by our outstanding global commercial team comprised of over 5,000 people. We've been investing in a comprehensive sales force effectiveness program that will be close to completed in our 10 largest countries by the end of this year. 
Over the past 2 years, the team has also made solid progress against our goal of improving our operating margin and simplifying the organization. We've rationalized our manufacturing and supply chain, launched a comprehensive enterprise modernization program around key functions, all while maintaining strong expense discipline. As a result, we will deliver the $250 million savings target and the '22 margin goal on time. 
Moving to Slide 23. In summary, we had a strong first half as the market recovered and the company made progress on key strategic goals. We are reaffirming our 2021 outlook. The dental market continues to show resilience as well as strong underlying fundamentals. We believe that Dentsply Sirona is well positioned to deliver sustainable growth in the future.  
And finally, we are pleased to confirm that DS World will again be welcoming guests to Las Vegas, September 23 through the 25th, at Caesars Forum while also offering a hybrid option. It is an excellent way to build momentum in the back half of the year. 
And with that, we can open the call to questions."

And listen, from a macro perspective, we feel really good about how the business is tracking. The execution by our teams has been solid all year. And the progression of the business, as demonstrated by the last several quarters, is consistent. Also, I mean, if you remember, we were the first company that provided guidance at the beginning of this year. And then right after the first quarter, given the performance we had in Q1, we actually raised our guidance in a meaningful way for the rest of the year. 
Q2, we performed very much according to our expectations. It was a solid quarter, and we believe the second half is going to be better than the first half. But as I pointed out in my prepared remarks, there's a few things to keep in mind, and we talked about this in Q1. First, we have investment spend that we move from Q1 and partially from Q2 into the second half of the year because we didn't spend at the pace we were planning to spend in the first half of the year. So that is important. And those investments, by the way, are intended to fund very important priorities for us, for example, clear aligners. Our clear aligners business, as we discussed, is growing and we are adding more resources because we are launching aligners in other countries. 
We are also making investments in our implants. Don talked about what's going on with our implant business, and we continue to make investments in our digital capabilities, both in terms of a go-to-market strategy and products that are important for our customers as well as internal infrastructure. 
And then I also mentioned this in my prepared remarks, there is an impact from a planning perspective resulting from our change in assumptions relative to the euro exchange rate. So when we provided guidance at the beginning of the year, this was one of the assumptions that I shared with all of you. We said at the time that we were expecting the euro to be at the 1.22 level, and we have not seen that this year. So for the remainder of the year, we decided to change the assumption, and now we are using 1.18. That change in assumptions represents about $0.05 in the second half of the year. 
So when you kind of look at all of those pieces and do the math, I think we feel good about being at the top end of our range. And we always -- we are never satisfied. We always want to do better, and -- but we are really -- we feel good about the consistency in our results and performance this year. So for all those reasons, that's why we have kept the guidance where it is now."

So yes, you're going to see a fair amount of that at DS World. 
Look, DS World is going to feature, we think, a pretty exciting lineup of new products, whether it was what we're doing in the endo space. We're really excited about the restage of our implant business. But also, really, I don't want to undersell the CEREC 5.2. I mean, the folks who have been using this for a while really say it's like almost a new product because it cuts the time you need to do a scan. It enhances accuracy. And when we're adding specific treatment planning around things like in dental scanning, doing a real integration with SureSmile, with 7.7, we're really trying to make digital workflows the heart of everything we do."

Your commentary about the market is continuing to improve, and that seems consistent with our checks. So just, I'd like to better understand why maybe that 2-year growth rate came in a few points. And it seemed like it was pretty evenly split across all 3 of your geographies. We have all 3 of them, maybe 3 to 5 points slower on a 2-year basis versus 1Q. So just maybe help us understand that dynamic."

And I think there was a fair amount of catch-up across the board. And as we look at 2Q, we saw a pretty -- again, consistent, whether it's Consumables, Technology & Equipment. By the way, Jorge in his prepared remarks called out our Wellspect business, the healthcare business, which obviously wasn't really impacted by the pandemic. So that's a piece of that business, you kind of have a normal growth rate there compared to the really significant dental growth rates of triple digits. 
The only other thing I'd point out, Jeff, when you start looking versus 2019, there's 2 points I’d direct your attention to. The first is, remember, Q1, Q2 in '19, we were coming off the Primescan launch, and we were actually a little bit back ordered in there with a lot of that actually delivered in the first and second quarter. 
And the second point in that around the Consumables business, we had really begun to implement a comprehensive program to change how we promote things and looking to focus much more on One DS-type programs that were aimed directly at creating retail demand as opposed to focus on wholesale activity. So there's -- we were working through that specific thing. If we hadn't been pandemic-ed, if that's even a word, Jeff, we would have seen that kind of level out through 2020. So you had that distortion associated with the pandemic.
And so now when you're looking at '21 versus '19, we're working our way through that comp, which might have been a little bit higher in '19 versus what we're seeing now as we level load and really focus on stuff like One DS as a preferred promotional program."

Datum, generally immaterial, a little bit of contribution.
So is it fair to think about that 19% acquisition growth in T&E specifically largely or majority of that being driven by BYTE, and that would suggest kind of sequentially BYTE stepped up probably 20% plus, is that reasonable as well?"

And basically, we said it was -- we thought it was a 2-stager, where, look, we've got to get back to growth part 1 and then we got to grow with the category or faster than the category. And you know this. Historically, we've been really kind of balkanized around our implant approach. We had 4 premium brands between  Ankylos, XiVE, Astra and Astra EV. I don't think people really understood we had a very competitive value brand in MIS that's actually been growing at, if not faster, than the market.  
The other thing, we've never really called out the -- our custom abutments business, which is -- the brand name we have is Atlantis, which is, again, growing at, if not faster, than market. 
So when we step back, we said, ""Hey, look, we have a fairly aggressive new product, set of programs, and we dovetailed the new products with -- as well as the digital offerings."" We've really, I think, done a nice job upgrading SIMPLANT and integrating it with CEREC. So when we put this all together, we think it gives us the opportunity to reset our brand image and our promise across the marketplace. 
So I would tell you, I think it's going to be very significant. I mean, if we have been growing our implant business at market levels, it would be significantly higher than what we performed at in the last 2 to 3 years. So again, we feel good that this gets us -- it's not going to happen instantly, but we feel good as we start exiting '22, we want to be extremely competitive in this marketplace and growing at market levels. 
And then in terms of, Tycho, value, premium value, they really kind of go hand in hand. I mean, the growth rate of our MIS business has been faster than our premium business. I think with the relaunch, we'll accelerate the premium side and we'd like to see both of them growing at market levels."

And one of the things that we've been focusing on is doing a better job of targeting over time. 
So as we look at that business, it's performing above expectations and that has incorporated some changes that we are making. The stuff that we get excited about over time, though, is, look, we think BYTE continues to represent a great opportunity to bring its underserved population, which a lot of people in BYTE aren't necessarily regular dental customers and how do we bring them into the fold? If somebody just spent close to $2,000 on doing a BYTE treatment, we want to help them really understand to continue making sure that they get value out of that procedure. They go see their dentists, go get a cleaning. And then we're going to be working with the dentist to follow up on things, like, how do you do a retainer and other things. 
But if -- again, one of the things we were attracted to around BYTE was really the fact that they were hitting underserved populations that weren't really exposed to dentists and -- but we think we have a unique opportunity, given the role we play to bring them into the dental fold."

It really depends on where they are and what part of the country, how much exposure they have to -- the south versus the east, west or north. But for all intent and purposes, we think it's a couple of percentage points versus where they were in '19. When we talk to them, and whether you talk to kind of the big -- close to 600, 700 offices or even kind of the large group practices, people, by and large, think the vaccine -- and the fact that some people haven't been to the dentist in 18 months, they're really kind of trying to get back in, is going to lead to a pretty steady recovery. So our expectation is even if the delta variant kind of forces people to shut down, I think the dental community has learned to deal with that and to proactively reach out to their patients and assure them about their safety. 
In terms of dealer inventory, first, we've been super happy with our dealer partners, I mean, both the large and small. They've done a really good job, in our opinion, on helping us buffer some pretty radical supply chain swing -- not supply chain swings, demand swings. If you look at where we were a year ago, it was basically shut down and now we're all the way back to '19. 
And our customer service levels, as we track it, the dentists have been pretty good. I would tell you, they've been challenged to maintain inventory. Obviously, a lot of their planning looks back on kind of a last 6-month, 9-month program, which would incorporate pandemic-related reductions. And we're working with them every day to make sure that they're getting adequate inventory to service the customer needs. And that's an ongoing process.

We're looking at bringing other areas in, whether that's search engine optimization or whether that's recos from other places, like, as we begin to bring this into the dentist office. 
We've got some great new products coming and some updates around that. Obviously, as Propel has become part of our business, we're going to look to continue to differentiate that business by virtue of our vibration technology, which we think is -- it makes the byproduct differentiated in the marketplace. 
And as we get out in 2022, I mean, one of the things that we get excited about the clear aligner business in general is whether it's the direct-to-consumer or whether it's through the dentist channel. I mean, we're still in the very, very early stages of penetration of this business. I mean, if you look at people who would be eligible for a class 1 treatment, do we think we're at 10% penetration in the U.S.? Probably not. 
The other opportunities we have with BYTE as well as with SureSmile is how do we take this out of the U.S. Jorge mentioned in his prepared remarks that at this point we're probably getting close to 10 countries now with SureSmile, and we're going to look to expand that. And we think BYTE has got real application because it's a unique product and it's a unique way to reach potentially underserved populations outside the U.S. So we think it can grow that way. 
And I've mentioned a couple of times, we really think that we have an outstanding relationship with the dental community all around. And one of the things that we'd like to do is take a lot of the traffic that we're generating with BYTE and all these unique visitors, and again to introduce them to dentists that would be part of our curated network, where they would have a Primescan. And we believe that they can really help not only make sure that the treatment that was done with BYTE is being held on, give them a cleaning afterwards, give them retainer afterwards, but potentially start a relationship with that dentist because we think less than 80% of the BYTE unique visitors have a regular relationship with a specific dentist."

It was interesting last year, where we basically ran the virtual event. One of the things we saw was you didn't necessarily see the urgency to buy around a specific like 2-week period. So we looked at kind of the purchase pattern. It was spread out over 3 to 4 months. And obviously, when you're doing virtual in the middle of pandemic, we probably didn't get as much of a pop as you might have seen in prior years. 
Now we believe that we're going to see a very successful DS World this year. We've got some really good new products. We've got excellent promotions in place with our dealer partners. So we think we're going to have a good DS world. 
Now how does that compare exactly to 2019? Again, it's going to be a little bit hard because we're still working through. This will be probably the first really big dental event held globally, and we're going to see how it works. But we have -- again, we have a -- we think, a very, very full new product lineup. We've got great promotions in place. We're excited. 
By the way, it's not just the products. We have close to 200 continuing education courses. Sign-up for DS World right now has been really positive. It's on track with what we saw in '19. 
In terms of the new products, we kind of talked -- I would group them into 3 things. There's the implant, there's the endo, there's the -- and SureSmile. It’s the kind of things that you want to focus on that are specifically product as opposed to some of the software upgrades. 
Look, the implants, it's not going to be a spike. I mean, one of the things we noticed in our Equipment business -- I mean, you launch a new piece of equipment, there's obviously a big spike. With kind of implants, endo, we think you're going to see a more gradual impact of those. I mean, we get the whole -- we get everything out virtually around the world by the end of the first quarter '22. Some of that might spill into the second quarter, things like the endo motors, and there's a lot of supplemental implant products that will follow off what we're launching at DS World. 
So I tend to look at that more as a back half impact from a revenue perspective than even loaded over the course of the year."

In terms of -- I don't necessarily think we're going to look at that as kind of a separate app, but I think it's part of the ongoing -- again, we have a very interactive relationship with our BYTE  customers. I mean, we talk to them fairly frequently. So that will become part of that process. 
Ultimately, though, we believe that the vibration technology has application well beyond just SureSmile and BYTE. We think it's something that we will continue. By the way, Propel had sold that beyond the U.S., but we will continue offering that to orthodontists and general dentists as a separate product if they want to combine it with their clear aligners,, and the app would be available for that. But it's -- the app is pretty cool. It really helps people -- it helps us understand if we need to give a nudge to a potential patient. ""Hey, we noticed you haven't used your vibration technology in 7 to 10 days, remember, of the wonderful benefits "" And again, we think that's part of the customer experience.

We are pleased with our performance in the second quarter. As we will detail today, the dental market continues to recover and demonstrate the underlying resilience that makes it attractive long term.  
For the quarter, the company grew both versus 2020 and 2019 as well as sequentially quarter-to-quarter. The team also made progress against our strategic and operational priorities, giving us confidence as we head into the back half of the year.  
The pandemic remains a key consideration for us as we evaluate our performance for the quarter and plan for the remainder of the year. At this point, we feel the market is operating slightly below 2019 levels with a continued recovery expected for the remainder of the year. As we navigate through the newest phase of the pandemic, we are mindful that there are -- continues to be some ongoing impact in certain regions and some stresses to the supply chain.  
One constant throughout all of this, though, has been our team at Dentsply Sirona. Their performance over the past 18 months has been exceptional, and I would like to thank them for their tremendous commitment to our customers as they demonstrate every day.  
On today's call, Jorge and I will talk about our results for the quarter and provide our outlook for the remainder of the year and discuss our growth plans for the back half of 2021 and beyond. 
Moving now to Slide 6. As I mentioned, our financial performance for the quarter was solid and closes out a strong first half of the year. The results reflect the continued recovery of the market, progress on our growth initiatives and good operating discipline.  
Revenues reached $1.067 billion, up 104.6% on an organic basis. Our operating margin was 20.5% versus minus 8.6% during the prior year. Adjusted non-GAAP EPS was $0.71 compared to a loss of $0.18 last year and cash flow was $214 million. 
To provide more details around the quarter, I will now turn the call over to Jorge."

As a reminder, my remarks today will be based on non-GAAP financial results unless otherwise noted. Please refer to the reconciliation tables at the back of the press release and slides, both of which are posted in the Investors section of our website.  
As Don said, our second quarter performance rounds out a strong first half of our fiscal year. In Q2, we delivered sequential quarterly revenue growth in both Consumables and T&E. We also posted organic sales above pre-COVID levels in 2019. 
Let's look at Q2 in more detail. Versus last year, the business delivered organic revenue growth of 104.6% and reported growth of 117.3%. Compared to the second quarter of 2019, reported sales grew 5.7% and organic sales grew 3.1%. Both segments also grew versus Q2 2019. This performance against the 2019 baseline confirms the steady recovery trend we have seen in 2021.  
Gross profit was $626 million or 58.7% of sales. This strong outcome reflects the continuation of a favorable mix similar to Q1 as well as the overall portfolio optimization work we have done to focus on higher growth, higher-margin businesses. We're also seeing some challenges from a supply chain cost perspective, and our teams are working diligently to address them.  
Before I start discussing SG&A numbers, I would like to remind you that we now report R&D spend separately from SG&A. As we indicated last quarter, we began to ramp on planned SG&A investment spend in the second quarter.  
We tempered certain investments during the height of COVID, but we are now accelerating projects as the market further normalizes. We are increasing investments in sales and marketing to support our short- and medium-term growth plans in clear aligners, implants and digital capabilities.  
Sequentially, SG&A increased in absolute dollars but remained relatively flat as a percent of sales. Versus the prior year quarter, SG&A as a percent of sales declined 12.6 percentage points to 34.4%.  
Spending on R&D was up 122.2% in the quarter to $40 million. We expect this level of spend to continue as we are committed to delivering innovation and great solutions to our customers. We are taking a disciplined approach to ensure alignment with our strategic priorities and track return on R&D investment.  
Operating profit was $219 million versus a loss of $42 million last year. The business delivered an operating margin of 20.5%, representing continued margin expansion from the realized benefits of our restructuring program. At the same time, we have been able to make meaningful investments in our business to fund growth initiatives. 
Net interest and other expense was flat versus last year. The non-GAAP tax rate in the second quarter was 23.9%, a decrease compared to 26.8% in the prior year quarter, which was a function of the changes in the U.S. versus non-U.S. pretax income.  
Non-GAAP EPS was $0.71 versus a loss of $0.18 in the prior year quarter.  
Moving to segment performance. Versus the second quarter of 2020, Consumables and Technologies & Equipment posted organic growth of 135.3% and 85.2%, respectively. Both segments posted strong growth across all product categories. Consumables sales were $445 million, an increase of 138% versus the prior year.  
Growth was strong across all regions and in all categories, most notably within the endo and resto parts of our portfolio, which represent strategic priorities for our business. Additionally, the rebound in the preventative business, particularly in the U.S., continued in Q2. 
The Consumables market has been resilient, and our team is executing well through the recovery. Currency favorably impacted Consumables by 11.2%, offset by a reduction of 8.5% due to divestitures and discontinued products.  
Moving on to Technologies & Equipment segment results. T&E sales grew 104.6% versus the prior year, with strong growth coming from all regions and product categories. The growth was driven by Digital Dentistry and equipment and instruments, which grew well in excess of 100%.  
The T&E segment also includes our health care business, which show a smaller pandemic-related impact than the dental business in Q2 2020, resulting in a less significant year-on-year growth.  Within T&E, the launch of our new Axeos imaging unit continues to go very well. We're also seeing a strong momentum in Digital Dentistry with digital adoption and upgrade cycles fueling growth for Primescan.  
Our Clear Aligners franchise performed very well in the quarter. Sales growth is strong, and we are confident in the team's ability to deliver on the $300 million 2021 exit run rate shared previously. This quarter, we also announced the acquisition of Propel Orthodontics and a strategic partnership with 3Shape, further complementing our clear aligners offering. We expect to see the benefits from these 2 initiatives starting in 2022. 
Currency favorably impacted sales by 10.4% as well as a benefit from acquisitions of 19%, offset by a reduction of 10% due to divestitures and discontinued products. 
Now turning to financial performance by region during the second quarter. U.S. sales were $366 million a growth of 179.4% versus last year. Organic sales growth was 145.8%. We were pleased to see dental sales volumes return close to normal levels in both segments and across all product categories.  
European sales were $431 million, a growth of 99.5% versus last year. Organic growth was 91.8% compared to the prior year. Similar to U.S. sales, all areas in Consumables and T&E rebounded well from the low point last year. 
Rest of the world sales were $270 million, a growth of 87.5% versus last year. Organic sales growth was 86.2%, reflecting the recovery in demand across Consumables and T&E. The Asia Pacific region, in particular, has been an area of continued growth for our business. 
Next, I'd like to cover cash flows. In the second quarter of 2021, our operating cash flow was $214 million, a $39 million improvement versus last year. The company finished the second quarter with cash on hand of $332 million and committed credit facilities of another $744 million. 
On a year-to-date basis, we deployed more than $241 million to fund strategic acquisitions, including Datum and Propel Orthodontics. We also returned a total of $134 million to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. During the second quarter, we increased the quarterly dividend by 10%. The Board also authorized an increase to our share repurchase program, bringing the total amount to $1 billion. This is inclusive of the $260 million we had remaining from our previous authorization. 
Now let me provide an update on our financial expectations for 2021. We completed a strong first half of the year. We believe the healthy demand will continue through the second half of the year driven by positive momentum in patient confidence and procedure volumes with the vaccine rollout. Based on that, we are reaffirming our outlook for fiscal 2021. We also expect non-GAAP EPS to be close to the top end of the $2.75 to $2.90 range that we provided last quarter.  
Here are a couple of considerations with respect to our outlook. We have updated our assumption for the euro-U.S. dollar exchange rate for the remainder of the year from 1.22 to 1.18. We estimate the impact from this change to be a reduction in projected earnings of approximately $0.05 in the second half of the year.  
Second, this full year outlook includes commitments on investment spend that will be incurred over the remainder of the year. We will continue to operate with a high degree of operational discipline, and we'll manage SG&A expenses in line with the pace of the commercial activities.  
Our key 2021 planning assumptions are listed within the supplemental materials posted on the Investors section of our website. There are 2 risks to this outlook that are worth highlighting. COVID-19 and ongoing supply disruptions. We are watching closely how the situation evolves, especially considering the increased number of cases in some countries and the actions taken by governments to reinstate certain restrictions.  
Before I turn the call back to Don, we would like to share a quick update on our efforts around ESG. During the second quarter of 2021, we published our sustainability fact sheet and environmental scorecard. They are available for review on the Sustainability page of our website. 
Additionally, in May, we announced a global partnership with FDI World Dental Federation, as 1 of 5 industry founding partners to lead the new sustainability in dentistry initiative. Also, we are planning to publish our sustainability report in Q3.  
As we look forward in our ESG evolution, there are a few guiding principles we are keeping in mind. First, we believe purpose and economic value intersect in a clear way in our business. Second, we want to be transparent about our progress by increasing the disclosure of key ESG metrics. And third, we are measuring and analyzing our ESG data, and we'll make sure we adhere to highest standards of data integrity. 
With that, I will now turn the call back to Don."

I would now like to provide some perspective around our strategy and priorities for 2021 and beyond. Moving to Slide 16 in the presentation. Our priorities have been consistent for the past 3 years. They are to grow organic revenues 4%",1623,"Thank you, Jorge. I would now like to provide some perspective around our strategy and priorities for 2021 and beyond. 
Moving to Slide 16 in the presentation. Our priorities have been consistent for the past 3 years. They are to grow organic revenues 4% to 5% long term through a combination of organic and inorganic activities. The team continues to focus on improving margins and expects to achieve our goal of 22% by the end of 2022. Supporting this goal are efforts to simplify the organization and take better advantage of our scale. This formula leads to our target of delivering consistent double-digit EPS growth.  
Slide 17 in the presentation details our strategy. We believe that Dentsply Sirona will grow long term by delivering superior, integrated workflows in critical procedures. These workflows will be built around diagnostic excellence, easy-to-use treatment planning and essential consumable products. When we do this, Dentsply Sirona becomes the essential solution provider that improves outcomes for patients while delivering better efficiency and economics for the dental professional. 
Moving to the next slide. Dentsply Sirona is unique in this space with category-leading brands in both the x-ray imaging and the intraoral scanning spaces. Most companies have one or the other. But we are, by far, the biggest player with both. 
In the imaging space, Dentsply Sirona has a significant installed base comprised of many well-recognized brands that are at the heart of the dental practice. Our imaging brands include Schick, the Orthopos family, Galileos and our new Axeos wide field of view system. Dentists all over the world recognize these brands for their high quality and innovative features.  
For perspective, our imaging systems combine to take over 400 million digital x-ray images a year. What really differentiates Dentsply Sirona, though, is that in addition to our major presence in imaging, we are also a leader in the intraoral scanning space.  
There is already a large and expanding CEREC base that includes Primescan and Omnicam intraoral scanners. While we continue to emphasize the advantage of chairside dentistry, the company is also focused on expanding our presence in the rapidly growing DI space. Our Primescan entry, in addition to being the engine for chairside dentistry, offers outstanding performance as a stand-alone scanner. When dental offices start with Primescan, they get a great scanner that is easy to use and extremely accurate.  
But starting with Primescan is only the beginning. Our system offers tremendous versatility that allows for easy upgrading to full chairside capabilities and further opportunities to expand into other procedures such as clear aligners and implants.  
Aesthetics areas like clear aligners, implants and complex restorations have been among the fastest growing in the dental market. These higher-value procedures are made easier and more efficient when using digital tools. And we are the leader in providing these increasingly important treatment planning tools.  
Our well-recognized treatment planning brands include Sidexis, CEREC, SureSmile, SIMPLANT, Atlantis and M-Guide. All of these treatment planning tools are fully integrated with our digital equipment. To give some context, in a typical year, there will be over 275 million patient cases done in Sidexis and over 4 million cases done through CEREC. The large volume of these cases also provides important fuel for our AI efforts. 
The final element of the strategy is linking the diagnosis and workflow tools with our essential Consumables business. Every implant and endodontic procedure finishes with a restoration, which is why we are optimistic about our ability to drive Consumables in the future. Our 4% to 5% growth target is built on a strong commitment to organic innovation, acquisitions and other inorganic opportunities built on a foundation of global commercial excellence.  
Organic innovation is our lifeblood. And as Jorge mentioned, our investment in R&D has been increased by close to 50%, reaching $160 million in 2021. This investment is helping drive a very robust pipeline for the back half of this year with continued progress in 2022.  
Moving now to Slide 19. In September, we will be launching a comprehensive restage of our implant business. The restage puts together our digital base, historical product strength with other key elements like custom abutments and continuing education and training. The program starts with harmonizing all our implant businesses under the Dentsply Sirona brand name, including our rapidly growing MIS value implant business.  
It will include strong new products, highlighted by Prime Taper, an immediate load implant that will position us very competitively in the marketplace. We will also be updating our well-recognized SIMPLANT treatment planning software and integrating it with CEREC. We're also focusing on our Atlantis Custom Abutment business, which has very easy-to-use planning software for custom abutments. 
For perspective, we process well over 0.5 million implant cases through SIMPLANT and Atlantis on an annual basis. For the first time, we are offering an edentulous scanning program for CEREC, a major development in the implant space. The edentulous scan takes advantage of Primescan's unique accuracy and provides a whole new level of detail that makes full arch implant planting easier. 
While we are in the process of rolling out -- we are in the process of rolling out the OSSIX bone regeneration brand to further enhance our implant offering and serve the rapidly growing immediate load implant segment in general. All our implant training and continuing education efforts will be harmonized and rebranded to provide a comprehensive implant curriculum for dentists.  
We've been working closely with our global implant KOL community, and they have started gaining experience with the product. The reaction has been very positive. They are very comfortable with the new products in part because they are based on a procedure they know well. The revitalization of our implant business is an important piece of our overall growth strategy.  
This relaunch will begin in September and continue rolling out globally throughout Q2 2022. 
Moving now to Slide 20. Our endodontic platform is another critical area for us. Beginning in September, we will be launching ProTaper Ultimate as part of a new platform that will include new files, a bio ceramic (sic) [ bio ceramic sealant ] sealer and a new disinfection device. 
In addition, we will be launching multiple new motor systems in early 2022. The ProTaper Ultimate system really takes performance to the next level. the files have been designed to cut and shape better and faster, requiring less files per procedure. The complete system will offer better cleaning and op duration as well. ProTaper Ultimate is the first major platform we have launched in the endo area in several years. It has also been in the hands of our KOLs and it was met with a very positive response. 
There are also several critical software upgrades and launches coming in the back half of 2021. These include a major SureSmile upgrade 7.7. This upgrade improves the user interface for the GP, simplifying the case review screen and enhancing the order entry process.  
We're also launching CEREC 5.2, a significant upgrade in Primescan that further enhances its speed and ease of use. This CEREC 5.2 upgrade supports the new edentulous scanning capability and differentiates Primescan in the marketplace. Early beta testers have indicated that this software upgrade provides a level of performance that makes it feel like a whole new product. 
There are also multiple new SureSmile product launches coming over the next 2 quarters. These include the introduction of a VPro product as well as whitening in Q4. With VPro, which came as part of the Propel acquisition, SureSmile will be differentiated in the marketplace. All of these new products will be launched at our DS World event in September.
Moving to the next slide. In addition to our organic innovation program, Jorge detailed some of the strategic acquisitions made over the last several months. All of these are designed to enhance our competitiveness in higher-growth, higher-margin categories, including clear aligners and implants. I wanted to add to his comments by saying that we are very happy with the BYTE acquisition. We've had BYTE for close to 8 months and are very pleased with the integration program and excited about its future growth prospects.  
As mentioned earlier, we also closed on Propel in Q2, and we recently acquired Datum to provide us with a leading bone growth regeneration product to accelerate our implant businesses. These businesses are off to a strong start and their integrations are on target.  
All of this is powered by our outstanding global commercial team comprised of over 5,000 people. We've been investing in a comprehensive sales force effectiveness program that will be close to completed in our 10 largest countries by the end of this year. 
Over the past 2 years, the team has also made solid progress against our goal of improving our operating margin and simplifying the organization. We've rationalized our manufacturing and supply chain, launched a comprehensive enterprise modernization program around key functions, all while maintaining strong expense discipline. As a result, we will deliver the $250 million savings target and the '22 margin goal on time. 
Moving to Slide 23. In summary, we had a strong first half as the market recovered and the company made progress on key strategic goals. We are reaffirming our 2021 outlook. The dental market continues to show resilience as well as strong underlying fundamentals. We believe that Dentsply Sirona is well positioned to deliver sustainable growth in the future.  
And finally, we are pleased to confirm that DS World will again be welcoming guests to Las Vegas, September 23 through the 25th, at Caesars Forum while also offering a hybrid option. It is an excellent way to build momentum in the back half of the year. 
And with that, we can open the call to questions."

And listen, from a macro perspective, we feel really good about how the business is tracking. The execution by our teams has been solid all year. And the progression of the business, as demonstrated by the last several quarters, is consistent. Also, I mean, if you remember, we were the first company that provided guidance at the beginning of this year. And then right after the first quarter, given the performance we had in Q1, we actually raised our guidance in a meaningful way for the rest of the year. 
Q2, we performed very much according to our expectations. It was a solid quarter, and we believe the second half is going to be better than the first half. But as I pointed out in my prepared remarks, there's a few things to keep in mind, and we talked about this in Q1. First, we have investment spend that we move from Q1 and partially from Q2 into the second half of the year because we didn't spend at the pace we were planning to spend in the first half of the year. So that is important. And those investments, by the way, are intended to fund very important priorities for us, for example, clear aligners. Our clear aligners business, as we discussed, is growing and we are adding more resources because we are launching aligners in other countries. 
We are also making investments in our implants. Don talked about what's going on with our implant business, and we continue to make investments in our digital capabilities, both in terms of a go-to-market strategy and products that are important for our customers as well as internal infrastructure. 
And then I also mentioned this in my prepared remarks, there is an impact from a planning perspective resulting from our change in assumptions relative to the euro exchange rate. So when we provided guidance at the beginning of the year, this was one of the assumptions that I shared with all of you. We said at the time that we were expecting the euro to be at the 1.22 level, and we have not seen that this year. So for the remainder of the year, we decided to change the assumption, and now we are using 1.18. That change in assumptions represents about $0.05 in the second half of the year. 
So when you kind of look at all of those pieces and do the math, I think we feel good about being at the top end of our range. And we always -- we are never satisfied. We always want to do better, and -- but we are really -- we feel good about the consistency in our results and performance this year. So for all those reasons, that's why we have kept the guidance where it is now."

Implants is going to be a big feature of DS World because, look, we really want to talk about being the first kind of digitally native implant company.

So yes, you're going to see a fair amount of that at DS World. 
Look, DS World is going to feature, we think, a pretty exciting lineup of new products, whether it was what we're doing in the endo space. We're really excited about the restage of our implant business. But also, really, I don't want to undersell the CEREC 5.2. I mean, the folks who have been using this for a while really say it's like almost a new product because it cuts the time you need to do a scan. It enhances accuracy. And when we're adding specific treatment planning around things like in dental scanning, doing a real integration with SureSmile, with 7.7, we're really trying to make digital workflows the heart of everything we do."

And I think there was a fair amount of catch-up across the board. And as we look at 2Q, we saw a pretty -- again, consistent, whether it's Consumables, Technology & Equipment. By the way, Jorge in his prepared remarks called out our Wellspect business, the healthcare business, which obviously wasn't really impacted by the pandemic. So that's a piece of that business, you kind of have a normal growth rate there compared to the really significant dental growth rates of triple digits. 
The only other thing I'd point out, Jeff, when you start looking versus 2019, there's 2 points I’d direct your attention to. The first is, remember, Q1, Q2 in '19, we were coming off the Primescan launch, and we were actually a little bit back ordered in there with a lot of that actually delivered in the first and second quarter. 
And the second point in that around the Consumables business, we had really begun to implement a comprehensive program to change how we promote things and looking to focus much more on One DS-type programs that were aimed directly at creating retail demand as opposed to focus on wholesale activity. So there's -- we were working through that specific thing. If we hadn't been pandemic-ed, if that's even a word, Jeff, we would have seen that kind of level out through 2020. So you had that distortion associated with the pandemic.
And so now when you're looking at '21 versus '19, we're working our way through that comp, which might have been a little bit higher in '19 versus what we're seeing now as we level load and really focus on stuff like One DS as a preferred promotional program."

Datum, generally immaterial, a little bit of contribution.
So is it fair to think about that 19% acquisition growth in T&E specifically largely or majority of that being driven by BYTE, and that would suggest kind of sequentially BYTE stepped up probably 20% plus, is that reasonable as well?"

First, we've been very public about saying we're unhappy with our implant performance. And basically, we said it was -- we thought it was a 2-stager, where, look, we've got to get back to growth part 1 and then we got to grow with the category or faster than the category. And you know this. Historically, we've been really kind of balkanized around our implant approach. We had 4 premium brands between  Ankylos, XiVE, Astra and Astra EV. I don't think people really understood we had a very competitive value brand in MIS that's actually been growing at, if not faster, than the market.  
The other thing, we've never really called out the -- our custom abutments business, which is -- the brand name we have is Atlantis, which is, again, growing at, if not faster, than market. 
So when we step back, we said, ""Hey, look, we have a fairly aggressive new product, set of programs, and we dovetailed the new products with -- as well as the digital offerings."" We've really, I think, done a nice job upgrading SIMPLANT and integrating it with CEREC. So when we put this all together, we think it gives us the opportunity to reset our brand image and our promise across the marketplace. 
So I would tell you, I think it's going to be very significant. I mean, if we have been growing our implant business at market levels, it would be significantly higher than what we performed at in the last 2 to 3 years. So again, we feel good that this gets us -- it's not going to happen instantly, but we feel good as we start exiting '22, we want to be extremely competitive in this marketplace and growing at market levels. 
And then in terms of, Tycho, value, premium value, they really kind of go hand in hand. I mean, the growth rate of our MIS business has been faster than our premium business. I think with the relaunch, we'll accelerate the premium side and we'd like to see both of them growing at market levels."

And one of the things that we've been focusing on is doing a better job of targeting over time. 
So as we look at that business, it's performing above expectations and that has incorporated some changes that we are making. The stuff that we get excited about over time, though, is, look, we think BYTE continues to represent a great opportunity to bring its underserved population, which a lot of people in BYTE aren't necessarily regular dental customers and how do we bring them into the fold? If somebody just spent close to $2,000 on doing a BYTE treatment, we want to help them really understand to continue making sure that they get value out of that procedure. They go see their dentists, go get a cleaning. And then we're going to be working with the dentist to follow up on things, like, how do you do a retainer and other things. 
But if -- again, one of the things we were attracted to around BYTE was really the fact that they were hitting underserved populations that weren't really exposed to dentists and -- but we think we have a unique opportunity, given the role we play to bring them into the dental fold."

It really depends on where they are and what part of the country, how much exposure they have to -- the south versus the east, west or north. But for all intent and purposes, we think it's a couple of percentage points versus where they were in '19. When we talk to them, and whether you talk to kind of the big -- close to 600, 700 offices or even kind of the large group practices, people, by and large, think the vaccine -- and the fact that some people haven't been to the dentist in 18 months, they're really kind of trying to get back in, is going to lead to a pretty steady recovery. So our expectation is even if the delta variant kind of forces people to shut down, I think the dental community has learned to deal with that and to proactively reach out to their patients and assure them about their safety. 
In terms of dealer inventory, first, we've been super happy with our dealer partners, I mean, both the large and small. They've done a really good job, in our opinion, on helping us buffer some pretty radical supply chain swing -- not supply chain swings, demand swings. If you look at where we were a year ago, it was basically shut down and now we're all the way back to '19. 
And our customer service levels, as we track it, the dentists have been pretty good. I would tell you, they've been challenged to maintain inventory. Obviously, a lot of their planning looks back on kind of a last 6-month, 9-month program, which would incorporate pandemic-related reductions. And we're working with them every day to make sure that they're getting adequate inventory to service the customer needs. And that's an ongoing process.

I mean, first, there's a lot of things that are going to go on with BYTE that we're extremely happy with. I mean, we -- first, from a marketing in the U.S. perspective, we expect a market at competitive levels. Some of the things we're beginning to do though is, we have been a very paid social, kind of, focused business. We're looking at bringing other areas in, whether that's search engine optimization or whether that's recos from other places, like, as we begin to bring this into the dentist office. 
We've got some great new products coming and some updates around that. Obviously, as Propel has become part of our business, we're going to look to continue to differentiate that business by virtue of our vibration technology, which we think is -- it makes the byproduct differentiated in the marketplace. 
And as we get out in 2022, I mean, one of the things that we get excited about the clear aligner business in general is whether it's the direct-to-consumer or whether it's through the dentist channel. I mean, we're still in the very, very early stages of penetration of this business. I mean, if you look at people who would be eligible for a class 1 treatment, do we think we're at 10% penetration in the U.S.? Probably not. 
The other opportunities we have with BYTE as well as with SureSmile is how do we take this out of the U.S. Jorge mentioned in his prepared remarks that at this point we're probably getting close to 10 countries now with SureSmile, and we're going to look to expand that. And we think BYTE has got real application because it's a unique product and it's a unique way to reach potentially underserved populations outside the U.S. So we think it can grow that way. 
And I've mentioned a couple of times, we really think that we have an outstanding relationship with the dental community all around. And one of the things that we'd like to do is take a lot of the traffic that we're generating with BYTE and all these unique visitors, and again to introduce them to dentists that would be part of our curated network, where they would have a Primescan. And we believe that they can really help not only make sure that the treatment that was done with BYTE is being held on, give them a cleaning afterwards, give them retainer afterwards, but potentially start a relationship with that dentist because we think less than 80% of the BYTE unique visitors have a regular relationship with a specific dentist."

It was interesting last year, where we basically ran the virtual event. One of the things we saw was you didn't necessarily see the urgency to buy around a specific like 2-week period. So we looked at kind of the purchase pattern. It was spread out over 3 to 4 months. And obviously, when you're doing virtual in the middle of pandemic, we probably didn't get as much of a pop as you might have seen in prior years. 
Now we believe that we're going to see a very successful DS World this year. We've got some really good new products. We've got excellent promotions in place with our dealer partners. So we think we're going to have a good DS world. 
Now how does that compare exactly to 2019? Again, it's going to be a little bit hard because we're still working through. This will be probably the first really big dental event held globally, and we're going to see how it works. But we have -- again, we have a -- we think, a very, very full new product lineup. We've got great promotions in place. We're excited. 
By the way, it's not just the products. We have close to 200 continuing education courses. Sign-up for DS World right now has been really positive. It's on track with what we saw in '19. 
In terms of the new products, we kind of talked -- I would group them into 3 things. There's the implant, there's the endo, there's the -- and SureSmile. It’s the kind of things that you want to focus on that are specifically product as opposed to some of the software upgrades. 
Look, the implants, it's not going to be a spike. I mean, one of the things we noticed in our Equipment business -- I mean, you launch a new piece of equipment, there's obviously a big spike. With kind of implants, endo, we think you're going to see a more gradual impact of those. I mean, we get the whole -- we get everything out virtually around the world by the end of the first quarter '22. Some of that might spill into the second quarter, things like the endo motors, and there's a lot of supplemental implant products that will follow off what we're launching at DS World. 
So I tend to look at that more as a back half impact from a revenue perspective than even loaded over the course of the year."

Ultimately, though, we believe that the vibration technology has application well beyond just SureSmile and BYTE. We think it's something that we will continue. By the way, Propel had sold that beyond the U.S., but we will continue offering that to orthodontists and general dentists as a separate product if they want to combine it with their clear aligners,, and the app would be available for that.

Overall, we continue to be pleased with the recovery in the dental market, how we are operating and our prospects for growth in the future. During this quarter, our top line showed strong growth versus both 2020 and importantly, against the pre-pandemic level in 2019. This growth was seen across most business units and regions. 
And looking at the remainder of the year, we have good momentum, but are mindful that the pandemic remains a key variable. Before we get into the details of the quarter, I did want to acknowledge the entire Dentsply Sirona team. Throughout the pandemic and now in the recovery phase, they have remained focused on delivering for the customer, disciplined in how they operate and committed to making progress against our strategic goals. It is a privilege to be part of this group. 
Moving now to Slide 6. As I mentioned, our financial performance in the third quarter was quite strong with revenues reaching $1,069,000,000. This represents a robust 21% increase on an organic basis. Our operating margin was 20.2% versus 22% in the prior year as SG&A and R&D investments increased to reflect the recovery in the market as well as our commitment to innovation. Adjusted non-GAAP EPS was $0.68. That is an increase versus $0.67 a year ago. 
Cash flow was $172 million for the quarter. to provide more details around the quarter, I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Jorge Gomez."

As a reminder, my remarks today will be based on non-GAAP financial results unless otherwise noted. Please refer to the reconciliation tables at the back of the press release and slides both of which are posted in the Investors section of our website. 
In the third quarter, we delivered strong revenue growth across the business in both consumables and T&E. The business delivered organic revenue growth of 21.1% and reported growth of 19.4%. Because the pandemic makes it difficult to gauge growth, I want to point out that we also posted robust organic sales growth versus 2019 pre-COVID levels. 
Compared to the third quarter of 2019, reported sales grew 11.1% and organic sales grew 10.7%, driven by growth in both segments and across all regions. This performance against the 2019 baseline confirms the steady recovery trend we have seen in 2021. Gross profit was $624 million or 58.4% of sales. Our margin rate remained steady, reflecting a balanced contribution from all of our businesses and a more normalized mix. 
Looking back, we have delivered 150 basis points of gross margin expansion since Q3 2019, the pre-COVID baseline attributed to portfolio optimization and our efforts to simplify the organization over the last few years. As you all know, the global supply chain environment continues to be a challenge in terms of cost, availability of components and labor across industries. So far, we have been able to meet demand at a normal pace and continue to work on various operational strategies to minimize the impact to our customers and to our P&L. 
Now turning to SG&A. In the third quarter, we had expenses of $373 million or 34.9% of sales. This ratio remains below pre-COVID 2019 levels, reflecting the benefits from our efficiency improvement initiatives. Quarter-over-quarter, SG&A increased as we ramped planned SG&A investments, particularly in sales and marketing to support our growth plans in strategic areas, including clear aligners, implants and digital capabilities. 
Q3 spending on R&D was up 31.6% year-over-year to $35 million. We expect this level of increased investment to continue as we are committed to delivering innovation and great solutions to our customers. As a result of the heightened emphasis on R&D over the last few years, we are pleased to see a much healthier solutions pipeline, as Don will discuss later. 
Turning now to profitability. Operating profit grew to $216 million versus $197 million last year. Operating margin was 20.2%. Looking back we have delivered 230 basis points of operating margin expansion since Q3 2019, the pre-COVID baseline. We have expanded margins and we have also made meaningful investments in our business, which are essential to fund sustainable long-term growth initiatives. 
Net interest and other expense increased versus last year mainly due to the impact from foreign exchange fluctuations. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate increased to 23.4% from 20.3% in the prior year quarter, primarily due to the geographic mix of pretax income and our continued business recovery from COVID. 
Turning to earnings. EPS was $0.68 versus $0.67 in the prior year quarter. Moving to segment performance. Versus the third quarter of 2020, Consumables and Technologies & Equipment grew 15.9% and 25.3%, respectively. Both segments posted strong growth across all product categories. The Consumables segment had sales of $440 million, an organic increase of 15.9% versus the prior year. 
Overall growth was strong across all regions and in all categories, most notably within the endo and rest of parts of our portfolio, which represent strategic priorities for our business. This quarter, we launched PrimeTaper Ultimate, the first major endolontic platform innovation launched in our endo business in more than 5 years. 
Market reaction thus far have been very positive. Additionally, the rebound in the preventative business, particularly in the U.S., continued in Q3. The Consumables market has been resilient, and our teams are executing well through the recovery. Currency favorably impacted consumable sales by 1.3%, offset by a reduction of 4.8% due to divestitures and discontinued products. 
Moving on to Technologies & Equipment segment results. T&E organic sales grew 25.3% versus the prior year with a strong overall growth in all regions and product categories. Growth was most notably driven by the digital category and implants. There continues to be a strong momentum on increasing digital capabilities within dental offices. Demand is high for digital devices such as Primescan and imaging equipment such as our new Axeos unit. 
We are seeing a growing trend in dental offices upgrading from 2D to 3D units, and we are observing this trend in all global markets. Our Clear Aligners franchise drove strong year-over-year growth this quarter. The aligners market continues to grow faster than most categories, and the aligners business is a key contributor to our growth strategy. 
In the dentist directed channel, SureSmile continues its expansion domestically and internationally. In addition, the new software we recently launched has been positively received by the market due to its significant user experience enhancements. The upcoming launch of VPro will be another key differentiator for our SureSmile offering. As you may recall, when we acquired Propel, earlier in the year, we indicated our intention to utilize it for SureSmile as well. 
SureSmile is on track to meet our run rate goal for the year. After a very strong first half in 2021, the DTC channel experienced softness in Q3. We believe this is largely attributed to COVID recovery dynamics and seasonality. Given the run rate we are seeing for BYTE in the second half of this year, there is a possibility we may not fully achieve the annualized run rate goal for this year. DTC is an exciting new category in the dental industry and BYTE is strategically positioned for growth with its focus on customer experience and key differentiators such as high provide and high engagement with customers through the entire aligner journey. 
Lastly, within T&E, currency favorably impacted sales by 1.2% as well as a benefit from acquisitions of 7.7%, offset by a reduction of 9.4% due to divestitures and discontinued products. Now turning to financial performance by region during the third quarter. 
U.S. sales were $399 million, a growth of 25.3% versus last year. Organic sales growth was 20.1%. U.S. dental sales volumes remain at close to normal levels in both segments despite COVID variant that spiked late in the quarter. European sales were also $399 million, a growth of 13.6% versus last year. Organic growth was 17.8%. Similar to the U.S. sales, the majority of product lines in consumables and T&E are running at pre-COVID levels or better. 
Rest of the World sales were $271 million, a growth of 20.1% versus last year. Organic sales growth was 27.8%, reflecting recovery in demand across consumables and T&E. The APAC region has delivered continued growth for our business throughout the entire fiscal year 2021. 
Next, I'd like to cover cash flow. In the third quarter of 2021, we generated operating cash flow of $172 million and free cash flow of $137 million. During this quarter, we paid our regular dividend and repaid long-term debt of $296 million, which mature in July. We finished the quarter with cash on hand of $281 million. Year-to-date, we have generated $435 million in operating cash flow and $334 million in free cash flow. 
On a year-to-date basis, we have deployed more than $248 million to fund strategic acquisitions, including Dan and Propel Orthodontics. We have also returned a total of $158 million to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. Our financial position and balance sheet remain strong. We are well positioned to continue to deploy capital strategically. 
Now let me provide an update on our financial expectations for 2021. Based on the solid performance of our business year-to-date and the current market trends, we are increasing our estimates for 2021 as follows. We are tightening our revenue outlook by increasing the bottom of our range. We now expect revenues to be in the $4.25 billion to $4.3 billion range. 
With respect to EPS, we are increasing and narrowing our estimates for fiscal year 2021. The new EPS outlook range is now $2.87 to $2.92. This range is based on a new assumption for the euro to USD rate of 1.16. This is lower than the fiscal year '21 budget assumption of 1.22 and lower than last quarter's assumption for the second half of the year of 1.18. 
Given our long euro exposure, a weaker euro represents a net headwind to our P&L. Overall, we are very pleased with the current momentum in our business and our new 2021 outlook for revenue and earnings reflects that confidence. 
To close my remarks, we are proud to share the progress we're making in our sustainability journey. As you may remember, we indicated a few months ago that we were taking substantive steps to advance sustainability. I am happy to report that just a few weeks ago, we share our sustainability strategy with a broad range of stakeholders at DS World and also publish our 2020 Sustainability Report and our 2025 Goals. 
It is our commitment to be transparent and accountable with respect to our strategy and goals. Going forward, we will measure our progress within 3 sustainability verticals, Healthy Planet, Healthy Smiles and Healthy Business. To support our Healthy Smiles pillar, this quarter, we entered into a 5-year partnership with SmileTrain and committed $5 million to the organization. SmileTrain is a nonprofit organization that provides corrective surgery for children with cleft lips and pallets across the world. 
We're excited by the opportunity to help improve oral health for children worldwide. I encourage you to visit the sustainability hub on our website to check out our metrics and actions within each of our sustainability verticals. We are convinced that our commitment to sustainability will deliver long-term value to our stakeholders. 
With that, I will now turn the call back to Don."

Moving on, I wanted to provide some additional perspective around our strategy and priorities going forward. Moving to Slide 17 in the presentation. Our priorities have remained consistent over the last few years, which has allowed us to",1318,"Thank you, Jorge. Moving on, I wanted to provide some additional perspective around our strategy and priorities going forward. Moving to Slide 17 in the presentation. Our priorities have remained consistent over the last few years, which has allowed us to stay very focused on delivering consistent results. These priorities are to grow revenues 4% to 5% long term through a combination of organic and inorganic activities. 
The second is to drive our margin to 22% by 2022. Essential to these efforts is the third priority, simplifying the organization to better leverage our scale as one of the largest companies in the dental space. When we meet these goals, we deliver consistent and sustainable double-digit EPS growth. 
Moving to Slide 18 to detail some of the progress we've made against those priorities. Growth is our overriding priority with the objective being to deliver 4% to 5% top line increases long term. We've made important progress against this goal. In addition to the 21% growth for the quarter. Year-to-date, we have delivered an increase of 35.9% versus 2020. 
It is also worth noting that for the entire year 2019, the last period prior to the pandemic, organic growth was 6.1%. This kind of performance gives us confidence in our growth strategy and our priorities. We will keep driving growth by focusing on 4 areas: They include building on our leading role in digital dentistry; accelerating our rapidly growing clear aligner franchise; delivering major innovations in critical areas; and building out our capabilities in faster-growing parts of the world. 
Our portfolio moves over the last few years also reflect these priorities and have resulted in increasing our exposure to faster-growing areas of the dental markets. Turning to the next priority around margin expansion. We are confident that we will deliver the 22% margin goal by the end of 2022. We are realizing the benefits of a 3-year restructuring plan as well as portfolio reshaping efforts. Our team also continues working on simplifying the organization, both structurally as well as how we work. 
A great example of this is our comprehensive enterprise modernization program under Jorge's leadership that increases the use of automation and digital tools across the company to improve efficiency and the customer experience. These efforts have helped us deliver significant headcount efficiencies, and we are on track to deliver the $250 million in savings that we outlined in 2018. 
Looking out to the future, our strategy outlined on Page 19, is to develop superior integrated workflows built on diagnostic excellence, easy-to-use treatment planning and essential products that improve outcomes for patients and dental practices. On Page 20, Dentsply Sirona's impressive digital foundation as outlined. It starts with a large global footprint in imaging with major brands like Schick, Orthophos, Gallileos and our newest addition, Axeos. 
Our large CEREC franchise that includes both chairside and DI is another critical component in our robust digital foundation. As Jorge noted, coming out of the pandemic, both of these digital businesses have strong momentum as dentists globally are looking to upgrade their practices. By adding these more powerful diagnostic tools like Primescan and 3D imaging, they can incorporate more complex procedures into their practice with competence. 
Adding these more sophisticated diagnostic tools also creates an opportunity to take advantage of treatment planning for complex cases like implants and clear aligners. Treatment planning helps the dentists map out the entire procedure. This increases their efficiency while elevating their confidence, which can lead to better results for the patient. 
Dentsply Sirona is one of the largest providers of treatment planning in all of dentistry with brands like Sidexis, CEREC, Atlantis, Simplant and SureSmile. We look at this digital foundation as one of our most important assets, and this area is a major investment priority for us. These will drive faster innovation, expanded treatment planning capabilities and accelerated progress in the areas of artificial intelligence. 
These efforts are now supported by over 500 software engineers within Dentsply Sirona today, that are helping us continue leading the digital dental revolution. Moving to Page 21. Innovation is our lifeblood, and we have delivered several innovations in 2021 in key areas like implants and Endo. At DS World, several of our major innovations were on display. Rather than just launching products, our customers could see our approach is based on simplifying critical workflows from diagnosis to delivering the final treatment in ways that can transform their practices. 
Our ability to work across the entire procedure is truly unique to Dentsply Sirona. The fact that we address so many of the key procedures gives us a real advantage as we look to become the essential partner to the practice. A great example of this was the comprehensive restage of our implant businesses announced last month. For us, it's not just about launching a new screw and abutment. It is about rethinking the entire implant workflow and bringing all the assets of Dentsply Sirona together to help simplify things for the dentist. 
It starts with moving to one brand name, Dentsply Sirona implants. It includes adding tools to Primescan that actually allow for in dental scanning a real breakthrough while also advancing innovative multi and single tooth replacement capabilities. It includes a Simpan treatment planning refresh and a comprehensive continuing education program to support a digital approach to implants. 
It allows us to deploy Lucitone to enhance performance of digital ventures. We have a best-in-class bone growth product with ASX. The team here is also really excited about the launch of PrimeTaper. This is an immediate load self tapping product that is built off a well-known procedure. The system has launched in the U.S. and EMEA to excellent initial reviews. And this is the kind of integrated innovation across a critical procedure that we believe transforms dentistry. 
We're also adding new products to our MIS value implant business to continue building momentum in this rapidly growing franchise. At DS World, we also launched ProTaper Ultimate in the endodontic space, as Jorge mentioned, representing a major innovation in this important therapeutic area. It's more than a file, and it includes a great cleaning product as well as a new operation system that includes a new bioceramic sealant. Early users of the system, which we call the trifecta are really excited about the ProTaper Ultimate system as it simplifies the procedure significantly. 
We have also launched a major software upgrade in CEREC called 5.2 as well as SureSmile 7.6. CEREC 5.2 is so powerful that it makes Primescan feel like a totally new product. And it takes its category-leading speed and accuracy to new levels. SureSmile 7.6 makes major progress around our user interface. We also have a full slate of news for our clear aligner franchise. As we have 2 brands, we are maximizing the investment in both R&D and manufacturing by offering the innovations across both the SureSmile and the BYTE businesses. 
Innovations in this space include our vibration technology, VPro and HyperByte for improved comfort. We also are launching new whitening products in the near term. To finish the discussion around innovation, there was major progress in 2021 that will pay dividends going forward. 
I would also note that we have a very robust pipeline going forward that we will bring to the market in the future. Moving now to Slide 22. To summarize, our strong performance year-to-date gives us confidence going forward for the remainder of 2021. We have good momentum leading into the future. Our results reflect the underlying resilience of the dental market and our team's disciplined performance against our operational goals and progress against our key strategic priorities. Based on this, as Jorge said, we are raising our '21 earnings outlook. Going beyond the quarter-to-quarter discussion, we also believe that Dentsply Sirona is well positioned to transform dentistry and deliver sustainable growth going forward. 
And with that, we will now open the call to questions."

And as we are kind of entering this recovery phase, we're seeing across not just the DTC clear aligner space, but a number of consumer businesses, consumers have choices in terms of where they're spending discretionary income. And all of a sudden, people are going on vacations and other things. 
So we think we're seeing a little bit of seasonality, and we're seeing some competition for discretionary spending among our core target audience. What we think going forward, first is that, look, we think clear aligners -- our clear liner strategy is predicated on, look, we've got a DTC space, and we -- DTC entry, and we have obviously a directed dentist entry. 
And we'll look to see growth in both of those segments. As what we saw in Q3, again, a little bit of seasonality. We think this is a little bit of consumers looking at other discretionary spending. I would tell you, we were -- obviously, when we sit down and prepare all this stuff, we were reflected on the fact that in basically, the second quarter 2018, we had 0 sales in clear aligners. And today, we've got a -- if it was an independent SBU, it would be one of our more significant franchises. And one that we expect to continue providing a lot of growth into the future."

We're optimistic as we begin to push that outside the U.S., and we have made progress doing that, that we expect to see continued growth on SureSmile. 
The plans for BYTE are also to begin to pick that up. I mean we're looking at bite in a couple of different ways. I mean the first is we have new products that are coming in that direction, Part 1, part 2 is we believe that there's opportunity to expand this outside the U.S. We think the DTC channel in places in Asia and other areas, is doing pretty well. 
So we really think that we've got a great product and want to participate in those regions. And then one of the things that we remain optimistic about is we really think that BYTE is going to play a role with our relationships with the professional. Obviously, when people come in to BYTE, not everybody is eligible for BYTE, they can be referred over to Dennis, that we believe that would have Primescan and other things and go right into SureSmile. 
So the BYTE to us is a strategic play that gives us opportunities to grow in a number of different areas."

It is more expensive in some cases to procure certain materials. We have managed all of that so far. So with respect to what we're seeing in the inventory pipeline or channel, we haven't seen any major disruptions. Any changes really of material significance at this point. But as you know, this is a global situation, and it's something that is hard to predict at this point. But so far, we -- our financials are not -- have not been impacted by the supply chain issues in a material way other than some elevated costs that we have been able to offset or in some cases, for example, we did a price increase. We announced a price increase effective October 1. Some of that helps offset some of the incremental costs that we are facing."

So we've worked our way through that. In terms of what headwinds are we seeing in Q3 that are different than Q2. Q3 is vacation time.

And literally, people were talking about, well, we're taking our first vacation since the pandemic and other things. 
So statistically, we -- basically, we think there's seasonality associated with people going on vacation, people heading into school. And then it is somewhat confounded by what's going on in the kind of the pandemic where you've got pent-up demand for consumer spending in other areas.

There is -- specifically with respect to your question about consumables, there's always between quarters, there's always the possibility of timing situations. 
And I indicated before, we announced a price increase for October 1. And this is the annual price increase that we normally put in place. Every time we do, we make these announcements, there is probably a movement of revenue from month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter. And so there's a possibility that there was some acceleration, probably not material, but some acceleration of consumable sales from Q4 into Q3 in anticipation of the price increase. 
And there is a couple of other things like that, that are timing related. But the macro point is there is sequential growth, the organic growth rate that we are indicating for total 2021, I mean if you look at the range, from 22% to 25%, and it's closer to 25% organic growth, total top line revenue growth versus last year. Those are strong numbers."

Listen, it's hard to predict how long the supply chain issues are going to last because again, this is not something unique to the dental industry. This is impacting pretty much all manufacturing industries globally. So we are a relatively small piece of that big, big equation. 
We are taking a lot of actions to minimize the impact. Procurement, doing a lot of great work trying to identify new sources for certain components. We are renegotiating certain contracts ensuring that we have access to supply for some key components on a predictable basis. So that's all short-term things that we're doing. 
I think there are some more long-term solutions that are somewhat related to the supply chain issues, but also related to our desire to be more efficient and improve the margins of our products. So for example, in many cases, we are harmonizing certain products or components that we were sourcing from different source, from multiple sources. We are now trying to consolidate. We're trying to harmonize the design of these components and that should help us improve the reliability of the supply. 
And then we're trying to make sure that we look at the balancing of our manufacturing operations, ensuring that we have at the right time, the right components to ensure that the lines are working efficiently for predictable periods of time as opposed to stop and starting based on unpredictable patterns of supply. So there's a lot of things going on. And the -- as I said before, the supply chain team is doing a great job. And that's why, so far, we have not impacted our ability to manufacture products."

But one of the things we've done since acquiring BYTE is really helping them look at search engine optimization and how do you do a better job creating content that's really meaningful to potential customers. 
We have a very aggressive affiliate marketing program, and we continue to have a pretty good program to aimed at insurers. So as we think about that, the level of marketing within BYTE is we don't expect it to change. We've been very disciplined like we're not going to go chase unprofitable volume, and that's been a key thing for us. But the also -- the other thing that we're very mindful of, we think it's got a really good runway in front of it.

We feel very good about the fact that we've created not only a more simple organization but one that's much more functional. And our team in here is really excited about the future. For those of you guys got to attend DS World, you could kind of see how we're laying things out from a procedure perspective and why we think Dentsply Sirona is really well positioned to become the essential partner and Dennis practices all over the world. So I'll close it out and say thank you all and look forward to catching up in some of the one-on-one sessions."

Overall, we continue to be pleased with the recovery in the dental market, how we are operating and our prospects for growth in the future. During this quarter, our top line showed strong growth versus both 2020 and importantly, against the pre-pandemic level in 2019. This growth was seen across most business units and regions.  
And looking at the remainder of the year, we have good momentum, but are mindful that the pandemic remains a key variable. Before we get into the details of the quarter, I did want to acknowledge the entire Dentsply Sirona team. Throughout the pandemic and now in the recovery phase, they have remained focused on delivering for the customer, disciplined in how they operate and committed to making progress against our strategic goals. It is a privilege to be part of this group.
Moving now to Slide 6. As I mentioned, our financial performance in the third quarter was quite strong with revenues reaching $1.069 billion. This represents a robust 21% increase on an organic basis. Our operating margin was 20.2% versus 22% in the prior year as SG&A and R&D investments increased to reflect the recovery in the market as well as our commitment to innovation. Adjusted non-GAAP EPS was $0.68, that is an increase versus $0.67 a year ago.
Cash flow was $172 million for the quarter. To provide more details around the quarter, I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Jorge Gomez."

Good morning, and thanks to all of you for joining us to discuss another strong quarter in our fiscal year 2021. As a reminder, my remarks today will be based on non-GAAP financial results unless otherwise noted. Please refer to the reconciliation tables at the back of the press release and slides, both of which are posted in the Investors section of our website.
In the third quarter, we delivered strong revenue growth across the business in both consumables and T&E. The business delivered organic revenue growth of 21.1% and reported growth of 19.4%. Because the pandemic makes it difficult to gauge growth, I want to point out that we also posted robust organic sales growth versus 2019 pre-COVID levels.
Compared to the third quarter of 2019, reported sales grew 11.1% and organic sales grew 10.7%, driven by growth in both segments and across all regions. This performance against the 2019 baseline confirms the steady recovery trend we have seen in 2021. Gross profit was $624 million or 58.4% of sales. Our margin rate remained steady, reflecting a balanced contribution from all of our businesses and a more normalized mix.
Looking back, we have delivered 150 basis points of gross margin expansion since Q3 2019, the pre-COVID baseline, attributed to portfolio optimization and our efforts to simplify the organization over the last few years. As you all know, the global supply chain environment continues to be a challenge in terms of cost, availability of components and labor across industries. So far, we have been able to meet demand at a normal pace and continue to work on various operational strategies to minimize the impact to our customers and to our P&L.
Now turning to SG&A. In the third quarter, we had expenses of $373 million or 34.9% of sales. This ratio remains below pre-COVID 2019 levels, reflecting the benefits from our efficiency improvement initiatives. Quarter-over-quarter, SG&A increased as we ramped planned SG&A investments, particularly in sales and marketing to support our growth plans in strategic areas, including clear aligners, implants and digital capabilities.
Q3 spending on R&D was up 31.6% year-over-year to $35 million. We expect this level of increased investment to continue as we are committed to delivering innovation and great solutions to our customers. As a result of the heightened emphasis on R&D over the last few years, we are pleased to see a much healthier solutions pipeline, as Don will discuss later.
Turning now to profitability. Operating profit grew to $216 million versus $197 million last year. Operating margin was 20.2%. Looking back, we have delivered 230 basis points of operating margin expansion since Q3 2019, the pre-COVID baseline. We have expanded margins and we have also made meaningful investments in our business, which are essential to fund sustainable long-term growth initiatives.
Net interest and other expense increased versus last year mainly due to the impact from foreign exchange fluctuations. Regarding taxes in the quarter, our effective tax rate increased to 23.4% from 20.3% in the prior year quarter, primarily due to the geographic mix of pretax income and our continued business recovery from COVID.
Turning to earnings. EPS was $0.68 versus $0.67 in the prior year quarter. Moving to segment performance. Versus the third quarter of 2020, Consumables and Technologies & Equipment grew 15.9% and 25.3%, respectively. Both segments posted a strong growth across all product categories. The Consumables segment had sales of $440 million, an organic increase of 15.9% versus the prior year.  
Overall growth was strong across all regions and in all categories, most notably within the endo and resto parts of our portfolio, which represent strategic priorities for our business. This quarter, we launched ProTaper Ultimate, the first major endodontic platform innovation launched in our endo business in more than 5 years.
Market reactions thus far have been very positive. Additionally, the rebound in the preventative business, particularly in the U.S., continued in Q3. The Consumables market has been resilient, and our teams are executing well through the recovery. Currency favorably impacted consumable sales by 1.3%, offset by a reduction of 4.8% due to divestitures and discontinued products.
Moving on to Technologies & Equipment segment results. T&E organic sales grew 25.3% versus the prior year with a strong overall growth in all regions and product categories. Growth was most notably driven by the digital category and implants. There continues to be a strong momentum on increasing digital capabilities within dental offices. Demand is high for digital devices such as Primescan and imaging equipment such as our new Axeos unit.
We are seeing a growing trend in dental offices upgrading from 2D to 3D units, and we are observing this trend in all global markets. Our Clear Aligners franchise drove a strong year-over-year growth this quarter. The aligners market continues to grow faster than most categories, and the aligners business is a key contributor to our growth strategy.
In the dentist directed channel, SureSmile continues its expansion domestically and internationally. In addition, the new software we recently launched has been positively received by the market due to its significant user experience enhancements. The upcoming launch of VPro will be another key differentiator for our SureSmile offering. As you may recall, when we acquired Propel, earlier in the year, we indicated our intention to utilize it for SureSmile as well.
SureSmile is on track to meet our run rate goal for the year. After a very strong first half in 2021, the DTC channel experienced softness in Q3. We believe this is largely attributed to COVID recovery dynamics and seasonality. Given the run rate we are seeing for Byte in the second half of this year, there is a possibility we may not fully achieve the annualized run rate goal for this year. DTC is an exciting new category in the dental industry and Byte is strategically positioned for growth with its focus on customer experience and key differentiators such as HyperByte and high engagement with customers through the entire aligner journey.
Lastly, within T&E, currency favorably impacted sales by 1.2% as well as a benefit from acquisitions of 7.7%, offset by a reduction of 9.4% due to divestitures and discontinued products. Now turning to financial performance by region during the third quarter.
U.S. sales were $399 million, a growth of 25.3% versus last year. Organic sales growth was 20.1%. U.S. dental sales volumes remain at close to normal levels in both segments despite COVID variants that spiked late in the quarter. European sales were also $399 million, a growth of 13.6% versus last year. Organic growth was 17.8%. Similar to the U.S. sales, the majority of product lines in Consumables and T&E are running at pre-COVID levels or better.
Rest of the World sales were $271 million, a growth of 20.1% versus last year. Organic sales growth was 27.8%, reflecting recovery in demand across Consumables and T&E. The APAC region has delivered continued growth for our business throughout the entire fiscal year 2021.
Next, I'd like to cover cash flow. In the third quarter of 2021, we generated operating cash flow of $172 million and free cash flow of $137 million. During this quarter, we paid our regular dividend and repaid long-term debt of $296 million, which mature in July. We finished the quarter with cash on hand of $281 million. Year-to-date, we have generated $435 million in operating cash flow and $334 million in free cash flow.
On a year-to-date basis, we have deployed more than $248 million to fund strategic acquisitions, including Datum and Propel Orthodontics. We have also returned a total of $158 million to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. Our financial position and balance sheet remain strong. We are well positioned to continue to deploy capital strategically.
Now let me provide an update on our financial expectations for 2021. Based on the solid performance of our business year-to-date and the current market trends, we are increasing our estimates for 2021 as follows. We are tightening our revenue outlook by increasing the bottom of our range. We now expect revenues to be in the $4.25 billion to $4.3 billion range.
With respect to EPS, we are increasing and narrowing our estimates for fiscal year 2021. The new EPS outlook range is now $2.87 to $2.92. This range is based on a new assumption for the euro to USD rate of 1.16. This is lower than the fiscal year '21 budget assumption of 1.22 and lower than last quarter's assumption for the second half of the year of 1.18.
Given our long euro exposure, a weaker euro represents a net headwind to our P&L. Overall, we are very pleased with the current momentum in our business and our new 2021 outlook for revenue and earnings reflects that confidence.
To close my remarks, we are proud to share the progress we're making in our sustainability journey. As you may remember, we indicated a few months ago that we were taking substantive steps to advance sustainability. I am happy to report that just a few weeks ago, we share our sustainability strategy with a broad range of stakeholders at DS World, and also publish our 2020 Sustainability Report and our 2025 Goals.
It is our commitment to be transparent and accountable with respect to our strategy and goals. Going forward, we will measure our progress within 3 sustainability verticals, healthy planet, healthy smiles and Healthy Business. To support our Healthy Smiles pillar, this quarter, we entered into a 5-year partnership with SmileTrain and committed $5 million to the organization. SmileTrain is a nonprofit organization that provides corrective surgery for children with cleft lips and palates across the world.
We're excited by the opportunity to help improve oral health for children worldwide. I encourage you to visit the Sustainability Hub on our website to check out our metrics and actions within each of our sustainability verticals. We are convinced that our commitment to sustainability will deliver long-term value to our stakeholders.
With that, I will now turn the call back to Don."

Moving on, I wanted to provide some additional perspective around our strategy and priorities going forward. Moving to Slide 17 in the presentation. Our priorities have remained consistent over the last few years, which has allowed us to",1318,"Thank you, Jorge. Moving on, I wanted to provide some additional perspective around our strategy and priorities going forward. Moving to Slide 17 in the presentation. Our priorities have remained consistent over the last few years, which has allowed us to stay very focused on delivering consistent results. These priorities are to grow revenues 4% to 5% long term through a combination of organic and inorganic activities.
The second is to drive our margin to 22% by 2022. Essential to these efforts is the third priority, simplifying the organization to better leverage our scale as one of the largest companies in the dental space. When we meet these goals, we deliver consistent and sustainable double-digit EPS growth.
Moving to Slide 18 to detail some of the progress we've made against those priorities. Growth is our overriding priority with the objective being to deliver 4% to 5% top line increases long term. We've made important progress against this goal. In addition to the 21% growth for the quarter. Year-to-date, we have delivered an increase of [ 35.9% ] versus 2020.
It is also worth noting that for the entire year 2019, the last period prior to the pandemic, organic growth was 6.1%. This kind of performance gives us confidence in our growth strategy and our priorities. We will keep driving growth by focusing on 4 areas: They include building on our leading role in digital dentistry; accelerating our rapidly growing clear aligner franchise; delivering major innovations in critical areas; and building out our capabilities in faster-growing parts of the world.
Our portfolio moves over the last few years also reflect these priorities and have resulted in increasing our exposure to faster-growing areas of the dental markets. Turning to the next priority around margin expansion. We are confident that we will deliver the 22% margin goal by the end of 2022. We are realizing the benefits of a 3-year restructuring plan as well as portfolio reshaping efforts. Our team also continues working on simplifying the organization, both structurally as well as how we work.
A great example of this is our comprehensive enterprise modernization program under Jorge's leadership that increases the use of automation and digital tools across the company to improve efficiency and the customer experience. These efforts have helped us deliver significant headcount efficiencies, and we are on track to deliver the $250 million in savings that we outlined in 2018.
Looking out to the future, our strategy outlined on Page 19, is to develop superior integrated workflows built on diagnostic excellence, easy-to-use treatment planning and essential products that improve outcomes for patients and dental practices. On Page 20, Dentsply Sirona's impressive digital foundation is outlined. It starts with a large global footprint in imaging with major brands like Schick, Orthophos, Gallileos and our newest addition, Axeos.
Our large CEREC franchise that includes both chairside and DI is another critical component in our robust digital foundation. As Jorge noted, coming out of the pandemic, both of these digital businesses have strong momentum as dentists globally are looking to upgrade their practices. By adding these more powerful diagnostic tools like Primescan and 3D imaging, they can incorporate more complex procedures into their practice with competence.
Adding these more sophisticated diagnostic tools also creates an opportunity to take advantage of treatment planning for complex cases like implants and clear aligners. Treatment planning helps the dentists map out the entire procedure. This increases their efficiency while elevating their confidence, which can lead to better results for the patients.
Dentsply Sirona is one of the largest providers of treatment planning in all of dentistry with brands like Sidexis, CEREC, Atlantis, Simplant and SureSmile. We look at this digital foundation as one of our most important assets, and this area is a major investment priority for us. These                 will drive faster innovation, expanded treatment planning capabilities and accelerated progress in the areas of artificial intelligence.
These efforts are now supported by over 500 software engineers within Dentsply Sirona today, that are helping us continue leading the digital dental revolution. Moving to Page 21. Innovation is our lifeblood, and we have delivered several innovations in 2021 in key areas like implants and endo. At DS World, several of our major innovations were on display. Rather than just launching products, our customers could see our approach is based on simplifying critical workflows from diagnosis to delivering the final treatment in ways that can transform their practices.
Our ability to work across the entire procedure is truly unique to Dentsply Sirona. The fact that we address so many of the key procedures gives us a real advantage as we look to become the essential partner to the practice. A great example of this was the comprehensive restage of our implant businesses announced last month. For us, it's not just about launching a new screw and abutment. It is about rethinking the entire implant workflow and bringing all the assets of Dentsply Sirona together to help simplify things for the dentist.
It starts with moving to one brand name, Dentsply Sirona implants. It includes adding tools to Primescan that actually allow for edentulous scanning, a real breakthrough, while also advancing innovative multi and single tooth replacement capabilities. It includes a Simplant treatment planning refresh and a comprehensive continuing education program to support a digital approach to implants.
It allows us to deploy Lucitone to enhance performance of digital ventures. We have a best-in-class bone growth product with OSSIX. The team here is also really excited about the launch of PrimeTaper. This is an immediate load self-tapping product that is built off a well-known procedure. The system has launched in the U.S. and EMEA to excellent initial reviews. And this is the kind of integrated innovation across a critical procedure that we believe transforms dentistry.
We're also adding new products to our MIS value implant business to continue building momentum in this rapidly growing franchise. At DS World, we also launched ProTaper Ultimate in the endodontic space, as Jorge mentioned, representing a major innovation in this important therapeutic area. It's more than a file, and it includes a great cleaning product as well as a new obturation system that includes a new bioceramic sealant. Early users of the system, which we call the trifecta, are really excited about the ProTaper Ultimate system as it simplifies the procedure significantly.
We have also launched a major software upgrade in CEREC called 5.2 as well as SureSmile 7.6. CEREC 5.2 is so powerful that it makes Primescan feel like a totally new product. And it takes its category-leading speed and accuracy to new levels. SureSmile 7.6 makes major progress around our user interface. We also have a full slate of news for our clear aligner franchise. As we have 2 brands, we are maximizing the investment in both R&D and manufacturing by offering the innovations across both the SureSmile and the Byte businesses.
Innovations in this space include our vibration technology, VPro, and HyperByte for improved comfort. We also are launching new whitening products in the near term. To finish the discussion around innovation, there was major progress in 2021 that will pay dividends going forward.
I would also note that we have a very robust pipeline going forward that we will bring to the market in the future. Moving now to Slide 22. To summarize, our strong performance year-to-date gives us confidence going forward for the remainder of 2021. We have good momentum leading into the future. Our results reflect the underlying resilience of the dental market and our team's disciplined performance against our operational goals and progress against our key strategic priorities. Based on this, as Jorge said, we are raising our '21 earnings outlook. Going beyond the quarter-to-quarter discussion, we also believe that Dentsply Sirona is well positioned to transform dentistry and deliver sustainable growth going forward.
And with that, we will now open the call to questions."

And as we are kind of entering this recovery phase, we're seeing across not just the DTC clear aligner space, but a number of consumer businesses. Consumers have choices in terms of where they're spending discretionary income. And all of a sudden, people are going on vacations and other things.
So we think we're seeing a little bit of seasonality, and we're seeing some competition for discretionary spending among our core target audience. What we think going forward, first is that, look, we think clear aligners -- our clear aligner strategy is predicated on, look, we've got a DTC space, and we -- DTC entry, and we have obviously a directed dentist entry.
And we'll look to see growth in both of those segments. As what we saw in Q3, again, a little bit of seasonality. We think this is a little bit of consumers looking at other discretionary spending. I would tell you, we were -- obviously, when we sit down and prepare all this stuff, we were reflected on the fact that in basically, the second quarter 2018, we had 0 sales in clear aligners. And today, we've got a -- if it was an independent SBU, it would be one of our more significant franchises. And one that we expect to continue providing a lot of growth into the future."

The plans for Byte are also to begin to pick that up. I mean we're looking at Byte in a couple of different ways. I mean the first is we have new products that are coming in that direction, Part 1; Part 2 is we believe that there's opportunity to expand this outside the U.S. We think the DTC channel in places in Asia and other areas is doing pretty well.
So we really think that we've got a great product and want to participate in those regions. And then one of the things that we remain optimistic about is we really think that Byte is going to play a role with our relationships with the professional. Obviously, when people come in to Byte, not everybody is eligible for Byte, they can be referred over to Dennis, that we believe that would have Primescan and other things and go right into SureSmile.

It is more expensive in some cases to procure certain materials. We have managed all of that so far. So with respect to what we're seeing in the inventory pipeline or channel, we haven't seen any major disruptions. Any changes really of material significance at this point. But as you know, this is a global situation, and it's something that is hard to predict at this point. But so far, we -- our financials are not -- have not been impacted by the supply chain issues in a material way other than some elevated costs that we have been able to offset or in some cases, for example, we did a price increase. We announced a price increase effective October 1. Some of that helps offset some of the incremental costs that we are facing."

So we've worked our way through that. In terms of what headwinds are we seeing in Q3 that are different than Q2. Q3 is vacation time. I mean, look, you had -- our feeling is, and we've looked at this and we've talked to a number of our customers or potential customers and people -- we get them in, ""Hey, look, you've spent $20 with us to get the diagnostic kit, why aren't you taking the next step?"" And literally, people were talking about, well, we're taking our first vacation since the pandemic and other things.
So statistically, we -- basically, we think there's seasonality associated with people going on vacation, people heading into school. And then it is somewhat confounded by what's going on in the kind of the pandemic where you've got pent-up demand for consumer spending in other areas. And the thing that we're still trying to quantify and we're going to continue to watch it and work through it is, obviously, there was a change in the third quarter about government payment related to pandemic recovery things.
So we're working through a bunch of the stuff. But I really -- I think Tycho just said it well. I do want to point out that we just posted pretty significant growth in the quarter and were raised.

And I indicated before, we announced a price increase for October 1. And this is the annual price increase that we normally put in place. Every time we do -- we make these announcements, there is probably a movement of revenue from month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter. And so there's a possibility that there was some acceleration, probably not material, but some acceleration of consumable sales from Q4 into Q3 in anticipation of the price increase.
And there is a couple of other things like that, that are timing related. But the macro point is there is sequential growth, the organic growth rate that we are indicating for total 2021, I mean if you look at the range, from 22% to 25%, and it's closer to 25% organic growth, total top line revenue growth versus last year.

Listen, it's hard to predict how long the supply chain issues are going to last because again, this is not something unique to the dental industry.

We are taking a lot of actions to minimize the impact. Procurement doing a lot of great work trying to identify new sources for certain components. We are renegotiating certain contracts ensuring that we have access to supply for some key components on a predictable basis. So that's all short-term things that we're doing.
I think there are some more long-term solutions that are somewhat related to the supply chain issues, but also related to our desire to be more efficient and improve the margins of our products. So for example, in many cases, we are harmonizing certain products or components that we were sourcing from different source -- from multiple sources. We are now trying to consolidate. We're trying to harmonize the design of these components and that should help us improve the reliability of the supply.
And then we're trying to make sure that we look at the balancing of our manufacturing operations, ensuring that we have at the right time, the right components to ensure that the lines are working efficiently for predictable periods of time as opposed to stop and starting based on unpredictable patterns of supply.

We have a very aggressive affiliate marketing program, and we continue to have a pretty good program to aimed at insurers. So as we think about that, the level of marketing within Byte is we don't expect it to change.

And we are not seeing any deviation from that. COVID continues to be a little bit of a shadow there. Do you see a few small markets, for example, Australia, New Zealand, parts of China, where there are lockdowns. 
But honestly, those lockdowns have not affected our sales in a material way because those markets are small for us. So the -- our expectation in the fourth quarter from a regional standpoint is a continuation of what we saw in Q3."

I think there is -- there needs to be a good contribution from all areas of the P&L to reach that goal, and we feel good about all of them. So starting with the top line, we have certain targets that we want to hit. And we have been explicit about our 4% to 5% target for revenue growth. So that is an important factor. And then keeping the stability from a gross margin perspective, we have been trending very well, very steady, from a gross margin perspective. 
And then there are further opportunities for cost savings, both in COGS as well as in SG&A that we are actively pursuing and implementing. And a lot of them have to do with what we call our enterprise modernization program that includes process harmonization and centralization. That's something that we still have a long ways to go. I think there is tons of opportunities from an automation perspective that should improve our cost base.
And then further possibilities to optimize our footprint, both in terms of manufacturing as well as facilities in general. I think as we learn how to live with the post pandemic or new ways of doing business post pandemic, I think that there are some interesting ideas to rationalize our footprint as well. So there is tons of things. And the last thing I would mention is from a product design perspective, the teams continue to do great work trying to improve the cost of materials, trying to improve the design.
So that is cheaper to manufacture and more efficient overall. So those are all important levers that we are actively pursuing. And when you  add out of them together, that's where we will get about the 22% target."

I guess as we think about going forward, how do you think about maybe investing more aggressively to go after some of those opportunities.

I guess has that changed how you're thinking about the historical balance that you've seen between reinvesting in the business, but also being on the path to 22% margins. It'd be great to kind of get your sense of kind of how you're thinking about that dynamic as we head into 2022."

I think what we are facing right now is reinforcing a lot of the beliefs that we had going into this pandemic. And so that reinforcement is translating into our strong desire to invest more and move faster with respect to a lot of ideas that we have in the pipeline.
And Don and I have indicated how we are really proud of the increased R&D activity that we have, what is coming out of that work. And we have a number of great ideas that we expect to bring to the market in the near future, and they are reflective of some of the important macro trends of digitization, changes in behaviors from consumers and things like that.
So I think this is just again, reinforcing the idea that we had before, and it's just pushing us to move faster, and we're really excited about the opportunities, frankly. I mean, there are great opportunities, and we are really excited about trying to do all of these things faster."

Look, I'd summarize by saying we feel really good about a quarter. It's -- we've been doing this a long time. It's rare that you get to talk about a 20% plus organic with a beat and raise.
And there's some stuff that we're very, very excited about. Jeff, really appreciate the question on implants. And when you're seeing double-digit implant growth is something we haven't seen in a long time. We feel there's tremendous momentum on our T&E business. And consumables, which is a question we typically get is, we feel that we've innovated across a broad platform. So we feel good about that.
And I would just pull back a little bit out of the quarter-to-quarter discussion. It was almost 3 years ago to the day when we announced the restructuring. Basically, since then, we feel that we're really on track in terms of growth. I mean, if you look at what we did in '19 and then as we get into this kind of recovery phase of the pandemic, we were hitting the margin targets that we put out. We've already delivered the headcount. 
We feel very good about the fact that we've created not only a more simple organization but one that's much more functional. And our team in here is really excited about the future. For those of you guys got to attend DS World, you could kind of see how we're laying things out from a procedure perspective and why we think Dentsply Sirona is really well positioned to become the essential partner in dentist practices all over the world.
