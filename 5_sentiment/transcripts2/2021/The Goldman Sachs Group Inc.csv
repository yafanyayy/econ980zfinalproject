Thank you, everybody, for joining us this morning. Let me begin with Page 1 of our strategic update presentation. I'm pleased to report that 2020 was a year of strong performance for Goldman Sachs as we successfully navigated unexpected o",3786,"Thanks, Heather. Thank you, everybody, for joining us this morning. Let me begin with Page 1 of our strategic update presentation. I'm pleased to report that 2020 was a year of strong performance for Goldman Sachs as we successfully navigated unexpected operating backdrop, characterized by near-record volatility and correspondingly high client activity. 
This year was marked by an extraordinary decline in economic activity in the second quarter brought on by COVID-19, and a dramatic reversal in the third and fourth quarter as economic output and unemployment partially reversed course. This volatility contributed to severe dislocation across asset classes, which was met by profound fiscal and monetary actions taken across the globe. Goldman Sachs met the needs of our clients relying on dynamic management of the firm's liquidity and balance sheet to provide complex risk intermediation, financing solutions, advice and innovative thought leadership. 
Momentum remains strong into year-end as we produced record revenues for the fourth quarter of $11.7 billion, resulting in record quarterly earnings per share of $12.08. For the full year, we grew revenue by 22% to $44.6 billion, our highest revenue production in more than a decade, which allowed us to generate meaningful operating leverage. We delivered a full year ROE of 11.1%, notwithstanding a nearly 4 percentage point impact of litigation expense. This revenue growth was clearly driven by a larger opportunity set given the extraordinary activity throughout 2020. While industry wallet grew, we also took meaningful market share across businesses and geographies. 
We continue to demonstrate the strength of our diversified business. We maintained our leading global position in completed M&A as we have for 19 of the past 20 years, and strong leadership position -- strong REIT table positions and underwriting, including a #1 ranking in equity and equity-linked offerings and a top 3 ranking in high yield. We delivered robust performance in global markets in both FICC and equities and solid client activity across our global platform and grew market share across businesses and client groups. Our next-generation trading talent now in positions of leadership demonstrated strong risk management discipline and client focus in executing against an expanding opportunity set. 
In Asset Management, we had record management and other fees as well as continued growth in our assets under supervision. We also generated solid revenues from on-balance sheet investments driven by public marks and event-driven gains on our portfolio. We continued our broader effort to reduce the balance sheet intensity of this business as we transition to more third-party investing. We continue to provide high-quality advice to our wealth management clients, producing record revenues and generated strong growth in our consumer business. 
Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we maintained a resilient and highly liquid balance sheet and demonstrated agility in the deployment of capital to serve clients amid high levels of market volatility and evolving regulatory constraints. 
While we are cautiously optimistic given improving macro trends, we recognize that the operating backdrop will continue to evolve. Although we are now seeing the initial rollout of vaccines in the U.S., U.K. and other nations, there remains significant uncertainty in the path forward related to virus resurgence, vaccine distribution and further fiscal stimulus and geopolitical risks. Let me underscore that progress on economic growth is contingent on an effective vaccine rollout program globally. I urge political leaders at all levels and across all jurisdictions to do everything possible to implement a coordinated and comprehensive distribution plan. In its absence, economic recovery will be unnecessarily delayed. 
Economists continue to anticipate a mixed outlook for near-term growth. The expectation is that we'll take until at least the second quarter return to prepandemic levels of output. Our economists expect GDP growth this year of roughly 6.5%, both globally and in the U.S., which would suggest a more rapid recovery. So circumstances around COVID-19 remain fluid, and we remain vigilant about risks in the markets and potential weaknesses in the broader economy. 
Looking ahead, the extreme volatility of 2020 is unlikely to repeat given the government actions taken last year. Nevertheless, I'm confident that Goldman Sachs will continue to benefit from the established wallet share gains made in 2020 and across an expanding client set, particularly in investment banking and global markets and continue to develop more durable revenue sources across asset management and consumer wealth management. 
With that, let me turn to Page 2. In the 12 months since our Investor Day, we have made steady progress towards our medium-term goals, and we remain confident that we will achieve these targets as well as our longer-term goal of mid-teens or higher returns. Our 2020 ROE when adjusted to exclude the impact of litigation comfortably exceeds our 13% medium-term target. We are pleased with our progress on funding diversification as we grew deposits by $70 billion in 2020. While the Fed funds rate declined faster than the reduction in our deposit rates, we have since adjusted our pricing, which should allow us to achieve our funding optimization goals by 2022. We are making headway in realizing expense efficiencies throughout the organization and have achieved approximately half of the $1.3 billion initial target we presented at our Investor Day. We will continue to make progress from here, and we'll evaluate additional opportunities for further expense savings. 
Finally, with respect to capital, our CET1 ratio stands at 14.7%. This positions us well to serve clients and accelerate capital returns to shareholders in the first quarter. We continue to believe that a 13% to 13.5% ratio is appropriate for the firm over the medium term. We are encouraged by the results of the recent mid-cycle stress test. That said, we will continue to proactively reduce the stress capital intensity of our businesses, including through continued sales of our on-balance sheet private equity investments. 
As John, Stephen and I have emphasized many times, we are committed to holding ourselves accountable and being transparent with our stakeholders on our progress. We are tracking roughly 30 firm-wide KPIs and many additional business-level metrics on a regular basis to measure our success as we execute on all aspects of our strategy. 
Let me now turn to Page 3. While last January's Investor Day seems distant given the events of the past year, the pillars of our strategic direction remain unchanged. Our strategy is simple: first, to grow and strengthen our existing franchise and capture higher wallet share across a wider client set; second, to diversify our products and services in order to build a more durable earnings stream; and third, to operate more efficiently so that we can drive higher margins and returns across the organization. We are seeing early success in each category. 
Moving to Page 4. The strength of our firm's culture is the foundation for our performance as individuals and the firm and is central to the success that we achieved in 2020. Delivering the entire firm to our clients through our One Goldman Sachs approach is crucial to our mission, and clients remain at the center of everything we do. The investments we made to break down internal silos and motivate better collaboration across the firm have been critical and will continue to guide our approach going forward. 
Equally, core to our mission is delivering on our firm's purpose to advance sustainable economic growth and financial opportunity. This purpose is fundamental to our 10-year $750 billion sustainable finance commitment that cuts across 2 broad pillars: climate transition and inclusive growth. During the year, we have worked closely with our clients to deepen knowledge and expertise, develop capabilities and accelerate commercial activity. We are delivering integrated ESG solutions across our client base, and I'm proud of the firm's leadership on this topic and optimistic about the benefits that these opportunities will bring to our clients. 
As we pursue these ambitious goals, we will also continue to focus on our people. Diversity is an imperative for our organization. For Goldman Sachs, it is about bringing diverse people, perspectives and abilities together to best serve our stakeholders and fosters more creative thinking and supports the inclusive, sustainable growth that is core to our long-term business strategy. While our recent progress is encouraging, including the most diverse campus analyst class ever to join the firm this past summer and improved diversity of our most recent partner, managing director classes, the events of the past year have reinforced how much further we have to go to enhance diversity and inclusion throughout the firm. This remains a personal priority for me, and we will continue to hold ourselves accountable to make further advancements including through our new aspirational goals to drive diverse hiring at more levels of the firm. 
Let me now take you through each of our 4 operating segments. I will start with Investment Banking, where we remain the adviser of choice for corporations around the world. In 2020, as measured against the goals set out at our Investor Day, we maintained our #1 ranking in announced and completed M&A and equity and equity-linked offerings. We also ranked in the top 4 for wallet share in global debt underwriting through the third quarter. We spoke last January about our aim to grow share in our core business. We began to execute on this goal in 2020 as announced M&A deal count was up along with our equity underwriting wallet share. 
Our footprint expansion efforts -- on our footprint expansion efforts, we have met our Investor Day target for client coverage. We generated in excess of $800 million of revenue in 2020 from this client set, and we expect this to be an important source of growth going forward. Across the business, we have added approximately 2,700 net new clients since 2017, and we will continue to add new clients to sustain this space. We are cautiously optimistic on the outlook for Investment Banking, given the robust activity levels in the capital markets and the elevated strategic activity on the back of improving CEO confidence reflected in our near-record backlog at the end of the year. 
We are also pleased with the early success of our transaction banking platform, with which since its launch last June, has attracted roughly 225 corporate clients and nearly $30 billion of deposits and is well positioned to drive growth and more durable revenues for the firm. Combination of our attractive product offering, strong client receptivity and tailwinds created by the macroeconomic environment drove deposit growth ahead of expectations. As we work to deliver greater functionality to clients and continue their onboarding, we will convert more of these deposits to operational, providing increased funding utility to the firm. 
We also continue to look for innovative ways to expand the reach of our platform to new clients as we did with our recent partnership with Stripe, which embeds our transaction banking, payment and deposit solutions directly into Stripe's platform, making these products available to its millions of small business customers. 
Let me now turn to Page 6. In 2020, our Global Markets business posted its strongest net revenues in a decade, exceeding the return targets laid out for the business at Investor Day. Global Markets is a business that many believed should have been downsized when John, Stephen and I took our seats. While it's only a single year, the performance of the business in 2020 is an early validation of our decision to stay the course. Our teams work diligently to serve our clients through the challenges of 2020, providing liquidity across asset classes, intermediating risk and engaging in structured solutions while also supporting significant volumes across expanding digital platforms. 
We also advanced on our Investor Day objective of moving into a top 3 position with more of the top 100 institutional clients. We are now in the top 3 across 64 of these firms, up from 51 a year ago. We gained 120 basis points of wallet share through the third quarter of 2020, which we intend to maintain through our deepened client relationships, superior risk intermediation and ongoing investment in technology platforms. 
We set a goal in January to increase our client financing activity. Our record FICC financing revenues for 2020 demonstrate our ability to meet this target. Additionally, we continued to strengthen our prime business, where we closed the year with record balances, the result of a multiyear investment in platform enhancements and other client-oriented initiatives, particularly in the quant space. 
Finally, while we saw meaningful revenue growth in global markets, we remain focused on operating efficiency. We achieved roughly $400 million in expense efficiencies last year and allocated $1.25 billion of capital in that business to more accretive opportunities, both ahead of schedule. Across any level of industry wallet, the progress that we have made in Global Markets has improved the business' structural return profile. 
Let me now turn to Page 7. Our asset management business experienced solid performance in 2020 marked by continued growth in assets under supervision, driving record management and other fees. Our status as one of the world's leading global asset managers has served us well during this volatile period. Our Asset Management business provides clients with offerings across the spectrum from liquidity to alternatives. And we will continue to grow this business opportunistically by serving our clients' needs and differentiating our offerings with holistic advice, investment solutions and portfolio implementation. 
We are progressing well towards our longer-term objectives of $250 billion of growth in traditional equity and fixed income products and $100 billion of net inflows to alternatives. 
To that end, we spoke at Investor Day about growing our third-party alternatives business, and we are pleased with our early achievements. We have raised approximately $40 billion in commitments to date across asset classes, including private equity, private credit and real estate. This is good progress toward our goal of $150 billion in gross fundraising over 5 years. Additionally, we are encouraged by the expanding number of institutions that are investing with Goldman Sachs. Many pension funds and international institutions participating in recent fund offerings are new investing clients to the firm. 
As we shift towards a greater emphasis on third-party funds, we also continue to work to optimize the capital consumption of our Asset Management business. To that end, we sold or announced the sale of over $4 billion of gross equity investments in 2020, with a related $2 billion of expected lower capital. We will continue to advance the sell-down process in 2021 and beyond to achieve the objectives we set out in our Investor Day. Importantly, as we highlighted at Investor Day, incentive fees on portfolio remain unrecognized until investments are sold and fund return thresholds are achieved. Our estimated unrecognized incentive fees currently stand at $1.8 billion. 
Turning to Page 8. We made meaningful advancements this year in growing our Consumer and Wealth Management segment, particularly in expanding our customer base, building our technology platform and leveraging our corporate franchise. We remain committed to delivering tailored advice and simple and transparent financial solutions to our individual clients across the wealth spectrum. And our goals here remain integral to our strategic priorities. 
Our Wealth Management franchise remains a crown jewel for the firm. Revenues grew 10% year-over-year to a record $4.8 billion as our clients largely remained invested through uncertain market conditions. In our Private Wealth Management business, this success has long been built on the strength, depth and trust of client relationships. which became even more relevant as COVID-19 limited face-to-face interaction. 
Throughout this period, our private wealth advisers have continued to maintain high levels of client engagement and deliver trusted advice. While the environment has caused us to slow some of our hiring efforts in this area, we remain committed to the growth potential of this franchise. 
We also continue to expand our high net worth platform through Ayco and personal financial management, our rebranded United Capital business. Our Ayco platform achieved its annual goal of bringing more than 30 new corporate clients onto the platform in 2020 as corporates of all types increasingly look to Ayco for financial planning and wellness solutions. We remain well positioned to meet this ongoing need given Ayco's broad spectrum of offerings as well as connectivity with our Investment Banking franchise and our new personal financial management capabilities. We have already begun to see significant synergies as a result of these advantages, with over 4,000 referrals in 2020, representing over $7 billion of AUS opportunity across these channels. 
Moving to Page 9, I want to provide some additional detail on our consumer business, which continues to perform well and deliver strong growth. The pandemic has reaffirmed our view that traditional banking has not kept up with the way people live their lives today, and the Goldman Sachs is uniquely placed to step into this gap. We've had early success launching online savings, lending and credit card, and we are now moving to the next phase of our growth plan, taking us from a series of singular products to a more comprehensive offering. 
We are particularly excited about the launch of Marcus Invest platform in the U.S. this quarter, which for the first time, brings the investing expertise of Goldman Sachs directly to mass affluent customers. Following our U.S. launch, we plan to expand to the U.K. in the second half of the year. Marcus Invest will offer individuals the ability to invest as little as $1,000 in our proprietary asset allocation strategies, with options raising from index funds to ESG-focused ETFs. Digital investing features will be integrated into the Marcus app and website and will combine the accessibility, simplicity and transparency of Marcus with our leading investment advisory capabilities. 
In addition, our new digital checking offering also scheduled for launch this year will deliver an enhanced customer experience that is simpler and more transparent than what traditional banks have historically offered, providing smart money management tools that help consumers take control of their financial lives. As we will grow -- as we grow, we will not only serve customers directly through the Marcus platform, but we will also serve customers through our growing partnership channels. 
In 2020, we launched 4 new partnerships with Amazon, Walmart, JetBlue and AARP, all following our first partnership with Apple. We also recently announced our second co-branded credit card with General Motors, another sign of our ability to be the banking partner of choice for leading corporations across a variety of industries. 
Our partners value our scale, innovation, engineering prowess, robust infrastructure, regulatory status and importantly, the power of the Goldman Sachs brand. The opportunity set here is very large with each partner reaching tens of millions of individuals through their existing customer bases. 
With that as background, let me also comment on 2020 consumer performance, which exceeded our expectations, but which also has implications for our financials as we go forward. We proactively adjusted our strategy beginning in March as the impact of COVID-19 and the evolving market conditions began to take shape. We tightened underwriting standards to reduce risk, deliberately slowing our consumer loan growth across both unsecured loans and Apple Card. Given the economic outlook, we also significantly grew our reserves for potential future losses. At the same time, we continued to raise deposits at a pace meaningfully higher than we had expected as clients remain attracted to the value of our products and the strength of our brand. 
Taken together, our pretax loss in consumer, excluding reserve build, was reduced versus 2019 levels and lower than our expectations for 2020. Looking forward, we have a clear opportunity to achieve breakeven, excluding reserves for our existing product set, including checking and investing in 2022. That achievement would be 1 year later than initially anticipated due to business adjustments driven by COVID. For 2021, pretax loss for our consumer business, excluding the impact of reserves, is likely to be higher and look more like what we had initially expected for 2020. This is driven by lower value on deposits, tighter credit standards and additionally, the investment in our new General Motors credit card. 
Beyond 2021, we've -- beyond 2021, we will continue to invest where appropriate and opportunities to build additional functionality with our digital bank as well as to pursue further growth in our partnership channel. In terms of broader functionality, we may look to develop additional products to drive a more comprehensive customer experience over time. These investments, if pursued, may delayed our planned breakeven for the business. I want to emphasize, however, that should we choose to invest in additional products to broaden our consumer capabilities, it will not affect our ability to meet our enterprise-level targets. 
With respect to partnerships, these opportunities with corporate clients of the firm allow us to commercially engage with a broader consumer population and are designed to build on the platform-based architecture that we have built for our proprietary Marcus business. Just as we did with Apple Card, our intent is to develop differentiated products and services -- service offerings that are embedded in our partners' ecosystems and tailored to the spending, borrowing and investing needs of their customers. From an economic perspective, these opportunities are designed to materially reduce our customer acquisition costs and leverage the embedded cost base of our systems. 
Furthermore, partnerships we seek to pursue offer the firm potential for mid-teens returns at scale. Each partnership is intended to extend beyond a single product and bring scale to our business on favorable economic terms. 
Goldman Sachs has a history of building businesses with a long-term orientation. Our investment in our consumer business will continue to be dynamic and appropriately sized to support our ability to achieve our long-term financial targets. And in the interim, it will not prevent us from reaching our medium-term firm-wide goals. 
Before I close, let me share that I am incredibly proud of the progress we've made in 2020, which was a transformative year for Goldman Sachs. Our success could not have been achieved without the extraordinary efforts of our people who continue to put clients at the center of everything we do. 
I am humbled by the level of commitment I see across our organization every day, knowing many of the personal and professional challenges our people are navigating. As we look forward, I know there will be further challenges, but I am optimistic about the potential for Goldman Sachs in the coming years. I believe in our strategic plan and our leadership team and our culture and in the raw talent of our people. Taken together, these attributes will better enable us to achieve higher and more sustainable returns for our shareholders. 
Let me now turn it over to Stephen to review funding, expenses and capital as a part of the Investor Day update."
398625,700318128,2175376,"The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 19, 2021",2021-01-19,"Earnings Calls","The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, David, and good morning. Let me continue the presentation on Page 10. We are pleased with the progress made to date on the diversification of our funding. The achievement of our medium-term funding goals remains a significant source of forward",3197,"Thank you, David, and good morning. Let me continue the presentation on Page 10. We are pleased with the progress made to date on the diversification of our funding. The achievement of our medium-term funding goals remains a significant source of forward value for the firm. As you will recall, our ambition is to achieve $1 billion in annual revenue uplift over the medium term from growth in deposits, enhancement to our asset liability management and the optimization of our liquidity pool. .
Along with the broader industry, we experienced a material shift in the rate environment in 2020. With Fed funds declining over 150 basis points, the relative value of our deposits remained positive but lower than projected at Investor Day. What's more, since we are modestly asset-sensitive as a firm, our assets repriced more quickly than our liabilities. 
As 2020 progressed, we were able to adjust our deposit pricing to reflect the broader downward movement in rates. While we did not achieve savings in 2020, with greater volume and now updated pricing in the consumer channel, we remain on track to achieve our $1 billion run rate savings target. We also remain well positioned to capture further savings as we expand our offerings in markets, deepen our client relationships and rely less on pricing as a lever for customer acquisition. 
While the focus has been on consumer deposits, our total deposits grew by $70 billion in 2020 across multiple strategic channels, including particularly strong flows in transaction banking. Importantly, deposits comprised approximately 50% of our total unsecured funding base at year-end, in line with our medium-term target. As the recent environment has helped accelerate our deposit gathering efforts, growth will likely be more moderate in the near term in light of our entity funding needs. 
We continue to grow assets within our bank entities, where we have traditionally lagged our peers. We now have approximately 1/4 of the firm-wide balance sheet held in the firm's bank entities versus roughly 15% in 2017. 
We have also made improvements in our asset liability management that we continue to employ a conservative funding approach, focused on term and diversification. 
Let me now move to Page 11 and expenses. We remain on track to achieve the target laid out at Investor Day of $1.3 billion in expense savings over the medium term, accomplishing approximately half of our goal over the past year. The achievement of these efficiencies has enabled us to partially offset the cost of investment in our business and our people in 2020. Our experience over the past 12 months has given us even greater confidence in several of the key elements of this plan. In particular, we are already seeing important benefits from our investment in automation and consolidation of platforms including increased straight-through processing rates and reduced cost per trade. In addition, we continue to generate efficiencies from structural adjustments to our employee base through our front-to-back realignment, location strategy and evaluation of pyramid structure. 
On the non-compensation front, consolidation of offices in London and Bengaluru, focus on transaction-based expenses and more centralized expense management processes have all contributed to early success. 
The remote work environment has also catalyzed an increased focus on our location strategy. Last January, we expected that 40% of our employees would ultimately work from one of our strategic locations, and we will continue to evaluate the potential for that number to grow over time. We will also look to expand into new strategic locations around the globe as well as consolidate our footprint, where appropriate, in keeping with our evolving business mix. 
Now turning to Page 12 and capital. Our capital management philosophy remains unchanged. We seek to deploy capital on accretive terms, both in our incumbent businesses and in areas of growth investment and otherwise return excess to our shareholders. While our ratios initially declined in early 2020 as we committed capital to support clients navigating the pandemic and we received an SCB result in the 2020 CCAR process that was higher than anticipated, our standardized CET1 ratio at year-end was 14.7%, accomplished through strong earnings, lower capital return and disciplined balance sheet management. 
Importantly, we are pleased with the results of the recent interim stress test, and we intend to resume share repurchases this quarter. As in the past and as permitted, we will continue to reassess our dividend commensurate with the strategic direction of our business. We will be dynamic in our approach, both to reflect proactive steps to reduce capital consumption in the business and as a function of capital requirements more in line with the results of the interim CCAR examination. As such, we continue to target a CET1 ratio of 13% to 13.5% over the medium term, which will inform our capital deployment decisions. As we look ahead, we remain engaged with the Federal Reserve to improve stress modeling in CCAR. 
As David mentioned earlier, we have already sold or announced the sale of $4 billion in assets with $2 billion of related capital reduction. That said, in the first quarter, we will adjust our equity attribution across our segments to more appropriately reflect the firm's higher SCB based on the results of CCAR 2020. Given the higher stress loss intensity of our equity positions, the capital attributed to asset management will be larger, and so will the capital reduction associated with our intended sell-down of assets. This change will not impact our stated medium-term targets. And in fact, we intend to increase the size and accelerate the pace of asset sales beyond that anticipated at Investor Day so as to further reduce the capital intensity of the segment beyond our original ambition. 
Speaking more broadly, there are several key drivers affecting capital requirements for the firm overall: first, our stress capital buffer, which we expect to improve as I have noted; second, our GSIB surcharge, where we ended the year at 3% to meet client demands, the impact of which will take effect in 2023; and lastly, our management buffer, which we plan to run between 50 and 100 basis points, accounting for volatility and client activity. 
Before turning to our earnings report, let me finish on Page 13, with a slide that David first presented at Investor Day 1 year ago. Our strategic direction is guided by these objectives. We are pleased with our progress to date in strengthening our existing businesses, growing our new businesses and operating the firm more efficiently. Early success in 2020, however, does not diminish our focus on forward execution. We have work to do from here, and we'll continue to drive more durable earnings and enhance returns for our shareholders. In all cases, we will continue our commitment to transparency and accountability, and we look forward to updating you further on our progress in the year ahead. 
With that, let me now switch gears to our separate earnings presentation to cover the fourth quarter and full year results. First, to quickly recap our financial results on Page 1. Fourth quarter net revenues were $11.7 billion, resulting in $44.6 billion for the full year, a growth rate of 22%. In the fourth quarter, we delivered net earnings of $4.5 billion and record quarterly earnings per share of $12.08. As David mentioned, the firm delivered full year ROE of 11.1%. Litigation burdened our full year returns by nearly 400 basis points. 
Turning to Page 2 and our individual segments. As we noted earlier, Investment Banking delivered outstanding performance in 2020. In the fourth quarter, net revenues were $2.6 billion. Advisory revenues were $1.1 billion, more than double third quarter levels, reflecting growth in the number of completed M&A transactions. We advised on over 350 transactions that closed during the quarter, representing over $1 trillion of deal volume, roughly $150 billion ahead of our closest peer. Equity underwriting produced a record $1.1 billion of revenue in the quarter as industry volumes remained elevated and we continued to gain market share. This drove record full year revenues in equity underwriting of $3.4 billion, supported by $115 billion of deal volume across nearly 600 transactions. 
In an extraordinary year for equity issuance, we participated in 120 traditional IPOs, 70 private transactions and a number of SPAC IPOs, providing clients advice and access to capital in innovative forms. 
Turning to debt underwriting. Net revenues were $526 million, down 8% sequentially, reflecting lower investment-grade transactions, partially offset by strength in leveraged finance. Full year revenues of $2.7 billion were a near record and up 26% versus 2019. Our franchise remains well positioned as evidenced by our #3 high-yield league table ranking for the year. 
Looking forward, as David mentioned, our investment banking backlog is at near record levels, significantly higher versus the third quarter and a year ago. Client dialogues remain robust, and we are optimistic on activity across a broad set of sectors, including TMT, FIG and health care. 
Fourth quarter net revenues from corporate lending were negative $119 million, reflecting roughly $250 million of hedge losses against the relationship loan book as credit spreads tighten. Recall that for risk management purposes, we maintained single-name hedges on certain large relationship lending commitments. Of note, in relationship lending, the total notional drawn or funded on revolvers is now back down to pre-COVID levels. 
Moving to Global Markets on Page 3. Net revenues were $4.3 billion in the fourth quarter, up 23% versus last year. For the full year, Global Markets generated $21.2 billion of net revenues, up 43% versus 2019, driven by stronger FICC and equities intermediation performance. This represents the highest yearly revenues for the segment in a decade. 
Turning to FICC on Page 4. Fourth quarter FICC net revenues were $1.9 billion, up 6% year-over-year. Our growth versus last year was driven by higher FICC intermediation revenues, where we saw increased client activity, while FICC financing revenues were roughly flat. 3 out of 5 FICC intermediation businesses posted higher fourth quarter net revenues versus the prior year, reflecting the continued strength and breadth of our business. In credit, we saw significantly better performance helped by elevated activity and market share gains, driven in particular by outperformance in portfolio trading, notably across our digital platforms. 
In commodities, net revenues were driven by stronger performance across most assets, including metals and agricultural products. In currencies, net revenues rose on solid performance in emerging markets as volatility rose across most currency pairs. In mortgages and rates, net revenues were lower year-on-year, though client activity remained solid, particularly in mortgages around CMBS and mortgage intermediation. And in rates, activity remained elevated as a consequence of a number of macro events, including the U.S. election and COVID and the overall reflationary theme. 
Moving over to equities. Net revenues for the fourth quarter were $2.4 billion, up 40% versus a year ago. Full year revenues of $9.6 billion were the highest since 2009. Fourth quarter Equities intermediation net revenues of $1.8 billion reflected stronger results in derivatives across all regions as well as higher cash revenues helped by strong performance in program trading. Equities financing revenues of $591 million were down 19% year-over-year due to higher net funding costs, including the impact of lower yields on our liquidity pool. Importantly, as David mentioned, client balances rose to record levels. 
Moving to Asset Management on Page 5. Our asset management activities produced net revenues of $3.2 billion in the fourth quarter. For the full year, Asset Management generated net revenues of $8 billion, down from a strong 2019 as equity and debt investment performance was challenged in the first half of 2020. Fourth quarter management and other fees totaled $733 million, up 10% versus a year ago on higher average assets, contributing to record full year net revenues of $2.8 billion. Across the Asset Management segment, our AUS stood at a record $1.5 trillion at year-end. Our equity investments generated $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter, on gains on our public and private investments. More specifically, on our $3 billion public equity portfolio, we generated roughly $745 million in gains from investments, including FASB and Sprout. And on our $17 billion private equity portfolio, we generated net gains of approximately $775 million from various positions, substantially all of which were driven by events, including corporate actions such as fundraisings, capital market activities and outright sales. Additionally, we had operating revenues of $250 million related to our portfolio of consolidated investment entities. 
Net revenues from lending and debt investment activities in Asset Management were $637 million on revenues from net interest income and gains on fair value debt securities and loans. This reflected tighter credit spreads on our portfolio of corporate and real estate investments. 
On Page 6, we show the composition of our Asset Management balance sheet, consistent with the information that we have provided to you in prior quarters. On equity and CIE portfolios remain highly diversified by sector, geography and vintage. And our debt investment portfolio is also diversified with segment loans largely secured. 
On Page 7, turning to Consumer & Wealth Management, we produced $1.7 billion of revenues in the fourth quarter. Full year net revenues were $6 billion, up 15% versus a year ago, driven by higher management and other fees and strong consumer banking growth. For the quarter, wealth management net revenues included record management and other fees of $1 billion. Full year revenues of $4.8 billion rose 10% year-over-year and assets under supervision rose to a record $615 billion at year-end. Total client assets in the segment exceeded $1 trillion at the end of 2020. 
Consumer banking revenues were $347 million in the fourth quarter, contributing to full year revenues of $1.2 billion, which rose 40% year-over-year and were diversified across lending, card and savings. Consumer deposits remained stable during the quarter despite an additional rate reduction, ending the year at $97 billion across the U.S. and U.K., up $37 billion versus last year. Funded consumer loan balances were $8 billion, of which $4 billion were from Marcus consumer loans and $4 billion from credit card lending. Importantly, the credit behavior of our loan and credit card portfolio outperformed our expectations. The portfolio benefited from improved underwriting as well as the consequences of our consumer assistant plans. 
Next, let's turn to Page 8 for firm-wide assets under supervision. Total AUS rose to over $2.1 trillion during the quarter and are up nearly $290 billion versus a year ago. The sequential change was driven by $17 billion of long-term inflows, $6 billion of liquidity inflows and $86 billion of market appreciation. 
On Page 9, we addressed net interest income and our lending portfolio across all segments. Total firm-wide NII was $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter, up versus a year ago, primarily reflecting growth in the firm's balance sheet, particularly in Global Markets as well as the benefit from credit card balances and repricing of deposits in Consumer & Wealth Management. Equally, this activity is reflective of the decision to allow our GSIB surcharge to increase to 3%. 
Next, let's review loan growth and credit performance across the firm. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $116 billion, up $4 billion sequentially, largely driven by modest growth in loans in Consumer & Wealth Management and real estate warehouse lending. Our provision for credit losses in the fourth quarter was $293 million, roughly flat sequentially and down versus a year ago. The quarter's provisions were driven primarily by continued growth in lending in our consumer business and wholesale impairments, offset by some reserve leases driven by improving macroeconomic conditions. Given our announced partnership with General Motors and the planned acquisition of the current loan receivables from Capital One, we expect to recognize approximately $200 million of associated provisions in the first quarter. 
At quarter end, our allowance for credit losses for both loans and commitments stood at $4.4 billion, including $3.9 billion for funded loans. Our allowance for funded loans was flat versus last quarter at 3.7% for our $103 billion accrual portfolio, including an allowance for wholesale loans of 2.7% and for consumer loans of 15.9%. For the full year, we recognized firm-wide net charge-offs of $907 million, resulting in an annualized net charge-off ratio of 0.9%, up 30 basis points versus last year. 
Next, let's turn to expenses on Page 10. Our total operating expenses were $5.9 billion in the fourth quarter. For the full year, our efficiency ratio was 65%, which includes a nearly 800 basis point impact from litigation expense. On compensation, our philosophy remains to pay for performance, and we are committed to compensating top talent. While compensation expenses were up 8% year-over-year relative to growth in revenue net of provisions for credit losses of 17%, our full year compensation ratio is at a record low, reflecting the operating leverage in our franchise. As we have said in the past, we view the compensation ratio metric as less relevant to the firm as we build new scale platform businesses. 
On noncompensation expense, our cost for the full year 2020 rose 25% versus last year. Excluding litigation, our full year operating expenses grew by only 8%, inclusive of investment spend across the business and higher variable expenses associated with transaction volumes. Growth was partially offset by efficiency savings and lower travel and entertainment costs due to the circumstances of COVID-19. 
Finally, on taxes. Our reported tax rate was 18.7% for the fourth quarter and 24.2% for the year, reflecting the impact of nondeductible expenses. We continue to expect our tax rate over the next few years to be approximately 21% under the current tax regime. 
Turning to our capital levels on Slide 11. As previously discussed, our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased to 14.7% at the end of the fourth quarter under the standardized approach, up 20 basis points sequentially. Earnings were largely offset by higher RWAs as we stepped in to serve our clients. Our ratio under the advanced approach increased 50 basis points to 13.4%. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Total assets ended the quarter at $1.2 trillion, rising 3% versus last quarter as we deployed resources to facilitate client activity, particularly within our Prime Brokerage business. We maintained very high liquidity levels with our global core liquid assets averaging $298 billion, reflecting the current backdrop. On the liability side, our total deposits were roughly flat at $260 billion as planned roll-off of higher-cost broker deposits was partially offset by modest growth in consumer, private bank and transaction banking deposits. 
In conclusion, our strong fourth quarter and 2020 results reflect the diversification of our client franchise, resilience of our business model, strong risk discipline and flexibility in our balance sheet deployment. David, John and I are proud of our people for their efforts this year in serving our clients and delivering on our strategic goals, especially given the challenges of COVID-19. We look forward to furthering our progress on our medium- and long-term targets, and we remain confident that execution of our strategic plan will drive better client experience, more durable revenues and higher returns for our shareholders over time. 
With that, thank you again for dialing in, and we'll now open the line for questions."

We were just on this slide reiterating the medium-term target that we had set at 10%. I would point out that while reported ROE in 2020 for Global Markets was 14.1%, the performance ex litigation that's otherwise allocated to the segment was 18.1%. 
I think the other point I would make here is that as we look forward and as we've commented several times, impossible to know what 2021 and beyond hold in terms of what the industry is presented. But I think there have been some fairly profound structural shift in that business. One, of course, is the expense base is being reduced. The second is we're much more attuned to the sort of agile deployment of capital across. But I think perhaps most important is the improvement of wallet share and the focus on clients. 
And David commented a couple of times on the improvement in overall wallet share, growing by 120 basis points through 3 quarters, and we'll see what played out for the full year. But I'd also say that a step-up in where we stand with the objective of being top 3 across the top 100 institutional clients in Global Markets, I think, also reflects that we'll capture at or better than our share on a going-forward basis, again, acknowledging that the market may not look as robust on the forward as it did in '20 for this business, but the structural changes are important."

So I get the allocation of more capital. I get the capital that you freed up on the announced sales. I know that when you're initially going down this path, I felt optimistic of your ability to raise lots of third-party money and you have. Just wonder if you have a thought process on '21 or it's just continued marching towards the 1 50. 
And in the same regard, I was concerned about selling down private equity would leave an earnings pickup at some point. But being that you have almost $2 billion in unrecognized incentive fees, do you feel like you can continue down this free-up capital, sell-down private equity, raise third-party path without a big earnings there to pick up?"
398625,700318128,2175376,"The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 19, 2021",2021-01-19,"Earnings Calls","The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.","Executives","Sure. Yes.

First, on fundraising, I think what's gratifying about the progress made in 2020 was a comment David made about an increasing number of clients new to the firm that are investing with Goldman Sachs. And so that leaves us optimistic about the prospect of the fundraising pipeline in 2020, which will be across a range of different investing sleeves, and we'll start to see that growing number of investing clients, look across a range of different product offerings that we have. 
On the sell-down, we're very attentive and have always been to the prospect of creating kind of a canyon. And we don't anticipate that to happen, and we'll continue to manage with that in mind. 
Now you draw the right observation, which is there's $1.8 billion of embedded fees to take, which we will take when gains become irrevocable or irreversible, and so that will buffer. But the point here is that our objective is to reduce the stress loss intensity of that segment. And so we've spoken about $4 billion in balance sheet sales to yield $2 billion of capital relief. We equally have line of sight into another $2.5 billion of sales, which could generate another $1 billion of capital relief. 
And I'd also point out, though it's not obvious in the way in which the results play, but over the course of the year, we sold $2.1 billion of public equities to offset about $1.9 billion of appreciation in market value. And so that equally has capital consequence for us. And so you'll continue to see us move along that road. 
Finally, on the question or the observation you made about what I was speaking to about what we will do in terms of attributed equity to that segment. That has no bearing on what our objective is, which is to bring capital down. But as CCAR 2020 was higher, more capital came to the firm. We don't keep a corporate segment, so we allocate or attribute that equity out to the segments. By definition, because of its intensity, Asset Management will pick up more capital. Obviously, on a unit of balance sheet reduction, more capital will come out as we reduce positions, which is why we're confident that we'll maintain at or better than what we're indicating in terms of capital reduction in the segment overall."

I -- and we tried to highlight this in the update that we're working to go from a product structure with a handful of products to a much more integrated offering for our customers. And so when you ask about comparison to some of the fintechs, I just say the fintechs are much more narrow in scope in terms of what they offer and don't have the broad capabilities that we have and more betting, and we're expanding on for our clients. 
So just in the context of the 2 examples that you gave in highlighting SoFI or Chime, when you think about spending across both checking and credit cards. When you think about borrowing across credit cards and loans and you think about savings and also investing and the investment capabilities that we have as a wealth manager, we have a much broader integrated offering. And we continue to get feedback that the state-of-the-art product platform and the digital applications that we have are really excellent by any standards. So we're going to continue to move forward with that long-term strategy. 
I don't really have a comment on the valuation of these businesses, although I'm watching with everyone else, and I'm looking at what we have, the number of clients we have, the number of customers, the size of our business, the scale that we have as we continue to move forward. And I'm looking at that opportunity, the growth that we have. And if people like those businesses, I think at some point in time, they should like and value our business more fulsomely, but we'll continue to execute and wait on that. 
We really like our model of having a proprietary platform for Marcus. But then also given our corporate relationships, the potential for partnerships is very, very strong for us. And I think you saw that in our execution this year by adding 4 more partnerships, by capturing the GM card. And I think you'll continue to see us do more on this front. And so we feel good about it. 
But as I said in my comments, we're taking a long-term view in what we're doing, and none of this will affect our medium-term targets that we're working toward at the end of 2022. Gets a lot of attention, but it won't affect our targets."

But I hear your points. 
Maybe my second question, and apologies, this one was a bit of a nitty question. But I'm trying to understand the impact of interest rates on the Marcus business. I guess in the earnings release, you called out higher funding costs and lower yields on the liquidity reserves as a headwind to the Marcus business. But also in the actual deck, we saw a really big step-up in Global Markets NII quarter-over-quarter. So maybe just step back here, remind us how interest rates impact the business, whether it's the current level of interest rates, the yield -- the shape of the yield curve and then some of the liability management actions you've taken, how does that impact the markets business, I guess, over the coming year?"

That was driven largely by balance sheet growth, notably in growth markets and most especially in prime. So our prime balances were up. 
The challenging aspect for us and the reference made in the context of funding is that our liquidity grew over the quarter. We were slower to adjust, particularly on the retail deposit side, the pricing of our liabilities. And so we didn't capture quite what we wanted. Obviously, we've now brought rates down, and so we're able to sort of allocate that cost out to the business. 
So liabilities are important. NII expanded because of balance sheet and impacted overall net funding costs. And so that's the reference, if you will, to the headwinds. Notwithstanding prime balances growing, funding costs were higher than we wanted. That notwithstanding, NII grew because of overall balance sheet growth over the course of the quarter in prime and by virtue overall of moving to a higher GSIB in the context of meeting client demands."

There's obviously growth in some of the growth initiatives, including transaction banking as well as what we're doing on the consumer side. And so you'll continue to see pickup and share pickup. 
None of those are necessarily meant to be compensating factors for what could be a shortfall in Global Markets. I think within Global Markets, we will buffer, structurally speaking, what might be a less impressive opportunity set on the forward relative to 2020 by virtue of what we've done around market share gains and equally what we're doing around the cost base. 
And I'd say also, if you look within the Global Markets business, what we're seeing in terms of the growth in low-touch, high-volume activity around Marquee and the digital platforms, particularly growth in portfolio trading across, I think all of those will spell sort of improved performance as a general matter, notwithstanding the market. 
Finally, I'd point out that the investment banking footprint continues to expand. And that too will provide an offset to the extent that -- again, the assumption to your question, that we see lower opportunity as an industry matter within the trading or Global Markets business."

So on capital, look, our capital philosophy really remains unchanged, which is we look for opportunities for accretive return on investment in capital in the business and equally meeting client demands that are there. Separate from that, it's my expectation that we will hit our first quarter repurchase expectations, which based on the calculation of the Fed will be about $1.9 billion in the quarter, plus neutralizing equity-based compensation expense. And so we will fulfill that in the first quarter. 
I'd also repeat a comment I made in the prepared remarks is that we'll continue to reevaluate our dividend in the context of the shape and form of the business being more durable going forward. Obviously, that's not a first quarter proposition, given the Fed rules, but you can certainly rely on the repurchase expectations and our fulfillment of them. 
In terms of Asset Management, this is all about an overall reduction in the balance sheet intensity of that business. It is being mindful of revenue in the near term. It's driving down on-balance sheet investing and moving that into third-party activity, doing that across more sleeves with more clients of the firm. And I think that will continue to take down our capital and I suspect based on the progress we made in 2020 of taking $2 billion on $4 billion of sales. And as I mentioned, our forward view on what's within line of sight, incremental capital will come out at or better than the expectations we carried at the Investor Day itself."

And I'll just -- to take your framing, you said historically, at times of severe stress, you've been a dealer of choice. And you really -- you make that statement by going back and looking at one window, which was the financial crisis. And there's no question in the financial crisis, we had very, very significant share gains. But I would highlight that one of the reasons that we had very significant share gains during the financial crisis is that a lot of the people that would be in our core competitive set were in a position of very, very weak structural financial performance at the time, and it definitely inhibited their ability to intermediate with clients. 
So one of the things I recall hearing at that time is a lot of firms did not show up during the financial crisis, and we benefited from that. I think, hopefully, we benefited for other reasons, but there was a different component. 
We have a very, very different situation right now. Banks have been a source of strength during the pandemic. All of our competitors have showed up in space and yet we had very, very significant share gains. Now maybe some of that is a branded reputation that we're a dealer of choice during a pandemic. But I would argue a bigger impact  in really affecting how we performed, and I've heard this consistently from our Global Markets clients, is a change strategically in our approach over the last few years in terms of how we're facing clients our One GS approach and what we're trying to do. 
We talked a little bit in the strategic update in talking about how for the first time over the last couple of years, we have a targeted approach in evaluating our wallet share with the top 100 clients. Seems relatively straightforward but this is not something we had ever done historically. And that we advanced that considerably over the course of 2020 by going from top 3 with 51 of the clients to top 3 of 64 of the clients. 
We have a much more client-centric approach. I got a lot of feedback calls this year from our clients noticing what they said was a very different approach in the way Goldman Sachs interacted with them now and versus 10 years ago. And so I would argue across the platform, that orientation is helping our will share gains. 
Now I'm not going to sit here and say that in a different environment when the world is more even, and we're not in a crisis that there's not going to be a flattening. In fact, I'd say that across all our businesses, we tend to outperform in investment banking during times of stress, and the market share gains collapsed a little bit in times when everything is very, very easy. And so I'm sure there'll be some of that. But we have a very, very clear strategy, very, very clear client-centric strategy that's different, and I think it's led to enhanced wallet share gains. 
I'd also say, and we highlighted this in the context of looking at that business, this goes back to one of the earlier questions, we've made structural improvements not just in the client approach, but also in the cost base of that business and in our capital allocation in that business. And the results are, even if we have a different available client wallet, we have a structurally more profitable business on a go-forward basis. And so that's the way we're thinking about that. I hope that's helpful."

And there's also -- because of the acceleration of digital trends, there are lots of businesses and lots of CEOs that are rethinking, reunderwriting strategically how they're positioned. So corporate activity and therefore, capital markets activity in that context is high. 
Certainly, as we head into 2021, there are a lot of indicators that, that's going to continue in 2021, certainly in the near term. And so our expectation is, certainly, in the near term, that activity will continue. To the degree that we get to a more normalized environment, to the degree that there is a backing off of fiscal activity, to the degree over time is a more normalization of monetary policy, that obviously can affect this activity level, but that's not something we'd expect in the near term in 2021. So at the moment, pipeline, backlog, things that we can see continue to look robust. That doesn't mean that we're saying that we expect a repeat of everything we saw in 2020, and there certainly are different parts of both the banking and the markets business that I think were elevated in 2020 and our expectations for 2021 are not as robust as they were in 2020, but certainly more robust than they were in 2019."

I think as we've also said in the past, and this is reflected a little bit in your question, the comp ratio is going to become much less of a relevant metric in this, in part because the profile of the business will change. That is, as we grow up businesses like transaction banking or the consumer business, they will be less comp heavy in terms of overall expense, and that ratio will be ultimately less relevant.

And then separately, it will be focused on particular initiatives like transaction banking, like the consumer business and so forth. And I think part of our focus on the efficiencies that we're capable and the cost savings we're capable of getting is such that those savings can subsidize the investment being made in places like technology around the firm.

And I'd say that activity levels broadly across the banking platform are up. Certainly, SPAC activity is contributing to it, but strategic corporate M&A is up meaningfully. And what I'd say is there was a real kind of doldrum, as the pandemic hit and people were reorganizing. But as we came out in the summer and people started to kind of look through the tunnel and get a sense of where things were going, strategic activity with corporates really picked up. And that's contributed meaningfully also. And that has nothing really to do with the SPAC ecosystem. 
On SPACs, Mike, I'll say a couple of things. There's no question that the growth of SPACs as a product definitely affected activity levels, but there are a few things that I'd say, just to try to frame it. SPACs were a little bit more than 50% of IPO activity this year. But when you look at IPO activity, IPO activity for us, for example, was on a volume basis, about 17% of of our equity volume. So we did about $20 billion of IPO lead table against $115 billion of equity lead table, 17%. 
If you look at our IPO fees, all IPOs, SPAC and non-SPAC, and again, SPACs, let's say, around 50%. But if you look at our IPO fees, our IPO fees, were less than 40% of all our equity underwriting fees. And then SPACs would be a subset of that. 
Now to your point, it also creates an ecosystem around capital raising, around advisory services, et cetera. And so there's no question that, that ecosystem at the moment is creating a tailwind for some of these capital market activities. 
There are a couple of other things I'd say. First, we generally strive to be #1 in the league tables. We do not strive to be #1 in the SPAC league tables. We are very -- while we're very active, we're very thoughtful about our sponsors and the business that we take on. And just looking at last year, if you look at the number of SPACs that were done and the league table leaders, the #1 and #2 firms did about 33% more deals than we did, representative, I think, of some of the things that came to us that we turned away. So we're participating, but we're trying to participate by picking what we think are the best situations. 
I do think SPACs is a good use case versus a traditional IPO and advantages for sellers and for investors in looking at this ecosystem. But the ecosystem is not without flaws. I think it's still evolving. I think the incentive system is still evolving. One of the things we're watching very, very closely is the incentives of the sponsors and also the incentives of somebody that's selling. And while I think these activity levels continue to be very robust and that they do continue as we head into 2021 to continue to be very, very robust, I do not think this is sustainable in the medium term. And there'll be something that will , in some way, shape or form, bring the activity levels down over a period of time. 
But we're watching it closely. And it's something that our clients continue to be very, very interested in. There are lots of companies that go public via SPAC that could also go public in a traditional IPO. And there are some companies that go public in a SPAC that probably couldn't go public through the standardized process of the traditional IPO and all of those are things that the market will have to wrestle with. And one of the things I certainly think is the case is you have something here that's a good capital markets innovation. But like many innovations, there's a point in time as they start where they have a tendency maybe to go a little bit too far and then need to be pulled back or rebalanced in some way. And that's something, my guess, is we'll see over the course of 2021 or 2022 with SPACs."

We've given you lots of metrics we can track that progress. And we continue to roll out on the investments that we're making, including, as we said, you'll see invest this quarter, Marcus Invest this quarter. And you'll see checking during the course of the year. 
With respect to M&A opportunities broadly, whether it's to expand our consumer offering, whether it's to grow our Asset Management business, whether it's to expand our wealth management capability, we're always looking for ways to accelerate our strategic growth plans. If something came along that helped us accelerate or advance our strategic growth plan, and we thought that it was a good fit strategically and we thought we could acquire and integrate it attractively, then we would do it, just as we did with United Capital. But the bar to do something significant is extremely high, and it's not an easy thing to do. 
So we'll continue to look for things that can accelerate our growth plan, but we're going to continue to invest in these businesses. And I think the important thing for you to note is that we have a lot of confidence that these can be sizable businesses at scale that are accretive to Goldman Sachs' returns even if we do not do something significant inorganically."

So let me answer the question a couple of ways. First of all, a spot observation on noncomp expense in a year. So our noncomp was up 8% ex litigation. Of about $900 million of noncomp expense increase year-over-year, about 2/3, in excess of $600",385,"Yes, yes. So let me answer the question a couple of ways. First of all, a spot observation on noncomp expense in a year. So our noncomp was up 8% ex litigation. Of about $900 million of noncomp expense increase year-over-year, about 2/3, in excess of $600 million was variable expense, BC&E, all of which is related to the volume of activity that's coming through. And so I just frame that to so you have a sense of how noncomp framed out over the course of the year. 
Now if you look at our achievement of about half of the $1.3 billion of run rate efficiencies, that we've set as a target for ourselves, I would say up through the end of 2020, a good proportion of that came out of the compensation side, okay, relative to noncomp. So by that, I mean, we have undertaken a very significant exercise over the course of 2020 at spans and layers, meaning we've looked at the sheer number of people we have in a variety of parts of the organization. We've looked at scope of management, and we've been able to sort of achieve efficiencies in that regard. We engaged in a front-to-back exercise that put more people from an ops and technology point of view in line of sight of the people in the business who know and understand what their objectives are and where they're going. 
Third is we've looked at location of where many of these people are and have accelerated that. And so that's on the sort of compensation side. 
On the noncompensation side, I would say that we've done a complete rationalization of campuses in places like London and in Bangalore, harvesting significant savings there. We've moved to a more disciplined and centralized planning tool. We've looked to centralize our expense management through SAP, taking multiple platforms and pulling them into one. All of these have sort of put us in a position to realize about 50% of the $1.3 billion and frankly speaking, give us a bit more confidence about what we can achieve on the forward, perhaps in excess of it. 
And so that may be a bit more granular than you want, but just to lay out sort of the elements, right, of where these expenses are being harvested."

So Gerard, I think it's a good question. I appreciate it, and I think there's a huge advantage. 
So putting aside some of the things I'm talking about that are strategically based on our conscious decisions, we happen to be one of a handful of firms that is global at scale and a market leader in these Global Markets and Investment Banking businesses. And I think it is increasingly difficult to compete in these businesses unless you're global and at scale unless you have the capacity to make very, very significant technology investments into platforms to better connect with your clients. And so there has been a consolidation of wallet share into the leading players across these platforms, and we continue to be one of those players. And I think that position has only grown and been strengthened. 
I also would point out that we don't just have scale broadly. We've stayed committed, as I highlighted earlier in my remarks, to all the different silos and asset classes across our markets business. So you think about the many asset classes across markets, we benefited because we stayed committed to commodities, and we have a more fulsome offering for our clients, and there was a real benefit to that this year. 
So I think there's no question the leading firms have a strong competitive advantage. I think, to maintain that competitive advantage and have reasonable margins given the capital requirements, the technology requirements, the regulatory requirements being in a leadership position is much more important today than it was 15, 20, 25 years ago."

And that has been a refreshing change to kind of legacy platforms that have been there. I say that not just simply an observer, but also a consumer of that service where Goldman Sachs is using its own platform. And I think that will continue, in part because operational flows across corporates will continue almost notwithstanding what plays out in the context of the market movement overall. 
The consumer side may be a different proposition. Now it depends on the perspective you take with respect to GDP growth and what happens with rates and the like. But I think as David has said, on the consumer side, we are playing for the long term. That is building a relationship with tens of millions of consumers and pivoting in 2021 to a broader, more comprehensive platform that I think will attract more consumers to the platform, not simply because there's an attractiveness to the deposit rate or to rate on lending, but because we'll offer a more comprehensive package of investing and checking and we'll become a more reliable primary bank to more consumers and anything that will play out, again, kind of notwithstanding where the markets otherwise take us on some of the more capital markets-intensive activity."

There's no question that has moved to the back of the year in Q4. You saw compression from what was wide in Q2 and Q3. But there again, wallet share gains benefited us and equally playing to both high touch and low touch. And so the advent of what we were doing through Marquee and equally through portfolio trading on these electronic platforms was of equal benefit. So tighter bid offer there as opposed to wider bid offer in Q2.

I'm joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, David Solomon; and our Chief Financial Officer, Stephen Scherr. This morning, we are pleased to review the firm's fourth quarter and full year performance in addition to providing an update on the strategic plan we outlined at last year's Investor Day. David and Stephen will be happy to take your questions following their remarks.
I'll now pass the call over to David. David?"

Let me begin with Page 1 of our strategic update presentation. I'm pleased to report that 2020 was a year of strong performance for Goldman Sachs as we successfully navigated unexpected operating backdrop, characterized by near-record volatility and correspondingly high client activity.
This year was marked by an extraordinary decline in economic activity in the second quarter brought on by COVID-19 and a dramatic reversal in the third and fourth quarter as economic output and unemployment partially reversed course. This volatility contributed to severe dislocation across asset classes, which was met by profound fiscal and monetary action taken across the globe. Goldman Sachs met the needs of our clients relying on dynamic management of the firm's liquidity and balance sheet to provide complex risk intermediation, financing solutions, advice and innovative thought leadership.
Momentum remains strong into year-end as we produced record revenues for the fourth quarter of $11.7 billion, resulting in record quarterly earnings per share of $12.08. For the full year, we grew revenue by 22% to $44.6 billion, our highest revenue production in more than a decade, which allowed us to generate meaningful operating leverage.
We delivered a full year ROE of 11.1%, notwithstanding a nearly 4 percentage point impact of litigation expense. This revenue growth was clearly driven by a larger opportunity set given the extraordinary activity throughout 2020. While industry wallet grew, we also took meaningful market share across businesses and geographies.
We continued to demonstrate the strength of our diversified business. We maintained our leading global position in completed M&A as we have for 19 of the past 20 years and strong leadership position -- strong REIT table positions and underwriting, including a #1 ranking in equity and equity-linked offerings and a top 3 ranking in high yield.
We delivered robust performance in global markets in both FICC and equities and solid client activity across our global platform and grew market share across businesses and client groups. Our next-generation trading talent now in positions of leadership demonstrated strong risk management discipline and client focus in executing against an expanding opportunity set.
In Asset Management, we had record management and other fees as well as continued growth in our assets under supervision. We also generated solid revenues from on-balance sheet investments driven by public marks and event-driven gains on our portfolio. We continued our broader effort to reduce the balance sheet intensity of this business as we transition to more third-party investing. We continue to provide high-quality advice to our wealth management clients, producing record revenues and generated strong growth in our consumer business.
Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we maintained a resilient and highly liquid balance sheet and demonstrated agility in the deployment of capital to serve clients amid high levels of market volatility and evolving regulatory constraints.
While we are cautiously optimistic given improving macro trends, we recognize that the operating backdrop will continue to evolve. Although we are now seeing the initial rollout of vaccines in the U.S., U.K. and other nations, there remains significant uncertainty in the path forward related to virus resurgence, vaccine distribution and further fiscal stimulus and geopolitical risks.
Let me underscore that progress on economic growth is contingent on an effective vaccine rollout program globally. I urge political leaders at all levels and across all jurisdictions to do everything possible to implement a coordinated and comprehensive distribution plan. In its absence, economic recovery will be unnecessarily delayed.
Economists continue to anticipate a mixed outlook for near-term growth. The expectation is that we'll take until at least the second quarter return to pre-pandemic levels of output. Our economists expect GDP growth this year of roughly 6.5%, both globally and in the U.S., which would suggest a more rapid recovery. So circumstances around COVID-19 remain fluid, and we remain vigilant about risks in the markets and potential weaknesses in the broader economy.
Looking ahead, the extreme volatility of 2020 is unlikely to repeat given the government actions taken last year. Nevertheless, I'm confident that Goldman Sachs will continue to benefit from the established wallet share gains made in 2020 and across an expanding client set, particularly in investment banking and global markets and continue to develop more durable revenue sources across asset management and consumer wealth management.
With that, let me turn to Page 2. In the 12 months since our Investor Day, we have made steady progress towards our medium-term goals, and we remain confident that we will achieve these targets as well as our longer-term goal of mid-teens or higher returns. Our 2020 ROE, when adjusted to exclude the impact of litigation, comfortably exceeds our 13% medium-term target.
We are pleased with our progress on funding diversification as we grew deposits by $70 billion in 2020. While the Fed funds rate declined faster than the reduction in our deposit rates, we have since adjusted our pricing, which should allow us to achieve our funding optimization goals by 2022. We are making headway in realizing expense efficiencies throughout the organization and have achieved approximately half of the $1.3 billion initial target we presented at our Investor Day. We will continue to make progress from here, and we'll evaluate additional opportunities for further expense savings.
Finally, with respect to capital, our CET1 ratio stands at 14.7%. This positions us well to serve clients and accelerate capital returns to shareholders in the first quarter. We continue to believe that a 13% to 13.5% ratio is appropriate for the firm over the medium term.
We are encouraged by the results of the recent mid-cycle stress test. That said, we will continue to proactively reduce the stress capital intensity of our businesses, including through continued sales of our on-balance sheet private equity investments.
As John, Stephen and I have emphasized many times, we are committed to holding ourselves accountable and being transparent with our stakeholders on our progress. We are tracking roughly 30 firm-wide KPIs and many additional business-level metrics on a regular basis to measure our success as we execute on all aspects of our strategy.
Let me now turn to Page 3. While last January's Investor Day seems distant given the events of the past year, the pillars of our strategic direction remain unchanged. Our strategy is simple: first, to grow and strengthen our existing franchise and capture higher wallet share across a wider client set; second, to diversify our products and services in order to build a more durable earnings stream; and third, to operate more efficiently so that we can drive higher margins and returns across the organization. We are seeing early success in each category.
Moving to Page 4. The strength of our firm's culture is the foundation for our performance as individuals and the firm and is central to the success that we achieved in 2020. Delivering the entire firm to our clients through our One Goldman Sachs approach is crucial to our mission, and clients remain at the center of everything we do. The investments we made to break down internal silos and motivate better collaboration across the firm have been critical and will continue to guide our approach going forward.
Equally, core to our mission is delivering on our firm's purpose to advance sustainable economic growth and financial opportunity. This purpose is fundamental to our 10-year $750 billion sustainable finance commitment that cuts across 2 broad pillars: climate transition and inclusive growth.
During the year, we have worked closely with our clients to deepen knowledge and expertise, develop capabilities and accelerate commercial activity. We are delivering integrated ESG solutions across our client base, and I'm proud of the firm's leadership on this topic and optimistic about the benefits that these opportunities will bring to our clients.
As we pursue these ambitious goals, we will also continue to focus on our people. Diversity is an imperative for our organization. For Goldman Sachs, it is about bringing diverse people, perspectives and abilities together to best serve our stakeholders and fosters more creative thinking and supports the inclusive, sustainable growth that is core to our long-term business strategy.
While our recent progress is encouraging, including the most diverse campus analyst class ever to join the firm this past summer and improved diversity of our most recent partner and managing director classes, the events of the past year have reinforced how much further we have to go to enhance diversity and inclusion throughout the firm. This remains a personal priority for me, and we will continue to hold ourselves accountable to make further advancements, including through our new aspirational goals to drive diverse hiring at more levels of the firm.
Let me now take you through each of our 4 operating segments. I will start with Investment Banking, where we remain the adviser of choice for corporations around the world. In 2020, as measured against the goals set out at our Investor Day, we maintained our #1 ranking in announced and completed M&A and equity and equity-linked offerings. We also ranked in the top 4 for wallet share in global debt underwriting through the third quarter. We spoke last January about our aim to grow share in our core business. We began to execute on this goal in 2020 as announced M&A deal count was up along with our equity underwriting wallet share.
Our footprint expansion efforts -- on our footprint expansion efforts, we have met our Investor Day target for client coverage. We generated in excess of $800 million of revenue in 2020 from this client set, and we expect this to be an important source of growth going forward. Across the business, we have added approximately 2,700 net new clients since 2017, and we will continue to add new clients to sustain this space. We are cautiously optimistic on the outlook for Investment Banking, given the robust activity levels in the capital markets and the elevated strategic activity on the back of improving CEO confidence reflected in our near-record backlog at the end of the year.
We are also pleased with the early success of our transaction banking platform, with -- which, since its launch last June, has attracted roughly 225 corporate clients and nearly $30 billion of deposits and is well positioned to drive growth and more durable revenues for the firm. Combination of our attractive product offering, strong client receptivity and tailwinds created by the macroeconomic environment drove deposit growth ahead of expectations. As we work to deliver greater functionality to clients and continue their onboarding, we will convert more of these deposits to operational, providing increased funding utility to the firm.
We also continue to look for innovative ways to expand the reach of our platform to new clients as we did with our recent partnership with Stripe, which embeds our transaction banking, payment and deposit solutions directly into Stripe's platform, making these products available to its millions of small business customers.
Let me now turn to Page 6. In 2020, our Global Markets business posted its strongest net revenues in a decade, exceeding the return targets laid out for the business at Investor Day. Global Markets is a business that many believed should have been downsized when John, Stephen and I took our seats. While it's only a single year, the performance of the business in 2020 is an early validation of our decision to stay the course. Our teams worked diligently to serve our clients through the challenges of 2020, providing liquidity across asset classes, intermediating risk and engaging in structured solutions while also supporting significant volumes across expanding digital platforms.
We also advanced on our Investor Day objective of moving into a top 3 position with more of the top 100 institutional clients. We are now in the top 3 across 64 of these firms, up from 51 a year ago. We gained 120 basis points of wallet share through the third quarter of 2020, which we intend to maintain through our deepened client relationships, superior risk intermediation and ongoing investment in technology platforms.
We set a goal in January to increase our client financing activity. Our record FICC financing revenues for 2020 demonstrate our ability to meet this target. Additionally, we continued to strengthen our prime business, where we closed the year with record balances, the result of a multiyear investment in platform enhancements and other client-oriented initiatives, particularly in the quant space.
Finally, while we saw meaningful revenue growth in global markets, we remain focused on operating efficiency. We achieved roughly $400 million in expense efficiencies last year and allocated $1.25 billion of capital in that business to more accretive opportunities, both ahead of schedule. Across any level of industry wallet, the progress that we have made in Global Markets has improved the business' structural return profile.
Let me now turn to Page 7. Our asset management business experienced solid performance in 2020 marked by continued growth in assets under supervision, driving record management and other fees. Our status as one of the world's leading global asset managers has served us well during this volatile period.
Our Asset Management business provides clients with offerings across the spectrum from liquidity to alternatives. And we will continue to grow this business opportunistically by serving our clients' needs and differentiating our offerings with holistic advice, investment solutions and portfolio implementation. We are progressing well towards our longer-term objectives of $250 billion of growth in traditional equity and fixed income products and $100 billion of net inflows to alternatives.
To that end, we spoke at Investor Day about growing our third-party alternatives business, and we are pleased with our early achievements. We have raised approximately $40 billion in commitments to date across asset classes, including private equity, private credit and real estate. This is good progress toward our goal of $150 billion in gross fundraising over 5 years. Additionally, we are encouraged by the expanding number of institutions that are investing with Goldman Sachs. Many pension funds and international institutions participating in recent fund offerings are new investing clients to the firm.
As we shift towards a greater emphasis on third-party funds, we also continue to work to optimize the capital consumption of our Asset Management business. To that end, we sold or announced the sale of over $4 billion of gross equity investments in 2020 with a related $2 billion of expected lower capital. We will continue to advance the sell-down process in 2021 and beyond to achieve the objectives we set out in our Investor Day. Importantly, as we highlighted at Investor Day, incentive fees on portfolio remain unrecognized until investments are sold and fund return thresholds are achieved. Our estimated unrecognized incentive fees currently stand at $1.8 billion.
Turning to Page 8. We made meaningful advancements this year in growing our Consumer & Wealth Management segment, particularly in expanding our customer base, building our technology platform and leveraging our corporate franchise. We remain committed to delivering tailored advice and simple and transparent financial solutions to our individual clients across the wealth spectrum. And our goals here remain integral to our strategic priorities.
Our Wealth Management franchise remains a crown jewel for the firm. Revenues grew 10% year-over-year to a record $4.8 billion as our clients largely remained invested through uncertain market conditions. In our Private Wealth Management business, this success has long been built on the strength, depth and trust of client relationships, which became even more relevant as COVID-19 limited face-to-face interaction.
Throughout this period, our private wealth advisers have continued to maintain high levels of client engagement and deliver trusted advice. While the environment has caused us to slow some of our hiring efforts in this area, we remain committed to the growth potential of this franchise.
We also continue to expand our high net worth platform through Ayco and Personal Financial Management, our rebranded United Capital business. Our Ayco platform achieved its annual goal of bringing more than 30 new corporate clients onto the platform in 2020 as corporates of all types increasingly look to Ayco for financial planning and wellness solutions.
We remain well positioned to meet this ongoing need given Ayco's broad spectrum of offerings as well as connectivity with our Investment Banking franchise and our new Personal Financial Management capabilities. We have already begun to see significant synergies as a result of these advantages with over 4,000 referrals in 2020, representing over $7 billion of AUS opportunity across these channels.
Moving to Page 9, I want to provide some additional detail on our consumer business, which continues to perform well and deliver strong growth. The pandemic has reaffirmed our view that traditional banking has not kept up with the way people live their lives today and that Goldman Sachs is uniquely placed to step into this gap. We've had early success launching online savings, lending and credit card, and we are now moving to the next phase of our growth plan, taking us from a series of singular products to a more comprehensive offering.
We are particularly excited about the launch of Marcus Invest platform in the U.S. this quarter, which for the first time, brings the investing expertise of Goldman Sachs directly to mass affluent customers. Following our U.S. launch, we plan to expand to the U.K. in the second half of the year. Marcus Invest will offer individuals the ability to invest as little as $1,000 in our proprietary asset allocation strategies, with options raising from index funds to ESG-focused ETFs. Digital investing features will be integrated into the Marcus app and website and will combine the accessibility, simplicity and transparency of Marcus with our leading investment advisory capabilities.
In addition, our new digital checking offering also scheduled for launch this year will deliver an enhanced customer experience that is simpler and more transparent than what traditional banks have historically offered, providing smart money management tools that help consumers take control of their financial lives. As we will grow -- as we grow, we will not only serve customers directly through the Marcus platform, but we will also serve customers through our growing partnership channels.
In 2020, we launched 4 new partnerships with Amazon, Walmart, JetBlue and AARP, all following our first partnership with Apple. We also recently announced our second co-branded credit card with General Motors, another sign of our ability to be the banking partner of choice for leading corporations across a variety of industries.
Our partners value our scale, innovation, engineering prowess, robust infrastructure, regulatory status and importantly, the power of the Goldman Sachs brand. The opportunity set here is very large with each partner reaching tens of millions of individuals through their existing customer bases.
With that as background, let me also comment on 2020 consumer performance, which exceeded our expectations, but which also has implications for our financials as we go forward. We proactively adjusted our strategy beginning in March as the impact of COVID-19 and the evolving market conditions began to take shape. We tightened underwriting standards to reduce risk, deliberately slowing our consumer loan growth across both unsecured loans and Apple Card. Given the economic outlook, we also significantly grew our reserves for potential future losses. At the same time, we continued to raise deposits at a pace meaningfully higher than we had expected as clients remained attracted to the value of our products and the strength of our brand.
Taken together, our pretax loss in consumer, excluding reserve build, was reduced versus 2019 levels and lower than our expectations for 2020. Looking forward, we have a clear opportunity to achieve breakeven, excluding reserves for our existing product set, including checking and investing in 2022. That achievement would be 1 year later than initially anticipated due to business adjustments driven by COVID.
For 2021, pretax loss for our consumer business, excluding the impact of reserves, is likely to be higher and look more like what we had initially expected for 2020. This is driven by lower value on deposits, tighter credit standards and additionally, the investment in our new General Motors credit card.
Beyond 2021, we will continue to invest where appropriate and opportunities to build additional functionality with our digital bank as well as to pursue further growth in our partnership channel. In terms of broader functionality, we may look to develop additional products to drive a more comprehensive customer experience over time. These investments, if pursued, may delay our planned breakeven for the business. I want to emphasize, however, that should we choose to invest in additional products to broaden our consumer capabilities, it will not affect our ability to meet our enterprise-level targets.
With respect to partnerships, these opportunities with corporate clients of the firm allow us to commercially engage with a broader consumer population and are designed to build on the platform-based architecture that we have built for our proprietary Marcus business. Just as we did with Apple Card, our intent is to develop differentiated products and services -- service offerings that are embedded in our partners' ecosystems and tailored to the spending, borrowing and investing needs of their customers.
From an economic perspective, these opportunities are designed to materially reduce our customer acquisition costs and leverage the embedded cost base of our systems. Furthermore, partnerships we seek to pursue offer the firm potential for mid-teens returns at scale. Each partnership is intended to extend beyond a single product and bring scale to our business on favorable economic terms.
Goldman Sachs has a history of building businesses with a long-term orientation. Our investment in our consumer business will continue to be dynamic and appropriately sized to support our ability to achieve our long-term financial targets. And in the interim, it will not prevent us from reaching our medium-term firm-wide goals.
Before I close, let me share that I am incredibly proud of the progress we've made in 2020, which was a transformative year for Goldman Sachs. Our success could not have been achieved without the extraordinary efforts of our people who continue to put clients at the center of everything we do.
I am humbled by the level of commitment I see across our organization every day, knowing many of the personal and professional challenges our people are navigating. As we look forward, I know there will be further challenges, but I am optimistic about the potential for Goldman Sachs in the coming years. I believe in our strategic plan and our leadership team and our culture and in the raw talent of our people. Taken together, these attributes will better enable us to achieve higher and more sustainable returns for our shareholders.
Let me now turn it over to Stephen to review funding, expenses and capital as a part of the Investor Day update."
398625,700318128,2175599,"The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 19, 2021",2021-01-19,"Earnings Calls","The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, David, and good morning. Let me continue the presentation on Page 10. We are pleased with the progress made to date on the diversification of our funding. The achievement of our medium-term funding goals remains a significant source of forward",3196,"Thank you, David, and good morning. Let me continue the presentation on Page 10. We are pleased with the progress made to date on the diversification of our funding. The achievement of our medium-term funding goals remains a significant source of forward value for the firm. As you will recall, our ambition is to achieve $1 billion in annual revenue uplift over the medium term from growth in deposits, enhancement to our asset liability management and the optimization of our liquidity pool.
Along with the broader industry, we experienced a material shift in the rate environment in 2020. With Fed funds declining over 150 basis points, the relative value of our deposits remained positive but lower than projected at Investor Day. What's more, since we are modestly asset-sensitive as a firm, our assets repriced more quickly than our liabilities.
As 2020 progressed, we were able to adjust our deposit pricing to reflect the broader downward movement in rates. While we did not achieve savings in 2020, with greater volume and now updated pricing in the consumer channel, we remain on track to achieve our $1 billion run rate savings target. We also remain well positioned to capture further savings as we expand our offerings in markets, deepen our client relationships and rely less on pricing as a lever for customer acquisition.
While the focus has been on consumer deposits, our total deposits grew by $70 billion in 2020 across multiple strategic channels, including particularly strong flows in transaction banking. Importantly, deposits comprised approximately 50% of our total unsecured funding base at year-end, in line with our medium-term target. As the recent environment has helped accelerate our deposit gathering efforts, growth will likely be more moderate in the near term in light of our entity funding needs.
We continue to grow assets within our bank entities, where we have traditionally lagged our peers. We now have approximately 1/4 of the firm-wide balance sheet held in the firm's bank entities versus roughly 15% in 2017. We have also made improvements in our asset liability management that we continue to employ a conservative funding approach focused on term and diversification.
Let me now move to Page 11 and expenses. We remain on track to achieve the target laid out at Investor Day of $1.3 billion in expense savings over the medium term, accomplishing approximately half of our goal over the past year. The achievement of these efficiencies has enabled us to partially offset the cost of investment in our business and our people in 2020.
Our experience over the past 12 months has given us even greater confidence in several of the key elements of this plan. In particular, we are already seeing important benefits from our investment in automation and consolidation of platforms, including increased straight-through processing rates and reduced cost per trade. In addition, we continue to generate efficiencies from structural adjustments to our employee base through our front-to-back realignment, location strategy and evaluation of pyramid structure.
On the non-compensation front, consolidation of offices in London and Bengaluru, focus on transaction-based expenses and more centralized expense management processes have all contributed to early success.
The remote work environment has also catalyzed an increased focus on our location strategy. Last January, we expected that 40% of our employees would ultimately work from one of our strategic locations, and we will continue to evaluate the potential for that number to grow over time. We will also look to expand into new strategic locations around the globe as well as consolidate our footprint, where appropriate, in keeping with our evolving business mix.
Now turning to Page 12 and capital. Our capital management philosophy remains unchanged. We seek to deploy capital on accretive terms, both in our incumbent businesses and in areas of growth investment and otherwise return excess to our shareholders. While our ratios initially declined in early 2020 as we committed capital to support clients navigating the pandemic and we received an SCB result in the 2020 CCAR process that was higher than anticipated, our standardized CET1 ratio at year-end was 14.7%, accomplished through strong earnings, lower capital return and disciplined balance sheet management.
Importantly, we are pleased with the results of the recent interim stress test, and we intend to resume share repurchases this quarter. As in the past and as permitted, we will continue to reassess our dividend commensurate with the strategic direction of our business. We will be dynamic in our approach, both to reflect proactive steps to reduce capital consumption in the business and as a function of capital requirements more in line with the results of the interim CCAR examination.
As such, we continue to target a CET1 ratio of 13% to 13.5% over the medium term, which will inform our capital deployment decisions. As we look ahead, we remain engaged with the Federal Reserve to improve stress modeling in CCAR.
As David mentioned earlier, we have already sold or announced the sale of $4 billion in assets with $2 billion of related capital reduction. That said, in the first quarter, we will adjust our equity attribution across our segments to more appropriately reflect the firm's higher SCB based on the results of CCAR 2020.
Given the higher stress loss intensity of our equity positions, the capital attributed to asset management will be larger and so will the capital reduction associated with our intended sell-down of assets. This change will not impact our stated medium-term targets. And in fact, we intend to increase the size and accelerate the pace of asset sales beyond that anticipated at Investor Day so as to further reduce the capital intensity of the segment beyond our original ambition.
Speaking more broadly, there are several key drivers affecting capital requirements for the firm overall: first, our stress capital buffer, which we expect to improve as I have noted; second, our GSIB surcharge, where we ended the year at 3% to meet client demands, the impact of which will take effect in 2023; and lastly, our management buffer, which we plan to run between 50 and 100 basis points, accounting for volatility and client activity.
Before turning to our earnings report, let me finish on Page 13, with a slide that David first presented at Investor Day 1 year ago. Our strategic direction is guided by these objectives. We are pleased with our progress to date in strengthening our existing businesses, growing our new businesses and operating the firm more efficiently.
Early success in 2020, however, does not diminish our focus on forward execution. We have work to do from here, and we'll continue to drive more durable earnings and enhance returns for our shareholders. In all cases, we will continue our commitment to transparency and accountability, and we look forward to updating you further on our progress in the year ahead.
With that, let me now switch gears to our separate earnings presentation to cover the fourth quarter and full year results. First, to quickly recap our financial results on Page 1. Fourth quarter net revenues were $11.7 billion, resulting in $44.6 billion for the full year, a growth rate of 22%. In the fourth quarter, we delivered net earnings of $4.5 billion and record quarterly earnings per share of $12.08. As David mentioned, the firm delivered full year ROE of 11.1%. Litigation burdened our full year returns by nearly 400 basis points.
Turning to Page 2 and our individual segments. As we noted earlier, Investment Banking delivered outstanding performance in 2020. In the fourth quarter, net revenues were $2.6 billion. Advisory revenues were $1.1 billion, more than double third quarter levels, reflecting growth in the number of completed M&A transactions. We advised on over 350 transactions that closed during the quarter, representing over $1 trillion of deal volume, roughly $150 billion ahead of our closest peer.
Equity underwriting produced a record $1.1 billion of revenue in the quarter as industry volumes remained elevated and we continued to gain market share. This drove record full year revenues in equity underwriting of $3.4 billion, supported by $115 billion of deal volume across nearly 600 transactions. In an extraordinary year for equity issuance, we participated in 120 traditional IPOs, 70 private transactions and a number of SPAC IPOs, providing clients advice and access to capital in innovative forms.
Turning to debt underwriting. Net revenues were $526 million, down 8% sequentially, reflecting lower investment-grade transactions, partially offset by strength in leveraged finance. Full year revenues of $2.7 billion were a near record and up 26% versus 2019. Our franchise remains well positioned as evidenced by our #3 high-yield league table ranking for the year.
Looking forward, as David mentioned, our investment banking backlog is at near record levels, significantly higher versus the third quarter and a year ago. Client dialogues remain robust, and we are optimistic on activity across a broad set of sectors, including TMT, FIG and health care.
Fourth quarter net revenues from corporate lending were negative $119 million, reflecting roughly $250 million of hedge losses against the relationship loan book as credit spreads tightened. Recall that for risk management purposes, we maintained single-name hedges on certain large relationship lending commitments. Of note, in relationship lending, the total notional drawn or funded on revolvers is now back down to pre-COVID levels.
Moving to Global Markets on Page 3. Net revenues were $4.3 billion in the fourth quarter, up 23% versus last year. For the full year, Global Markets generated $21.2 billion of net revenues, up 43% versus 2019, driven by stronger FICC and equities intermediation performance. This represents the highest yearly revenues for the segment in a decade.
Turning to FICC on Page 4. Fourth quarter FICC net revenues were $1.9 billion, up 6% year-over-year. Our growth versus last year was driven by higher FICC intermediation revenues where we saw increased client activity, while FICC financing revenues were roughly flat. 3 out of 5 FICC intermediation businesses posted higher fourth quarter net revenues versus the prior year, reflecting the continued strength and breadth of our business. In credit, we saw significantly better performance helped by elevated activity and market share gains, driven in particular by outperformance in portfolio trading, notably across our digital platforms.
In commodities, net revenues were driven by stronger performance across most assets, including metals and agricultural products. In currencies, net revenues rose on solid performance in emerging markets as volatility rose across most currency pairs. In mortgages and rates, net revenues were lower year-on-year, though client activity remained solid, particularly in mortgages around CMBS and mortgage intermediation. And in rates, activity remained elevated as a consequence of a number of macro events, including the U.S. election and COVID and the overall reflationary theme.
Moving over to equities. Net revenues for the fourth quarter were $2.4 billion, up 40% versus a year ago. Full year revenues of $9.6 billion were the highest since 2009. Fourth quarter Equities intermediation net revenues of $1.8 billion reflected stronger results in derivatives across all regions as well as higher cash revenues helped by strong performance in program trading. Equities financing revenues of $591 million were down 19% year-over-year due to higher net funding costs, including the impact of lower yields on our liquidity pool. Importantly, as David mentioned, client balances rose to record levels.
Moving to Asset Management on Page 5. Our asset management activities produced net revenues of $3.2 billion in the fourth quarter. For the full year, Asset Management generated net revenues of $8 billion, down from a strong 2019 as equity and debt investment performance was challenged in the first half of 2020. Fourth quarter management and other fees totaled $733 million, up 10% versus a year ago on higher average assets, contributing to record full year net revenues of $2.8 billion. Across the Asset Management segment, our AUS stood at a record $1.5 trillion at year-end.
Our equity investments generated $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter on gains on our public and private investments. More specifically, on our $3 billion public equity portfolio, we generated roughly $745 million in gains from investments, including FASB and Sprout. And on our $17 billion private equity portfolio, we generated net gains of approximately $775 million from various positions, substantially all of which were driven by events, including corporate actions such as fundraisings, capital market activities and outright sales. Additionally, we had operating revenues of $250 million related to our portfolio of consolidated investment entities.
Net revenues from lending and debt investment activities in Asset Management were $637 million on revenues from net interest income and gains on fair value debt securities and loans. This reflected tighter credit spreads on our portfolio of corporate and real estate investments.
On Page 6, we show the composition of our Asset Management balance sheet, consistent with the information that we have provided to you in prior quarters. On equity and CIE portfolios remain highly diversified by sector, geography and vintage. And our debt investment portfolio is also diversified with segment loans largely secured.
On Page 7, turning to Consumer & Wealth Management, we produced $1.7 billion of revenues in the fourth quarter. Full year net revenues were $6 billion, up 15% versus a year ago, driven by higher management and other fees and strong consumer banking growth. For the quarter, wealth management net revenues included record management and other fees of $1 billion. Full year revenues of $4.8 billion rose 10% year-over-year and assets under supervision rose to a record $615 billion at year-end. Total client assets in the segment exceeded $1 trillion at the end of 2020.
Consumer banking revenues were $347 million in the fourth quarter, contributing to full year revenues of $1.2 billion, which rose 40% year-over-year and were diversified across lending, card and savings. Consumer deposits remained stable during the quarter despite an additional rate reduction, ending the year at $97 billion across the U.S. and U.K., up $37 billion versus last year.
Funded consumer loan balances were $8 billion, of which $4 billion were from Marcus consumer loans and $4 billion from credit card lending. Importantly, the credit behavior of our loan and credit card portfolio outperformed our expectations. The portfolio benefited from improved underwriting as well as the consequences of our consumer assistant plans.
Next, let's turn to Page 8 for firm-wide assets under supervision. Total AUS rose to over $2.1 trillion during the quarter and are up nearly $290 billion versus a year ago. The sequential change was driven by $17 billion of long-term inflows, $6 billion of liquidity inflows and $86 billion of market appreciation.
On Page 9, we addressed net interest income and our lending portfolio across all segments. Total firm-wide NII was $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter, up versus a year ago, primarily reflecting growth in the firm's balance sheet, particularly in Global Markets as well as the benefit from credit card balances and repricing of deposits in Consumer & Wealth Management. Equally, this activity is reflective of the decision to allow our GSIB surcharge to increase to 3%.
Next, let's review loan growth and credit performance across the firm. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $116 billion, up $4 billion sequentially, largely driven by modest growth in loans in Consumer & Wealth Management and real estate warehouse lending. Our provision for credit losses in the fourth quarter was $293 million, roughly flat sequentially and down versus a year ago.
The quarter's provisions were driven primarily by continued growth in lending in our consumer business and wholesale impairments, offset by some reserve leases driven by improving macroeconomic conditions. Given our announced partnership with General Motors and the planned acquisition of the current loan receivables from Capital One, we expect to recognize approximately $200 million of associated provisions in the first quarter.
At quarter end, our allowance for credit losses for both loans and commitments stood at $4.4 billion, including $3.9 billion for funded loans. Our allowance for funded loans was flat versus last quarter at 3.7% for our $103 billion accrual portfolio, including an allowance for wholesale loans of 2.7% and for consumer loans of 15.9%. For the full year, we recognized firm-wide net charge-offs of $907 million, resulting in an annualized net charge-off ratio of 0.9%, up 30 basis points versus last year.
Next, let's turn to expenses on Page 10. Our total operating expenses were $5.9 billion in the fourth quarter. For the full year, our efficiency ratio was 65%, which includes a nearly 800 basis point impact from litigation expense. On compensation, our philosophy remains to pay for performance, and we are committed to compensating top talent. While compensation expenses were up 8% year-over-year relative to growth in revenue net of provisions for credit losses of 17%, our full year compensation ratio is at a record low, reflecting the operating leverage in our franchise. As we have said in the past, we view the compensation ratio metric as less relevant to the firm as we build new scale platform businesses.
On noncompensation expense, our cost for the full year 2020 rose 25% versus last year. Excluding litigation, our full year operating expenses grew by only 8%, inclusive of investment spend across the business and higher variable expenses associated with transaction volumes. Growth was partially offset by efficiency savings and lower travel and entertainment costs due to the circumstances of COVID-19.
Finally, on taxes. Our reported tax rate was 18.7% for the fourth quarter and 24.2% for the year, reflecting the impact of nondeductible expenses. We continue to expect our tax rate over the next few years to be approximately 21% under the current tax regime.
Turning to our capital levels on Slide 11. As previously discussed, our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio increased to 14.7% at the end of the fourth quarter under the standardized approach, up 20 basis points sequentially. Earnings were largely offset by higher RWAs as we stepped in to serve our clients. Our ratio under the advanced approach increased 50 basis points to 13.4%.
Turning to the balance sheet. Total assets ended the quarter at $1.2 trillion, rising 3% versus last quarter as we deployed resources to facilitate client activity, particularly within our Prime Brokerage business. We maintained very high liquidity levels with our global core liquid assets averaging $298 billion, reflecting the current backdrop. On the liability side, our total deposits were roughly flat at $260 billion as planned roll-off of higher-cost broker deposits was partially offset by modest growth in consumer, private bank and transaction banking deposits.
In conclusion, our strong fourth quarter and 2020 results reflect the diversification of our client franchise, resilience of our business model, strong risk discipline and flexibility in our balance sheet deployment. David, John and I are proud of our people for their efforts this year in serving our clients and delivering on our strategic goals, especially given the challenges of COVID-19. We look forward to furthering our progress on our medium- and long-term targets, and we remain confident that execution of our strategic plan will drive better client experience, more durable revenues and higher returns for our shareholders over time. 
With that, thank you again for dialing in, and we'll now open the line for questions."

We were just on this slide reiterating the medium-term target that we had set at 10%. I would point out that while reported ROE in 2020 for Global Markets was 14.1%, the performance ex litigation that's otherwise allocated to the segment was 18.1%.
I think the other point I would make here is that as we look forward and as we've commented several times, impossible to know what 2021 and beyond hold in terms of what the industry is presented. But I think there have been some fairly profound structural shift in that business. One, of course, is the expense base is being reduced. The second is we're much more attuned to the sort of agile deployment of capital across.
But I think perhaps most important is the improvement of wallet share and the focus on clients. And David commented a couple of times on the improvement in overall wallet share, growing by 120 basis points through 3 quarters, and we'll see what played out for the full year.
But I'd also say that a step-up in where we stand with the objective of being top 3 across the top 100 institutional clients in Global Markets, I think, also reflects that we'll capture at or better than our share on a going-forward basis, again, acknowledging that the market may not look as robust on the forward as it did in '20 for this business, but the structural changes are important."

So I get the allocation of more capital. I get the capital that you freed up on the announced sales. I know that when you're initially going down this path, I felt optimistic of your ability to raise lots of third-party money and you have. Just wonder if you have a thought process on '21 or it's just continued marching towards the $150 billion.
And in the same regard, I was concerned about selling down private equity would leave an earnings pickup at some point. But being that you have almost $2 billion in unrecognized incentive fees, do you feel like you can continue down this free up capital, sell down private equity, raise third-party path without a big earnings there to pick up?"

First, on fundraising, I think what's gratifying about the progress made in 2020 was a comment David made about an increasing number of clients new to the firm that are investing with Goldman Sachs. And so that leaves us optimistic about the prospect of the fundraising pipeline in 2020, which will be across a range of different investing sleeves, and we'll start to see that growing number of investing clients, look across a range of different product offerings that we have.
On the sell-down, we're very attentive and have always been to the prospect of creating kind of a canyon. And we don't anticipate that to happen, and we'll continue to manage with that in mind.
Now you draw the right observation, which is there's $1.8 billion of embedded fees to take, which we will take when gains become irrevocable or irreversible, and so that will buffer. But the point here is that our objective is to reduce the stress loss intensity of that segment. And so we've spoken about $4 billion in balance sheet sales to yield $2 billion of capital relief. We equally have line of sight into another $2.5 billion of sales, which could generate another $1 billion of capital relief.
And I'd also point out, though it's not obvious in the way in which the results play, but over the course of the year, we sold $2.1 billion of public equities to offset about $1.9 billion of appreciation in market value. And so that equally has capital consequence for us. And so you'll continue to see us move along that road.
Finally, on the question or the observation you made about what I was speaking to about what we will do in terms of attributed equity to that segment. That has no bearing on what our objective is, which is to bring capital down. But as CCAR 2020 was higher, more capital came to the firm. We don't keep a corporate segment, so we allocate or attribute that equity out to the segments.
By definition, because of its intensity, Asset Management will pick up more capital. Obviously, on a unit of balance sheet reduction, more capital will come out as we reduce positions, which is why we're confident that we'll maintain at or better than what we're indicating in terms of capital reduction in the segment overall."

I -- and we tried to highlight this in the update that we're working to go from a product structure with a handful of products to a much more integrated offering for our customers. And so when you ask about comparison to some of the fintechs, I just say the fintechs are much more narrow in scope in terms of what they offer and don't have the broad capabilities that we have and we're embedding and we're expanding on for our clients.
So just in the context of the 2 examples that you gave in highlighting SoFi or Chime, when you think about spending across both checking and credit cards, when you think about borrowing across credit cards and loans and you think about savings and also investing and the investment capabilities that we have as a wealth manager, we have a much broader integrated offering. And we continue to get feedbacks that the state-of-the-art product platform and the digital applications that we have are really excellent by any standards. So we're going to continue to move forward with that long-term strategy.
I don't really have a comment on the valuation of these businesses, although I'm watching with everyone else, and I'm looking at what we have, the number of clients we have, the number of customers, the size of our business, the scale that we have as we continue to move forward. And I'm looking at that opportunity, the growth that we have. And if people like those businesses, I think at some point in time, they should like and value our business more fulsomely, but we'll continue to execute and wait on that.
We really like our model of having a proprietary platform for Marcus. But then also given our corporate relationships, the potential for partnerships is very, very strong for us. And I think you saw that in our execution this year by adding 4 more partnerships, by capturing the GM card. And I think you'll continue to see us do more on this front. And so we feel good about it.
But as I said in my comments, we're taking a long-term view in what we're doing, and none of this will affect our medium-term targets that we're working toward at the end of 2022. Gets a lot of attention, but it won't affect our targets."

Maybe my second question, and apologies, this one is a bit of a nitty question. But I'm trying to understand the impact of interest rates on the Markets business. I guess in the earnings release, you called out higher funding costs and lower yields on the liquidity reserves as a headwind to the Markets business. But also in the actual deck, we saw a really big step-up in Global Markets NII quarter-over-quarter.
So maybe just step back here, remind us how interest rates impact the business, whether it's the current level of interest rates, the yield -- the shape of the yield curve and then some of the liability management actions you've taken, how does that impact the markets business, I guess, over the coming year."

That was driven largely by balance sheet growth, notably in growth markets and most especially in prime. So our prime balances were up.
The challenging aspect for us and the reference made in the context of funding is that our liquidity grew over the quarter. We were slower to adjust, particularly on the retail deposit side, the pricing of our liabilities. And so we didn't capture quite what we wanted. Obviously, we've now brought rates down, and so we're able to sort of allocate that cost out to the business.
So liabilities are important. NII expanded because of balance sheet and impacted overall net funding costs. And so that's the reference, if you will, to the headwinds. Notwithstanding prime balances growing, funding costs were higher than we wanted. That notwithstanding, NII grew because of overall balance sheet growth over the course of the quarter in prime and by virtue overall of moving to a higher GSIB in the context of meeting client demands."

There's obviously growth in some of the growth initiatives, including transaction banking as well as what we're doing on the consumer side. And so you'll continue to see pickup and share pickup.
None of those are necessarily meant to be compensating factors for what could be a shortfall in Global Markets. I think within Global Markets, we will buffer, structurally speaking, what might be a less impressive opportunity set on the forward relative to '20 by virtue of what we've done around market share gains and equally what we're doing around the cost base.
And I'd say also, if you look within the Global Markets business, what we're seeing in terms of the growth in low-touch, high-volume activity around Marquee and the digital platforms, particularly growth in portfolio trading across, I think all of those will spell sort of improved performance as a general matter, notwithstanding the market.
Finally, I'd point out that the investment banking footprint continues to expand. And that too will provide an offset to the extent that -- again, the assumption to your question, that we see lower opportunity as an industry matter within the trading or Global Markets business."

So on capital, look, our capital philosophy really remains unchanged, which is we look for opportunities for accretive return on investment in capital in the business and equally meeting client demands that are there. Separate from that, it's my expectation that we will hit our first quarter repurchase expectations, which based on the calculation of the Fed will be about $1.9 billion in the quarter, plus neutralizing equity-based compensation expense. And so we will fulfill that in the first quarter.
I'd also repeat a comment I made in the prepared remarks is that we'll continue to reevaluate our dividend in the context of the shape and form of the business being more durable going forward. Obviously, that's not a first quarter proposition given the Fed rules, but you can certainly rely on the repurchase expectations and our fulfillment of them.
In terms of Asset Management, this is all about an overall reduction in the balance sheet intensity of that business. It is being mindful of revenue in the near term. It's driving down on-balance sheet investing and moving that into third-party activity, doing that across more sleeves with more clients of the firm.
And I think that will continue to take down our capital and I suspect based on the progress we made in 2020 of taking $2 billion on $4 billion of sales. And as I mentioned, our forward view on what's within line of sight, incremental capital will come out at or better than the expectations we carried at the Investor Day itself."

And I'll just -- to take your framing, you said historically, at times of severe stress, you've been a dealer of choice. And you really -- you make that statement by going back and looking at one window, which was the financial crisis. And there's no question in the financial crisis, we had very, very significant share gains. But I would highlight that one of the reasons that we had very significant share gains during the financial crisis is that a lot of the people that would be in our core competitive set were in a position of very, very weak structural financial performance at the time, and it definitely inhibited their ability to intermediate with clients.
So one of the things I recall hearing at that time is a lot of firms did not show up during the financial crisis, and we benefited from that. I think, hopefully, we benefited for other reasons, but there was a different component.
We have a very, very different situation right now. Banks have been a source of strength during the pandemic. All of our competitors have showed up in spades and yet we had very, very significant share gains. Now maybe some of that is a branded reputation that we're a dealer of choice during a pandemic. But I would argue, a bigger impact in really affecting how we performed, and I've heard this consistently from our Global Markets clients, is a change strategically in our approach over the last few years in terms of how we're facing clients, our One GS approach and what we're trying to do.
We talked a little bit in the strategic update in talking about how, for the first time over the last couple of years, we have a targeted approach in evaluating our wallet share with the top 100 clients. Seems relatively straightforward, but this is not something we had ever done historically. And that we advanced that considerably over the course of 2020 by going from top 3 with 51 of the clients to top 3 of 64 of the clients.
We have a much more client-centric approach. I got a lot of feedback calls this year from our clients noticing what they said was a very different approach in the way Goldman Sachs interacted with them now and versus 10 years ago. And so I would argue, across the platform, that orientation is helping our wide share gains.
Now I'm not going to sit here and say that in a different environment, when the world is more even and we're not in a crisis, that there's not going to be a flattening. In fact, I'd say that across all our businesses. We tend to outperform in investment banking during times of stress, and the market share gains collapsed a little bit in times when everything is very, very easy. And so I'm sure there'll be some of that. But we have a very, very clear strategy, very, very clear client-centric strategy that's different, and I think it's led to enhanced wallet share gains.
I'd also say, and we highlighted this in the context of looking at that business, this goes back to one of the earlier questions, we've made structural improvements not just in the client approach, but also in the cost base of that business and in our capital allocation in that business.

But what I would say is we're still in the middle of a pandemic. There's still an enormous amount of stimulus. And there's also -- because of the acceleration of digital trends, there are lots of businesses and lots of CEOs that are rethinking or reunderwriting strategically how they're positioned. So corporate activity and therefore, capital markets activity in that context is high.
Certainly, as we head into 2021, there are a lot of indicators that, that's going to continue in 2021, certainly in the near term. And so our expectation is, certainly, in the near term, that activity will continue. To the degree that we get to a more normalized environment, to the degree that there is a backing off of fiscal activity, to the degree over time is a more normalization of monetary policy, that obviously can affect this activity level, but that's not something we'd expect in the near term in 2021. So at the moment, the pipeline, backlogs, things that we can see continue to look robust.
That doesn't mean that we're saying that we expect a repeat of everything we saw in 2020, and there certainly are different parts of both the banking and the markets business that I think were elevated in 2020 and our expectations for 2021 are not as robust as they were in 2020 but certainly more robust than they were in 2019."

I think as we've also said in the past, and this is reflected a little bit in your question, the comp ratio is going to become much less of a relevant metric in this, in part because the profile of the business will change. That is, as we grow up businesses like transaction banking or the consumer business, they will be less comp heavy in terms of overall expense, and that ratio will be ultimately less relevant.
But I think for where we are right now, there's considerable leverage in this where we're capable of rewarding our talent for performance overall but equally doing that on a levered basis so that our shareholders and shareholders benefit more broadly from the overall performance."

It will grow by several hundred million dollars year-over-year. It will do that really for 2 reasons. One, continued improvement at the core, that is the way in which the firm operates more broadly. It is achievement of some of what David was talking about around automation and the like.
And then separately, it will be focused on particular initiatives like transaction banking, like the consumer business and so forth. And I think part of our focus on the efficiencies that we're capable and the cost savings we're capable of getting is such that those savings can subsidize the investment being made in places like technology around the firm.
And so you'll continue to see that investment play out. We have less remedial activity than perhaps some of the other bigger commercial banks have in as much as we have a lot of new tech build and new activity going on.

And I'd say that activity levels broadly across the banking platform are up. Certainly, SPAC activity is contributing to it, but strategic corporate M&A is up meaningfully.
And what I'd say is there was a real kind of doldrum as the pandemic hit and people were reorganizing. But as we came out in the summer and people started to kind of look through the tunnel and get a sense of where things were going, strategic activity with corporates really picked up. And that's contributed meaningfully also. And that has nothing really to do with the SPAC ecosystem.
On SPACs, Mike, I'll say a couple of things. There's no question that the growth of SPACs as a product definitely affected activity levels, but there are a few things that I'd say, just to try to frame it. SPACs were a little bit more than 50% of IPO activity this year. But when you look at IPO activity, IPO activity for us, for example, was on a volume basis, about 17% of our equity volume. So we did about $20 billion of IPO league table against $115 billion of equity league table, 17%.
If you look at our IPO fees, all IPOs, SPAC and non-SPAC -- and again, SPACs, let's say, around 50%. But if you look at our IPO fees, our IPO fees, were less than 40% of all our equity underwriting fees, and then SPACs would be a subset of that.
Now to your point, it also creates an ecosystem around capital raising, around advisory services, et cetera. And so there's no question that, that ecosystem at the moment is creating a tailwind for some of these capital market activities.
There are a couple of other things I'd say. First, we generally strive to be #1 in the league tables. We do not strive to be #1 in the SPAC league tables. We are very -- while we're very active, we're very thoughtful about our sponsors and the business that we take on. And just looking at last year, if you look at the number of SPACs that were done and the league table leaders, the #1 and #2 firms did about 33% more deals than we did, representative, I think, of some of the things that came to us that we turned away. So we're participating, but we're trying to participate by picking what we think are the best situations.
I do think SPACs is a good use case versus a traditional IPO and advantageous for sellers and for investors in looking at this ecosystem. But the ecosystem is not without flaws. I think it's still evolving. I think the incentive system is still evolving.
One of the things we're watching very, very closely is the incentives of the sponsors and also the incentives of somebody that's selling. And while I think these activity levels continue to be very robust and that they do continue as we head into 2021 to continue to be very, very robust, I do not think this is sustainable in the, medium term. And there'll be something that will, in some way, shape or form, bring the activity levels down over a period of time.
But we're watching it closely. And it's something that our clients continue to be very, very interested in. There are lots of companies that go public via SPAC that could also go public in a traditional IPO. And there are some companies that go public in a SPAC that probably couldn't go public through the standardized process of a traditional IPO. And all of those are things that the market will have to wrestle with.
And one of the things I certainly think is the case is you have something here that's a good capital markets innovation. But like many innovations, there's a point in time as they start where they have a tendency maybe to go a little bit too far and then need to be pulled back or rebalanced in some way. And that's something, my guess, is we'll see over the course of 2021 or 2022 with SPACs."

And we continue to roll out on the investments that we're making, including, as we said, you'll see Invest this quarter, Marcus Invest this quarter and you'll see checking during the course of the year.
With respect to M&A opportunities broadly, whether it's to expand our consumer offering, whether it's to grow our Asset Management business, whether it's to expand our wealth management capability, we're always looking for ways to accelerate our strategic growth plans. If something came along that helped us accelerate or advance our strategic growth plan, and we thought that it was a good fit strategically and we thought we could acquire and integrate it attractively, then we would do it, just as we did with United Capital. But the bar to do something significant is extremely high, and it's not an easy thing to do.
So we'll continue to look for things that can accelerate our growth plan, but we're going to continue to invest in these businesses. And I think the important thing for you to note is that we have a lot of confidence that these can be sizable businesses at scale that are accretive to Goldman Sachs' returns even if we do not do something significant inorganically."

And then my second one is on the efficiencies, and I know there have been a few questions there. But from my perspective, it's -- I guess, it's just a little bit hard to unpack some and see some of the $650 million that you referenced earlier, Stephen. You guys have a lot of revenue and volume sensitivity on your expense side. And that's usually particularly true on the comp front. So maybe how much of the $650 million was in noncomp versus comp? And what is your expectation for the timing on the remaining $650 million? Any color is going to be helpful."
398625,700318128,2175599,"The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 19, 2021",2021-01-19,"Earnings Calls","The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.","Executives","Yes, yes. So let me answer the question a couple of ways. First of all, a spot observation on noncomp expense in a year. So our noncomp was up 8% ex litigation. Of about $900 million of noncomp expense increase year-over-year, about 2/3, in excess of $600",384,"Yes, yes. So let me answer the question a couple of ways. First of all, a spot observation on noncomp expense in a year. So our noncomp was up 8% ex litigation. Of about $900 million of noncomp expense increase year-over-year, about 2/3, in excess of $600 million was variable expense, BC&E, all of which is related to the volume of activity that's coming through. And so I just frame that just so you have a sense of how noncomp framed out over the course of the year.
Now if you look at our achievement of about half of the $1.3 billion of run rate efficiencies that we've set as a target for ourselves, I would say up through the end of 2020, a good proportion of that came out of the compensation side, okay, relative to noncomp.
So by that, I mean, we've undertaken a very significant exercise over the course of 2020 at spans and layers, meaning we've looked at the sheer number of people we have in a variety of parts of the organization. We've looked at scope of management and we've been able to sort of achieve efficiencies in that regard.
We engaged in a front-to-back exercise that put more people from an ops and technology point of view in line of sight of the people in the business who know and understand what their objectives are and where they're going. Third is we've looked at location of where many of these people are and have accelerated that. And so that's on the sort of compensation side.
On the noncompensation side, I would say that we've done a complete rationalization of campuses in places like London and in Bangalore, harvesting significant savings there. We've moved to a more disciplined and centralized planning tool. We've looked to centralize our expense management through SAP, taking multiple platforms and pulling them into one.
All of these have sort of put us in a position to realize about 50% of the $1.3 billion and frankly speaking, give us a bit more confidence about what we can achieve on the forward, perhaps in excess of it. And so that may be a bit more granular than you want, but just to lay out sort of the elements, right, of where these expenses are being harvested."

So Gerard, I think it's a good question. I appreciate it, and I think there's a huge advantage. So putting aside some of the things I'm talking about that are strategically based on our conscious decisions, we happen to be one of a handful of firms that is global at scale and a market leader in these global markets and investment banking businesses.
And I think it is increasingly difficult to compete in these businesses unless you're global and at scale, unless you have the capacity to make very, very significant technology investments into platforms to better connect with your clients. And so there has been a consolidation of wallet share into the leading players across these platforms, and we continue to be one of those players. And I think that position has only grown and been strengthened.
I also would point out that we don't just have scale broadly. We've stayed committed, as I highlighted earlier in my remarks, to all the different silos and asset classes across our markets business. So you think about the many asset classes across markets, we benefited because we stayed committed to commodities, and we have a more fulsome offering for our clients and there was a real benefit to that this year.
So I think there's no question, the leading firms have a strong competitive advantage. I think, to maintain that competitive advantage and have reasonable margins given the capital requirements, the technology requirements, the regulatory requirements, being in a leadership position is much more important today than it was 15, 20, 25 years ago."

And there continues to be leverage in the business. To the extent that revenue growth doesn't materialize as we expected, we've got levers to pull on expense, which is why we are comfortable with a view that we'll achieve an efficiency ratio at or around 60% by 2022.

And that has been a refreshing change to kind of legacy platforms that have been there.
I say that not just simply an observer, but also a consumer of that service where Goldman Sachs is using its own platform. And I think that will continue in part because operational flows across corporates will continue almost notwithstanding what plays out in the context of the market movement overall.
The consumer side may be a different proposition. Now it depends on the perspective you take with respect to GDP growth and what happens with rates and the like. But I think as David has said, on the consumer side, we are playing for the long term. That is building a relationship with tens of millions of consumers and pivoting in 2021 to a broader, more comprehensive platform that I think will attract more consumers to the platform, not simply because there's an attractiveness to the deposit rate or to rate on lending, but because we'll offer a more comprehensive package of investing and checking and we'll become a more reliable primary bank to more consumers. And I think that will play out, again, kind of notwithstanding where the markets otherwise take us on some of the more capital markets-intensive activity."

There's no question that has moved to the back of the year in Q4. You saw compression from what was wide in Q2 and Q3. But there again, wallet share gains benefited us and equally playing to both high touch and low touch. And so the advent of what we were doing through Marquee and equally through portfolio trading on these electronic platforms was of equal benefit.
So tighter bid-offer there as opposed to wider bid-offer in Q2. But I think you're seeing a business that is more diverse, broader and in a position to continue to intermediate flows and do so with very high balance sheet velocity."

I will begin on Page 1 of the presentation with a summary of our financial results. In the first quarter, we produced record net revenues of $17.7 billion. The strength and breadth of our client franchise continued to be evident as we delivered net earnings of $6.8 billion; record quarterly earnings per share of $18.60; and a return on equity of 31% and a return on tangible equity of 32.9%, the highest in over a decade. Our first quarter results underscore the ongoing strength of our franchise in the supportive environment in which we operated during the quarter. These results also evidence our successful execution towards the firm's strategic priorities. We maintained our leading global positions across M&A and equity underwriting. We delivered the best performance in global markets in a decade, with strength in FICC and equities driven by solid client activity across our platform and reinforced by last year's market share gains. 
In asset management, we recognized significant net gains across our public and private equity positions. And we continued to harvest on-balance sheet investments in our efforts to transition the business to more third-party assets, where we are making progress in raising funds across a range of investing strategies. In wealth management, we continue to provide valuable advice to our ultra-high net worth PWM clients, while we further scale our personal financial management business. 
And in consumer, we continue to make strong progress on our vision to create the leading digital consumer banking platform. This quarter, we launched Marcus Invest in the U.S., our digital investment offering, which provides consumers access to diversified investment portfolios with as little as a $1,000 investment. The customer response and uptake since launch has been positive, and we are focused on scaling the platform. We're also working toward the launch of digital checking in the U.S. and Marcus Invest in the U.K. 
Importantly, we maintained a resilient and highly liquid balance sheet as we continue to deploy our resources to support clients amid an evolving and dynamic market backdrop.
With that, let me turn now to the operating environment on Page 2. As anticipated, we saw improvement in the macroeconomic backdrop during the first quarter, which was supported by the continued accommodative fiscal and monetary policies of central banks and governments around the world. At this stage, it is clear to me that the U.S. is poised for a strong recovery this year, led by consumer spending that is rebounding to pre-COVID levels. This sentiment is reflected in the capital markets, with U.S. equities hovering at or near records and bolstered by recent U.S. employment data and our economist forecast on GDP growth. 
Despite these positive developments, we recognize that the operating backdrop will undoubtedly evolve and that much of the global economic recovery will depend on the progress around COVID-19. While the rollout of vaccines is well underway in the U.S. and the U.K., distribution has been challenged in a number of other countries around the globe, and the prospect of new variants adds to potential concerns around the trajectory of the economic recovery. 
As you would expect, we remain vigilant to risks across markets. We are mindful of elevated valuation levels across certain asset classes, increased volatility in certain single-name stocks, and are aware of the inflationary risks inherent in the actions being taken to stimulate continued growth in the economy. 
Let me now also take a moment to share my views on a few important topics where I've been fielding questions from clients and other stakeholders.  First, on the events related to Archegos Capital. This was a case of an investor with highly concentrated and leveraged positions. This is not the first time we've seen a situation like this, and it likely won't be the last. 
We have robust risk management that governs the amount of financing we provide for these types of portfolios. Our risk controls, all of which were put in place long before the March events worked well. We identified the risk early and took prompt action consistent with the terms of our contract with the client. I am pleased with how the firm handled it, and it's a reflection of the engagement and communication of teams across Goldman Sachs, both in the business and on the control side of our firm. 
These events raised reasonable questions around market practice and transparency. They are worthy of debate, and we intend to play a constructive role in that dialogue.
Next on SPACs, we continue to believe that providing sponsors a mechanism to access public markets for capital formation is an innovation that's here to stay. However, as a meaningful participant in this market, we will continue to be thoughtful regarding the transactions we underwrite with a particular focus on the quality of sponsors, sponsor economics, investor protections and disclosure. We believe the industry should evolve on these important issues in the interest of more efficient and transparent markets. 
I also want to touch on the topics of cryptocurrency, blockchain and the digitization of money. As activities in these areas progress, there will be significant disruption and change in the way money moves around the world. Many central banks are looking at digital currencies and working to apply this technology to the local markets and determine the longer-term impact on global payment systems. There's also significant focus on cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, where the trajectory is less clear as market participants evaluate their possibility as a store of value. 
At Goldman Sachs, we continue to look for ways to expand our capabilities to support our clients' needs and evaluate applications to improve our organizational efficiency. Of course, we need to operate within the current regulatory guidelines. For example, we cannot own Bitcoin or trade it as [ principal. ] Goldman Sachs will play a role in these innovations as they are important to our clients and important to the future of global financial systems. 
Another topic coming up in stakeholder conversations is sustainability. We remain steadfast in our commitments to sustainable finance. Central to our purpose as an organization, our programs are commercially attractive and utilize our expertise and capital to support all of our stakeholders. During the quarter, we issued our first sustainability bond where we raised $800 million, the proceeds of which will be allocated towards initiatives aimed at accelerating climate transition and advancing inclusive growth. We also launched One Million Black Women, an initiative that I'm very proud of and through which the firm will commit $10 billion in direct investment capital and $100 million in philanthropic capital for capacity-building grants over the next decade to narrow the opportunity gaps for black women in the United States. Separately, we also committed an additional $500 million to Launch with GS, our program designed to invest in diverse-led companies and fund managers, bringing our total commitments to $1 billion.
Finally, I want to take a few minutes to comment on our people. I continue to hear from clients that the quality and dedication of our people is one of our great differentiators. The firm's quarterly results are the product of our client focus and the dedication of the employees of Goldman Sachs day in and day out. Notwithstanding the challenges that they have all faced as we mark 1 year into the COVID-19 pandemic, our people have rallied to the needs of our clients. I would like to thank my colleagues around the world. I am in awe of their performance and of our results this quarter due to their hard work, dedication and our culture of teamwork. 
It will always be a priority for our firm to attract and retain the best talent to serve our clients and execute on our strategy. We have a vibrant partnership and a deep bench of talent across the organization. Many will spend their entire career with us. Some will even become clients of the firm. This is a virtuous ecosystem that has been in place for decades. It is also aligned with the evolution of our partnership strategy, where we're working to continue to make the partnership more aspirational. 
I recognize there's an enormous amount of discussion about how companies will operate their businesses post-pandemic. For Goldman Sachs, our people operate at their best when they are forging close bonds with colleagues and furthering the apprenticeship culture that has defined us. We have found that the best way to do that is to work together in person on a regular basis. 
Let me be clear, achieving the objective of bringing our colleagues back to the office is not inconsistent with the desire to provide our people with the flexibility they need to manage the personal and professional lives, which is the way we have always run this firm. And given the experience of the past year, I am more confident than ever in our ability to facilitate this approach going forward. 
Over the course of the past few months, we have been welcoming thousands of colleagues back to the office in a manner consistent with safety guidelines in each city in which we operate. We have implemented testing and other protocols across our offices to make for a safer work environment and to provide those returning to the office with a sense of confidence in their return. Importantly, I look forward to increasing the number of employees returning as vaccination programs around the world expand, and we welcome new joiners to the firm's offices this summer. 
Regarding our junior bankers and others in the organization who have been working tirelessly to support our clients and at times have been overburdened, I've been passionate about the experience of our junior people throughout my career. As you can now see from our results, client activity is extraordinarily high, and I fully appreciate how busy our people have been. This has been exacerbated by the isolation of working remotely in a COVID-19 environment. 
To address this, we are taking concrete actions, including additional hiring, reallocating resources, and pursuing stricter enforcements of boundaries. In this 24/7 connected world, we have to help those transitioning into the workforce to understand that Goldman Sachs is a place where we work very hard to serve our clients, but also need to be thoughtful about personal resilience and well-being.
In closing, I'm very pleased with how our people delivered for our clients and drove attractive returns for our shareholders. I'm confident in the state of our client franchise and the progress we are making as we execute our strategic priorities.
With that, I will turn it over to Stephen."

And good morning. Let me begin with our summary results on Page 3. During the first quarter, the firm's performance reflected meaningful strength across all 4 of our business segments. In investment banking, clients remained very active",2407,"Thank you, David. And good morning. Let me begin with our summary results on Page 3. During the first quarter, the firm's performance reflected meaningful strength across all 4 of our business segments. In investment banking, clients remained very active in raising capital, particularly in the equity markets. And we witnessed high levels of M&A activity amid elevated strategic dialogues. In global markets, we saw strength across all products and regions as client engagement remained high. In asset management, record performance was attributable to gains from our equity investments, particularly as we harvested private equity positions in an attractive market. We also saw double-digit revenue growth year-over-year in our consumer and wealth management segment for a third consecutive quarter as we further expand our wealth capabilities and scale our consumer offering.
Turning to specific business performance on Page 4, let me begin with investment banking. Investment banking produced record quarterly net revenues of $3.8 billion, up 73% versus a year ago. Financial advisory revenues of $1.1 billion rose 43% versus last year on increased transaction closings in the quarter. During the quarter, we maintained our #1 league table position as we participated in over $400 billion of announced transactions, over $100 billion ahead of our next closest competitor, and closed over 100 deals for approximately $300 billion of deal volume. 
The bigger headline in investment banking again this quarter was equity underwriting, where we generated a record $1.6 billion in revenues, over 4x greater than the levels a year ago. We ranked #1 globally in equity underwriting, with our volumes climbing to nearly $50 billion across roughly 240 deals, including over 90 initial public offerings for companies across all markets like Coupang in Korea, InPost in Poland and Bumble in the U.S. Our equity underwriting market share increased more than 60 basis points during the quarter, largely driven by improved share in IPOs. We experienced strong activity this quarter in follow-ons and new products, including our participation in a growing number of SPAC transactions. 
In debt underwriting, net revenues were $880 million, up 51% from a year ago, driven by strong activity levels particularly in leveraged finance, and asset-backed transactions. In addition, our engagement with sectors impacted by COVID, including airlines and hospitality, was high. Notwithstanding the significant realization of revenue in the quarter, our investment banking backlog ended the quarter at record levels, with sequential growth supported by sustained M&A activity as well as replenishment from underwriting transactions.  
Revenues from corporate lending were $205 million, down 54% versus the first quarter of last year, which included significant gains on hedges maintained with respect to our relationship loan book. Revenues in the quarter reflect net interest income, including from transaction banking and fees from relationship lending, partially offset by approximately $85 million of losses on hedges as spreads tightened modestly.
Moving to global markets on Page 5. Our franchise exhibited broad-based strength across businesses in both FICC and equities. Net revenues were $7.6 billion in the first quarter, up 47% versus a year ago and the highest since 2010. During the quarter, we benefited from a supportive market-making environment and facilitated considerable client activity.
Turning to FICC on Page 6. First quarter net revenues were $3.9 billion, up 31% versus a year ago, driven by a 36% increase in intermediation where we experienced healthy client flows and demonstrated strong risk management and grew revenues in 4 out of 5 businesses versus last year. In mortgages, revenues rose significantly, bolstered by solid results in agency mortgages and residential loans and high levels of client engagement as the business continues to diversify its revenue across market-making, loan origination and financing. 
In commodities, higher year-on-year performance was driven by solid inventory management across products amid volatile markets and healthy client flows. In rates, revenues rose amidst strong risk management and client engagement, particularly on the back of anticipated fiscal activity in the U.S. and diverging central bank actions during the quarter. In credit, revenues were up versus a year ago as the business benefited from continued improvement in credit spreads, while client activity remained healthy amid robust primary issuance. We also saw increase in volumes related to our automated bond pricing engine and growing activity in electronic trading. In currencies, revenues fell due to lower activity versus a strong quarter a year ago, though client engagement remained high across both the G10 and emerging markets franchises.
Turning to equities, net revenues for the first quarter were $3.7 billion, up 68% versus a year ago as we deployed our balance sheet to support clients and intermediated risk with discipline. Equities intermediation produced net revenues of $2.6 billion, up 69%, reflecting the global scale and breadth of our client franchise and aided by elevated client volumes across cash and derivatives as well as strong risk management. 
In cash, we facilitated client flows across high- and low-touch channels and executed a number of block trades for clients during the quarter. In derivatives, we produced record results as we saw solid activity in flow and structured transactions across both the U.S. and Europe. 
Equities financing revenues of $1.1 billion were the best in over a decade, rising 65% year-over-year. Average balances in our prime business grew to record levels as we supported clients amid the volatility and market events of the first quarter. 
As we continue to grow our prime business, we are well aware of the risks inherent in that business and the resources, including liquidity that are consumed. While we avoided losses related to recent events involving Archegos Capital, as David noted, the situation underscored the potential risks of the business and the corresponding importance of our risk infrastructure and control systems. 
As to forward expectations for global markets, it remains difficult to predict client activity. While we do not expect the pace of activity in the first quarter to necessarily persist for the balance of the year, we believe the high levels of primary issuance, the current trajectory of economic recovery and diverging central bank policies, particularly in emerging markets, could continue to support elevated client activity. Our confidence on the forward of global markets rests largely on the market share gains generated last year through a deepening of client relationships and our ongoing investment in technology platforms to enhance client experience and drive efficiencies. As we have noted previously, this progress has improved the structural return profile of the business independent of the wallet opportunity.
Moving now to asset management on Page 7. In the first quarter, we generated record revenues of $4.6 billion. Management and other fees totaled $693 million, up 8% versus a year ago, driven by higher average assets under supervision, partially offset by fee waivers on money market funds. Incentive fees of $42 million were lower versus a strong year-ago quarter. 
Equity investments produced $3.1 billion of net gains, including appreciation across our public investments and marks related to event-driven activity in our private equity portfolio, such as sales or capital raises. More specifically, on our $3 billion public equity portfolio, we had gains of roughly $340 million. This quarter, we disposed of over $1.5 billion of positions given attractive market conditions. Despite the quantum of public positions sold in the quarter, the more moderate decline in the size of our portfolio reflects the impacts of IPOs in our private portfolio and market appreciation. 
Across our $17 billion private equity book we generated gains of nearly $2.6 billion from various positions, more than 2/3 of which were driven by events relating to the underlying portfolio of companies, including fundraisings, capital market activities and outright sales. Additionally, we had operating revenues of $225 million related to our portfolio of consolidated investment entities. 
We announced or closed on dispositions of private assets of $1.5 billion in the quarter, bringing the total private sales since our 2020 Investor Day to $4.7 billion. There is an implied $2.3 billion of capital associated with those assets. Additionally, we have line of sight on nearly $3 billion of incremental asset sales. 
Despite these actions and as I mentioned on our January earnings call, we increased the equity attributed to asset management as a result of our 2020 CCAR stress test. This change was driven by our dynamic capital attribution methodology, which takes various regulatory constraints into consideration. On the forward, a continued reduction in balance sheet positions will produce a more meaningful impact on attributed equity reduction. Importantly, we remain on track to achieve our net reduction in segment capital, consistent with what we presented at our 2020 Investor Day, to below $18 billion by 2024. 
The ongoing harvesting of our investment portfolio is consistent with our strategy of migrating our business to third party versus on-balance sheet investing, and attractive market valuations have accelerated some sales. We are keen to continue such activity as it would be capital accretive to the firm.
That said, dispositions at attractive levels now will diminish gains from sales in forward quarters. We are mindful of that trade-off and are working to offset the revenue impact in subsequent years as we look to realize increasing fee income from the number of alternative funds being formed and invested.
Finally, in asset management, net revenues from lending and debt investment activities were $759 million on revenues from NII and gains on fair value debt securities and loans. This reflected modestly tighter credit spreads on our portfolio of corporate and real estate investments.
Let me now turn to Page 8, where we show the composition of our asset management balance sheet, consistent with the information that we have provided to you in prior quarters. Our equity and CIE portfolios remain highly diversified by sector, geography and vintage. And our debt investment portfolio is also diversified, with loans in the segment largely secured.
Moving to Page 9. Consumer and wealth management produced $1.7 billion of revenues in the first quarter, up 16% versus a year ago. Management and other fees of $1.1 billion rose 12% versus last year, reflecting higher assets under supervision, which rose 25% to $637 billion. Consumer banking revenues grew to $371 million in the first quarter, up 32% versus last year, reflecting higher credit card loans and deposit growth.
Next, let's turn to Page 10 for our firm-wide assets under supervision and firm-wide management and other fees. Total AUS increased to a record $2.2 trillion during the quarter, up over $380 billion versus a year ago. The sequential increase of $59 billion was driven by $37 billion of long-term inflows and $23 billion of liquidity inflows. Our total firm-wide management and other fees grew by 11% versus the first quarter of 2020 to $1.8 billion.
On Page 11, we address net interest income and our lending portfolio across all segments. Total firm-wide NII was $1.5 billion for the first quarter, higher versus a year ago, reflecting an increase in interest-earning assets and lower funding costs.
Next, let's review loan growth and credit performance across the firm. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $121 billion, up $5 billion sequentially, driven by residential real estate warehouse and wealth management lending. In the first quarter, provision for credit losses reflected a net benefit of $70 million. This includes a reserve reduction driven by improvements in the broader economic backdrop and loss expectations, partially offset by portfolio growth, including approximately $180 million in provisions related to the pending acquisition of loan receivables as part of our credit card partnership with General Motors expected to launch by year-end.
Next, let's turn to expenses on Page 12. Our total quarterly operating expenses were $9.4 billion. While our ratio of compensation to revenues net of provisions fell to 34% from 41% in the first quarter of last year, compensation expense increased, reflecting strong performance. Non-compensation expenses were up only 5% versus last year as an increase in transaction-based and technology expenses was largely offset by a decline in litigation and travel and entertainment expenses as well as lower expenses related to our consolidated investment entities. 
Overall, our efficiency ratio for the quarter was 53.3%, reflecting the operating leverage in our business. We remain focused on our expense discipline and a pay-for-performance culture as well as our expense initiatives, where we continue to evaluate additional opportunities for further savings. 
Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 18%, primarily reflecting the impact of equity-based compensation of approximately $175 million. As noted previously, we expect our tax rate under the current tax regime to be approximately 21%. I should note that we continue to monitor the impact of various proposals being made in the U.S. on the federal and state level.
Turning to our capital levels on Slide 13. Our common equity tier 1 ratio was 14.3% at the end of the first quarter under the standardized approach, down 40 basis points sequentially. The decline was driven by increased lending and higher market RWAs as we stepped in to serve clients, partially offset by strong earnings. 
In the quarter, we returned a total of $3.15 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $2.7 billion and approximately $450 million in common stock dividends. Our book value per share rose to a record $250.81. While the Federal Reserve has extended the limitations in place on share repurchases and dividend increases, we nonetheless expect to continue our repurchase plans in the second quarter close to the levels of the first quarter. And we'll evaluate an increase to the dividend as permitted.
Turning to the balance sheet. Total assets ended the quarter at $1.3 trillion, 12% higher versus last quarter as we supported client activity. We maintained high liquidity levels, with our global core liquid assets averaging nearly $300 billion. 
On the liabilities side, our total deposits rose to $286 billion, up $26 billion versus last quarter. Notably, consumer deposits surpassed $100 billion during the quarter. 
Our long-term debt rose by $6 billion, driven by $20 billion of benchmark issuance. Given the growth in our balance sheet outside of bank entities, particularly due to accretive deployment opportunities in our prime business, we now expect benchmark issuances to be modestly higher than maturities and redemptions this year. 
In conclusion, our first quarter results reflect the diversification and strength of our client franchise. We remain confident that execution of our strategic priorities will continue to drive a better client experience, more durable revenues, and strong returns for shareholders. With that, we'll now open up the line for questions."

So let me just go through the numbers, so we're all level set. 
In the quarter, we closed on about $1.5 billion of balance sheet reduction, producing about $852 million of AE relief. And as I noted in the prepared remarks, since our Investor Day, we've disposed of balance sheet positions totaling $4.7 billion. That produced about $2.3 billion of relief as well.
In terms of line of sight, as I said, we have a view into about $3 billion of balance sheet reduction. My view is that the capital attachment associated with that $3 billion would be I would say well in excess of about $1 billion, probably close to $1.4 billion in terms of AE relief there. 
As to the profile vintage and otherwise, I think it's important to recognize that in pursuing the strategy of migrating to more third-party funds, we're going to look across the portfolio regardless of vintage of opportunities, particularly in this market, to advance. It's not only in the pursuit of course of that strategy, but equally it reduces the capital density of that business and holds the promise of reduced capital that the firm would be required to hold overall, and so 2 components in the context of what we're trying to achieve strategically. 
If you look at what we've done just on the last part of your question in terms of fundraising, you'll remember that through 2020, we noted that we had raised funds approximating $40 billion. Taking that and extending it through the first quarter, we're up just north of about $52 billion and are looking to deploy that now where obviously management fees get paid on deployment and investment of that fundraising. And so the roster of ambition of what we're going to do this year is quite real. We're confident in our ability to achieve it. And this is all obviously part and parcel of meeting what I was talking about, which is as we see the harvest of positions now and take that revenue in we will see compensation for that, if you will, in the context of management fees as we grow and deploy capital in the alternative space."

I think on the forward as it relates, for example, to global markets, there it's difficult to say. As I noted in the comment and David did as well, it's hard to know what the market opportunity will be. The comparative set of results, second and third quarter last year versus this will be challenging, just given the volatility we saw last year in those quarters. 
I think the confidence we're taking in terms of sustainability of results lies in our market share. And we have picked up market share across global markets, across investment banking both in financial advisory and equity capital markets. And we will rely on that to capture kind of our fair share or better of the opportunity set presented."

First, I'll start at a high level, and then Stephen will probably give you some more granular data. 
But at a high level, one of the things we've been very focused on over the last 2.5 years is the client centricity of our business and trying to really look at the way clients experience us, look at it holistically, see how we're serving their needs holistically. You've heard us talk about our One GS mantra, our ability to bring the whole organization together to deliver better for clients. 
And one of the things that I'm hearing consistently from clients, as I reach out and spend time with clients, is that they feel like there's been a meaningful change in the kind of broad client service they're getting, our focus on them, the resources we're getting, giving -- or bringing to them the coordination of all that. And I think that has contributed meaningfully, that client centricity, that culture is contributing meaningfully to market share gains. 
You know and we've put it forward that we talked about looking at the top 100 accounts in global markets. We gave you data last quarter on our progress against those accounts, being top 3 against those accounts. That is a KPI we continue to track. We made progress last year, and we're committed to making further progress this year. And so I think that also has an impact on this.
In addition then obviously, you have the market activity that's generated. And so we get the benefit of those market shares gains against that activity. 
On your second question with respect to kind of activity looking forward, what I'd say was the first quarter was an extraordinary quarter. I don't think that the expectation should be that activity will continue at that pace through the second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter. But I will say that activity levels continue to be elevated from what I would say was a pre-COVID activity level by a meaningful amount. And I think as we said in the script that the environment, the monetary fiscal stimulus, and in addition the economic recovery, continues to paint a relatively constructive background. But I don't think the expectation should be for it to continue at the pace we saw in the first quarter."

First of all, across the equities business in global markets, I think we're seeing a very clear consolidation of share in and among a discrete number of banks in the U.S., among which we are one. We saw elevated prime levels, part of the strategy that we've been pursuing, and as I noted in my comments, record prime levels that contributed to meaningful uptick in equity financing. 
Even on the last call, I had noted that over the course of 2020 across global markets, we had picked up about 120 basis points of wallet share across the patch. And then when you look at -- I'll just take 2 individual businesses in FICC, just to pivot to FICC for a moment. 
First of all if you look at mortgages, the interesting thing about mortgages is that this business is now sort of pivoted away from sort of straight market-making and is now it's self-engaged in financing and loan origination. And so doing more for more clients has been kind of the signature, if you will, of just expanding in the mortgage space that has grown that business. 
And then if you look at credit, we have picked up meaningful market share, both in cash and loans, in the context of what we're doing. And then the last thing I would say, which I think is a contributor to enhanced share, client engagement and the like has been what we've done in the development of platforms. And credit is a good example of that, where portfolio trading has grown quite considerably. Our place in it is quite high. And so again it's all, as David is saying, client centricity and engagement with clients and meeting clients where they care to execute platforms being a good example."

I mean I'd argue that the opportunity set across pretty much all your businesses today are much bigger than certainly when you -- so much bigger today than when you set out some of those expense targets at Investor Day in early 2020. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about continuing along the path for those expense targets versus capitalizing on revenue opportunities that are ahead of you?"

First of all in noncomp expense more broadly, there should be no doubt that we have a very keen focus on controlling our expense base. I'm saying that independent of the efficiencies that we laid out at Investor Day which I'll come on to. But as reported, noncomp expense was up 5%; x litigation, up 9%. And within that, literally the totality of the increase in expenses were related to transaction-based expenses, so BC&E relating to elevated levels in global markets and our technology spend. And so I think on the forward, you should expect that where transaction activity is high, where we're meeting our clients, where market opportunity is large, that variable expense will continue to fluctuate consistent with the market and will carry us there.
The second piece I'll comment on is just the $1.3 billion of expense initiative. Again, independent of the day-to-day focus on non-comp expense. And there we continue to make progress in all of the areas that we had talked about, including our real estate footprint as we just announced that we're opening up offices in Birmingham. We did that as it relates to Hyderabad. All of that is a component piece of what we're trying to achieve in the $1.3 billion of expenses. 
The last piece I'd say is the operating leverage that exists with compensation. As we've said many, many times, we pay for performance. And so that lever is always available to us as and to the extent we see revenue turn down relative to the kind of performance we've otherwise seen in this quarter."

Since some of the areas where you noted some gains, like prime, are clearly going to be impacted by the prospect of potentially SLR being binding. And then just on risk-based ratios as well, if you could just speak to how you're thinking about the RWA trajectory as you continue to execute on the planned equity investment sales?"

So first on SLR, just to be clear, that has not been and is not a binding constraint on us, just to be clear about it. Obviously, 5% at the holdco is 6% at the bank. We stand higher than both of the minimums and don't find that to be a binding const",330,"Sure. So first on SLR, just to be clear, that has not been and is not a binding constraint on us, just to be clear about it. Obviously, 5% at the holdco is 6% at the bank. We stand higher than both of the minimums and don't find that to be a binding constraint to us. And so I would say that at both levels, we have ample growth capacity in terms of balance sheet growth before that comes on to the horizon as being an issue for us. So SLR, not the issue that it is for some of the other commercial banks.
In terms of RWA growth, I think that you'll see that commensurate with the nature and level of activity that's there. The one thing I do want to point out is that risk control and risk calibration remains unchanged. It is as disciplined as you would expect it to be, notwithstanding RWA growth. So the opportunity set that's been presented causes us to extend balance sheet and grow risk-weighted assets commensurate with that opportunity, but without compromise to the kind of risk levels that we find. 
I mean the thing I would say, Steve, on this is that if you look at growth in the firm and you look at growth in balance sheet, in the service of our clients as David's been talking about, the resource input to this has been maintained so as to protect the risk flank of the firm. We're sitting with elevated levels of liquidity at GCLA north of $300 billion. We sit in an ample capital position, obviously elevated by where the minimums sit, but within -- in an offensive mode and a buffer prepared to deal and engage with our clients. Marry those 2 resource sort of points alongside risk controls that David spoke about, and we feel quite comfortable with the RWA growth we're experiencing and keeping it in control and checked from a risk point of view."

I know this has been asked a number of different ways on recent calls. But just given the sheer pace of share gains; and David, some remarks you actually made at a conference this quarter noting that industry fee pool should normalize above 2019 levels, it does feel to us like those 2 factors alone should support more than $3 billion in higher run rate IB and trading revenues, which actually compares to a target for incumbent business growth of just 2 billion to 3 billion. So clearly some of the targets that you outlined at Investor Day on the revenue side do appear quite conservative, just given the sheer level of progress. I was hoping you could speak to your confidence around the ability to drive better growth in the incumbent businesses relative to those targets, and maybe if you feel like that north of 3 billion in higher run rate IB and trading is a reasonable expectation, given the underlying trends that you're seeing as well as the improved and deepened client penetration?"

We've always talked about how long-term market cap growth has led to long-term growth in our business broadly, but you've got to look at it over long periods of time. 
I think there are a variety of structural things that has supported growth in our core businesses, and I think we're seeing some of that. I'm not going to comment specifically on your numbers, although I think that your numbers as you point out set very reasonable expectations for us to meet our medium-term targets that we set at Investor Day. 
So I'll start by saying I am extremely confident of our ability to meet our medium-term targets that we set at Investor Day. We also said at Investor Day that, that is not our longer-term aspirations. And as the market continues to evolve, as we come out of the pandemic, as we have more clarity on how the world sets out moves forward, we'll give you clearer communication about our longer-term expectations for our ability to drive the franchise forward.

And there's no question if you look at a broader historical perspective, growth and activity levels in our business have been correlated to robust GDP growth around the world.

There's no question that there is meaningful consumer pent-up demand. Consumers have reasonable liquidity and savings higher than they did going into the pandemic. And we expect that all of that economic activity and that pickup in economic activity is a constructive backdrop for our business. 
There's no question, given the monetary and fiscal actions, that there's an increasing risk of inflationary activity. We all are watching very carefully comments from central banks around the world as we look forward. I think in my opinion, there's no question that we will see an increase in inflation. The question is how much, how quickly, and how we respond to that. 
And I think it's early, it's very early to speculate. But there is a scenario in the distribution where it would accelerate more quickly, and actions would have to be taken that would create more headwinds for our business. I don't see that as obvious on the near-term horizon as we look through this year and we continue to come out of the pandemic.

I think that the ambition here is to have the dividend grow commensurate with an increasing durability of revenues in the business.

On the corporate side, you can see it play out in the context of investment banking revenues broadly. I would say equally we're playing to a larger corporate set in our global market segment in terms of those becoming more prolific clients in what we do. 
And then on the geography, as I mentioned before, we have seen kind of double-digit growth in backlog in EMEA and in Asia. And we continue to see growth in the Americas as well. But again, the Americas presents a much larger set more broadly. 
I'd also refer you back to a comment David made and we've spoken about before, which is our ambition and our focus around client centricity in global markets. It's always been there as it relates to investment banking, has put us in among the top 3 among 64 of the most prolific clients, top 100 clients in global markets, and that's up from 51 the year before.

Stephen, you also mentioned in your remarks, clearly the focus on technology platforms and the front office experience for clients that you have improved and are improving. But maybe you could elaborate a little bit more in detail. 
For example, how much of your business is cloud based? How much do you want to get to cloud? How many platforms do you have on the trading side? And how many do you envision to have in the future? 
And on the front office side, we hear from a lot of banks that they're very good at the new platform operations that they are dealing with. But just wondering what is the experience at Goldman that makes it so different, in your view?"

But let me answer the question this way, and let me use transaction banking as being a really good example, okay? 
Transaction banking is a new platform designed from the front end all the way through to the back, into the books and records of the firm. It is cloud-based engineering, which has all the efficiencies that I'm sure you're aware of in terms of a lower expense to sort of keep it current in terms of developments around engineering and the like. 
And so our new builds are largely, perhaps not exclusively, but largely cloud-based. We're always looking to rationalize platforms. And I would say one thing I've learned from Marco Argenti and George in engineering is that it's as important to decommission old platforms as it is to put new ones in. We're riveted and focused on doing that so as to eliminate legacy technology, build in the cloud. And I think some of the newer businesses that we're involved in, transaction banking consumer, benefit from the absence of legacy, so that we can build new and efficiently and in the right form."

Have you considered -- you guys have done a lot with disclosure, and it's been great and very constructive. Have you considered making some adjustments in the disclosures, which would help investors and analysts to model some of those recurring revenues and show them as more mechanical, so to speak? 
For example with consumer banking, I mean consumer banking is the one that seems much clear to me. You just provide the revenue line, but we don't know what the breakdown is in fees versus NII. We don't know what the direct balances are tied to that. We don't know credit metrics that would allow for some sort of more mechanical calculations and I think might assist in the appreciation of how much of your revenue base is actually recurring amongst the analysts and investor community. 
Have you considered any of those changes or shifts? And do you think that might help in greater appreciation of those recurring revenue streams?"

On the specific points you raised around consumer, I think as consumer grows, and so David was reflecting before that, that business is now turning a corner to sort of resemble the ambition of a broader platform than it is a series of products. We'd like to find ourselves in a place where we will and can provide greater disclosure on consumer, just as an example. 
I would say the same will be true as transaction banking becomes more durable. These are areas where as they become more material, and we expect that they will, disclosure will naturally follow. And then I think your feedback is a good one, just in the context of providing a firm-wide perspective through disclosure on durability."

Really in all businesses everywhere, we continue to see consolidation of those in a strong -- with consolidation by those that are in a strong position. Because all businesses continue in the digital world we're in with further digitization require more tech investment, more scale, more global. And so in that context, obviously leaders are continuing to consolidate their strong positions.
With respect to our space broadly and how we think about this, I'm going to repeat verbatim what I said last quarter. And what I've said before, we spend a lot of time looking at opportunities to accelerate the growth of our franchise. In particular as we look at businesses like asset management and wealth, if we could find something that we felt would accelerate our strategic growth objectives, we would certainly consider it. But the bar for anything significant is high. And it has to be the right industrial logic more than the fact that we have a currency because the stock is higher. 
And so we continue to think about ways that we could accelerate our growth, but the bar to do it is high. Prices are high. It's a competitive environment. And we feel good about our plan, but we'll continue to do the work and be diligent about looking for opportunities where we can accelerate the growth of the firm."

We'll continue to do that. Where we don't, we will look to return capital back in the form of share repurchase, with the dividend obviously being a reflection, as I commented earlier, of greater confidence and a more durable set of revenues and that net dividend increase to reflect it. 
On the achievement of the 13% to 13.5%, I would say that the lever is honestly less about share repurchase and more about what we're doing to alter the capital consumptive density of the firm. So key among those initiatives sits in asset management, where the pivot from on-balance sheet to third-party fund is as much about creating a durable, more predictable revenue stream as it is lowering the capital density of that business, and therefore of the firm. And to the extent that happens, we will be doing ourselves the favor of reducing capital intensity. But my expectation is that the Fed will recognize it equally and subsequent CCAR exams will reflect it as lowering of the requirement that we ultimately will have. And it's on top of that, that we'll maintain what I view, we view, as an offensive buffer to deploy capital for clients. So less about share repurchase, more about fundamental shifts in change that we're bringing to the business, both to help ourselves and frankly speaking, to enable the Fed to come to a realization of the lower capital consumption profile of the business."

I think we have a very, very constructive environment, Gerard, given that the world is dominated by the pandemic and dominated by the actions that central banks and governments are taking to respond to the pandemic. The weightiness of that, the rest of that really overshadows most else that's going on. 
I do think over time, we'll be having discussions about the increase in government debt and government spending around the world. There will be consequence to that. That can obviously have an impact over time. There's a general view at the moment that rates are going to be low for very, very long. Certainly, given some of the actions that are taken, you could see a scenario where the perspective on that would change and could change quickly. And that would certainly create headwinds to growth and headwinds to activity.

I mean there's no question that given the number of SPACs that have been raised, the incentives that are set certainly lead to all those sponsors to look for deals actively. Given our position in the M&A market, that should be a tailwind.
That said, just to quantify it, when you look at our M&A activity, that M&A activity for us with SPACs last quarter, I think it was a single-digit percentage of the M&A activity that we participated in. So while it's a tailwind, I wouldn't say that that's dominating the M&A activity and the positive constructive comments we made around M&A. In fact, that's really rooted in much more broad strategic activity that we've seen a big pickup in over the course of the last 6 to 9 months.
With respect to underwriting activity, there's no question that it has slowed from the peak of where it was. I think there's a little indigestion in the context of that. You've obviously seen returns and some of the shells kind of slowed at this point.  I'd also highlight just again kind of backlog, that when you look at ECM revenue last quarter, SPACs were less than 15% of our ECM revenue last quarter. 
So this all creates a tailwind. But my guess is in this quarter, you'll see less new issuance than what we saw in the first quarter. And you'll see a continued progress that people try to find M&A targets to destack. All of that should be constructive for our business."

Before I begin my remarks, let me thank Heather for leading the firm's Investor Relations effort for the past 4 years, and welcome Carey to the role.  
I will begin on Page 1 of the presentation with a summary of our financial results. In the first quarter, we produced record net revenues of $17.7 billion. The strength and breadth of our client franchise continued to be evident as we delivered net earnings of $6.8 billion, record quarterly earnings per share of $18.60, and a return on equity of 31% and a return on tangible equity of 32.9%, the highest in over a decade. Our first quarter results underscore the ongoing strength of our franchise in the supportive environment which we operated during the quarter. These results also evidence our successful execution towards the firm's strategic priorities. We maintained our leading global positions across M&A and equity underwriting. We delivered the best performance in global markets in a decade, with strength in FICC and equities driven by solid client activity across our platform and reinforced by last year's market share gains.  
In asset management, we recognized significant net gains across our public and private equity positions, And we continued to harvest on-balance sheet investments in our efforts to transition the business to more third-party assets, where we are making progress in raising funds across a range of investing strategies. In wealth management, we continue to provide valuable advice to our ultra-high net worth PWM clients, while we further scale our personal financial management business. And in consumer, we continue to make strong progress on our vision to create the leading digital consumer banking platform. This quarter, we launched Marcus Invest in the U.S., our digital investment offering, which provides consumers access to diversified investment portfolios with as little as a $1,000 investment. The customer response and uptake since launch has been positive, and we are focused on scaling the platform. We're also working toward the launch of digital checking in the U.S. and Marcus Invest in the U.K.  
Importantly, we maintained a resilient and highly liquid balance sheet as we continue to deploy our resources to support clients amid an evolving and dynamic market backdrop. 
With that, let me turn now to the operating environment on Page 2. As anticipated, we saw improvement in the macroeconomic backdrop during the first quarter, which was supported by the continued accommodative fiscal and monetary policies of central banks and governments around the world. At this stage, it is clear to me that the U.S. is poised for a strong recovery this year, led by consumer spending that is rebounding to pre-COVID levels. This sentiment is reflected in the capital markets, with U.S. equities hovering at or near records and bolstered by recent U.S. employment data and our economist forecast on GDP growth.  
Despite these positive developments, we recognize that the operating backdrop will undoubtedly evolve and that much of the global economic recovery will depend on the progress around COVID-19. While the rollout of vaccines is well underway in the U.S. and the U.K., distribution has been challenged in a number of other countries around the globe, and the prospect of new variants adds to potential concerns around the trajectory of the economic recovery.  
As you would expect, we remain vigilant to risks across markets. We are mindful of elevated valuation levels across certain asset classes, increased volatility in certain single-name stocks, and are aware of the inflationary risks inherent in the actions being taken to stimulate continued growth in the economy. 
Let me now also take a moment to share my views on a few important topics where I've been fielding questions from clients and other stakeholders. First, on the events related to Archegos Capital. This was a case of an investor with highly concentrated and leveraged positions. This is not the first time we've seen a situation like this, and it likely won't be the last. We have robust risk management that governs the amount of financing we provide for these types of portfolios. Our risk controls, all of which were put in place long before the March events worked well. We identified the risk early and took prompt action consistent with the terms of our contract with the client. I am pleased with how the firm handled it, and it's a reflection of the engagement and communication of teams across Goldman Sachs, both in the business and on the control side of our firm.  
These events raised reasonable questions around market practice and transparency. They are worthy of debate, and we intend to play a constructive role in that dialogue. 
Next on SPACs, we continue to believe that providing sponsors a mechanism to access public markets for capital formation is an innovation that's here to stay. However, as a meaningful participant in this market, we will continue to be thoughtful regarding the transactions we underwrite with a particular focus on the quality of sponsors, sponsor economics, investor protections and disclosure. We believe the industry should evolve on these important issues in the interest of more efficient and transparent markets.  
I also want to touch on the topics of cryptocurrency, blockchain and the digitization of money. As activities in these areas progress, there will be significant disruption and change in the way money moves around the world. Many central banks are looking at digital currencies and working to apply this technology to the local markets and determine the longer-term impact on global payment systems. There's also significant focus on cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, where the trajectory is less clear as market participants evaluate their possibility as a store of value.  
At Goldman Sachs, we continue to look for ways to expand our capabilities to support our clients' needs and evaluate applications to improve our organizational efficiency. Of course, we need to operate within the current regulatory guidelines. For example, we cannot own bitcoin or trade it as [ principal ]. Goldman Sachs will play a role in these innovations as they are important to our clients and important to the future of global financial systems.  
Another topic coming up in stakeholder conversations is sustainability. We remain steadfast in our commitments to sustainable finance. Central to our purpose as an organization, our programs are commercially attractive and utilize our expertise and capital to support all of our stakeholders. During the quarter, we issued our first sustainability bond where we raised $800 million, the proceeds of which will be allocated towards initiatives aimed at accelerating climate transition and advancing inclusive growth. We also launched One Million Black Women, an initiative that I'm very proud of and through which the firm will commit $10 billion in direct investment capital and $100 million in philanthropic capital for capacity-building grants over the next decade to narrow the opportunity gaps for black women in the United States. Separately, we also committed an additional $500 million to Launch with GS, our program designed to invest in diverse-led companies and fund managers, bringing our total commitments to $1 billion. 
Finally, I want to take a few minutes to comment on our people. I continue to hear from clients that the quality and dedication of our people is one of our great differentiators. The firm's quarterly results are product of our client focus and the dedication of the employees of Goldman Sachs day in and day out, notwithstanding the challenges that they have all faced as we mark 1 year into the COVID-19 pandemic, our people have rallied to the needs of our clients. I would like to thank my colleagues around the world. I am in awe of their performance and of our results this quarter due to their hard work, dedication and our culture of teamwork.  
It will always be a priority for our firm to attract and retain the best talent to serve our clients and execute on our strategy. We have a vibrant partnership and a deep bench of talent across the organization. Many will spend their entire career with us. Some will even become clients of the firm. This is a virtuous ecosystem that has been in place for decades. It is also aligned with the evolution of our partnership strategy, where we're working to continue to make the partnership more aspirational.  
I recognize there's an enormous amount of discussion about how companies will operate their businesses post-pandemic. For Goldman Sachs, our people operate at their best when they are forging close bonds with colleagues and furthering the apprenticeship culture that has defined us. We have found that the best way to do that is to work together in person on a regular basis.  
Let me be clear, achieving the objective of bringing our colleagues back to the office is not inconsistent with the desire to provide our people with the flexibility they need to manage their personal and professional lives, which is the way we have always run this firm. And given the experience of the past year, I am more confident than ever in our ability to facilitate this approach going forward.  
Over the course of the past few months, we have been welcoming thousands of colleagues back to the office in a manner consistent with safety guidelines in each city in which we operate. We have implemented testing and other protocols across our offices to make for a safer work environment and to provide those returning to the office with a sense of confidence in their return. Importantly, I look forward to increasing the number of employees returning as vaccination programs around the world expand, and we welcome new joiners to the firm's offices this summer.  
Regarding our junior bankers and others in the organization who have been working tirelessly to support our clients and at times have been overburdened, I've been passionate about the experience of our junior people throughout my career. As you can now see from our results, client activity is extraordinarily high, and I fully appreciate how busy our people have been. This has been exacerbated by the isolation of working remotely in a COVID-19 environment. To address this, we are taking concrete actions, including additional hiring, reallocating resources, and pursuing stricter enforcements of boundaries. In this 24/7 connected world, we have to help those transitioning into the workforce to understand that Goldman Sachs is a place where we work very hard to serve our clients, but all need to be thoughtful about personal resilience and well-being. 
In closing, I'm very pleased with how our people delivered for our clients and drove attractive returns for our shareholders. I'm confident in the state of our client franchise and the progress we are making as we execute our strategic priorities. 
With that, I will turn it over to Stephen."

And good morning. Let me begin with our summary results on Page 3. During the first quarter, the firm's performance reflected meaningful strength across all 4 of our business segments. In investment banking, clients remained very active",2407,"Thank you, David. And good morning. Let me begin with our summary results on Page 3. During the first quarter, the firm's performance reflected meaningful strength across all 4 of our business segments. In investment banking, clients remained very active in raising capital, particularly in the equity markets. And we witnessed high levels of M&A activity amid elevated strategic dialogues. In global markets, we saw strength across all products and regions as client engagement remained high. In asset management, record performance was attributable to gains from our equity investments, particularly as we harvested private equity positions in an attractive market. We also saw double-digit revenue growth year-over-year in our consumer and wealth management segment for a third consecutive quarter as we further expand our wealth capabilities and scale our consumer offering. 
Turning to specific business performance on Page 4, let me begin with investment banking. Investment banking produced record quarterly net revenues of $3.8 billion, up 73% versus a year ago. Financial advisory revenues of $1.1 billion rose 43% versus last year on increased transaction closings in the quarter. During the quarter, we maintained our #1 league table position as we participated in over $400 billion of announced transactions, over $100 billion ahead of our next closest competitor, and closed over 100 deals for approximately $300 billion of deal volume.  
The bigger headline in investment banking again this quarter was equity underwriting, where we generated a record $1.6 billion in revenues, over 4x greater than the levels a year ago. We ranked #1 globally in equity underwriting, with our volumes climbing to nearly $50 billion across roughly 240 deals, including over 90 initial public offerings for companies across all markets like Coupang in Korea, InPost in Poland and Bumble in the U.S. Our equity underwriting market share increased more than 60 basis points during the quarter, largely driven by improved share in IPOs. We experienced strong activity this quarter in follow-ons and new products, including our participation in a growing number of SPAC transactions.  
In debt underwriting, net revenues were $880 million, up 51% from a year ago, driven by strong activity levels particularly in leveraged finance, and asset-backed transactions. In addition, our engagement with sectors impacted by COVID, including airlines and hospitality, was high.  
Notwithstanding the significant realization of revenue in the quarter, our investment banking backlog ended the quarter at record levels, with sequential growth supported by sustained M&A activity as well as replenishment from underwriting transactions.  
Revenues from corporate lending were $205 million, down 54% versus the first quarter of last year, which included significant gains on hedges maintained with respect to our relationship loan book. Revenues in the quarter reflect net interest income, including from transaction banking and fees from relationship lending, partially offset by approximately $85 million of losses on hedges as spreads tightened modestly. 
Moving to global markets on Page 5. Our franchise exhibited broad-based strength across businesses in both FICC and equities. Net revenues were $7.6 billion in the first quarter, up 47% versus a year ago and the highest since 2010. During the quarter, we benefited from a supportive market-making environment and facilitated considerable client activity. 
Turning to FICC on Page 6. First quarter net revenues were $3.9 billion, up 31% versus a year ago, driven by a 36% increase in intermediation where we experienced healthy client flows and demonstrated strong risk management and grew revenues in 4 out of 5 businesses versus last year. In mortgages, revenues rose significantly, bolstered by solid results in agency mortgages and residential loans and high levels of client engagement as the business continues to diversify its revenue across market-making, loan origination and financing.  
In commodities, higher year-on-year performance was driven by solid inventory management across products amid volatile markets and healthy client flows. In rates, revenues rose amidst strong risk management and client engagement, particularly on the back of anticipated fiscal activity in the U.S. and diverging central bank actions during the quarter. In credit, revenues were up versus a year ago as the business benefited from continued improvement in credit spreads, while client activity remained healthy amid robust primary issuance. We also saw increase in volumes related to our automated bond pricing engine and growing activity in electronic trading. In currencies, revenues fell due to lower activity versus a strong quarter a year ago, though client engagement remained high across both the G10 and emerging markets franchises. 
Turning to equities. Net revenues for the first quarter were $3.7 billion, up 68% versus a year ago as we deployed our balance sheet to support clients and intermediated risk with discipline. Equities intermediation produced net revenues of $2.6 billion, up 69%, reflecting the global scale and breadth of our client franchise and aided by elevated client volumes across cash and derivatives as well as strong risk management.  
In cash, we facilitated client flows across high- and low-touch channels and executed a number of block trades for clients during the quarter. In derivatives, we produced record results as we saw solid activity in flow and structured transactions across both the U.S. and Europe.  
Equities financing revenues of $1.1 billion were the best in over a decade, rising 65% year-over-year. Average balances in our prime business grew to record levels as we supported clients amid the volatility and market events of the first quarter. As we continue to grow our prime business, we are well aware of the risks inherent in that business and the resources, including liquidity that are consumed. While we avoided losses related to recent events involving Archegos Capital, as David noted, the situation underscored the potential risks of the business and the corresponding importance of our risk infrastructure and control systems.  
As to forward expectations for global markets, it remains difficult to predict client activity. While we do not expect the pace of activity in the first quarter to necessarily persist for the balance of the year, we believe the high levels of primary issuance, the current trajectory of economic recovery and diverging central bank policies, particularly in emerging markets, could continue to support elevated client activity. Our confidence on the forward of global markets rests largely on the market share gains generated last year through a deepening of client relationships and our ongoing investment in technology platforms to enhance client experience and drive efficiencies. As we have noted previously, this progress has improved the structural return profile of the business independent of the wallet opportunity. 
Moving now to asset management on Page 7. In the first quarter, we generated record revenues of $4.6 billion. Management and other fees totaled $693 million, up 8% versus a year ago, driven by higher average assets under supervision, partially offset by fee waivers on money market funds. Incentive fees of $42 million were lower versus a strong year-ago quarter.  
Equity investments produced $3.1 billion of net gains, including appreciation across our public investments and marks related to event-driven activity in our private equity portfolio, such as sales or capital raises. More specifically, on our $3 billion public equity portfolio, we had gains of roughly $340 million. This quarter, we disposed of over $1.5 billion of positions given attractive market conditions. Despite the quantum of public positions sold in the quarter, the more moderate decline in the size of our portfolio reflects the impacts of IPOs in our private portfolio and market appreciation. Across our $17 billion private equity book we generated gains of nearly $2.6 billion from various positions, more than 2/3 of which were driven by events relating to the underlying portfolio of companies, including fundraisings, capital market activities and outright sales. Additionally, we had operating revenues of $225 million related to our portfolio of consolidated investment entities.  
We announced or closed on dispositions of private assets of $1.5 billion in the quarter, bringing the total private sales since our 2020 Investor Day to $4.7 billion. There is an implied $2.3 billion of capital associated with those assets. Additionally, we have line of sight on nearly $3 billion of incremental asset sales.  
Despite these actions and as I mentioned on our January earnings call, we increased the equity attributed to asset management as a result of our 2020 CCAR stress test. This change was driven by our dynamic capital attribution methodology, which takes various regulatory constraints into consideration. On the forward, a continued reduction in balance sheet positions will produce a more meaningful impact on attributed equity reduction. Importantly, we remain on track to achieve our net reduction in segment capital, consistent with what we presented at our 2020 Investor Day, to below $18 billion by 2024.  
The ongoing harvesting of our investment portfolio is consistent with our strategy of migrating our business to third party versus on-balance sheet investing, and attractive market valuations have accelerated some sales. We are keen to continue such activity as it would be capital accretive to the firm. 
That said, dispositions at attractive levels now will diminish gains from sales in forward quarters. We are mindful of that trade-off and are working to offset the revenue impact in subsequent years as we look to realize increasing fee income from the number of alternative funds being formed and invested. 
Finally, in asset management, net revenues from lending and debt investment activities were $759 million on revenues from NII and gains on fair value debt securities and loans. This reflected modestly tighter credit spreads on our portfolio of corporate and real estate investments. 
Let me now turn to Page 8, where we show the composition of our asset management balance sheet, consistent with the information that we have provided to you in prior quarters. Our equity and CIE portfolios remain highly diversified by sector, geography and vintage. And our debt investment portfolio is also diversified, with loans in the segment largely secured. 
Moving to Page 9. Consumer and wealth management produced $1.7 billion of revenues in the first quarter, up 16% versus a year ago. Management and other fees of $1.1 billion rose 12% versus last year, reflecting higher assets under supervision, which rose 25% to $637 billion. Consumer banking revenues grew to $371 million in the first quarter, up 32% versus last year, reflecting higher credit card loans and deposit growth. 
Next, let's turn to Page 10 for our firm-wide assets under supervision and firm-wide management and other fees. Total AUS increased to a record $2.2 trillion during the quarter, up over $380 billion versus a year ago. The sequential increase of $59 billion was driven by $37 billion of long-term inflows and $23 billion of liquidity inflows. Our total firm-wide management and other fees grew by 11% versus the first quarter of 2020 to $1.8 billion. 
On Page 11, we address net interest income and our lending portfolio across all segments. Total firm-wide NII was $1.5 billion for the first quarter, higher versus a year ago, reflecting an increase in interest-earning assets and lower funding costs. 
Next, let's review loan growth and credit performance across the firm. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $121 billion, up $5 billion sequentially, driven by residential real estate warehouse and wealth management lending. In the first quarter, provision for credit losses reflected a net benefit of $70 million. This includes a reserve reduction driven by improvements in the broader economic backdrop and loss expectations, partially offset by portfolio growth, including approximately $180 million in provisions related to the pending acquisition of loan receivables as part of our credit card partnership with General Motors expected to launch by year-end. 
Next, let's turn to expenses on Page 12. Our total quarterly operating expenses were $9.4 billion. While our ratio of compensation to revenues net of provisions fell to 34% from 41% in the first quarter of last year, compensation expense increased, reflecting strong performance. Non-compensation expenses were up only 5% versus last year as an increase in transaction-based and technology expenses was largely offset by a decline in litigation and travel and entertainment expenses as well as lower expenses related to our consolidated investment entities.  
Overall, our efficiency ratio for the quarter was 53.3%, reflecting the operating leverage in our business. We remain focused on our expense discipline in a pay-for-performance culture as well as our expense initiatives, where we continue to evaluate additional opportunities for further savings.  
Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 18%, primarily reflecting the impact of equity-based compensation of approximately $175 million. As noted previously, we expect our tax rate under the current tax regime to be approximately 21%. I should note that we continue to monitor the impact of various proposals being made in the U.S. on the federal and state level. 
Turning to our capital levels on Slide 13. Our common equity tier 1 ratio was 14.3% at the end of the first quarter under the standardized approach, down 40 basis points sequentially. The decline was driven by increased lending and higher market RWAs as we stepped in to serve clients, partially offset by strong earnings.  
In the quarter, we returned a total of $3.15 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $2.7 billion and approximately $450 million in common stock dividends. Our book value per share rose to a record $250.81. While the Federal Reserve has extended the limitations in place on share repurchases and dividend increases, we nonetheless expect to continue our repurchase plans in the second quarter close to the levels of the first quarter. And we'll evaluate an increase to the dividend as permitted. 
Turning to the balance sheet. Total assets ended the quarter at $1.3 trillion, 12% higher versus last quarter as we supported client activity. We maintained high liquidity levels, with our global core liquid assets averaging nearly $300 billion.  
On the liabilities side, our total deposits rose to $286 billion, up $26 billion versus last quarter. Notably, consumer deposits surpassed $100 billion during the quarter.  
Our long-term debt rose by $6 billion, driven by $20 billion of benchmark issuance. Given the growth in our balance sheet outside of bank entities, particularly due to accretive deployment opportunities in our prime business, we now expect benchmark issuances to be modestly higher than maturities and redemptions this year.  
In conclusion, our first quarter results reflect the diversification and strength of our client franchise. We remain confident that execution of our strategic priorities will continue to drive a better client experience, more durable revenues, and strong returns for shareholders. With that, we'll now open up the line for questions."

Thanks for the question. So let me just go through the numbers, so we're all level set.  In the quarter, we closed on about $1.5 billion of balance sheet reduction, producing about $852 million of AE relief. And as I noted in the prepared r",369,"Sure, Glenn. Thanks for the question. So let me just go through the numbers, so we're all level set.  
In the quarter, we closed on about $1.5 billion of balance sheet reduction, producing about $852 million of AE relief. And as I noted in the prepared remarks, since our Investor Day, we've disposed of balance sheet positions totaling $4.7 billion. That produced about $2.3 billion of relief as well. 
In terms of line of sight, as I said, we have a view into about $3 billion of balance sheet reduction. My view is that the capital attachment associated with that $3 billion would be I would say well in excess of about $1 billion, probably close to $1.4 billion in terms of AE relief there.  
As to the profile vintage and otherwise, I think it's important to recognize that in pursuing the strategy of migrating to more third-party funds, we're going to look across the portfolio regardless of vintage of opportunities, particularly in this market, to advance. It's not only in the pursuit of course of that strategy, but equally it reduces the capital density of that business and holds the promise of reduced capital that the firm would be required to hold overall.  
And so 2 components in the context of what we're trying to achieve strategically: if you look at what we've done just on the last part of your question in terms of fundraising, you'll remember that through 2020, we noted that we had raised funds approximating $40 billion. Taking that and extending it through the first quarter, we're up just north of about $52 billion and are looking to deploy that now where obviously management fees get paid on deployment and investment of that fundraising. And so the roster of ambition of what we're going to do this year is quite real. We're confident in our ability to achieve it. And this is all obviously part and parcel of meeting what I was talking about, which is as we see the harvest of positions now and take that revenue in we will see compensation for that, if you will, in the context of management fees as we grow and deploy capital in the alternative space."

And so that's really the sort of best picture forward, if you will, in terms of what our clients are engaged in doing.  
I think on the forward as it relates, for example, to global markets, there it's difficult to say, as I noted in the comment and David did as well, it's hard to know what the market opportunity will be. The comparative set of results, second and third quarter last year versus this will be challenging, just given the volatility we saw last year in those quarters.  
I think the confidence we're taking in terms of sustainability of results lies in our market share. And we have picked up market share across global markets, across investment banking both in financial advisory and equity capital markets. And we will rely on that to capture kind of our fair share or better of the opportunity set presented."

First, I'll start at a high level, and then Stephen will probably give you some more granular data.  
But at a high level, one of the things we've been very focused on over the last 2.5 years is the client centricity of our business and trying to really look at the way clients experience us, look at it holistically, see how we're serving their needs holistically. You've heard us talk about our One GS mantra, our ability to bring the whole organization together to deliver better for clients.  
And one of the things that I'm hearing consistently from clients as I reach out and spend time with clients, is that they feel like there's been a meaningful change in the kind of broad client service they're getting, our focus on them, the resources we're getting, giving -- or bringing to them the coordination of all that. And I think that has contributed meaningfully, that client centricity, that culture is contributing meaningfully to market share gains.  
You know and we've put it forward that we talked about looking at the top 100 accounts in global markets. We gave you data last quarter on our progress against those accounts, being top 3 against those accounts. That is a KPI we continue to track. We made progress last year, and we're committed to making further progress this year. And so I think that also has an impact on this. 
In addition then obviously, you have the market activity that's generated. And so we get the benefit of those market shares gains against that activity.  
On your second question, with respect to kind of activity looking forward, what I'd say was the first quarter was an extraordinary quarter. I don't think that the expectation should be that activity will continue at that pace through the second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter. But I will say that activity levels continue to be elevated from what I would say was a pre-COVID activity level by a meaningful amount. And I think as we said in the script that the environment, the monetary and fiscal stimulus, and in addition the economic recovery, continues to paint a relatively constructive background. But I don't think the expectation should be for it to continue at the pace we saw in the first quarter."

First of all, across the equities business in global markets, I think we're seeing a very clear consolidation of share in and among a discrete number of banks in the U.S., among which we are one. We saw elevated prime levels, part of the strategy that we've been pursuing, and as I noted in my comments, record prime levels that contributed to meaningful uptick in equity financing.  
Even on the last call, I had noted that over the course of 2020 across global markets, we had picked up about 120 basis points of wallet share across the patch. And then when you look at -- I'll just take 2 individual businesses in FICC, just to pivot to FICC for a moment. First of all if you look at mortgages, the interesting thing about mortgages is that this business is now sort of pivoted away from sort of straight market-making and is now it's self-engaged in financing and loan origination. And so doing more for more clients has been kind of the signature, if you will, of just expanding in the mortgage space that has grown that business.  
And then if you look at credit, we have picked up meaningful market share, both in cash and loans, in the context of what we're doing. And then the last thing I would say, which I think is a contributor to enhanced share, client engagement and the like has been what we've done in the development of platforms. And credit is a good example of that, where portfolio trading has grown quite considerably. Our place in it is quite high. And so again it's all, as David is saying, client centricity and engagement with clients and meeting clients where they care to execute platforms being a good example."

First of all in noncomp expense more broadly, there should be no doubt that we have a very keen focus on controlling our expense base. I'm saying that independent of the efficiencies that we laid out at Investor Day which I'll come on to. But as reported, noncomp expense was up 5%; x litigation, up 9%. And within that, literally the totality of the increase in expenses were related to transaction-based expenses, so BC&E relating to elevated levels in global markets and our technology spend. And so I think on the forward, you should expect that where transaction activity is high, where we're meeting our clients, where market opportunity is large, that variable expense will continue to fluctuate consistent with the market and will carry us there.
The second piece I'll comment on is just the $1.3 billion of expense initiative. Again, independent of the day-to-day focus on non-comp expense. And there we continue to make progress in all of the areas that we had talked about, including our real estate footprint as we just announced that we're opening up offices in Birmingham. We did that as it relates to Hyderabad. All of that is a component piece of what we're trying to achieve in the $1.3 billion of expenses. 
The last piece I'd say is the operating leverage that exists with compensation. As we've said many, many times, we pay for performance. And so that lever is always available to us as and to the extent we see revenue turn down relative to the kind of performance we've otherwise seen in this quarter."

So first on SLR, just to be clear, that has not been and is not a binding constraint on us, just to be clear about it. Obviously, 5% at the holdco, 6% at the bank, we stand higher than both of the minimums and don't find that to be a binding constra",329,"Sure. So first on SLR, just to be clear, that has not been and is not a binding constraint on us, just to be clear about it. Obviously, 5% at the holdco, 6% at the bank, we stand higher than both of the minimums and don't find that to be a binding constraint to us. And so I would say that at both levels, we have ample growth capacity in terms of balance sheet growth before that comes on to the horizon as being an issue for us. So SLR, not the issue that it is for some of the other commercial banks.
In terms of RWA growth, I think that you'll see that commensurate with the nature and level of activity that's there. The one thing I do want to point out is that risk control and risk calibration remains unchanged. It is as disciplined as you would expect it to be, notwithstanding RWA growth. So the opportunity set that's been presented causes us to extend balance sheet and grow risk-weighted assets commensurate with that opportunity, but without compromise to the kind of risk levels that we find. 
I mean the thing I would say, Steve, on this is that if you look at growth in the firm and you look at growth in balance sheet, in the service of our clients as David's been talking about, the resource input to this has been maintained so as to protect the risk flank of the firm. We're sitting with elevated levels of liquidity at GCLA north of $300 billion. We sit in an ample capital position, obviously elevated by where the minimums sit, but within -- in an offensive mode and a buffer prepared to deal and engage with our clients. Marry those 2 resource sort of points alongside risk controls that David spoke about, and we feel quite comfortable with the RWA growth we're experiencing and keeping it in control and checked from a risk point of view."

I know this has been asked a number of different ways on recent calls. But just given the sheer pace of share gains; and David, some remarks you actually made at a conference this quarter noting that industry fee pool should normalize above 2019 levels, it does feel to us like those 2 factors alone should support more than $3 billion in higher run rate IB and trading revenues, which actually compares to a target for incumbent business growth of just 2 billion to 3 billion. 
So clearly some of the targets that you outlined at Investor Day on the revenue side do appear quite conservative, just given the sheer level of progress. I was hoping you could speak to your confidence around the ability to drive better growth in the incumbent businesses relative to those targets, and maybe if you feel like that north of $3 billion in higher run rate IB and trading is a reasonable expectation, given the underlying trends that you're seeing as well as the improved and deepened client penetration?"

There's no question that there is meaningful consumer pent-up demand. Consumers have reasonable liquidity and savings higher than they did going into the pandemic. And we expect that all of that economic activity and that pickup in economic activity is a constructive backdrop for our business. 
There's no question, given the monetary and fiscal actions, that there's an increasing risk of inflationary activity. We all are watching very carefully comments from central banks around the world as we look forward. I think in my opinion, there's no question that we will see an increase in inflation. The question is how much, how quickly, and how we respond to that. 
And I think it's early, it's very early to speculate. But there is a scenario in the distribution where it would accelerate more quickly, and actions would have to be taken that would create more headwinds for our business. I don't see that as obvious on the near-term horizon as we look through this year and we continue to come out of the pandemic.

To my memory, I wouldn't view it as a multiple to prior peak. I would call it as probably 10% higher than where the top of that number had been historically."

So I don't want to peg the exact sort of aspiration of where we'll be, and our ambition is to take the dividend up when the rules permit. But I would say that our ambition is to put the dividend in a more competitive standing than perhaps where it has sat historically. 
By the way, we've already been on that path, having raised the dividend quite considerably since David and John and I all took our seats. And so to my memory, we took it up about 47% or thereabout at the beginning of our tenure, and higher since. 
I think that the ambition here is to have the dividend grow commensurate with an increasing durability of revenues in the business. As the more durable businesses or revenue streams and businesses grow, the dividend ought to reflect that, and it will. And so that's probably the best sort of forward view on dividend thinking that I can provide."

First of all in the middle market, that continues to grow. And the revenue that we've taken in, in investment banking around the growth in the client set has been quite substantial, and frankly I think beyond that which we otherwise thought we would achieve at the Investor Day. 
On the corporate side, you can see it play out in the context of investment banking revenues broadly. I would say equally we're playing to a larger corporate set in our global market segment in terms of those becoming more prolific clients in what we do. 
And then on the geography, as I mentioned before, we have seen kind of double-digit growth in backlog in EMEA and in Asia. And we continue to see growth in the Americas as well. But again, the Americas presents a much larger set more broadly. 
I'd also refer you back to a comment David made and we've spoken about before, which is our ambition and our focus around client centricity in global markets. It's always been there as it relates to investment banking, has put us in among the top 3 among 64 of the most prolific clients, top 100 clients in global markets, and that's up from 51 the year before. And so we continue to see growth in the share we're taking. By the way, this is all against the backdrop of consolidation in share, I would say, among U.S. banks relative to the European competitors across a range of product areas in equities and in FICC."

And as we grow that, and this is what David was referring to, we continue to maintain quite a vigilant posture as it relates to risk that's embedded in it. We recognize risk of concentration. We recognize the consumptive nature of that business. And so we're going to maintain kind of our threshold of risk tolerance in terms of clients that we bring on.

That is, taking note of the demands among our clients around middle and back office and the overall experience of our clients set not just on the front end of the trade, but all through to the back. Each of those investments, whether it's technology to build platforms that captures portfolio trading credit, or development of enhanced technology to automate and streamline the overall straight-through processing, all of that is subject to an ROI framework with an eye toward improving the overall client and user experience that's there.

But let me answer the question this way, and let me use transaction banking as being a really good example, okay? 
Transaction banking is a new platform designed from the front end all the way through to the back, into the books and records of the firm. It is cloud-based engineering, which has all the efficiencies that I'm sure you're aware of in terms of a lower expense to sort of keep it current in terms of developments around engineering and the like. 
And so our new builds are largely, perhaps not exclusively, but largely cloud-based. We're always looking to rationalize platforms. And I would say one thing I've learned from Marco, Atte and George in engineering is that it's as important to decommission old platforms as it is to put new ones in. We're riveted and focused on doing that so as to eliminate legacy technology, build in the cloud. And I think some of the newer businesses that we're involved in, transaction banking consumer, benefit from the absence of legacy, so that we can build new and efficiently and in the right form."

Have you considered making some adjustments in the disclosures, which would help investors and analysts to model some of those recurring revenues and show them as more mechanical, so to speak?

We don't know what the direct balances are tied to that. We don't know credit metrics that would allow for some sort of more mechanical calculations and I think might assist in the appreciation of how much of your revenue base is actually recurring amongst the analysts and investor community.

We'd like to find ourselves in a place where we will and can provide greater disclosure on consumer, just as an example. 
I would say the same will be true as transaction banking becomes more durable. These are areas where as they become more material, and we expect that they will, disclosure will naturally follow.

Really in all businesses everywhere, we continue to see consolidation of those in a strong -- with consolidation by those that are in a strong position. Because all businesses continue in the digital world we're in with further digitization require more tech investment, more scale, more global. And so in that context, obviously leaders are continuing to consolidate their strong positions.
With respect to our space broadly and how we think about this, I'm going to repeat verbatim what I said last quarter. And what I've said before, we spend a lot of time looking at opportunities to accelerate the growth of our franchise. In particular as we look at businesses like asset management and wealth, if we could find something that we felt would accelerate our strategic growth objectives, we would certainly consider it. But the bar for anything significant is high. And it has to be the right industrial logic more than the fact that we have a currency because the stock is higher. 
And so we continue to think about ways that we could accelerate our growth, but the bar to do it is high. Prices are high. It's a competitive environment. And we feel good about our plan, but we'll continue to do the work and be diligent about looking for opportunities where we can accelerate the growth of the firm."

We'll continue to do that. Where we don't, we will look to return capital back in the form of share repurchase, with the dividend obviously being a reflection, as I commented earlier, of greater confidence and a more durable set of revenues and that net dividend increase to reflect it. 
On the achievement of the 13% to 13.5%, I would say that the lever is honestly less about share repurchase and more about what we're doing to alter the capital consumptive density of the firm. So key among those initiatives sits in asset management, where the pivot from on-balance sheet to third-party fund is as much about creating a durable, more predictable revenue stream as it is lowering the capital density of that business, and therefore of the firm. And to the extent that happens, we will be doing ourselves the favor of reducing capital intensity. But my expectation is that the Fed will recognize it equally and subsequent CCAR exams will reflect it as lowering of the requirement that we ultimately will have. And it's on top of that, that we'll maintain what I view, we view, as an offensive buffer to deploy capital for clients. So less about share repurchase, more about fundamental shifts in change that we're bringing to the business, both to help ourselves and frankly speaking, to enable the Fed to come to a realization of the lower capital consumption profile of the business."

What are some of risks that you keep your eyes on that could kind of set the outlook back, maybe not as robust as it appears to be for you and some of your peers today?"

And things tend to pop up in places that you don't see or you don't expect. 
I think we have a very, very constructive environment, Gerard, given that the world is dominated by the pandemic and dominated by the actions that central banks and governments are taking to respond to the pandemic. The weightiness of that, the heft of that really overshadows most else that's going on. 
I do think over time, we'll be having discussions about the increase in government debt and government spending around the world. There will be consequence to that. That can obviously have an impact over time. There's a general view at the moment that rates are going to be low for very, very long. Certainly, given some of the actions that are taken, you could see a scenario where the perspective on that would change and could change quickly. And that would certainly create headwinds to growth and headwinds to activity. 
But I do think we have a very very good backdrop at the moment with a higher probability or distribution of strong economic growth, because we had such a sharp reaction to the other side given the pandemic. And the unwind of that, I think will dominate as we move through the rest of the year into next year."

I mean there's no question that given the number of SPACs that have been raised, the incentives that are set certainly lead to all those sponsors to look for deals actively. Given our position in the M&A market, that should be a tailwind.
That said, just to quantify it, when you look at our M&A activity, that M&A activity for us with SPACs last quarter, I think it was a single-digit percentage of the M&A activity that we participated in. So while it's a tailwind, I wouldn't say that that's dominating the M&A activity and the positive constructive comments we made around M&A. In fact, that's really rooted in much more broad strategic activity that we've seen a big pickup in over the course of the last 6 to 9 months.
With respect to underwriting activity, there's no question that it has slowed from the peak of where it was. I think there's a little indigestion in the context of that. You've obviously seen returns and some of the [ shells ] kind of slowed at this point. I'd also highlight just again kind of backlog, that when you look at ECM revenue last quarter, SPACs were less than 15% of our ECM revenue last quarter. 
So this all creates a tailwind. But my guess is in this quarter, you'll see less new issuance than what we saw in the first quarter. And you'll see a continued progress that people try to find M&A targets to destack. All of that should be constructive for our business."

I will begin on Page 1 of the presentation with a review of our financial results. 
In the second quarter, we produced net revenues of $15.4 billion, our second highest result on record. The strength, breadth and diversity of our business remained evident this quarter as we delivered net earnings of $5.5 billion and quarterly earnings per share of $15.02. 
Second quarter results contributed to our highest ever first half revenues of $33 billion and net earnings of over $12 billion, which drove year-to-date ROE of 27.3% and ROTE of 28.9%. Our performance underscores the strength of our client franchise and the constructive but more normalized market environment relative to a year ago. Our results also reflect ongoing progress on the firm's strategic priorities across all 4 of our businesses as laid out at our 2020 Investor Day. 
In Investment Banking, we continue to benefit from our leading M&A franchise. Given this position, we observed certain secular changes driving strategic activity as our key clients emerge from the pandemic: the drive for scale, a push to achieve operating efficiency, the shift to a digital economy across a broader industry set. We've maintained the #1 rank and completed M&A for 19 of the last 20 years and have been the leader in equity underwriting for 9 of the last 10 years. We are broadening our transaction banking platform. In June, we launched in the U.K., and we will now focus on expanding into Japan and other geographies. Although we are early in the rollout, initial client feedback has been quite positive. 
We delivered solid results in Global Markets where recent market share gains contributed to our performance. We continue to deploy balance sheet to support client activity, and we are further expanding our means of engagement with our clients across both traditional and digital platforms. A good example is our Marquee platform where we are collaborating with MSCI to deliver improved portfolio analytics for our institutional clients versus via APIs. 
In Asset Management, our assets under supervision hit another record of $1.6 trillion as we serve clients by delivering best-in-class investment opportunities across a growing spectrum of traditional and alternative asset classes. We also continue to transition the business to more third-party funds where we have raised $74 billion in gross commitments across the range of alternative investment strategies since our 2020 Investor Day. 
Additionally, during the quarter, we received preliminary approval for a joint venture with ICBC, China's largest bank. The JV will combine our expertise in Asset Management with ICBC's extensive access to retail and institutional clients. The partnership is a testament to our long-standing relationship with ICBC and represents a significant opportunity for us to grow internationally. 
In Consumer & Wealth Management, we are seeing solid inflows in PWM and from new and existing clients and ongoing synergies with our Ayco and PFM businesses. We are also advancing on our vision of creating a leading digital consumer banking platform where customer satisfaction with our products and services continues to be very high. 
This quarter, we launched Apple Card family, which allows co-owners on the same account to build credit together as equals. In addition, as we grow markets invest and prepare for the rollout of checking and other services, we are building a more comprehensive consumer banking offering. 
All in, the progress on our strategic priorities, combined with our continued execution, reaffirms my confidence in the strength of our franchise and the increasing durability of our revenues. Reflecting this confidence, our Board of Directors declared a 60% increase in our quarterly dividend to $2 a share. This follows an increase of over 50% in 2019. Taken together, we have increased the dividend by 150% since I took my seat as CEO. While future increases won't necessarily be of this magnitude, we continue to prioritize a robust dividend as a part of our capital management philosophy. 
With that, let me now turn to the operating environment on Page 2. It's clear that we're in the middle of a significant economic rebound. This is particularly true in countries like the U.S. and China, driven by the lifting of health and safety restrictions amid comprehensive vaccination programs. The broader economic improvement has also been underpinned by unprecedented support by central banks and, in the United States, the prospect of further fiscal stimulus in the form of infrastructure spending. 
A quarter ago, I mentioned my concerns about the prospect of the U.S. economy overheating, but recent commentary from the Federal Reserve indicates that the Central Bank is focused on this risk, which supports our economist view that inflationary pressures might be transitory and that any resulting risks could be adequately managed. From here, I remain concerned about the prospect of a pandemic resurgence. The Delta variant, should it spread further, could spear policy actions at slow economic growth. We are already seeing this play out in places like Hong Kong and Australia and potentially in parts of Europe. While vaccine take-up is progressing, it is not consistent across communities and nations, including parts of the United States. Widespread vaccine distribution and high vaccine rates are critical to open and thriving economies. I want to urge policymakers, government officials and business leaders across jurisdictions to do all they can to facilitate these efforts. 
At Goldman Sachs, we are running programs to facilitate faster vaccinations for our people and their families in the United States, Hong Kong and India, among other locations, building on the support we are providing communities in which we operate as we all navigate the challenges of this pandemic. More broadly as risk managers, we closely monitor developments and remain attentive to a variety of potential risks away from the challenges associated with COVID. Right now, the geopolitical landscape, most notably China and cybersecurity, are top of mind. As always, we remain committed to helping our clients navigate these and other risks amid an ever-changing market backdrop. 
As I look ahead, I remain optimistic about the opportunity set for Goldman Sachs. Our Investment Banking backlog is at a record level as strategic discussions with our corporate client base remain high, reflective of elevated CEO confidence and the prospect of continued economic recovery. While consumer confidence may prove more volatile as supplemental benefits expire in the U.S., corporate clients remain steadfast in their efforts to emerge stronger from the pandemic. 
In our markets business, ongoing client engagement and increased market share have strengthened our competitive positioning, notwithstanding more normalized flows and spreads relative to a year ago. And across our investing businesses, the current rate environment and search for yield are driving demand for both institutional and individual investors for our world-class scaled investment platform. 
Before I turn it over to Stephen, I'd like to close with a few final thoughts on the people of Goldman Sachs. We are an incredibly dedicated and resilient team, and I'm so proud of how we've worked tirelessly to serve our clients amid the challenges of the last 18 months. Again and again, I've heard from our clients that they say Goldman Sachs is ahead of the curve and that the engagement from our people has been stronger than ever. 
Speaking of that, as many of you know, we formally welcomed our colleagues in New York, Dallas, Salt Lake City, Hong Kong and other locations to office this summer. With roughly 50% of our people in these offices back on a regular basis, I can tell you that seeing them in our buildings again has been completely invigorating. We recognize that various geographies are navigating different stages of the pandemic, and we'll continue to provide our colleagues with the support they need. Going forward, we look to reopen more locations consistent with health and safety guidelines of each city in which we operate. 
I've heard from so many of our people over the last few weeks that they are glad to be back in the office, and clients appreciate that we are showing up. We have always given our people the flexibility they need to manage their professional and personal lives, and we will continue to do so. That said, I believe bringing us back together, forging the close bonds that support a culture of collaboration has renewed the sense of teamwork and apprenticeship that allows our people and our business to thrive. 
I'm particularly excited to see nearly 5,800 interns and new hires who are joining us this summer, many in person working side-by-side with long-tenured professionals of Goldman Sachs. 
I'll close by saying I'm very pleased with how our people continue to deliver for our clients and our shareholders. I'm especially confident in the strength of our client franchise amid an improving economic backdrop. Importantly, we are making progress in executing our strategy, and I believe we are on a path to sustainable mid-teens returns. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Stephen."

Investment Banking produced its second highest quarterly net revenues of $3.6 billion.

Activity continues to be strong across geographies, particularly in the Americas, with strength across all industry groups, reflecting the breadth of our franchise.

That represents volume market share of 10%, up 40 basis points versus full year 2020. Notably, we led over 160 IPOs for the year-to-date more than all of last year. 
In debt underwriting, net revenues were $950 million with performance supported by strong high-yield volumes and, importantly, robust acquisition financing activity, including LDOs as well as strong M&A and financial sponsor activity. This performance reflects the integrated nature of our financing and advisory businesses as well as our dominant share in financial sponsor activity. Additionally, ESG remained a focus of the market, particularly in Europe, with strong issuance volumes across sustainability-linked bonds and loans. We expect this trend to continue in future quarters. 
Notwithstanding the realization of record revenue in the first half of the year, as David noted, our Investment Banking backlog ended the quarter at a fresh record high with sequential growth supported by sustained M&A activity as well as replenishment from underwriting transactions. Corporate lending results of $159 million reflect revenues from transaction banking and middle market and relationship lending, net of approximately $130 million of losses on hedges in place with respect to the relationship loan book. Transaction banking is performing well. The business is approaching 300 clients, generating roughly $40 billion in deposits, with an increasing percentage becoming operational. 
Moving to Global Markets on Page 5. Segment net revenues were $4.9 billion in the quarter driven by solid client activity and a generally supportive market-making environment. Our franchise continued to exhibit strength across both FICC and Equities, notwithstanding more normalized activity versus a year ago when we experienced significant dislocation and volatility driving elevated client volumes. We remain focused on building upon recent market share gains and have made advances in digital platforms to sustain strong performance in this segment. 
Beginning with FICC on Page 6. Second quarter net revenues were $2.3 billion. In rates, performance was impacted by spread compression amid lower volatility, though activity remains high with a number of macroeconomic cross currents around economic recovery and inflation. In commodities, we saw solid performance across our increasingly diversified business with contributions from oil, natural gas and power, ags and metals, and active risk management in a dynamic market characterized by healthy client flows. In mortgages, strong performance was helped by activity in our residential loan trading business, offset by lower results in agency mortgages. The business continues to diversify its revenue across market-making, loan origination and financing. 
Across both credit and currencies, lower volatility, more muted volumes and spread compression led to more modest performance relative to recent quarters, though market share gains helped offset the effects of a relatively subdued trade environment. 
FICC financing revenues of $423 million were driven by mortgage lending, offset by lower repo performance. 
Moving to Equities. Net revenues for the second quarter were $2.6 billion as we actively deployed our balance sheet to intermediate risk and support client activity. Equities intermediation produced net revenues of $1.8 billion with performance driven by the global scale and breadth of our client franchise in both cash and derivatives. 
In cash, we facilitated client flows across high and low-touch channels. And in derivatives, we saw solid performance in EMEA, following a more orderly market in European dividends relative to a year ago and stronger results in structured products across geographies. Equities financing revenues of $815 million were strong given record average balances in our prime business. Growth in balances were a product of rising equity markets and more significant engagement among existing and new clients. 
While growth in Equities financing remains a strategic priority, we nonetheless maintain a very disciplined focus on risk management, pricing and structural terms of engagement. 
Moving to Asset Management on Page 7. In the second quarter, we generated record revenues of $5.1 billion. Management and other fees totaled $727 million, which rose year-on-year despite approximately $160 million of fee waivers on our money market funds. These waivers carry over from prior quarters and are consistent with industry practice in this rate environment. Incentive fees for the quarter were $78 million. 
Equity investments produced record net gains of $3.7 billion amid a supportive market backdrop, particularly in growth equity, which drove roughly 1/3 of these revenues. The growth equity business has a 15-year track record of generating strong investment returns over the cycle and is focused exclusively on investments in growth stage, technology-driven companies, spanning multiple industries. 
Let me break down the results more specifically. On our $4 billion public equity portfolio, we had gains of roughly $900 million driven by market appreciation on investments, including Privia Health, [indiscernible] and Flywire. We will continue to execute sales where possible as conditions permit. 
Across our $17 billion private equity book, we generated gains of $2.8 billion from various positions, more than 2/3 of which were driven by events relating to the underlying portfolio of companies, including fundraisings, capital market activities and outright sales. Significant transactions in the portfolio included investments in Oncoclínicas, a Brazilian oncology business; Sterling, a provider of screening solutions; and Zipwhip, a messaging software firm. Additionally, we had operating revenues of roughly $200 million related to our portfolio of consolidated investment entities. 
Finally, net revenues from lending and debt investment activities were $610 million driven by NII and gains on fair value debt securities and loans. These gains reflected modestly tighter credit spreads and idiosyncratic events on our portfolio of corporate and real estate investments. 
On Page 8, we show the composition of our diversified asset management balance sheet, consistent with the information that we have provided to you in prior quarters. Staying with Asset Management, let me turn to Page 9. We included this page in today's earnings presentation to provide greater detail on the progress made in harvesting our on-balance sheet investments in Asset Management over the first half of the year. This is a critical driver of our strategy to reduce the capital intensity of our business. The message on the page is simple. While the overall balance sheet portfolio has increased modestly since the end of last year, we have been actively harvesting positions through the outright sales and IPOs of roughly $5.5 billion. These dispositions have been largely offset by markups on the portfolio of approximately $5 billion given the supportive market backdrop mentioned as well as modest additions to the balance sheet, which include early fund facilitation and other commitments. So while the balance sheet is slightly higher, we are actively executing on our harvesting strategy. The implied capital associated with the total dispositions across both private and public equity positions year-to-date is approximately $4 billion. And at this stage, we have line of sight on roughly $3 billion of incremental private asset sales corresponding to over $1 billion of capital reduction. 
As noted earlier, we will continue to pursue this disposition activity particularly given treatment of on-balance sheet equity investments under CCAR. 
Moving to Page 10. Consumer & Wealth Management produced record revenues of $1.7 billion in the second quarter. Wealth Management revenues of $1.4 billion included record management and other fees of $1.1 billion as assets under supervision increased to $672 billion. Private banking and lending revenues were $260 million, with loans to private wealth clients up $4 billion sequentially, consistent with our growth objectives. 
We remain focused on synergies between our PFM and PWM franchises where we continue to see referrals representing a significant AUS opportunity. 
Consumer banking revenues were $363 million [ in the quarter ], reflecting higher deposit balances and credit card loans. The low rate environment as well as our reduced rate of loan growth in the portfolio over the past 15 months continues to impact the business, though forward growth should help to offset this. 
Next, let's turn to Page 11 for our firm-wide view of assets under supervision and management and other fees. Total AUS increased to a record $2.3 trillion during the quarter. The sequential increase of $101 billion was driven by $22 billion of long-term inflows, $16 billion of liquidity inflows and $63 billion of market appreciation. Our firm-wide management and other fees grew by 13% versus the second quarter of 2020 to a record $1.8 billion. 
On Page 12, we address net interest income and our lending portfolio across all segments. Total firm-wide NII was $1.6 billion for the second quarter, higher versus a year ago, reflecting lower funding expenses and an increase in interest-earning assets. 
Next, let's review loan growth and credit performance across the firm. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $131 billion, up $10 billion sequentially, driven by wealth management and residential real estate warehouse lending as well as Apple Card. Provision for credit losses reflected a net benefit of $92 million, which includes a reserve reduction driven by improvements in the broader economic backdrop, partially offset by portfolio growth. As the credit environment remains benign, we expect loan growth to accelerate in coming quarters, consistent with our strategy to increase lending and financing across the firm. 
Let's turn to expenses on Page 13. Our total quarterly operating expenses were $8.6 billion, and our efficiency ratio for the quarter was 56.1%, reflecting the operating leverage in our business and our ability to exhibit expense discipline while investing for growth. Our ratio of compensation to revenues net of provisions remained flat at 34%, though compensation expense increased year-over-year, reflecting strong results in line with our pay-for-performance culture. 
Noncompensation expenses were down 43% versus last year due to significantly lower litigation costs. Excluding the impact of litigation, noncompensation was up approximately 6% relative to top line growth of 16% as increases in transaction-based and technology expenses were partially offset by lower expenses related to investment entities. 
We remain focused on the $1.3 billion expense efficiency target announced at Investor Day. As we noted at a recent industry conference, we also see increased opportunity for further expense efficiencies beyond the medium term, which permits us to fund investments in growth initiatives and in the talent of the firm. 
Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.8%. As noted previously, we expect our tax rate under the current tax regime to be approximately 21%, and we'll monitor the impact of various proposals being made in the U.S. on the federal and state level. 
Turning to our balance sheet and capital on Slide 14. On June 28, we disclosed the Federal Reserve's indicative stress capital buffer estimate for Goldman Sachs of 6.4%, which implies a Common Equity Tier 1 requirement of 13.4% effective October 1. As David mentioned, we also announced an increase in our dividend to $2 per share. 
While our expectation of the Federal Reserve stress test results was for a more meaningful reduction in our SCB, the results only serve to reaffirm the importance of executing our strategy of reducing the capital intensity of our businesses. 
In light of our most recent SCB, we recognize that our standardized CET1 ratio will remain elevated for this CCAR cycle. And achieving our target in the medium term, by definition, will be more challenging. That said, we continue to believe that the 13% to 13.5% CET1 target range provided at Investor Day is appropriate for our firm. Our capital management philosophy remains unchanged. We prioritize deploying capital for our client franchise at attractive returns, paying a dividend commensurate with our forward view on durability of earnings and then returning any excess to shareholders via share repurchases. 
In the quarter, we returned a total of $1.4 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $1 billion and approximately $440 million in common stock dividends. Consistent with our capital management philosophy and in recognition of the accretive capital deployment opportunities across the firm, we lowered our stock repurchases in the quarter. Our book value per share rose to a record $264.90, up 6% sequentially. Total assets ended the quarter at $1.4 trillion, 7% higher versus last quarter. We maintained high liquidity levels with our global core liquid assets, averaging $329 billion. On the liability side, our total deposits rose to $306 billion, up $20 billion versus last quarter. And our long-term debt also rose by $20 billion driven by $18 billion of benchmark issuance. 
Let me just spend a moment on funding. As we noted on our fixed income call in May, our year-to-date benchmark issuance has exceeded maturities and redemptions for the year, contrary to our intention at the start of the year, but responsive to client demand and attractive return opportunities for the firm. We expect to continue this issuance should more accretive opportunities requiring nonbank funding persist, albeit at a more moderate pace than the $38 billion issued in the first half. Nonetheless, we remain focused on further diversification of our funding channels and opportunities for higher utilization of deposit funding globally. 
To that end, we recently completed a realignment of certain of our bank entities to facilitate more activity in the U.S. bank, bringing our banks to nearly 30% of the firm-wide balance sheet. 
In conclusion, we delivered record revenues for the first half of the year, reflecting the diversification and strength of our client franchise. Looking forward, the overall opportunity set remains attractive across the firm. Given strategic progress and recent performance, we are confident around our medium-term return targets with a path to sustainable mid-teens returns as we continue to execute on our strategy. 
With that, we'll now open up the line for questions."

They've grown kind of consistent with the broader strategy that we set up. As to distinguish that growth between the environment and clients, I would say it's both. I would say the environment, obviously, by virtue of balances accreting in this market, that has grown balances. And we've obviously seen opportunity to take on new clients, and frankly speaking, to be more profound with our existing ones. But I would tell you that in the context of all of that, and I mentioned this in the script, there's a clear screen, which looks at where we are pricing, how we are structuring terms both around new entrants and equally around the back book of our prime balances. And so we're being rather judicious in the context of what we bring in to assure that this stays as accretive as we think it can become from a returns point of view, but it is both environment and clients. And our ambition is to take that share up, but to do it in a rather prudent way. 
On the part of your question relating to Arca [indiscernible], look, this is obviously gathered kind of an investigative purview from a number of geographies and across regulators, kind of hard to predict exactly where that yields or what that yields. I suspect that in the broad category of transparency and disclosure, both of which we would be supportive of. There will be moves by regulators to achieve that, but very hard to say kind of as to where that all plays out. As we said in our first quarter earnings call, we aim to be a constructive participant in the kind of regulatory and industry change that will come about."

So progress on both fronts has been considerable. I would say -- let's start with Apple Card. The press around creating the family plan was, frankly speaking, to achieve a greater and more positive user experience so that people across the family were treated equally in the context of the underwriting, broadly speaking. I think that move will accelerate share, but I think more importantly -- and its objective was to create just a better overall user experience. 
On Apple Card, generally, I would tell you that while we pulled back in terms of rate of growth during the course of COVID, we've seen the credit profile of Apple Card customers to prove positive, perhaps even more positive than we thought. And we've now opened up the aperture and are now accelerating that rate of growth, consistent with the tone of the consumer market that we're seeing. And I think there's more opportunities to be had with Apple using the card as a medium for engagement with the client set. So you'll start to see forward growth, and I suspect balances will be a fast follower from the increase in originations and underwriting in Apple Card, and the family plan will only serve to help that. 
In transaction banking, that business continues to grow. We're upwards of now several hundred clients, $40 billion of deposits. And perhaps most importantly, when you look at that deposit base, we're starting to see an acceleration of operational deposits approaching 15%. And that's obviously the lynchpin to creating a deposit base that is more usable and more valuable to the firm. 
I will tell you based on our opening expectations of that business, we have had to put less rate on deposits to attract customers. It's turning out that the user interface and the engagement with the corporate client set just in terms of what we're offering by way of experience and technology is proving to be the winning ticket. And so as both David and I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're going to start to see geographic expansion both to the U.K. and Japan. We've set ourselves up from a bank entity point of view to facilitate that kind of growth with licenses in a variety of jurisdictions and a reorganization of the banking entities. And so I think that business will continue to play forward. And perhaps what's most illustrative of that is just the power of the corporate franchise and the open doors that are there in the context of kind of the One GS mantra and the way in which we're able to sell them through an existing client base."

We appreciate the question. And on the first part of the question, we absolutely have made progress on our goals with respect to capital efficiency and the on-balance sheet investing, and I'll let Stephen highlight some of the details in the moment -- at the moment, but we continue to move aggressively to manage those positions. I think it's a very constructive environment for us to do so, and I think you'll continue to do that -- you'll continue to see us do that with intensity as we see good opportunities to monetize those positions. 
We continue to be committed to both diversifying our revenue streams and also continuing to drive toward more durable and recurring revenues. And the fee-based emphasis of the fundraising that we're doing in the asset management business is one aspect of that. 
On the broader question about opportunity, I think one of the reasons why we decreased our buyback in the quarter is that we see opportunities to continue to devote capital to serving our clients and growing our business. And so if we can add accretive returns in our business by deploying capital in that manner, we'll continue to do it, but we want to remain, and I think we've always been, a very, very nimble capital allocator. And so when we see those opportunities, we will make investments, and we'll continue to grow the business. If, for some reason, the environment changes and we don't, we'll return that capital appropriately to shareholders. 
Stephen, you want to comment just on the progress along those sell-downs because we have made real targeted progress, and we'll continue to make progress with respect to some of the goals we've set out."

So I guess let's just start kind of with the facts. Obviously, on the new page that we showed you, $5.5 billion did come off balance sheet, producing $4 billion of capital relief.

Obviously, on the new page that we showed you, $5.5 billion did come off balance sheet, producing $4 billion of capital relief. And as I mentioned, there's another $3 billion that's in sight to take $1 billion of capital down. Now that just looks narrowly speaking at the private equity portfolio. There's consolidated investment entities. There are debt positions, all of which are on balance sheet, all of which are subject to further reduction, all of which will reduce down capital. 
Now why does that matter? And why do we want to stick to that strategy, Christian, as opposed to kind of abandon it? Well, first of all, obviously, we're looking to elevate the capital returns of the firm. The one way to do that is to influence the denominator. The way to do that is to reduce down the capital density of our businesses more broadly. At the same time, this is going to dramatically change over time the durable revenue forecast for the firm, which is that moving from on-balance sheet to fund format and the fact that we've raised since Investor Day $75 billion of new funds in those funds, okay, we'll increase assets under supervision and equally will increase fee revenue that's being generated by those investments in that fund format. And so in a way, the page to watch on the forward will be Page 11 of our Investor Day presentation because what's going to play out and we promised more disclosure, which we will deliver, but firm-wide assets under supervision will go up. Firm-wide management and other fees will go up. Those will prove to be more durable and predictable and I think hold the promise of greater valuation on the back of a lower capital dense set of businesses. And I think that's the broader picture, if you will, in terms of what we're trying to achieve. What we put on Page 9 was nothing but an attempt very simply to show progress was made, much as it would otherwise be masked by, as you put it, kind of a very happy problem in terms of an appreciating equity market also providing us with an opportunity to accelerate into the strategy of disposing of on-balance sheet investments."

I mean the environment for Investment Banking activity, Steven, continues to be very, very constructive. And I think that there's a good chance that, that will continue to play forward in that direction for some time here as the economic expansion continues. 
In my remarks, I highlighted the fact that coming out of the pandemic, there were a handful of factors that we think are structurally driving CEOs and boards to think about how they can strategically strengthen their position in an increasingly evolving digital world. And we're seeing really, really broad engagement across our franchise with respect to the desire of companies to better position themselves on a go forward basis and a world that's actually evolving quite quickly. I'm encouraged by the fact that our backlog levels remain extremely high, record levels. And a lot of that, I think, feels like it will sustain as we move through this environment. Obviously, if there was some sort of a disruption or an economic slowdown sometime in the future, that would wear on confidence and slow that, but that doesn't seem likely given where we are positioned today. 
With respect to Global Markets, we picked up 160 basis points of market share through quarter 1, and that's allowing us to take greater share of whatever the broader trading market provides us. I don't have specific market share KPIs on Investment Banking to share right on this call. We can certainly follow up more broadly on some things. 
Obviously, we tracked our -- we track our league table position both in M&A and equity and debt. And there, we've been strengthening our position over time, and it's consistently at the top of those league tables. 
What I do say is affecting our wallet share in banking is part of our Investor Day process to serve a broader array of clients was to really expand that footprint. And the footprint of available clients that, let's say, are in the $500 million to $3 billion enterprise value has been significant. It's grown, and we've continued to expand that footprint, and we're quite effective at penetrating that. And so that's been a very good opportunity for us, and I actually think that opportunity will continue. 
I think our Investment Banking business is positioned incredibly well. I think we continue, as we have been, to be a leader in that business over the course of the last decades. And the quality of the talent we have in that business continues to be strong, differentiated and very, very front footed with our clients. And so there certainly could be macro events over 12-, 24-, 36-month period that slow down the current momentum. But at the moment, it feels quite constructive."

Call after call, quarter-after-quarter, I've said and I'll say again that the bar would always be extremely high for us to do something very, very significant, but I've also said that our drive to diversify our revenues and create more durable revenues comes, as both Stephen and I have highlighted in our remarks, from continuing to invest in and grow our Asset Management business, continuing to invest in and grow the opportunity in our Wealth Management business and for broadening our digital consumer banking platform. There may be opportunities from time to time that can accelerate the direction of travel on those. We look at things constantly. If we see things that can accelerate the direction of travel in those businesses and accelerate our goals in those businesses, we'll certainly consider them, always with a high bar. It wouldn't surprise you that prices at the moment are high, and that certainly has an impact on how we think about these things, but we're making a lot of progress organically, and we continue to be focused on that organic growth."

And we've only started to really tap into the relationship network and the platform that we have as a firm to really be a much bigger institutional capital manager across these strategies broadly. And as Stephen highlighted, since our Investor Day, we've raised $75 billion in fund [indiscernible]. 
I think everybody on this call understands that when we do raise funds, we invest as a GP alongside our institutional investors. And so there will always be equity investments through our fund participation, but the cycle that we're going through is one of shifting from significant on-balance sheet investments over time to a much broader fund mix where the investment slice we have in the fund is smaller, and therefore, the overall equity position will be meaningfully smaller than it's been. 
Now it's a good problem that the market keeps going up. And therefore, the value seems to be staying the same, even though we're making very, very significant sales. But over time, as we continue to grow the funds portion of the business and we continue on the path of disposing, that number will get smaller. We haven't put out a target number. But by definition, it will get smaller. 
In the near term, our balance sheet will come down, and our AE target is a little less than $18 billion."

And so all of that is part and parcel of where we want to go. Obviously, the objective or the near-term target as it were of AE of getting down to $18 billion or lower remains that, and we're committed to get to it, notwithstanding the appreciation in the overall portfolio because, as you rightly point out, that also presents opportunity to accelerate where we can the sell-down of these positions."

We're taking a lot of self-help here. We've been talking about one. The overall push to durable revenues, right, is going to factor into the way in which the Fed determines PPNR in the context of the overall SCB calculation. So it's not just limited to this. It means what do we do in the pivot to the fees that will be generated, as David spoke about and I did, of $75 billion and growing in fund format. What does it mean in the context of a growing consumer business? What does it mean in the context of a growing fee set that comes out of transaction banking? All of these will prove to be more durable, viewed that way, presumably by the Fed, to yield a better PPNR sort of calculation in the overall test. So we're not exclusively relying on this much as this has sort of considerable consequence in the way in which CCAR treats on balance sheet investing. 
And then, again, we remain quite engaged with the Fed as we put our letter in last year, and we'll only serve to reinforce those issues this year on issues that we think are relevant to achieving a lower SCB calculation."

I'm going to answer the second part first, and then I'll circle back on the executive order and kind of the broader road map around M&A. But I don't think the sponsor activity is driven by tax. The sponsor business at this point is a broad, diverse business. There's enormous dry powder. There's an enormous amount of money that moves in that ecosystem. There's real secular growth in the context of the capital allocators and their desire to increase their weighting to alternatives. It's one of the reasons why the strategy we're focused as one of the leading alternative managers in the world and continuing to grow that because there's lots of demand for our clients. And so I don't think that there's any overlay from a tax perspective that's accelerating activity there. I do think that activity has accelerated because the market environment is quite constructive, and it's been quite a constructive environment for asset prices generally. 
With respect to the broad M&A environment and antitrust and the executive order, I mean, obviously, the executive order, I think, serves the road map for a whole bunch of policy priorities that the current administration would like to get done over the next 4 years that relate broadly to competition, consumer protection issues. This is a -- it's a broad and ambitious range of ideas. It's something that I think we'll have to watch very, very closely. 
Ultimately, the order can't direct the agencies that make the antitrust decisions to make those decisions, but it can put a set of constructs into place that certainly could ultimately have a regulatory impact. But the agencies will have to over time put forward -- or through the actions they take create more transparency on that. We'll be watching it very closely and doing a lot of work to see how that all evolves with agencies. Certainly, I think there's a tipping in the balance that could, in the margin, have some impact on certain transactions. I'd certainly say broadly around large tech consolidation, there'll certainly be a lot of discussion in that area. But I think it's early, and I think you have to watch it closely. And I think the macro environment and the tailwinds from the macro environment and some of the things I said earlier about company's desires to really strengthen their competitive positioning outweighs the regulatory overlay, but we're going to have to watch that very carefully."

Mike, the way we look at it and compute it is we look at the introduction of technology into a variety of different work streams, take risk, for example, where there's mandatory production of tens of thousands of reports, either by regulators or consumption internally. And we go through a zero-based budgeting exercise where we constantly revisit what we need in the context of the introduction of technology and automation that plays forward. 
When I think about the forward for the firm, the real cost gains are going to happen, and the production of higher marginal margins are going to play out by virtually the achievement of scale. When we achieve scale in certain of these businesses, take transaction banking, take the consumer business, even look at what we do in platforms like PFM, okay, we are building constantly higher marginal margin returns because we've got an embedded base that is built to scale, and those businesses will scale over time over the medium to long term, and the effective unit cost, if you will, of producing what we do will come down. And so that's just a sense both in the spot, zero-based budgeting, risk, et cetera, but equally on the forward in terms of how to think about the achievement of scale and higher marginal margin in the business."

I mean one is to repeat what David said, which is it's a bit early, right now a week into the issuance of the executive order as to exactly how that plays, okay? From our perspective, we started this consumer business on a white sheet of paper. So we're not retrofitting a series of transactions or incumbent businesses. And so as we look to continue to build the consumer platform, we're quite open to the notion that there will be shared set of data. The data will be portable. Our focus has been entirely from the customer back, which is what does the customer want, what does the customer need and the build of a very differentiated new consumer platform. And so these products are all about the design, utilization of data. 
We obviously are consistent and in line with some of our other banking brethren, which is we need to make sure that the security of customer data is paramount. We're no different than any other bank. We take that responsibility seriously. But I think on the new build, on a white sheet of paper, we're less burdened by these issues, less protective of an incumbent business and more focused on where we can take it and where we can build."

So let me take the 3 pieces. First, on the $1.3 billion expense initiative, we are as ever confident in the achievement of that. And you all may have heard at a recent industry conference, John Waldron indicated that we have further confi",590,"Yes. Sure. Okay. So let me take the 3 pieces. First, on the $1.3 billion expense initiative, we are as ever confident in the achievement of that. And you all may have heard at a recent industry conference, John Waldron indicated that we have further confidence to about $400 million above and beyond that to be achieved outside the 2022 time line that we set for the achievement of the $1.3 billion. So confident in the existing number and giving an offering kind of a forward indication of where we can take it up from there. Again, all of this consistent actually with some of the prior questions are about creating capacity for further investment in the firm and in its people. And so that's where we stand as it relates to the expense initiatives. 
In terms of comp and noncomp and the forward, let me say this. On compensation, as David has indicated, we've always been in a pay-for-performance mode. We'll continue to be that. As the firm performs, we will continue to sort of pay out to both attract and retain talent. I will say, as we've said in the past on compensation that the compensation as sort of a call out component to operating expense will become less and less important as and to the extent that we build out more of these scaled businesses. And so therefore, you'll be looking more at operating expense in its total than you will as we have historically been rather preoccupied with the compensation ratio in and of itself. That's less a reflection of any departure whatsoever from the way in which we want to pay talent. It has more to do with the composition of businesses that we're building and the kind of noncomp intensity of expenses related to it. 
On noncomp expense, I would say we have in virtually every one of the recent quarters been quite focused on ensuring that we demonstrate operating leverage in the business. That is our noncomp expense, normalized for kind of excessive one-off litigation or the like, trends at a level which is inside rate of growth to the top line of the firm. So this quarter, as I noted, while the as-reported noncomp expense is down about 43%, that's influenced very heavily by the $2.9 billion of litigation that appeared in the second quarter of last year. When you look at it like-for-like, our noncomp expense is up 6% against the 16% top line revenue growth. I think that should be a guidepost for how we're going to continue to sort of carry ourselves on the forward. 
On the third question, you asked about funding optimization. Here, I would say we are -- we remain committed and confident in the achievement of $1 billion in funding optimization. Bear in mind that as I spoke about increased nondeposit funding or increased wholesale funding, the overall funding mix or the funding taken in total for the firm is going up. It's going up in the context of accretive opportunities we see inside the firm. In as much as we grow nonbank or wholesale funding, we are equally growing the deposit base. We're doing that now at a lower price point than where we were before. It's indicative of NII growing in the firm. And so we're confident that the growth in that deposit funding on a price times volume basis is going to continue to sort of bear fruit and take us to $1 billion of run rate savings within the time frame."

So I would say the process of sell-through here is better in terms of rate of growth than we anticipated, but the way in which it's happening is as we anticipated, which is that we are not new to any one of the corporates who are coming on to this platform. There's a long-standing corporate relationship that has opened the door. We had said from the beginning that while our ambition was to grow a very big and very profitable business, we recognized that there was a progression where you have large corporates that have a platform of 3 or 4 participating banks that our break in point was to be #3 or 4, and this wasn't conditioned on us jumping to the #1 spot on that platform out of the box. 
Now my view is that as treasurers and CFOs grow ever more confident in kind of their operational experience on the platform, we will grow. We will have more products and services to offer that corporate client off of the transaction banking platform, and we will see our ranking, if you will, on that platform grow. If we began at 3 or 4, we'll see ourselves to 2 and perhaps 1, and that will continue to sort of grow and expand. But these are formidable clients of the firm who place considerable confidence in the firm. So that sell-through is, as we expected, perhaps faster in terms of rate of growth, and that's kind of progression. 
I would also say that, that will correspondingly lead to greater operational deposits on the $40 billion growing that we will see because as a client becomes ever more operational as a percentage of their overall business, percentage of their deposits with the firm will become more operational, therefore, more valuable. And so that, I think, is kind of the progression and the way to think about growth and the migration kind of up the ladder as it were for any given corporate client."

Certainly, I can't predict the future. There certainly could be an environment that comes in the future where economic activity slows and where some parts of our business slow vis-à-vis the levels of activity we're seeing today. On the other hand, at times of stress or in times of decreasing economic activity, there are also parts of our business that perform quite well and had some counter cyclicality. So I think we have a big at scale business. We are at scale in a number of our businesses and a leader. I think those businesses will continue through the cycle to produce very, very good returns. I think we're building other businesses that, as Stephen highlighted, are going to be scaling. Some of them are different kinds of businesses, but they offer opportunity for more consistent, more [indiscernible], more consistent returns that you can more easily model and people will view as more durable. I believe that our business activities are durable through the cycle, and our job is to continue to perform and continue to prove it. And so I believe if we continue to do that over time, the discount that exists between the way our earnings are valued and the way others and our peers are valued should narrow. But we're going to continue -- we're going to continue to focus on serving our clients, growing these businesses, expanding the platforms. And my belief is the market will follow."

It's also enabling us to develop new products in credit like customized baskets and TRS strategies. It's all in the context of where a client of the firm can come either through Marquee or otherwise, and through an API, use data and tools that the firm is providing in order to execute.

So [ ERP ] has been in both places over the last several months. 
In the commodities business, I would say that we have broadly expanded our business to take account of greater product dispersion in commodities to play to a greater interest of expression in view by clients. So for example, our business used to be in commodities, almost 50% oil. And now oil is more like 20%, and we see greater product dispersion across gas, power, metals and ags. I think that's good for our business, and it reflects our reaction to, as I say, an expression by clients and customers of greater interest across a wider sort of span of product sets within commodities itself."

So let me talk a little bit about where we've seen loan growth now because I think it's reflective of the forward. So as I mentioned in my remarks, we're seeing loan growth in our PWM client channel where we extended about $4 billion of incremental lending in the quarter. It's a great feeder in the context of our engagement with clients and kind of a broader fee pool that's created by virtue of meeting the borrowings. And this is all very well credit placed in the context of the client set that's borrowing. We've seen more lending in the context of our Investment Banking business, much of that relating to transactional activity. Again, it bleeds out to a larger fee pool in the context of where we are. 
In Global Markets, we've seen ourselves, and I mentioned this in mortgages, around warehouse financing. So this is very liquid lending that I think takes on the proper credit profile in terms of what's there. So the positioning I'm speaking about is both a broader view about macro risk, about individual idiosyncratic risk in the sleeve in which we're lending and perhaps, more importantly, the returns that the firm takes in, in the context of lending into any one of those particular client segments."

As it relates to SCB, we have long said that we maintain a 50 to 100 basis point buffer -- management buffer above our minimum. I see no reason to sort of change that view. We do view that buffer not simply as a defensive tool but rather an offensive tool where it leaves us with considerable dry powder in the deployment of capital when and if clients look to petition us for it. Actually, during the second quarter, that was true. We participated in AT&T and Medline, both of which were momentarily capital consumptive. The buffer enabled us to do that and engage. Just one obviously factual point, which is we're at 13 6 under SCB for this -- the third quarter. We go down to 13 4 in the fourth quarter relative to the most recent CCAR outcome. 
As it relates to share repurchase, I would only say what I said before, which is we've obviously taken the dividend up, reflective of our view about the forward durability of the performance of the firm, and we look to deploy capital at -- returns. And if they continue to demonstrate mid-20% return on equity, you will see us continue to deploy capital in that direction. To the extent that, that falls off for whatever reason, we will take up our share repurchase in that regard, but you should assume us to be an active participant in share repurchase in any given quarter.

I will begin on Page 1 of the presentation with a review of our financial results.  
In the second quarter, we produced net revenues of $15.4 billion, our second highest result on record. The strength, breadth and diversity of our business remained evident this quarter as we delivered net earnings of $5.5 billion and quarterly earnings per share of $15.02.  
Second quarter results contributed to our highest ever first half revenues of $33 billion and net earnings of over $12 billion, which drove year-to-date ROE of 27.3% and ROTE of 28.9%. Our performance underscores the strength of our client franchise and the constructive but more normalized market environment relative to a year ago. Our results also reflect ongoing progress on the firm's strategic priorities across all 4 of our businesses as laid out at our 2020 Investor Day.  
In Investment Banking, we continue to benefit from our leading M&A franchise. Given this position, we observed certain secular changes driving strategic activity as our key clients emerge from the pandemic: the drive for scale, a push to achieve operating efficiency, the shift to a digital economy across a broader industry set. We've maintained the #1 rank and completed M&A for 19 of the last 20 years and have been the leader in equity underwriting for 9 of the last 10 years. We are broadening our transaction banking platform. In June, we launched in the U.K., and we will now focus on expanding into Japan and other geographies. Although we are early in the rollout, initial client feedback has been quite positive.  
We delivered solid results in Global Markets where recent market share gains contributed to our performance. We continue to deploy balance sheet to support client activity, and we are further expanding our means of engagement with our clients across both traditional and digital platforms. A good example is our Marquee platform where we are collaborating with MSCI to deliver improved portfolio analytics for our institutional clients versus via APIs.  
In Asset Management, our assets under supervision hit another record of $1.6 trillion as we serve clients by delivering best-in-class investment opportunities across a growing spectrum of traditional and alternative asset classes. We also continue to transition the business to more third-party funds where we have raised $74 billion in gross commitments across the range of alternative investment strategies since our 2020 Investor Day.  
Additionally, during the quarter, we received preliminary approval for a joint venture with ICBC, China's largest bank. The JV will combine our expertise in Asset Management with ICBC's extensive access to retail and institutional clients. The partnership is a testament to our long-standing relationship with ICBC and represents a significant opportunity for us to grow internationally.  
In Consumer & Wealth Management, we are seeing solid inflows in PWM from new and existing clients and ongoing synergies with our Ayco and PFM businesses. We are also advancing on our vision of creating a leading digital consumer banking platform where customer satisfaction with our products and services continues to be very high.  
This quarter, we launched Apple Card family, which allows co-owners on the same account to build credit together as equals. In addition, as we grow markets invest and prepare for the rollout of checking and other services, we are building a more comprehensive consumer banking offering.  
All in, the progress on our strategic priorities, combined with our continued execution, reaffirms my confidence in the strength of our franchise and the increasing durability of our revenues. Reflecting this confidence, our Board of Directors declared a 60% increase in our quarterly dividend to $2 a share. This follows an increase of over 50% in 2019. Taken together, we have increased the dividend by 150% since I took my seat as CEO. While future increases won't necessarily be of this magnitude, we continue to prioritize a robust dividend as a part of our capital management philosophy.  
With that, let me now turn to the operating environment on Page 2. It's clear that we're in the middle of a significant economic rebound. This is particularly true in countries like the U.S. and China, driven by the lifting of health and safety restrictions amid comprehensive vaccination programs. The broader economic improvement has also been underpinned by unprecedented support by central banks and, in the United States, the prospect of further fiscal stimulus in the form of infrastructure spending.  
A quarter ago, I mentioned my concerns about the prospect of the U.S. economy overheating, but recent commentary from the Federal Reserve indicates that the Central Bank is focused on this risk, which supports our economist view that inflationary pressures might be transitory and that any resulting risks could be adequately managed. From here, I remain concerned about the prospect of a pandemic resurgence. The Delta variant, should it spread further, could spear policy actions at slow economic growth. We are already seeing this play out in places like Hong Kong and Australia and potentially in parts of Europe. While vaccine take-up is progressing, it is not consistent across communities and nations, including parts of the United States. Widespread vaccine distribution and high vaccine rates are critical to open and thriving economies. I want to urge policymakers, government officials and business leaders across jurisdictions to do all they can to facilitate these efforts.  
At Goldman Sachs, we are running programs to facilitate faster vaccinations for our people and their families in the United States, Hong Kong and India, among other locations, building on the support we are providing communities in which we operate as we all navigate the challenges of this pandemic. More broadly as risk managers, we closely monitor developments and remain attentive to a variety of potential risks away from the challenges associated with COVID. Right now, the geopolitical landscape, most notably China and cybersecurity, are top of mind. As always, we remain committed to helping our clients navigate these and other risks amid an ever-changing market backdrop.  
As I look ahead, I remain optimistic about the opportunity set for Goldman Sachs. Our Investment Banking backlog is at a record level as strategic discussions with our corporate client base remain high, reflective of elevated CEO confidence and the prospect of continued economic recovery. While consumer confidence may prove more volatile as supplemental benefits expire in the U.S., corporate clients remain steadfast in their efforts to emerge stronger from the pandemic.  
In our markets business, ongoing client engagement and increased market share have strengthened our competitive positioning, notwithstanding more normalized flows and spreads relative to a year ago. And across our investing businesses, the current rate environment and search for yield are driving demand for both institutional and individual investors for our world-class scaled investment platform.  
Before I turn it over to Stephen, I'd like to close with a few final thoughts on the people of Goldman Sachs. We are an incredibly dedicated and resilient team, and I'm so proud of how we've worked tirelessly to serve our clients amid the challenges of the last 18 months. Again and again, I've heard from our clients that they say Goldman Sachs is ahead of the curve and that the engagement from our people has been stronger than ever.  
Speaking of that, as many of you know, we formally welcomed our colleagues in New York, Dallas, Salt Lake City, Hong Kong and other locations to office this summer. With roughly 50% of our people in these offices back on a regular basis, I can tell you that seeing them in our buildings again has been completely invigorating. We recognize that various geographies are navigating different stages of the pandemic, and we'll continue to provide our colleagues with the support they need. Going forward, we look to reopen more locations consistent with health and safety guidelines of each city in which we operate.  
I've heard from so many of our people over the last few weeks that they are glad to be back in the office, and clients appreciate that we are showing up. We have always given our people the flexibility they need to manage their professional and personal lives, and we will continue to do so. That said, I believe bringing us back together, forging the close bonds that support a culture of collaboration has renewed the sense of teamwork and apprenticeship that allows our people and our business to thrive.  
I'm particularly excited to see nearly 5,800 interns and new hires who are joining us this summer, many in person working side-by-side with long-tenured professionals of Goldman Sachs.  
I'll close by saying I'm very pleased with how our people continue to deliver for our clients and our shareholders. I'm especially confident in the strength of our client franchise amid an improving economic backdrop. Importantly, we are making progress in executing our strategy, and I believe we are on a path to sustainable mid-teens returns.  
With that, I'll turn it over to Stephen."
398625,1673070029,2344110,"The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 13, 2021",2021-07-13,"Earnings Calls","The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, David, and good morning. I will start with our business performance by segment, beginning on Page 4.  Investment Banking produced its second highest quarterly net revenues of $3.6 billion. Financial advisory revenues of $1.3 billion reflected",2415,"Thank you, David, and good morning. I will start with our business performance by segment, beginning on Page 4.  
Investment Banking produced its second highest quarterly net revenues of $3.6 billion. Financial advisory revenues of $1.3 billion reflected an elevated number of deal closings in the quarter and the increasing market position of our business as we have expanded our client footprint. We maintained our #1 league table position for the year-to-date, participating in $975 billion of announced transactions with a volume market share of 33%.  
Activity continues to be strong across geographies, particularly in the Americas, with strength across all industry groups, reflecting the breadth of our franchise. Underwriting performance remained very strong with its second highest quarterly revenues, following on from a record performance in the first quarter. Equity underwriting performance, in particular, continued to be strong, generating $1.2 billion in revenues amid elevated IPO activity and representing our third consecutive quarter with revenues of over $1 billion. We ranked #1 globally in equity underwriting for the year-to-date with volumes in the first half climbing to $85 billion across 400 deals. That represents volume market share of 10%, up 40 basis points versus full year 2020. Notably, we led over 160 IPOs for the year-to-date more than all of last year.  
In debt underwriting, net revenues were $950 million with performance supported by strong high-yield volumes and, importantly, robust acquisition financing activity, including LDOs as well as strong M&A and financial sponsor activity. This performance reflects the integrated nature of our financing and advisory businesses as well as our dominant share in financial sponsor activity. Additionally, ESG remained a focus of the market, particularly in Europe, with strong issuance volumes across sustainability-linked bonds and loans. We expect this trend to continue in future quarters.  
Notwithstanding the realization of record revenue in the first half of the year, as David noted, our Investment Banking backlog ended the quarter at a fresh record high with sequential growth supported by sustained M&A activity as well as replenishment from underwriting transactions. Corporate lending results of $159 million reflect revenues from transaction banking and middle market and relationship lending, net of approximately $130 million of losses on hedges in place with respect to the relationship loan book. Transaction banking is performing well. The business is approaching 300 clients, generating roughly $40 billion in deposits, with an increasing percentage becoming operational.  
Moving to Global Markets on Page 5. Segment net revenues were $4.9 billion in the quarter driven by solid client activity and a generally supportive market-making environment. Our franchise continued to exhibit strength across both FICC and Equities, notwithstanding more normalized activity versus a year ago when we experienced significant dislocation and volatility driving elevated client volumes. We remain focused on building upon recent market share gains and have made advances in digital platforms to sustain strong performance in this segment.  
Beginning with FICC on Page 6. Second quarter net revenues were $2.3 billion. In rates, performance was impacted by spread compression amid lower volatility, though activity remains high with a number of macroeconomic cross currents around economic recovery and inflation. In commodities, we saw solid performance across our increasingly diversified business with contributions from oil, natural gas and power, ags and metals, and active risk management in a dynamic market characterized by healthy client flows. In mortgages, strong performance was helped by activity in our residential loan trading business, offset by lower results in agency mortgages. The business continues to diversify its revenue across market-making, loan origination and financing.  
Across both credit and currencies, lower volatility, more muted volumes and spread compression led to more modest performance relative to recent quarters, though market share gains helped to offset the effects of a relatively subdued trade environment.  
FICC financing revenues of $423 million were driven by mortgage lending, offset by lower repo performance.  
Moving to Equities. Net revenues for the second quarter were $2.6 billion as we actively deployed our balance sheet to intermediate risk and support client activity. Equities intermediation produced net revenues of $1.8 billion with performance driven by the global scale and breadth of our client franchise in both cash and derivatives.  
In cash, we facilitated client flows across high and low-touch channels. And in derivatives, we saw solid performance in EMEA, following a more orderly market in European dividends relative to a year ago and stronger results in structured products across geographies. Equities financing revenues of $815 million were strong given record average balances in our prime business. Growth in balances were a product of rising equity markets and more significant engagement among existing and new clients.  
While growth in Equities financing remains a strategic priority, we nonetheless maintain a very disciplined focus on risk management, pricing and structural terms of engagement.  
Moving to Asset Management on Page 7. In the second quarter, we generated record revenues of $5.1 billion. Management and other fees totaled $727 million, which rose year-on-year despite approximately $160 million of fee waivers on our money market funds. These waivers carry over from prior quarters and are consistent with industry practice in this rate environment. Incentive fees for the quarter were $78 million.  
Equity investments produced record net gains of $3.7 billion amid a supportive market backdrop, particularly in growth equity, which drove roughly 1/3 of these revenues. The growth equity business has a 15-year track record of generating strong investment returns over the cycle and is focused exclusively on investments in growth stage, technology-driven companies, spanning multiple industries.  
Let me break down the results more specifically. On our $4 billion public equity portfolio, we had gains of roughly $900 million driven by market appreciation on investments, including Privia Health, KnowBe4 and Flywire. We will continue to execute sales where possible as conditions permit.  
Across our $17 billion private equity book, we generated gains of $2.8 billion from various positions, more than 2/3 of which were driven by events relating to the underlying portfolio of companies, including fundraisings, capital market activities and outright sales. Significant transactions in the portfolio included investments in Oncoclínicas, a Brazilian oncology business; Sterling, a provider of screening solutions; and Zipwhip, a messaging software firm. Additionally, we had operating revenues of roughly $200 million related to our portfolio of consolidated investment entities.  
Finally, net revenues from lending and debt investment activities were $610 million driven by NII and gains on fair value debt securities and loans. These gains reflected modestly tighter credit spreads and idiosyncratic events on our portfolio of corporate and real estate investments.  
On Page 8, we show the composition of our diversified asset management balance sheet, consistent with the information that we have provided to you in prior quarters. Staying with Asset Management, let me turn to Page 9. We included this page in today's earnings presentation to provide greater detail on the progress made in harvesting our on-balance sheet investments in Asset Management over the first half of the year. This is a critical driver of our strategy to reduce the capital intensity of our business. The message on the page is simple. While the overall balance sheet portfolio has increased modestly since the end of last year, we have been actively harvesting positions through the outright sales and IPOs of roughly $5.5 billion. 
These dispositions have been largely offset by markups on the portfolio of approximately $5 billion given the supportive market backdrop mentioned as well as modest additions to the balance sheet, which include early fund facilitation and other commitments. So while the balance sheet is slightly higher, we are actively executing on our harvesting strategy. The implied capital associated with the total dispositions across both private and public equity positions year-to-date is approximately $4 billion. And at this stage, we have line of sight on roughly $3 billion of incremental private asset sales corresponding to over $1 billion of capital reduction.  
As noted earlier, we will continue to pursue this disposition activity particularly given treatment of on-balance sheet equity investments under CCAR.  
Moving to Page 10. Consumer & Wealth Management produced record revenues of $1.7 billion in the second quarter. Wealth Management revenues of $1.4 billion included record management and other fees of $1.1 billion as assets under supervision increased to $672 billion. Private banking and lending revenues were $260 million, with loans to private wealth clients up $4 billion sequentially, consistent with our growth objectives.  
We remain focused on synergies between our PFM and PWM franchises where we continue to see referrals representing a significant AUS opportunity.  
Consumer banking revenues were $363 million [ in the quarter ], reflecting higher deposit balances and credit card loans. The low rate environment as well as our reduced rate of loan growth in the portfolio over the past 15 months continues to impact the business, though forward growth should help to offset this.  
Next, let's turn to Page 11 for our firm-wide view of assets under supervision and management and other fees. Total AUS increased to a record $2.3 trillion during the quarter. The sequential increase of $101 billion was driven by $22 billion of long-term inflows, $16 billion of liquidity inflows and $63 billion of market appreciation. Our firm-wide management and other fees grew by 13% versus the second quarter of 2020 to a record $1.8 billion.  
On Page 12, we address net interest income and our lending portfolio across all segments. Total firm-wide NII was $1.6 billion for the second quarter, higher versus a year ago, reflecting lower funding expenses and an increase in interest-earning assets.  
Next, let's review loan growth and credit performance across the firm. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $131 billion, up $10 billion sequentially, driven by wealth management and residential real estate warehouse lending as well as Apple Card. Provision for credit losses reflected a net benefit of $92 million, which includes a reserve reduction driven by improvements in the broader economic backdrop, partially offset by portfolio growth. As the credit environment remains benign, we expect loan growth to accelerate in coming quarters, consistent with our strategy to increase lending and financing across the firm.  
Let's turn to expenses on Page 13. Our total quarterly operating expenses were $8.6 billion, and our efficiency ratio for the quarter was 56.1%, reflecting the operating leverage in our business and our ability to exhibit expense discipline while investing for growth. Our ratio of compensation to revenues net of provisions remained flat at 34%, though compensation expense increased year-over-year, reflecting strong results in line with our pay-for-performance culture.  
Noncompensation expenses were down 43% versus last year due to significantly lower litigation costs. Excluding the impact of litigation, noncompensation was up approximately 6% relative to top line growth of 16% as increases in transaction-based and technology expenses were partially offset by lower expenses related to investment entities.  
We remain focused on the $1.3 billion expense efficiency target announced at Investor Day. As we noted at a recent industry conference, we also see increased opportunity for further expense efficiencies beyond the medium term, which permits us to fund investments in growth initiatives and in the talent of the firm.  
Our effective tax rate in the quarter was 19.8%. As noted previously, we expect our tax rate under the current tax regime to be approximately 21% and will monitor the impact of various proposals being made in the U.S. on the federal and state level.  
Turning to our balance sheet and capital on Slide 14. On June 28, we disclosed the Federal Reserve's indicative stress capital buffer estimate for Goldman Sachs of 6.4%, which implies a Common Equity Tier 1 requirement of 13.4% effective October 1. As David mentioned, we also announced an increase in our dividend to $2 per share.  
While our expectation of the Federal Reserve stress test results was for a more meaningful reduction in our SCB, the results only serve to reaffirm the importance of executing our strategy of reducing the capital intensity of our businesses.  
In light of our most recent SCB, we recognize that our standardized CET1 ratio will remain elevated for this CCAR cycle. And achieving our target in the medium term, by definition, will be more challenging. That said, we continue to believe that the 13% to 13.5% CET1 target range provided at Investor Day is appropriate for our firm. Our capital management philosophy remains unchanged. We prioritize deploying capital for our client franchise at attractive returns, paying a dividend commensurate with our forward view on durability of earnings and then returning any excess to shareholders via share repurchases.  
In the quarter, we returned a total of $1.4 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $1 billion and approximately $440 million in common stock dividends. Consistent with our capital management philosophy and in recognition of the accretive capital deployment opportunities across the firm, we lowered our stock repurchases in the quarter. Our book value per share rose to a record $264.90, up 6% sequentially. Total assets ended the quarter at $1.4 trillion, 7% higher versus last quarter. We maintained high liquidity levels with our global core liquid assets, averaging $329 billion. On the liability side, our total deposits rose to $306 billion, up $20 billion versus last quarter. And our long-term debt also rose by $20 billion driven by $18 billion of benchmark issuance.  
Let me just spend a moment on funding. As we noted on our fixed income call in May, our year-to-date benchmark issuance has exceeded maturities and redemptions for the year, contrary to our intention at the start of the year, but responsive to client demand and attractive return opportunities for the firm. We expect to continue this issuance should more accretive opportunities requiring nonbank funding persist, albeit at a more moderate pace than the $38 billion issued in the first half. Nonetheless, we remain focused on further diversification of our funding channels and opportunities for higher utilization of deposit funding globally.  
To that end, we recently completed a realignment of certain of our bank entities to facilitate more activity in the U.S. bank, bringing our banks to nearly 30% of the firm-wide balance sheet.  
In conclusion, we delivered record revenues for the first half of the year, reflecting the diversification and strength of our client franchise. Looking forward, the overall opportunity set remains attractive across the firm. Given strategic progress and recent performance, we are confident around our medium-term return targets with a path to sustainable mid-teens returns as we continue to execute on our strategy.  
With that, we'll now open up the line for questions."

I would say the environment, obviously, by virtue of balances accreting in this market, that has grown balances. And we've obviously seen opportunity to take on new clients, and frankly speaking, to be more profound with our existing ones. But I would tell you that in the context of all of that, and I mentioned this in the script, there's a clear screen, which looks at where we are pricing, how we are structuring terms both around new entrants and equally around the back book of our prime balances. And so we're being rather judicious in the context of what we bring in to assure that this stays as accretive as we think it can become from a returns point of view, but it is both environment and clients. And our ambition is to take that share up, but to do it in a rather prudent way.  
On the part of your question relating to Archegos, look, this is obviously gathered kind of an investigative purview from a number of geographies and across regulators, kind of hard to predict exactly where that yields or what that yields. I suspect that in the broad category of transparency and disclosure, both of which we would be supportive of. There will be moves by regulators to achieve that, but very hard to say kind of as to where that all plays out. As we said in our first quarter earnings call, we aim to be a constructive participant in the kind of regulatory and industry change that will come about."

So progress on both fronts has been considerable. I would say -- let's start with Apple Card. The press around creating the family plan was, frankly speaking, to achieve a greater and more positive user experience so that people across the family were treated equally in the context of the underwriting, broadly speaking. I think that move will accelerate share, but I think more importantly -- and its objective was to create just a better overall user experience.  
On Apple Card, generally, I would tell you that while we pulled back in terms of rate of growth during the course of COVID, we've seen the credit profile of Apple Card customers to prove positive, perhaps even more positive than we thought. And we've now opened up the aperture and are now accelerating that rate of growth, consistent with the tone of the consumer market that we're seeing. And I think there's more opportunities to be had with Apple using the card as a medium for engagement with the client set. So you'll start to see forward growth, and I suspect balances will be a fast follower from the increase in originations and underwriting in Apple Card, and the family plan will only serve to help that.  
In transaction banking, that business continues to grow. We're upwards of now several hundred clients, $40 billion of deposits. And perhaps most importantly, when you look at that deposit base, we're starting to see an acceleration of operational deposits approaching 15%. And that's obviously the lynchpin to creating a deposit base that is more usable and more valuable to the firm.  
I will tell you based on our opening expectations of that business, we have had to put less rate on deposits to attract customers. It's turning out that the user interface and the engagement with the corporate client set just in terms of what we're offering by way of experience and technology is proving to be the winning ticket. And so as both David and I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're going to start to see geographic expansion both to the U.K. and Japan. We've set ourselves up from a bank entity point of view to facilitate that kind of growth with licenses in a variety of jurisdictions and a reorganization of the banking entities. And so I think that business will continue to play forward. And perhaps what's most illustrative of that is just the power of the corporate franchise and the open doors that are there in the context of kind of the One GS mantra and the way in which we're able to sell them through an existing client base."

And then maybe more broadly, is it time to really rethink the sort of disposition strategy? Your stock is at all-time high.

We appreciate the question. And on the first part of the question, we absolutely have made progress on our goals with respect to capital efficiency and the on-balance sheet investing, and I'll let Stephen highlight some of the details in the moment -- at the moment, but we continue to move aggressively to manage those positions. I think it's a very constructive environment for us to do so, and I think you'll continue to do that -- you'll continue to see us do that with intensity as we see good opportunities to monetize those positions.  
We continue to be committed to both diversifying our revenue streams and also continuing to drive toward more durable and recurring revenues. And the fee-based emphasis of the fundraising that we're doing in the asset management business is one aspect of that.  
On the broader question about opportunity, I think one of the reasons why we decreased our buyback in the quarter is that we see opportunities to continue to devote capital to serving our clients and growing our business. And so if we can add accretive returns in our business by deploying capital in that manner, we'll continue to do it, but we want to remain, and I think we've always been, a very, very nimble capital allocator. And so when we see those opportunities, we will make investments, and we'll continue to grow the business. If, for some reason, the environment changes and we don't, we'll return that capital appropriately to shareholders.  
Stephen, you want to comment just on the progress along those sell-downs because we have made real targeted progress, and we'll continue to make progress with respect to some of the goals we've set out."

There's consolidated investment entities. There are debt positions, all of which are on balance sheet, all of which are subject to further reduction, all of which will reduce down capital.  
Now why does that matter? And why do we want to stick to that strategy, Christian, as opposed to kind of abandon it? Well, first of all, obviously, we're looking to elevate the capital returns of the firm. The one way to do that is to influence the denominator. The way to do that is to reduce down the capital density of our businesses more broadly. At the same time, this is going to dramatically change over time the durable revenue forecast for the firm, which is that moving from on-balance sheet to fund format and the fact that we've raised since Investor Day $75 billion of new funds in those funds, okay, we'll increase assets under supervision and equally will increase fee revenue that's being generated by those investments in that fund format. 
And so in a way, the page to watch on the forward will be Page 11 of our Investor Day presentation because what's going to play out and we promised more disclosure, which we will deliver, but firm-wide assets under supervision will go up. Firm-wide management and other fees will go up. Those will prove to be more durable and predictable and I think hold the promise of greater valuation on the back of a lower capital dense set of businesses. And I think that's the broader picture, if you will, in terms of what we're trying to achieve. What we put on Page 9 was nothing but an attempt very simply to show progress was made, much as it would otherwise be masked by, as you put it, kind of a very happy problem in terms of an appreciating equity market also providing us with an opportunity to accelerate into the strategy of disposing of on-balance sheet investments."

I mean the environment for Investment Banking activity, Steven, continues to be very, very constructive. And I think that there's a good chance that, that will continue to play forward in that direction for some time here as the economic expansion continues. 
In my remarks, I highlighted the fact that coming out of the pandemic, there were a handful of factors that we think are structurally driving CEOs and Boards to think about how they can strategically strengthen their position in an increasingly evolving digital world. And we're seeing really, really broad engagement across our franchise with respect to the desire of companies to better position themselves on a go forward basis and a world that's actually evolving quite quickly. I'm encouraged by the fact that our backlog levels remain extremely high, record levels. And a lot of that, I think, feels like it will sustain as we move through this environment. Obviously, if there was some sort of a disruption or an economic slowdown sometime in the future, that would wear on confidence and slow that, but that doesn't seem likely given where we are positioned today. 
With respect to Global Markets, we picked up 160 basis points of market share through quarter 1, and that's allowing us to take greater share of whatever the broader trading market provides us. I don't have specific market share KPIs on Investment Banking to share right on this call. We can certainly follow up more broadly on some things. 
Obviously, we tracked our -- we track our league table position both in M&A and equity and debt. And there, we've been strengthening our position over time, and it's consistently at the top of those league tables. 
What I do say is affecting our wallet share in banking is part of our Investor Day process to serve a broader array of clients was to really expand that footprint. And the footprint of available clients that, let's say, are in the $500 million to $3 billion enterprise value has been significant. It's grown, and we've continued to expand that footprint, and we're quite effective at penetrating that. And so that's been a very good opportunity for us, and I actually think that opportunity will continue. 
I think our Investment Banking business is positioned incredibly well. I think we continue, as we have been, to be a leader in that business over the course of the last decades. And the quality of the talent we have in that business continues to be strong, differentiated and very, very front footed with our clients. And so there certainly could be macro events over 12-, 24-, 36-month period that slow down the current momentum. But at the moment, it feels quite constructive."

Recognizing that barring a net reduction in that portfolio, understanding there's other metrics we have to monitor, it might be difficult to really see any meaningful SCB improvement at least in the near term. I was hoping to get some perspective just given the multiple rerating that you've seen, the strong momentum in the business as well as the fact that the SCB is feeling some upward pressure, whether your views on transformational M&A are evolving at all and whether a potential acquisition could at least help potentially mitigate some of the pressures from the global market shock that seem to be driving that upward pressure on the capital ratio."

And we've only started to really tap into the relationship network and the platform that we have as a firm to really be a much bigger institutional capital manager across these strategies broadly. And as Stephen highlighted, since our Investor Day, we've raised $75 billion in fund [ structure ]. 
I think everybody on this call understands that when we do raise funds, we invest as a GP alongside our institutional investors. And so there will always be equity investments through our fund participation, but the cycle that we're going through is one of shifting from significant on-balance sheet investments over time to a much broader fund mix where the investment slice we have in the fund is smaller, and therefore, the overall equity position will be meaningfully smaller than it's been. 
Now it's a good problem that the market keeps going up. And therefore, the value seems to be staying the same, even though we're making very, very significant sales. But over time, as we continue to grow the funds portion of the business and we continue on the path of disposing, that number will get smaller. We haven't put out a target number. But by definition, it will get smaller. 
In the near term, our balance sheet will come down, and our AE target is a little less than $18 billion."

And so all of that is part and parcel of where we want to go. Obviously, the objective or the near-term target as it were of AE of getting down to $18 billion or lower remains that, and we're committed to get to it, notwithstanding the appreciation in the overall portfolio because, as you rightly point out, that also presents opportunity to accelerate where we can the sell-down of these positions."

We're taking a lot of self-help here. We've been talking about one. The overall push to durable revenues, right, is going to factor into the way in which the Fed determines PPNR in the context of the overall SCB calculation. So it's not just limited to this. It means what do we do in the pivot to the fees that will be generated, as David spoke about and I did, of $75 billion and growing in fund format. What does it mean in the context of a growing consumer business? What does it mean in the context of a growing fee set that comes out of transaction banking? All of these will prove to be more durable, viewed that way, presumably by the Fed, to yield a better PPNR sort of calculation in the overall test. So we're not exclusively relying on this much as this has sort of considerable consequence in the way in which CCAR treats on balance sheet investing. 
And then, again, we remain quite engaged with the Fed as we put our letter in last year, and we'll only serve to reinforce those issues this year on issues that we think are relevant to achieving a lower SCB calculation."

I'm going to answer the second part first, and then I'll circle back on the executive order and kind of the broader road map around M&A. But I don't think the sponsor activity is driven by tax. The sponsor business at this point is a broad, diverse business. There's enormous dry powder. There's an enormous amount of money that moves in that ecosystem. There's real secular growth in the context of the capital allocators and their desire to increase their weighting to alternatives. It's one of the reasons why the strategy we're focused as one of the leading alternative managers in the world and continuing to grow that because there's lots of demand for our clients. And so I don't think that there's any overlay from a tax perspective that's accelerating activity there. I do think that activity has accelerated because the market environment is quite constructive, and it's been quite a constructive environment for asset prices generally. 
With respect to the broad M&A environment and antitrust and the executive order, I mean, obviously, the executive order, I think, serves the road map for a whole bunch of policy priorities that the current administration would like to get done over the next 4 years that relate broadly to competition, consumer protection issues. This is a -- it's a broad and ambitious range of ideas. It's something that I think we'll have to watch very, very closely. 
Ultimately, the order can't direct the agencies that make the antitrust decisions to make those decisions, but it can put a set of constructs into place that certainly could ultimately have a regulatory impact. But the agencies will have to over time put forward -- or through the actions they take create more transparency on that. We'll be watching it very closely and doing a lot of work to see how that all evolves with agencies. Certainly, I think there's a tipping in the balance that could, in the margin, have some impact on certain transactions. I'd certainly say broadly around large tech consolidation, there'll certainly be a lot of discussion in that area. But I think it's early, and I think you have to watch it closely. And I think the macro environment and the tailwinds from the macro environment and some of the things I said earlier about company's desires to really strengthen their competitive positioning outweighs the regulatory overlay, but we're going to have to watch that very carefully."

And we go through a zero-based budgeting exercise where we constantly revisit what we need in the context of the introduction of technology and automation that plays forward. 
When I think about the forward for the firm, the real cost gains are going to happen, and the production of higher marginal margins are going to play out by virtually the achievement of scale. When we achieve scale in certain of these businesses, take transaction banking, take the consumer business, even look at what we do in platforms like PFM, okay, we are building constantly higher marginal margin returns because we've got an embedded base that is built to scale, and those businesses will scale over time over the medium to long term, and the effective unit cost, if you will, of producing what we do will come down.

Our focus has been entirely from the customer back, which is what does the customer want, what does the customer need and the build of a very differentiated new consumer platform. And so these products are all about the design, utilization of data. 
We obviously are consistent and in line with some of our other banking brethren, which is we need to make sure that the security of customer data is paramount. We're no different than any other bank.

398625,1673070029,2344110,"The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 13, 2021",2021-07-13,"Earnings Calls","The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.","Executives","Yes. Sure. Okay. So let me take the 3 pieces. First, on the $1.3 billion expense initiative, we are as ever confident in the achievement of that. And you all may have heard at a recent industry conference, John Waldron indicated that we have further confi",590,"Yes. Sure. Okay. So let me take the 3 pieces. First, on the $1.3 billion expense initiative, we are as ever confident in the achievement of that. And you all may have heard at a recent industry conference, John Waldron indicated that we have further confidence to about $400 million above and beyond that to be achieved outside the 2022 time line that we set for the achievement of the $1.3 billion. So confident in the existing number and giving an offering kind of a forward indication of where we can take it up from there. Again, all of this consistent actually with some of the prior questions are about creating capacity for further investment in the firm and in its people. And so that's where we stand as it relates to the expense initiatives. 
In terms of comp and noncomp and the forward, let me say this. On compensation, as David has indicated, we've always been in a pay-for-performance mode. We'll continue to be that. As the firm performs, we will continue to sort of pay out to both attract and retain talent. I will say, as we've said in the past on compensation that the compensation as sort of a call out component to operating expense will become less and less important as and to the extent that we build out more of these scaled businesses. And so therefore, you'll be looking more at operating expense in its total than you will as we have historically been rather preoccupied with the compensation ratio in and of itself. That's less a reflection of any departure whatsoever from the way in which we want to pay talent. It has more to do with the composition of businesses that we're building and the kind of noncomp intensity of expenses related to it. 
On noncomp expense, I would say we have in virtually every one of the recent quarters been quite focused on ensuring that we demonstrate operating leverage in the business. That is our noncomp expense, normalized for kind of excessive one-off litigation or the like, trends at a level which is inside rate of growth to the top line of the firm. So this quarter, as I noted, while the as-reported noncomp expense is down about 43%, that's influenced very heavily by the $2.9 billion of litigation that appeared in the second quarter of last year. When you look at it like-for-like, our noncomp expense is up 6% against the 16% top line revenue growth. I think that should be a guidepost for how we're going to continue to sort of carry ourselves on the forward. 
On the third question, you asked about funding optimization. Here, I would say we are -- we remain committed and confident in the achievement of $1 billion in funding optimization. Bear in mind that as I spoke about increased nondeposit funding or increased wholesale funding, the overall funding mix or the funding taken in total for the firm is going up. It's going up in the context of accretive opportunities we see inside the firm. In as much as we grow nonbank or wholesale funding, we are equally growing the deposit base. We're doing that now at a lower price point than where we were before. It's indicative of NII growing in the firm. And so we're confident that the growth in that deposit funding on a price times volume basis is going to continue to sort of bear fruit and take us to $1 billion of run rate savings within the time frame."

So I would say the process of sell-through here is better in terms of rate of growth than we anticipated, but the way in which it's happening is as we anticipated, which is that we are not new to any one of the corporates who are coming on to this platform. There's a long-standing corporate relationship that has opened the door. We had said from the beginning that while our ambition was to grow a very big and very profitable business, we recognized that there was a progression where you have large corporates that have a platform of 3 or 4 participating banks that our break in point was to be #3 or 4, and this wasn't conditioned on us jumping to the #1 spot on that platform out of the box. 
Now my view is that as treasurers and CFOs grow ever more confident in kind of their operational experience on the platform, we will grow. We will have more products and services to offer that corporate client off of the transaction banking platform, and we will see our ranking, if you will, on that platform grow. If we began at 3 or 4, we'll see ourselves to 2 and perhaps 1, and that will continue to sort of grow and expand. But these are formidable clients of the firm who place considerable confidence in the firm. So that sell-through is, as we expected, perhaps faster in terms of rate of growth, and that's kind of progression. 
I would also say that, that will correspondingly lead to greater operational deposits on the $40 billion growing that we will see because as a client becomes ever more operational as a percentage of their overall business, percentage of their deposits with the firm will become more operational, therefore, more valuable. And so that, I think, is kind of the progression and the way to think about growth and the migration kind of up the ladder as it were for any given corporate client."

Certainly, I can't predict the future. There certainly could be an environment that comes in the future where economic activity slows and where some parts of our business slow vis-à-vis the levels of activity we're seeing today. On the other hand, at times of stress or in times of decreasing economic activity, there are also parts of our business that perform quite well and had some counter cyclicality. So I think we have a big at scale business. We are at scale in a number of our businesses as a leader. I think those businesses will continue through the cycle to produce very, very good returns. I think we're building other businesses that, as Stephen highlighted, are going to be scaling. 
Some of them are different kinds of businesses, but they offer opportunity for more consistent, modelable, more consistent returns that you can more easily model and people will view as more durable. I believe that our business activities are durable through the cycle, and our job is to continue to perform and continue to prove it. And so I believe if we continue to do that over time, the discount that exists between the way our earnings are valued and the way others and our peers are valued should narrow. But we're going to continue -- we're going to continue to focus on serving our clients, growing these businesses, expanding the platforms. And my belief is the market will follow."

It's also enabling us to develop new products in credit like customized baskets and TRS strategies.

In the commodities business, I would say that we have broadly expanded our business to take account of greater product dispersion in commodities to play to a greater interest of expression in view by clients.

So let me talk a little bit about where we've seen loan growth now because I think it's reflective of the forward. So as I mentioned in my remarks, we're seeing loan growth in our PWM client channel where we extended about $4 billion of incremental lending in the quarter. It's a great feeder in the context of our engagement with clients and kind of a broader fee pool that's created by virtue of meeting the borrowings. And this is all very well credit placed in the context of the client set that's borrowing. We've seen more lending in the context of our Investment Banking business, much of that relating to transactional activity. Again, it bleeds out to a larger fee pool in the context of where we are. 
In Global Markets, we've seen ourselves, and I mentioned this in mortgages, around warehouse financing. So this is very liquid lending that I think takes on the proper credit profile in terms of what's there. So the positioning I'm speaking about is both a broader view about macro risk, about individual idiosyncratic risk in the sleeve in which we're lending and perhaps, more importantly, the returns that the firm takes in, in the context of lending into any one of those particular client segments."

We do view that buffer not simply as a defensive tool but rather an offensive tool where it leaves us with considerable dry powder in the deployment of capital when and if clients look to petition us for it. Actually, during the second quarter, that was true. We participated in AT&T and Medline, both of which were momentarily capital consumptive. The buffer enabled us to do that and engage. Just one obviously factual point, which is we're at 13 6 under SCB for this -- the third quarter. We go down to 13 4 in the fourth quarter relative to the most recent CCAR outcome. 
As it relates to share repurchase, I would only say what I said before, which is we've obviously taken the dividend up, reflective of our view about the forward durability of the performance of the firm, and we look to deploy capital at -- returns.

I'm joining you today from California, where we have been hosting one of our best-known client events, the Builders and Innovators Summit. We bring together over 100 of the most intriguing entrepreneurs in the world to exchange ideas and hear from thought leaders about how to build successful and enduring companies. I've heard from a number of them that they're extremely excited to meet with our team and with other entrepreneurs here in California. 
In addition, over the last few months, I've also been able to travel around to spend time with our employees and clients in person, which has been invigorating. In my conversations with clients and in the results we're reporting today, it's clear that our client franchise is on very solid footing. 
This quarter, we announced 2 acquisitions, a key pillar of the strategic vision that we laid out at our Investor Day in 2020 centered around diversifying our business mix toward more recurring revenues and durable earnings. There's no question that we have been successfully executing on our growth plans, and now we are further investing in the growth of the firm to accelerate our strategic evolution. 
First, in August, we announced the acquisition of a leading European asset manager and an investment partner. The addition of $320 billion in assets under supervision will help us achieve greater scale in our Asset Management platform, enhance our distribution network on the continent and bolster our ESG capabilities. 
On the topic of ESG, as world leaders prepared to convene in Glasgow later this month for COP 26, I would like to underscore the firm's commitment to working across our businesses to deliver on the goals of the Paris Agreement. This includes partnering with our clients to help drive climate transition and inclusive growth, and we're making progress toward our target of $750 billion in sustainable financing, investing and advisory activity to help achieve these goals. 
My view is that the businesses and markets need policy that supports the deliberate transition to a more sustainable future. This includes developing a mechanism to put a price on the cost of carbon. This transition is complex and won't happen overnight. It will require both the public and the private sectors to do their part. And given that fossil fuels will remain part of our energy mix for the near future, it is critical that we strike a balance between good public policy and recognizing the consequences of the supply constraints that we face. 
Our second acquisition was GreenSky which we announced in September. This transaction furthers our efforts to build the Consumer Banking platform of the future. It provides our consumer business with an attractive and high credit quality customer acquisition channel via an impressive network of over 10,000 merchants in a secularly growing market. It has a digital cloud-based infrastructure and product capabilities that are synergistic with our broader platform. And with the addition of our bank funding model, we expect to generate 20%-plus returns at scale through recurring fee-based and net interest income revenues. 
Importantly, these customers will be our customers. They will live in the market's ecosystem where we can holistically help them manage their financial lives. 
Turning to Page 1 of our presentation. We produced net revenues of $13.6 billion driven by year-on-year increases in 3 of our 4 business segments. On the bottom line, we delivered net earnings of $5.4 billion and quarterly earnings per share of $14.93. 
Our year-to-date revenues of nearly $47 billion and net earnings of over $17.5 billion are higher than any full year results in our history and drove an ROE of nearly 26% and an ROTE of over 27%. 
Our performance underscores the strength of our client franchise and a supportive market environment. 
In Investment Banking, we produced our second highest quarterly revenues. Our clients were extremely active. They turned to Goldman Sachs for our leading M&A franchise, driving strategic activity and associated financing to elevated levels. We delivered solid results in global markets as we continue to focus on market share and engage with clients on a broader array of solutions. 
In Asset Management, assets under supervision hit another record of $1.7 trillion, which will be further enhanced by the NNIP acquisition. We continue to transition our alternatives business to more third-party funds, and we have gained momentum as we spend a significant amount of time with new and existing institutional clients, raising $90 billion against our goal of $150 billion in gross fundraising commitments since our 2020 Investor Day. 
And in Consumer Wealth Management, we had a record quarter. In Wealth Management, we've seen strong long-term fee-based inflows in the first 9 months of the year and had big client wins in Ayco that give us the opportunity to serve employees at all levels of their organizations. 
In Consumer, we are now enabling 9 million customers to spend, borrow and save on a multiproduct platform. 
All in, our strong performance, tireless focus on our clients, and relentless execution of our strategy strengthened my confidence that we will continue to advance our strategic evolution and deliver higher, more durable returns for our shareholders. 
Let me now turn to Page 2. Broadly speaking, the current operating environment still has solid fundamentals, but there is increasing uncertainty around a number of factors. On the one hand, fiscal and monetary policy remain accommodative, and equity market is still near all-time highs. COVID-19 vaccination rates are rising around the world. I believe that we are likely past the worst of the pandemic effects on the global economy. And as technology behind the vaccines continues to improve, we will make further progress against the virus. 
That being said, there are a number of emerging areas of uncertainty we're paying close attention to. First, the trajectory of inflation, particularly wage inflation in the short term. Second, there remains significant uncertainty around the Delta variant. Third, there's ongoing political debate in the U.S. over economic policy, including the potential for additional infrastructure deals, the longer-term extension of the federal debt ceiling and tax increases. And fourth, the U.S.-China relationship remains complicated. 
Taken together, these items have the potential to be a headwind to growth. As further indicated by the downward revision and our economists' U.S. GDP expectations, earlier this week. Regardless of the market backdrop, I consistently hear from clients how much they value the high-quality service we provide, especially our differentiated advice and execution capabilities. As I look ahead, I remain optimistic about the opportunity set for Goldman Sachs and our ability to grow our firm. Activity levels remain high, particularly in investment banking and we have solid momentum in our asset management client business. 
Before I close, I would like to thank Stephen for his nearly 3 decades of service to the firm. I've had the privilege to work with Stephen since the early 2000s, and I couldn't be more grateful for his counsel and friendship over the last 20 years. 
In January, as we announced previously, Stephen will be succeeded by Denis Coleman, a 25-year veteran of Goldman Sachs, who has held numerous leadership positions within investment banking most recently as Co-Head of the Financing Group. I and Stephen have enjoyed a close working relationship for almost 20 years and are progressing toward a seamless transition in the CFO seat. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Stephen."

Good morning to all of you on the call. Before I turn to the results, let me say briefly that I have thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to work closely with all of you, our shareholders and the analyst community, over the past 3 years as CFO, and I am committed to facilitating a smooth handoff to Denis, who as Carey noted, has joined us on the call today. 
On our results, let me begin with our business performance by segment, starting on Page 4. I'm pleased to start with Investment Banking, which has continued to experience strong momentum and produced its second highest quarterly net revenues of $3.7 billion. The consistency of performance in investment banking is a reflection of both elevated market activity and increased market share in a client that has long enjoyed a leading competitive position. 
Financial advisory revenues of $1.6 billion were an all-time high. We maintained our #1 league table position for the year-to-date, participating in $1.4 trillion of announced transactions with a volume market share of 32%. The M&A activity was elevated across geographies and industry groups, with particular strength in TMT and health care and benefited from our strategic footprint expansion and our significant position with financial sponsors who remain exceptionally active in the market. 
Underwriting results were strong, notwithstanding more normalized activity relative to the very robust levels in the first half. Equity underwriting generated $1.2 billion in revenues, representing our fourth consecutive quarter with revenues in excess of $1 billion. We ranked #1 globally in equity underwriting for the year-to-date with volumes in excess of $110 billion across 570 deals. That represents volume market share of 10%. 
In debt underwriting, net revenues were $726 million, with performance supported by solid high-yield and investment-grade issuance as well as acquisition financing activity. Given the current levels of M&A announcements and continued healthy activity among financial sponsors, we expect acquisition financing activity to remain high. Despite significant levels of completed transactions, our Investment Banking backlog nonetheless ended the quarter significantly higher than year-end levels. 
Corporate lending results of $152 million reflected revenues from transaction banking, middle market lending and the relationship loan book, including associated hedges. In Transaction Banking, we achieved our 5-year goal of $50 billion in deposits this quarter, well ahead of the target date. As a key growth initiative for the firm with a very large addressable market, we continue to successfully access the breadth of our corporate client base in adding customers and driving higher engagement on the platform, which has exceeded expectations. We remain confident in the longer-term revenue target for this business of $1 billion. 
Moving to Global Markets on Page 5. Segment net revenues were $5.6 billion in the quarter, 23% higher year-on-year driven by healthy client activity, notably in Equities, and a generally supportive market-making environment, characterized by heightened volatility in certain areas. 
Results were also supported by recent market share gains across FICC and Equities. Global Markets again produced returns in excess of the target ROE expressed at our Investor Day, reflecting the strength of our franchise and ongoing attention to cost. 
Turning to Page 6. Our FICC businesses generated $2.5 billion of net revenues for the third quarter. The decline in FICC intermediation versus a year ago was the result of lower revenues in rates, credit and mortgages, offset by materially better performance in commodities and higher results in currencies. Activity increased into the end of the quarter with September proving to be a very strong month. Our commodities business continued to perform well amidst the heightened level of volatility in the business, including in oil, natural gas and power. FICC financing revenues of $513 million were the best in over a decade and were up meaningfully, driven by mortgage lending, consistent with our strategy. 
Total Equities revenues of $3.1 billion were very strong, helped by higher results in equities intermediation amid better performance in both derivatives and cash and record equities financing as we saw record average balances in prime and opportunities to extend liquidity to clients. 
Moving to Asset Management on Page 7. In the third quarter, we generated revenues of $2.3 billion. Management and other fees totaled $724 million, which were impacted by approximately $155 million of fee waivers on our money market funds. We again extended these waivers for clients, consistent with industry practice in this low rate environment. 
Equity investments produced net revenues of $935 million amid $1.6 billion of gains on our $16 billion private investment portfolio plus our consolidated investment entities, partially offset by $820 million in losses on our $4 billion public portfolio. Losses in the public portfolio were dominated by a few positions, which, by contrast, were material contributors to gains in the segment last quarter. Additionally, we had operating revenues of roughly $200 million related to our CIE portfolio. 
Staying with Asset Management, Page 8, again, provides disclosure on the composition of our equity and debt positions by vintage, region and, where relevant, accounting treatment. On Page 9, we show a longer time series of disclosure regarding the progress made in harvesting our on-balance sheet investments. Since our 2020 Investor Day, we have actively harvested positions of $16 billion. which have been partially offset by markups on the portfolio of $9 billion and additions of $5 billion, which include early fund facilitation and other commitments. 
The implied capital associated with total dispositions across both private and public equity positions since our 2020 Investor Day is approximately $8 billion. We continue to have line of sight on $2.8 billion of incremental private asset sales corresponding to $2 billion of capital reduction. We remain focused on the execution of this strategy and meeting our capital target for the segment. To this end, we sold over $1 billion of CIE portfolio during the quarter and also disposed of $2 billion of private positions. 
Moving to Page 10. Consumer and Wealth Management produced record revenues of $2 billion in the third quarter. In Wealth Management, very strong long-term fee-based inflows for the year-to-date helped drive record management and other fees of $1.2 billion, which rose 10% versus the second quarter and 28% year-on-year. Incentive fees of $121 million largely reflected the recognition of overrides in certain of our investment funds. Private banking and lending revenues of $292 million rose 12% with loans to private wealth clients up $2 billion sequentially, as demand for lending products remains high amid the low rate environment. I would add that we view private bank lending as an integral part of our wealth offering with room for further growth based on the needs of our clients and our current penetration rates as well as the strong credit standing of this client base. 
Consumer Banking revenues were $382 million in the quarter, reflecting higher credit card loans and deposit balances year-over-year. We expect loan growth to accelerate in 2022 given the pending acquisitions of GreenSky and the General Motors credit card portfolio and continued expansion in our existing product set. 
Looking across these 2 segments, Page 11 shows our firm-wide assets under supervision and management and other fees. We have been building these businesses steadily and total AUS now stands at a record $2.4 trillion, putting us in the top 5 of both active managers and alternative asset managers globally. This growth has driven higher firmwide management and other fees, which rose 16% year-over-year to a record $1.9 billion. 
On Page 12, we address net interest income and our lending portfolio across all segments. Total firm-wide NII was $1.6 billion for the third quarter, higher versus a year ago, reflecting lower funding expenses and an increase in interest-earning assets. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $143 billion, up $12 billion sequentially, reflecting increases across the portfolio. Corresponding provision for credit losses of $175 million reflected portfolio growth. 
On Page 13, you see our total quarterly operating expenses of $6.6 billion. Our efficiency ratio for the year-to-date stands at 52.8%, reflecting our ability to exhibit operating leverage while maintaining a pay-for-performance culture and investing for growth. Our year-to-date non-compensation expenses were down 17% but up 11% ex litigation, while our compensation expenses were up 34% on a year-to-date basis. 
Turning to capital on Slide 14. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.1% at the end of the third quarter; under the standardized approach, down 30 basis points sequentially. Despite higher capital on solid earnings generation, the decline was driven largely by a $43 billion increase in RWAs, partially reflecting revisions to RWA calculations based on regulatory feedback in the quarter. 
In the quarter, we returned a total of $1.7 billion to shareholders including common stock repurchases of $1 billion and $700 million in common stock dividends. Consistent with our capital management philosophy, we will prioritize deploying capital for our client franchise at attractive returns and then return any excess to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. 
In conclusion, we delivered another quarter of strong performance, reflecting the diversification and strength of our client franchise. Additionally, we announced 2 acquisitions that will enhance both our Asset Management and Consumer businesses and increased the firm's recurring revenue stream. Looking forward, the overall opportunity set remains attractive across the firm as we continue to execute on our strategy where we are building towards a path to sustainable mid-teens returns. 
With that, we'll now open up the line for questions."

So let me start kind of with a reiteration of our standing capital policy. As you know, our priority is to deploy capital in the business on behalf of clients and to do that, especially when returns are as attractive as they have been. So in",465,"Sure, Glenn. So let me start kind of with a reiteration of our standing capital policy. As you know, our priority is to deploy capital in the business on behalf of clients and to do that, especially when returns are as attractive as they have been. So in a quarter where we produce 22.5% ROE, it's reason and consistent with that, that we deploy the capital in the business. 
I'd also point out that in the dividend, our dividend is now at $2 a share, up from $1.25. So on an annual basis, we're returning an additional $1 billion or so to shareholders through the dividend. And where we exhaust opportunities that prove to be attractive, we'll return capital back, and that really represents what we do in terms of share repurchase. 
Now in terms of the opportunity set, you referred into the Consumer business. It's unquestionably a priority. David has reflected time and again, the long-term view we have about how that business can grow and be accretive to the firm. But I would say that the deployment of capital knows not one segment nor one opportunity. It is a broad look across the firm. And we think always about how do we add in an agile way, deploy capital across the whole of the business. So I wouldn't necessarily say that it's targeted against anyone in particular. 
Obviously, we're operating at a higher SCB, a higher minimum requirement pursuant to the Fed, therefore, surplus is less. And we, consistent with the policy, always look forward to what will be, in effect, a petition on capital that we know. SACCR is certainly one of them. And in that regard, while we've not made a formal decision on implementation and we'll let our regulators know when we do, we're looking forward to that. And our view is that when we put SACCR in place, it will increase our RWAs by about $15 billion or tax our ratio by about 30 basis points. 
It is at that level, in part because as we look back when SACCR was finalized by Basel in '14 and then adopted by the Fed in '18 and '19, we began then to kind of proactively mitigate the effect. So the implementation now reflects mitigation progress we've made in anticipation of it as opposed to kind of a starting workstream. And obviously, the work was assembling data and understanding where appropriate netting pursuant through the rules could play out. But I think that's a reflection of a proactive engagement so as to minimize the impact to capital and ratio now relative to what it would have been. And so sorry for the long answer, but that gives you kind of a complete picture, if you will, of how we're thinking about capital."

But where we are right now, comp to net revenue net of provision for credit loss is at 31% through 9 months. That was at 34% when we ended the second quarter. 
We always reserve for compensation consistent with what's required of us, which is what do we think we need to pay the firm consistent with performance as at that date. Obviously, there's a quarter to go. So we're at a 31% ratio, revenue net of provision for credit loss. 
You can see through 9 months in the comp and benefits line, not to confuse the 2 numbers, that number is up 34%, again reflecting the performance of the business and a pay-for-performance philosophy more broadly. That 34% is obviously to be measured against revenues that are up 42% year-to-date and revenues net of provisions up 56%. So you can see the comp leverage that exists even when we are provisioning for what we believe to be a healthy and robust comp process. 
I think, overall, if you look at total operating expenses, because we look at it that way, including our noncomp expense, there continues to be the exhibition of leverage, operating leverage in the business. Again, revenue is up 42%, but total operating expenses ex litigation are up 24%. And so this just gives you a sense of the leverage in operating expenses broadly and in comp specifically. But maybe David wants to comment just on the philosophy."

Congratulations and definitely will be very big shoes to fill for sure. So my first question here is on the digital consumer bank. That business continues to do very well. I think year-to-date, revenue growth is an impressive 30%, but that still lags some of the pure-play neobanks out there. And some of that might just be a function of product holes, [indiscernible] checking payment functions and investment functions and Marcus a little bit light. So curious here how you think about the product road map from here for Marcus, the potential to use M&A to fill some of those product gaps. And then longer term, how should we think about sort of sustainable revenue growth for that business?"

But we -- this is -- Christian, this is something that we're focused on over the long term. I think we've built an excellent platform. From a standing start of 0, in 5 years, we've built a very, very significant depository institution with over $100 billion of digital deposits, no branches, very small marketing budget or customer acquisition costs. The cost of the infrastructure that holds and drives those deposits is very, very efficient vis-a-vis other models. 
We have 9 million customers that we're servicing right now. We have our own credit card platform that I think is really differentiated, and we're onboarding both other partnerships, but also have the opportunity for a proprietary card that's in development. We've talked publicly about adding digital checking to the portfolio during 2022, and that is on track and it's expanding. GreenSky allows us to broadly expand our point-of-sale capability. And as was highlighted in the starting comments, their tech platform, the cloud-based technology integrates very seamlessly into what we're doing. And so we feel very good about the fact that we're going to continue to grow this and build a consequential business. 
We have a long-term view with it. I'm not going to comment on a revenue growth percentage. Unlike a lot of the fintechs that are simply trying to look at a revenue growth model, we're looking to build a sustainable business that contributes durable recurring earnings to Goldman Sachs over time and to compound that. And we do believe that if we serve clients well in a seamless way with good technology, it will continue to grow, and we will do that. 
I don't know, Stephen, if you have anything else you think should be added."

We're now coming back to sort of turn that back on having seen the portfolio perform very well. 
So year-over-year, revenues in Consumer are up 23% in the deposit line. They're up 54% in credit cards, and that's just a reflection of the renewed commitment that David is reflecting to sort of growing out that business and seeing it perform. 
And I think David's comments are spot on. If you look at loans and savings and Apple Card soon to be joined by General Motors, the investing module and checking, this is not -- what's coming in to focus is a big, broad platform that can serve customers in all of their needs as opposed to where we began in kind of a bespoke product set.

I don't -- I think it's a really important part and highlight of what we've been executing on in the context of the strategy that we laid out when we went back to Investor Day. And so I think there are a couple of things that we've tried to do very differently over the last few years to strengthen the position of this business. And I think they're accruing results that will be quite sticky. And I don't want to say that the share gains are going to continue at this pace because they won't. We know that, but we've positioned the business much, much better for, I think, 2 principal reasons. 
Number one, the business has been much more focused on having a client-centric One GS culture to really figure out how to serve the needs of our clients in a very holistic way. The business has been less transactional, more long-term-focused on the client relationship and the level of client service while bringing to bear the market-making, provisioning and financing capabilities of the firm that we have. And I'm hearing repeatedly from clients that they see a real switch in the way we're operating the business, and it's accruing to market share gains. It's benefiting us in that context. 
Number two, we were never an organization that focused on financing our clients as a business segment that we could meaningfully grow and target. And so since the Investor Day, we targeted our ability to grow our finance capability across both Equities and FICC, and we've succeeded on that, and that's a place where we've taken market share. And that is more durable share, obviously, and we continue to think there are opportunities that we can continue to prosecute on the financing side, and that's different. 
I would also highlight that we've been making significant investments in technology, and we have the scale and have developed platforms that enhance the competitive position that we have with clients. And I think one of the things that's happening broadly is the leading players here, given the test necessity, have an advantage to secondary or tertiary players. And so we're benefiting from that also. 
Now there's no question, this is a very conducive environment the performance in that business. And we're not sitting here saying this level of performance will continue. But I think that the way we're running the business, the focus we've made certainly takes us a step function up from where we were in 2019. I'd also say, as part of our Investor Day, we were focused on efficiencies in operating that business. And so even if we went back to a different level, we're at a higher hurdle return rate in the business at lower levels. And so we feel very good about the way the business is positioned."

And I think you're right, we're at a moment in time where the activity levels are quite high. 
First, on fundraising, I'd just say that one of the reasons why we got very focused a few years ago on -- in a much more organized way growing our third-party capital and building institutional relationships to add to our alternatives platform is because there really is secular growth in the context of capital allocation into alternatives. And you get out and you get around the world, whether it's governments and sovereign wealth funds or broad institutions, all of them or a broad array of them are increasing their allocation to alternatives. 
I think in addition, there's no question that we're in a position -- the world is in a position where retail participation through wealthy individuals is broadly expanding in the alternative space. And so there's more access being offered to wealthy individuals. We've always had a distribution channel with ultra wealthy individuals, but that access is broadening more significantly. 
And so I do think we have a number of years ahead of broad secular growth in terms of the capital allocation onto these broad global alternatives platforms. I think we're very well positioned for that. And so that's helping us in the context of our fundraising as we highlighted. 
With respect to deal activity, there's a lot of dry powder out there. I would note that sponsor activity in M&A was a much higher percentage of activity this quarter than it's been over the last few years. And in the past, when sponsor activity has increased, it runs for a while, but then ultimately, there'll be something that backs it off. 
We're watching the velocity of our lending activity into that sponsor activity very carefully, thinking very carefully about risk management around that. It feels at the moment given the continued accommodative monetary and fiscal policy environment and the reacceleration of the economy coming out of the pandemic that this will run for some while, but that's also something that we're going to watch very carefully because it won't sustain at this pace will certainly be speed bumps along the way."

We know they get very punitive treatment in CCAR, but -- and this is a high-class problem, shrinking the investments, at least on a net basis has proven rather difficult and remains stubbornly above that $20 billion level. How much smaller does the book need to get in order to meaningfully reduce your SCB? And is that 13% to 13.5% CET1 target still the appropriate long-term bogey just given some of the stubbornly high equity investments that have persisted for the better part of a couple of years now?"

Our strongly held view is that 13% to 13.5% is the right place for this firm to operate. Now our ability to get there is obviously frustrated by what the Fed is otherwise requiring of us in the context of CCAR and SCB. 
So in that context, what we can do and what we are doing is candidly taking action into our own hands, meaning we're not waiting for [indiscernible] to be well received in order that the requirement comes down. But instead, we're pivoting and moving from balance sheet into fund format. 
I think if you look at the Page 9 in our deck, what you'll see is what's happened in terms of $16 billion of dispositions and what that has meant for AE free-up. So I'll just give you a sense of it. 
In the last 9 months, we've seen reduction in balance sheet of $8.9 billion, corresponding to $4.6 billion of AE. Since Investor Day, $16.2 billion of reduction in balance sheet and $8.3 billion of freed AE, and we have line of sight from where we sit to about $2.8 billion of balance sheet reduction, freeing up about $2 billion of AE. 
I give you all those numbers because you can see the magnitude of the activity that's been going on that will continue. And we had always focused in on whether or not at Investor Day, we would experience a bit of a canyon, if you will, of revenue, meaning we would see balance sheet reduction come off at a quicker pace, faster slope than what might have been a yawning line, if you will, to fundraising and deployment. That's not happening. 
As David has said, we have $90 billion of fundraising, which -- and underlying that is about $50 billion of AUS, which is fee paying. And so that transition is being managed well, and this just gives you a sense of the overall capital reduction in the context of what we're trying to achieve."

If you just look at segment by segment, you look at growth in our financing activity in investment banking that supports our M&A franchise, you look at financing that's going on in the context of both FICC and Equities that were up year-on-year and that David was reflecting in the answer to his question around kind of sustainability and the forward in our trading business, and so a good deal of this is balance sheet in support of clients. 
I would point out though that in the context of growing balance sheet, it doesn't grow in isolation, meaning we have various risk metrics that are in place. Capital has obviously grown. Liquidity maintained at the firm obviously grows in the form of our GCLA, and so all of these, I think, are meant to be read in tandem in the context of serving clients, but doing that in a way where balance sheet growth is held in the context of various risk, be it capital and liquidity profile of the firm itself. 
We're not -- we are not a bank, notwithstanding the fact that we have strategically grown our deposit base that are experiencing the kind of outsized growth in deposits that you're seeing or that you have seen at the bigger commercial banks. And that is inflating balance sheet there. We're not seeing that kind of inflation frankly, in part because this is a new platform for us and a strategic pivot in terms of very usable deposits as a substitute for wholesale funding."

You're right, at any point in time, that mix could change, and we wouldn't see the same robust amount of client activity, but we have fundamental growth in markets. We have fundamental growth and economic activity around the world. And that, over periods of time, grows long-term growth in these business platforms. 
So I certainly would say we're running a very, very robust capital markets activity in the Investment Banking franchise at the moment. But I'd also say, whenever things slow down or rebalance a little, we're going to find that these businesses are baseline fundamentally larger than they were 5 years ago because of the growth in market cap of the world and the growth in economic activity in the world. 
And so we've always said that there's a real correlation to economic activity to our activity. There's a real correlation in market cap growth to our activity. Obviously, these things will ebb and flow, but we have lots of flexibility in the context of the way we manage the businesses. And these businesses, I think, will continue to be strong performers even in different environments. They just might not perform at this level all the time."

I think there are opportunities for us around the Wealth Management business, in particular, in Europe, and we've been focused on that. I think there are wealth management opportunities for us in the U.S. as we move from simply managing money with ultra high net worth clientele that have been our traditional PWM business to a more mass affluent structure and using digital technology and expanding the use of Ayco. China is another place where there's opportunity for us from a wealth management perspective.

At a high level, we're spending significantly technology to expand the platforms that we operate on, to better connect to our clients and to enable us, obviously, to operate more efficiently. We're performing very well at the moment, but our commitment to continuing to uplift our broad background and to put more of our businesses into the cloud for a variety of reasons, which I'll highlight in just a second, I think, is something that we've been very focused on strategically and it continues, but we're in the middle of the execution path. Historically, developers at the firm have used their own physical data centers to build and host technology. And cloud adoption really enables innovation by allowing talent that we have all across the organization to focus their time where it really matters and to be able to much more directly create services and applications that can directly service our clients' needs rather than doing what I call as undifferentiated kind of heavy lifting tech build that manage what was more traditional tech infrastructure. 
The cloud really provides low-friction access to technologies such as big data, machine learning analytics, which enables us to continuously deliver products to meet the growing demand that our clients have as they want to connect with us. And it's allowing us to accelerate some of the initiatives we have, and you highlighted some of them, like Transaction Banking and some of the things we're doing on the Marcus platform. And so there's no question that there are real efficiencies for us that are coming out of that. 
We know that the cloud is not everything, and so there are some services. And I'll give you an example like high-frequency trading that are better served on-premise, and so we clearly operate in a hybrid environment. And we also choose our partners in kind of a multi-cloud or what we call a poly-cloud strategy so that we can take the best-of-breed offerings that each of these different technology platforms have and allow that to better leverage what we can do for our clients. 
So overall, we're in this journey that's very, very intentional. It's aligned with our strategic objectives of delivering better services to our clients and operating the firm more efficiently, and I think we're getting real benefit from it in the execution of our strategy, but I think there's more upside in that as we continue to build the financial cloud, so to speak for some of our principal businesses.

So excluding litigation, so just looking at the core non-comp expense, year-to-date is up 11%. If you look at the gross expense that, that represents, about 1/3 of that increase is related to technology. So about 1/3 of the increase of non-compensation expense in the firm through the first 9 months relates to technology. And this is spent all across the firm. So it's both, in particular, initiatives like consumer, TXB, Marquee, but equally, it's spent broadly on the broader uplift of platforms in and around the firm. Cloud-based engineering is one that David brought to your attention. 
In all of these spends, we sweat the ROI of this investment. And so as an example, part of the uplift will enable us to create greater opportunity for automation, which will play out as a return across the whole of the firm. So I just offer that to you just to give you some sort of dimension, if you will, from a true expense line as to what David was otherwise describing."

And as we've said, that's now become about 25% operational, so of value to us. But just to come back to your question about the cloud, so the TXB business was built entirely in the cloud. I don't know that I would necessarily conclude that, that is why it's been successful. I would conclude, however, that it is how it's been built on a very cost-efficient basis and built with a level of security that I think satisfies us and our client base, meaning I think it's a draw card in the context of it. 
The reason, Mike, is kind of self-evident, which is that it's built in the cloud. As David noted, it's not built with multiple instances of the Transaction Banking platform across redundant data centers. It benefits without necessarily costing us to sort of improve security upgrades to sort of technology and the like. That is the benefit of sitting within the cloud itself. 
So I can't tell you that I could draw a line to the deposits that have come in. I can tell you that we built it better, cheaper and on a more attractive basis to facilitate client attention and attraction to it."

And part of the reason, as Stephen highlighted, we could do that so quickly was because it's easier to build on the cloud and transition. But fundamentally, this is an example of us seeing an opportunity to build a digital platform that took friction out of an activity that was deeply embedded in our corporate clients. As a user of that activity, we saw that experience, and we saw that there were ways that, that experience could be improved, and we've built a platform that delivers a better experience. 
And that's why it's succeeding. That's why it's meeting targets and continuing to grow, and that's why we're very optimistic. Stephen laid out to you $1 billion of revenue. We're confident in that target. And this business has margin in it and will be a good contributor. And so we're very confident about how we'll continue to execute.

But first, it's a very different company as an independent public company than it is as a platform inside Goldman Sachs. And one of the big weaknesses of the company as an independent public company is it didn't have a funding model, and it had to fund differently inside Goldman Sachs, where we have funding and attractive funding that becomes a technology platform that allows us to connect to a very attractive base of customers that we can pull into the Marcus ecosystem. 
I think the merchant network that they've developed, we have over 10,000 merchants and they developed over 15 years is extremely valuable. And then the work we did to try to have a point-of-sale merchant network and look at that, we think it would have taken us close to 10 years to develop a similar network. And so the ability to acquire that network bring a very, very high-quality customers. These are customers that own homes. These are customers that have high FICO scores, very, very attractive into Goldman Sachs. It allowed us to do something that fits seamlessly into our platform and allowed us to expand the point-of-sale activities that we were doing. 
And so we feel very, very good about it. And we think that this acquisition will consistently deliver 20%-plus returns on the activity that it generates."

We laid out a strategy that said we would continue to invest in our core businesses to grow market share and increase their positioning. I think we've done that. There's still some opportunities to continue to do that. But we highlighted a handful of areas where we saw opportunities to grow and expand our competitive position while also increasing the mix of durable fee-based revenues into the business. 
And when you look at those areas, it's Transaction Banking, it's Asset Management, it's Wealth Management and it's our digital consumer bank. And so as we look forward, I still think there are opportunities to grow all 4 of those areas. I think we can continue to grow them organically. But when there are opportunities to make an acquisition that can accelerate our competitive position and our growth in one of those areas, we're going to take a hard look at it. 
As I've said before, the bar for us to do something very significant is extraordinarily high. I think there are still opportunities. There may be opportunities in the coming years for us to do things that can accelerate those areas, but we are focused on those 4 areas because those 4 areas diversify the durability of our revenues and allow us to continue to grow a more durable and consistent earnings stream. And so that's the frame that we'll continue to look at. I wouldn't point to anything more specifically."

But I'll go back to some of the things that we said at Investor Day that kind of geared or stored our focus on this. 
We've been in these businesses for a long time, and we actually have something that I think is very differentiated in that we have a truly broad global product offering that is relatively built out and has been built out for a number of years. We have positions in private equity, in growth equity, in credit, in real estate, in infrastructure. And we also have them globally around the world. And when you look at a lot of the freestanding firms, there are some that have that broad array, but very few have all the products on a global basis the way we're set up. 
What was differentiated or different about our business and alternatives before we roll it together and got it focused is, generally, our LP relationships came through our private wealth network, and we have raised an enormous amount of money through our private wealth network, including the partners of the firm. While we had some institutional LP relationships, we had not really been a large institutional funder into this business platform. And given our relationship with a lot of these institutions broadly from other activities, we knew that if we took a One GS approach at really taking a long-term view in building relationships with those institutional partners, we could grow our partnership with them. 
So a big part of the growth opportunity has been adding new LPs to our ecosystem. And if you look at strategic solutions, which we raised last year, there were a number of -- probably a dozen new significant institutional LPs that the first time they were coming on to our platform was in that strategic solutions fund. So I think there's a big opportunity for us to continue to expand that. It's something we're very focused on. But the opportunity for us is less in product addition, although we are adding products. We've just raised the Horizon Fund, which is an ESG centered funds will allow us to allocate capital into certain climate technologies, and we'll add other product capabilities that we think are interesting, but our focus is on meaningfully using the Goldman Sachs platform and the broad institutional relationships we have to really meaningfully expand the list of institutional LPs that are partnered with us, and I think we have a lot of upside to run on that."

What we're doing in building a digital consumer bank is also relying on this. 
The broader digital ecosystem, I think, is in early stages. I think we're a version 1.0. I think you'll continue to see a lot of disruption on traditional ways of financial services are delivered and consumed. I think big competitive platforms will continue to be a place where more financial services are intermediated. I think there are lots of complications around the regulatory structure and how the regulatory structure will ultimately manage some of this as the technology allows for more disruption.

So we've seen Fed funds come down from the time of Investor Day, I don't know, I want to say about 150 basis points, maybe a little more. The consequence of that is that the value of deposits -- the economic value of deposits is not as rich now as we had imagined back at Investor Day. But equally in the context of an expectation of rising interest rates, we'll see a return to the value of those deposits otherwise modeled out. And therefore, on the forward rate curve, our view is that we'll be able to achieve that $1 billion revenue target. 
I'd point out that of the $50 billion, more of them are operational. That's sort of step on to achieving the value of that. And that has been a big quarter-on-quarter increase from about 14% the last quarter. 
And I think more broadly, in Transaction Banking, about 2/3 of the revenue from the time we modeled it through now is correlated to deposit intake with the balance around FX and other fees. And so as we see interest rates come back, the value of those deposits will as well."

I'm joining you today from California, where we have been hosting one of our best-known client events, the Builders + Innovators Summit. We bring together over 100 of the most intriguing entrepreneurs in the world to exchange ideas and hear from thought leaders about how to build successful and enduring companies. I've heard from a number of them that they're extremely excited to meet with our team and with other entrepreneurs here in California. 
In addition, over the last few months, I've also been able to travel around to spend time with our employees and clients in person, which has been invigorating. In my conversations with clients and in the results we're reporting today, it's clear that our client franchise is on very solid footing. 
This quarter, we announced 2 acquisitions, a key pillar of the strategic vision that we laid out at our Investor Day in 2020 centered around diversifying our business mix toward more recurring revenues and durable earnings. There's no question that we have been successfully executing on our growth plans, and now we are further investing in the growth of the firm to accelerate our strategic evolution. 
First, in August, we announced the acquisition of a leading European asset manager, NN Investment Partners. The addition of $320 billion in assets under supervision will help us achieve greater scale in our Asset Management platform, enhance our distribution network on the continent and bolster our ESG capabilities. 
On the topic of ESG, as world leaders prepare to convene in Glasgow later this month for COP26, I would like to underscore the firm's commitment to working across our businesses to deliver on the goals of the Paris Agreement. This includes partnering with our clients to help drive climate transition and inclusive growth, and we're making progress toward our target of $750 billion in sustainable financing, investing and advisory activity to help achieve these goals. 
My view is that the businesses and markets need policy that supports the deliberate transition to a more sustainable future. This includes developing a mechanism to put a price on the cost of carbon. This transition is complex and won't happen overnight. It will require both the public and the private sectors to do their part. And given that fossil fuels will remain part of our energy mix for the near future, it is critical that we strike a balance between good public policy and recognizing the consequences of the supply constraints that we face. 
Our second acquisition was GreenSky, which we announced in September. This transaction furthers our efforts to build the consumer banking platform of the future. It provides our Consumer business with an attractive and high credit quality customer acquisition channel via an impressive network of over 10,000 merchants in a secularly growing market. It has a digital cloud-based infrastructure and product capabilities that are synergistic with our broader platform. And with the addition of our bank funding model, we expect to generate 20%-plus returns at scale through recurring fee-based and net interest income revenues. 
Importantly, these customers will be our customers. They will live in the market's ecosystem where we can holistically help them manage their financial lives. 
Turning to Page 1 of our presentation. We produced net revenues of $13.6 billion, driven by year-on-year increases in 3 of our 4 business segments. On the bottom line, we delivered net earnings of $5.4 billion and quarterly earnings per share of $14.93. 
Our year-to-date revenues of nearly $47 billion and net earnings of over $17.5 billion are higher than any full year results in our history and drove an ROE of nearly 26% and an ROTE of over 27%. 
Our performance underscores the strength of our client franchise and a supportive market environment. 
In Investment Banking, we produced our second highest quarterly revenues. Our clients were extremely active. They turned to Goldman Sachs for our leading M&A franchise, driving strategic activity and associated financing to elevated levels. We delivered solid results in Global Markets as we continue to focus on market share and engage with clients on a broader array of solutions. 
In Asset Management, assets under supervision hit another record of $1.7 trillion, which will be further enhanced by the NNIP acquisition. We continue to transition our alternatives business to more third-party funds, and we have gained momentum as we spend a significant amount of time with new and existing institutional clients, raising $90 billion against our goal of $150 billion in gross fundraising commitments since our 2020 Investor Day. 
And in Consumer & Wealth Management, we had a record quarter. In Wealth Management, we've seen strong, long-term fee-based inflows in the first 9 months of the year and had big client wins in Ayco that give us the opportunity to serve employees at all levels of their organizations. 
In Consumer, we are now enabling 9 million customers to spend, borrow and save on a multiproduct platform. 
All in, our strong performance, tireless focus on our clients and relentless execution of our strategy strengthen my confidence that we will continue to advance our strategic evolution and deliver higher, more durable returns for our shareholders. 
Let me now turn to Page 2. Broadly speaking, the current operating environment still has solid fundamentals, but there is increasing uncertainty around a number of factors. On the one hand, fiscal and monetary policy remain accommodative, and equity market is still near all-time highs. COVID-19 vaccination rates are rising around the world. I believe that we are likely past the worst of the pandemic's effects on the global economy. And as technology behind the vaccines continues to improve, we will make further progress against the virus. 
That being said, there are a number of emerging areas of uncertainty we're paying close attention to. First, the trajectory of inflation, particularly wage inflation in the short term. Second, there remains significant uncertainty around the Delta variant. Third, there's ongoing political debate in the U.S. over economic policy, including the potential for additional infrastructure deals, the longer-term extension of the federal debt ceiling and tax increases. And fourth, the U.S.-China relationship remains complicated. 
Taken together, these items have the potential to be a headwind to growth. As further indicated by the downward revision and our economists' U.S. GDP expectations, earlier this week. Regardless of the market backdrop, I consistently hear from clients how much they value the high-quality service we provide, especially our differentiated advice and execution capabilities. As I look ahead, I remain optimistic about the opportunity set for Goldman Sachs and our ability to grow our firm. Activity levels remain high, particularly in investment banking and we have solid momentum in our Asset Management client business. 
Before I close, I would like to thank Stephen for his nearly 3 decades of service to the firm. I've had the privilege to work with Stephen since the early 2000s, and I couldn't be more grateful for his counsel and friendship over the last 20 years. 
In January, as we announced previously, Stephen will be succeeded by Denis Coleman, a 25-year veteran of Goldman Sachs, who has held numerous leadership positions within investment banking most recently as Co-Head of the Financing Group. He and Stephen have enjoyed a close working relationship for almost 20 years and are progressing toward a seamless transition in the CFO seat. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Stephen."

Good morning to all of you on the call. Before I turn to the results, let me say briefly that I have thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to work closely with all of you, our shareholders and the analyst community over the past 3 years as CFO, and I am committed to facilitating a smooth handoff to Denis, who as Carey noted, has joined us on the call today. 
On our results, let me begin with our business performance by segment, starting on Page 4. I'm pleased to start with Investment Banking, which has continued to experience strong momentum and produced its second highest quarterly net revenues of $3.7 billion. The consistency of performance in Investment Banking is a reflection of both elevated market activity and increased market share in a client that has long enjoyed a leading competitive position. 
Financial advisory revenues of $1.6 billion were an all-time high. We maintained our #1 league table position for the year-to-date, participating in $1.4 trillion of announced transactions with a volume market share of 32%. M&A activity was elevated across geographies and industry groups, with particular strength in TMT and health care and benefited from our strategic footprint expansion and our significant position with financial sponsors who remain exceptionally active in the market. 
Underwriting results were strong, notwithstanding more normalized activity relative to the very robust levels in the first half. Equity underwriting generated $1.2 billion in revenues, representing our fourth consecutive quarter with revenues in excess of $1 billion. We ranked #1 globally in equity underwriting for the year-to-date, with volumes in excess of $110 billion across 570 deals. That represents volume market share of 10%. 
In debt underwriting, net revenues were $726 million, with performance supported by solid high-yield and investment-grade issuance as well as acquisition financing activity. Given the current levels of M&A announcements and continued healthy activity among financial sponsors, we expect acquisition financing activity to remain high. Despite significant levels of completed transactions, our Investment Banking backlog nonetheless ended the quarter significantly higher than year-end levels. 
Corporate lending results of $152 million reflected revenues from transaction banking, middle market lending and the relationship loan book, including associated hedges. In Transaction Banking, we achieved our 5-year goal of $50 billion in deposits this quarter, well ahead of the target date. As a key growth initiative for the firm with a very large addressable market, we continue to successfully access the breadth of our corporate client base in adding customers and driving higher engagement on the platform, which has exceeded expectations. We remain confident in the longer-term revenue target for this business of $1 billion. 
Moving to Global Markets on Page 5. Segment net revenues were $5.6 billion in the quarter, 23% higher year-on-year driven by healthy client activity, notably in Equities and a generally supportive market-making environment, characterized by heightened volatility in certain areas. 
Results were also supported by recent market share gains across FICC and Equities. Global Markets again produced returns in excess of the target ROE expressed at our Investor Day, reflecting the strength of our franchise and ongoing attention to cost. 
Turning to Page 6. Our FICC businesses generated $2.5 billion of net revenues for the third quarter. The decline in FICC intermediation versus a year ago was the result of lower revenues in rates, credit and mortgages, offset by materially better performance in commodities and higher results in currencies. Activity increased into the end of the quarter with September proving to be a very strong month. Our commodities business continued to perform well amidst the heightened level of volatility in the business, including in oil, natural gas and power. FICC financing revenues of $513 million were the best in over a decade and were up meaningfully, driven by mortgage lending, consistent with our strategy. 
Total Equities revenues of $3.1 billion were very strong, helped by higher results in equities intermediation, amid better performance in both derivatives and cash and record equities financing as we saw record average balances in prime and opportunities to extend liquidity to clients. 
Moving to Asset Management on Page 7. In the third quarter, we generated revenues of $2.3 billion. Management and other fees totaled $724 million, which were impacted by approximately $155 million of fee waivers on our money market funds. We again extended these waivers for clients, consistent with industry practice in this low rate environment. 
Equity investments produced net revenues of $935 million amid $1.6 billion of gains on our $16 billion private investment portfolio plus our consolidated investment entities, partially offset by $820 million in losses on our $4 billion public portfolio. Losses in the public portfolio were dominated by a few positions, which by contrast, were material contributors to gains in the segment last quarter. Additionally, we had operating revenues of roughly $200 million related to our CIE portfolio. 
Staying with Asset Management, Page 8, again, provides disclosure on the composition of our equity and debt positions by vintage, region and, where relevant, accounting treatment. 
On Page 9, we show a longer time series of disclosure regarding the progress made in harvesting our on-balance sheet investments. Since our 2020 Investor Day, we have actively harvested positions of $16 billion, which have been partially offset by markups on the portfolio of $9 billion and additions of $5 billion, which include early fund facilitation and other commitments. 
The implied capital associated with total dispositions across both private and public equity positions since our 2020 Investor Day is approximately $8 billion. We continue to have line of sight on $2.8 billion of incremental private asset sales corresponding to $2 billion of capital reduction. We remain focused on the execution of this strategy and meeting our capital target for the segment. To this end, we sold over $1 billion of CIE portfolio during the quarter and also disposed of $2 billion of private positions. 
Moving to Page 10. Consumer and Wealth Management produced record revenues of $2 billion in the third quarter. In Wealth Management, very strong, long-term fee-based inflows for the year-to-date helped drive record management and other fees of $1.2 billion, which rose 10% versus the second quarter and 28% year-on-year. Incentive fees of $121 million largely reflected the recognition of overrides in certain of our investment funds. Private banking and lending revenues of $292 million rose 12%, with loans to private wealth clients up $2 billion sequentially, as demand for lending products remains high amid the low rate environment. I would add that we view private bank lending as an integral part of our wealth offering, with room for further growth based on the needs of our clients and our current penetration rates as well as the strong credit standing of this client base. 
Consumer banking revenues were $382 million in the quarter, reflecting higher credit card loans and deposit balances year-over-year. We expect loan growth to accelerate in 2022 given the pending acquisitions of GreenSky and the General Motors credit card portfolio and continued expansion in our existing product set. 
Looking across these 2 segments, Page 11 shows our firmwide assets under supervision and management and other fees. We have been building these businesses steadily and total AUS now stands at a record $2.4 trillion, putting us in the top 5 of both active managers and alternative asset managers globally. This growth has driven higher firmwide management and other fees, which rose 16% year-over-year to a record $1.9 billion. 
On Page 12, we address net interest income and our lending portfolio across all segments. Total firmwide NII was $1.6 billion for the third quarter, higher versus a year ago, reflecting lower funding expenses and an increase in interest-earning assets. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $143 billion, up $12 billion sequentially, reflecting increases across the portfolio. Corresponding provision for credit losses of $175 million reflected portfolio growth. 
On Page 13, you see our total quarterly operating expenses of $6.6 billion. Our efficiency ratio for the year-to-date stands at 52.8%, reflecting our ability to exhibit operating leverage while maintaining a pay-for-performance culture and investing for growth. Our year-to-date noncompensation expenses were down 17% but up 11% ex litigation, while our compensation expenses were up 34% on a year-to-date basis. 
Turning to capital on Slide 14. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.1% at the end of the third quarter under the standardized approach, down 30 basis points sequentially. Despite higher capital on solid earnings generation, the decline was driven largely by a $43 billion increase in RWAs, partially reflecting revisions to RWA calculations based on regulatory feedback in the quarter. 
In the quarter, we returned a total of $1.7 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $1 billion and $700 million in common stock dividends. Consistent with our capital management philosophy, we will prioritize deploying capital for our client franchise at attractive returns and then return any excess to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. 
In conclusion, we delivered another quarter of strong performance, reflecting the diversification and strength of our client franchise. Additionally, we announced 2 acquisitions that will enhance both our Asset Management and Consumer businesses and increase the firm's recurring revenue stream. 
Looking forward, the overall opportunity set remains attractive across the firm as we continue to execute on our strategy we are building towards a path to sustainable mid-teens returns. 
With that, we'll now open up the line for questions."

398625,1681638610,2406840,"The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 15, 2021",2021-10-15,"Earnings Calls","The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.","Executives","Sure, Glenn. So let me start kind of with a reiteration of our standing capital policy. As you know, our priority is to deploy capital in the business on behalf of clients, and to do that especially when returns are as attractive as they have been. So in",467,"Sure, Glenn. So let me start kind of with a reiteration of our standing capital policy. As you know, our priority is to deploy capital in the business on behalf of clients, and to do that especially when returns are as attractive as they have been. So in a quarter where we produce 22.5% ROE, it's good to reason and consistent with that, that we deploy the capital in the business. 
I'd also point out that in the dividend, our dividend is now at $2 a share, up from $1.25. So on an annual basis, we're returning an additional $1 billion or so to shareholders through the dividend. And where we exhaust opportunities that prove to be attractive, we'll return capital back, and that really represents what we do in terms of share repurchase. 
Now in terms of the opportunity set, you referred into the Consumer business. It's unquestionably a priority. David has reflected time and again, the long-term view we have about how that business can grow and be accretive to the firm. But I would say that the deployment of capital knows not one segment nor one opportunity. It is a broad look across the firm. And we think always about how do we add in an agile way, deploy capital across the whole of the business. So I wouldn't necessarily say that it's targeted against anyone in particular. 
Obviously, we're operating at a higher SCB, a higher minimum requirement pursuant to the Fed, therefore, surplus is less. And we, consistent with the policy, always look forward to what will be, in effect, a petition on capital that we know. SACCR is certainly one of them. And in that regard, while we've not made a formal decision on implementation and we'll let our regulators know when we do, we're looking forward to that. And our view is that when we put SACCR in place, it will increase our RWAs by about $15 billion or tax our ratio by about 30 basis points. 
It is at that level, in part because as we look back when SACCR was finalized by Basel in '14 and then adopted by the Fed in '18 and '19, we began then to kind of proactively mitigate the effect. So the implementation now reflects mitigation progress we've made in anticipation of it as opposed to kind of a starting workstream. And obviously, the work was assembling data and understanding where appropriate netting pursuant to the rules could play out. But I think that's a reflection of a proactive engagement so as to minimize the impact to capital and ratio now relative to what it would have been. And so sorry for the long answer, but that gives you kind of a complete picture, if you will, of how we're thinking about capital."

So just thinking full year to full year comp ratio, anything on the puts and takes on what to expect?"

But where we are right now, comp to net revenue, net of provision for credit loss is at 31% through 9 months. That was at 34%",266,"So maybe I start with the numbers, and then I'll turn it to David, who I think can reflect on kind of comp philosophy generally. But where we are right now, comp to net revenue, net of provision for credit loss is at 31% through 9 months. That was at 34% when we ended the second quarter. 
We always reserve for compensation consistent with what's required of us, which is what do we think we need to pay the firm consistent with performance as at that date. Obviously, there's a quarter to go. So we're at a 31% ratio, revenue net of provision for credit loss. 
You can see through 9 months in the comp and benefits line, not to confuse the 2 numbers, that number is up 34%, again, reflecting the performance of the business and a pay-for-performance philosophy more broadly. That 34% is obviously to be measured against revenues that are up 42% year-to-date and revenues net of provisions up 56%. So you can see the comp leverage that exists even when we are provisioning for what we believe to be a healthy and robust comp process. 
I think overall, if you look at total operating expenses, because we look at it that way, including our noncomp expense, there continues to be the exhibition of leverage, operating leverage in the business. Again, revenue is up 42%, but total operating expenses ex litigation are up 24%. And so this just gives you a sense of the leverage in operating expenses broadly and in comp specifically. But maybe David wants to comment just on the philosophy."

But we -- this is -- Christian, this is something that we're focused on over the long term. I think we've built an excellent platform. From a standing start of 0, in 5 years, we've built a very, very significant depository institution with over $100 billion of digital deposits, no branches, very small marketing budget or customer acquisition costs. The cost of the infrastructure that holds and drives those deposits is very, very efficient vis-à-vis other models. 
We have 9 million customers that we're servicing right now. We have our own credit card platform that I think is really differentiated, and we're onboarding both other partnerships, but also have the opportunity for a proprietary card that's in development. We've talked publicly about adding digital checking to the portfolio during 2022, and that is on track and it's expanding. GreenSky allows us to broadly expand our point-of-sale capability. And as was highlighted in the starting comments, their tech platform, their cloud-based technology integrates very seamlessly into what we're doing. And so we feel very good about the fact that we're going to continue to grow this and build a consequential business. 
We have a long-term view with it. I'm not going to comment on a revenue growth percentage. Unlike a lot of the fintechs that are simply trying to look at a revenue growth model, we're looking to build a sustainable business that contributes durable recurring earnings to Goldman Sachs over time and to compound that. And we do believe that if we serve clients well in a seamless way with good technology, it will continue to grow and we will do that. 
I don't know, Stephen, if you have anything else you think should be added."

So year-over-year, revenues in Consumer are up 23% in the deposit line. They're up 54% in credit cards, and that's just a reflection of the renewed commitment that David is reflecting to sort of growing out that business and seeing it perform. 
And I think David's comments are spot on. If you look at loans and savings and Apple Card soon to be joined by General Motors, the investing module and checking, this is not -- what's coming into focus is a big, broad platform that can serve customers in all of their needs as opposed to where we began in kind of a bespoke product set.

I don't -- I think it's a really important part and highlight of what we've been executing on in the context of the strategy that we laid out when we went back to Investor Day. And so I think there are a couple of things that we've tried to do very differently over the last few years to strengthen the position of this business. And I think they're accruing results that will be quite sticky. And I don't want to say that the share gains are going to continue at this pace because they won't. We know that, but we've positioned the business much, much better for, I think, 2 principal reasons. 
Number one, the business has been much more focused on having a client-centric One GS culture to really figure out how to serve the needs of our clients in a very holistic way. The business has been less transactional, more long term focused on the client relationship and the level of client service while bringing to bear the market-making, provisioning and financing capabilities of the firm that we have. And I'm hearing repeatedly from clients that they see a real switch in the way we're operating the business, and it's accruing to market share gains. It's benefiting us in that context. 
Number two, we were never an organization that focused on financing our clients as a business segment that we could meaningfully grow and target. And so since the Investor Day, we targeted our ability to grow our financing capability across both Equities and FICC, and we've succeeded on that, and that's a place where we've taken market share. And that is more durable share, obviously, and we continue to think there are opportunities that we can continue to prosecute on the financing side, and that's different. 
I would also highlight that we've been making significant investments in technology, and we have the scale and have developed platforms that enhance the competitive position that we have with clients. And I think one of the things that's happening broadly is the leading players here, given the tech necessity, have an advantage to secondary or tertiary players. And so we're benefiting from that also. 
Now there's no question, this is a very conducive environment the performance in that business. And we're not sitting here saying this level of performance will continue. But I think that the way we're running the business, the focus we've made certainly takes us a step function up from where we were in 2019. I'd also say, as part of our Investor Day, we were focused on efficiencies in operating that business. And so even if we went back to a different level, we're at a higher hurdle return rate in the business at lower levels. And so we feel very good about the way the business is positioned."

But with somewhat unique perspective into the business, just given you're building out your own third-party alternatives platform and you cited some really impressive fundraising numbers, I was hoping if you could just speak to how much longer this frenzied pace of both fundraising and deal activity could persist and whether there are any factors we should be watching, whether it's tax reform or higher rates that could potentially derail some of that momentum."

And I think you're right, we're at a moment in time where the activity levels are quite high. 
First, on fundraising. I'd just say that one of the reasons why we got very focused a few years ago on -- in a much more organized way growing our third-party capital and building institutional relationships to add to our alternatives platform is because there really is secular growth in the context of capital allocation into alternatives. And you get out and you get around the world, whether it's governments and sovereign wealth funds or broad institutions, all of them or a broad array of them are increasing their allocation to alternatives. 
I think in addition, there's no question that we're in a position, the world is in a position where retail participation through wealthy individuals is broadly expanding in the alternative space. And so there's more access being offered to wealthy individuals. We've always had a distribution channel with ultra wealthy individuals, but that access is broadening more significantly. 
And so I do think we have a number of years ahead of broad secular growth in terms of the capital allocation onto these broad global alternatives platforms. I think we're very well positioned for that. And so that's helping us in the context of our fundraising as we highlighted. 
With respect to deal activity, there's a lot of dry powder out there. I would note that sponsor activity in M&A was a much higher percentage of activity this quarter than it's been over the last few years. And in the past, when sponsor activity has increased, it runs for a while, but then ultimately, there'll be something that backs it off. 
We're watching the velocity of our lending activity into that sponsor activity very carefully, thinking very carefully about risk management around that. It feels at the moment given the continued accommodative monetary and fiscal policy environment and the reacceleration of the economy coming out of the pandemic, that this will run for some while, but that's also something that we're going to watch very carefully because it won't sustain at this pace. There'll certainly be speed bumps along the way."

And maybe just for my follow-up, a question, Stephen, just on equity investments and the impact to capital. And one of the primary drivers of future SCB reduction, which you've talked about, is the harvesting of those equity investments. We know they get very punitive treatment in CCAR, but -- and this is a high-class problem, shrinking the investments, at least on a net basis has proven rather difficult and remains stubbornly above that $20 billion level. How much smaller does the book need to get in order to meaningfully reduce your SCB? And is that 13% to 13.5% CET1 target still the appropriate long-term bogey just given some of the stubbornly high equity investments that have persisted for the better part of a couple of years now?"

Our strongly held view is that 13% to 13.5% is the right place for this firm to operate. Now our ability to get there is obviously frustrated by what the Fed is otherwise requiring of us in the context of CCAR and SCB. 
So in that context, what we can do and what we are doing is candidly taking action into our own hands, meaning we're not waiting for petitions to be well received in order that the requirement comes down. But instead, we're pivoting and moving from balance sheet into fund format. 
I think if you look at the Page 9 in our deck, what you'll see is what's happened in terms of $16 billion of dispositions and what that has meant for AE free-up. So I'll just give you a sense of it. 
In the last 9 months, we've seen reduction in balance sheet of $8.9 billion, corresponding to $4.6 billion of AE. Since Investor Day, $16.2 billion of reduction in balance sheet and $8.3 billion of freed AE, and we have line of sight from where we sit to about $2.8 billion of balance sheet reduction, freeing up about $2 billion of AE. 
I give you all those numbers because you can see the magnitude of the activity that's been going on that will continue. And we had always focused in on whether or not at Investor Day, we would experience a bit of a canyon, if you will, of revenue, meaning we would see balance sheet reduction come off at a quicker pace, faster slope than what might have been a yawning line, if you will, to fundraising and deployment. That's not happening. 
As David has said, we have $90 billion of fundraising, which -- and underlying that is about $50 billion of AUS, which is fee paying. And so that transition is being managed well, and this just gives you a sense of the overall capital reduction in the context of what we're trying to achieve."

If you just look at segment by segment, you look at growth in our financing activity in investment banking that supports our M&A franchise, you look at financing that's going on in the context of both FICC and Equities that were up year-on-year and that David was reflecting in the answer to his question around kind of sustainability and the forward in our trading business, and so a good deal of this is balance sheet in support of clients. 
I would point out though that in the context of growing balance sheet, it doesn't grow in isolation, meaning we have various risk metrics that are in place. Capital has obviously grown. Liquidity maintained at the firm obviously grows in the form of our GCLA. And so all of these, I think, are meant to be read in tandem in the context of serving clients, but doing that in a way where balance sheet growth is held in the context of various risk, be it capital and liquidity profile of the firm itself. 
We're not -- we are not a bank, notwithstanding the fact that we have strategically grown our deposit base that are experiencing the kind of outsized growth in deposits that you're seeing or that you have seen at the bigger commercial banks. And that is inflating balance sheet there. We're not seeing that kind of inflation frankly, in part because this is a new platform for us and a strategic pivot in terms of very usable deposits as a substitute for wholesale funding."

You're right, at any point in time, that mix could change, and we wouldn't see the same robust amount of client activity, but we have fundamental growth in markets. We have fundamental growth and economic activity around the world. And that, over periods of time, grows long-term growth in these business platforms. 
So I certainly would say we're running a very, very robust capital markets activity in the Investment Banking franchise at the moment. But I'd also say, whenever things slow down or rebalance a little, we're going to find that these businesses are baseline fundamentally larger than they were 5 years ago because of the growth in market cap for the world and the growth in economic activity in the world. 
And so we've always said that there's a real correlation to economic activity to our activity. There's a real correlation in market cap growth to our activity. Obviously, these things will ebb and flow, but we have lots of flexibility in the context of the way we manage the businesses. And these businesses, I think, will continue to be strong performers even in different environments. They just might not perform at this level all the time."

I do think around some of the public portion of our GSAM business across the world, there's still opportunities for us to punch in a better way, even though at this point, we're one of the top 5 active asset managers. And so we continue to think about that as an opportunity.
I think there are opportunities for us around the Wealth Management business, in particular, in Europe, and we've been focused on that. I think there are wealth management opportunities for us in the U.S. as we move from simply managing money with ultra-high-net-worth clientele that have been our traditional PWM business to a more mass affluent structure and using digital technology and expanding the use of Ayco. China is another place where there's opportunity for us from a wealth management perspective.

And Stephen, I'm sure, will have some things to add here, too. At a high level, we're spending significantly on technology to expand the platforms that we operate on, to better connect to our clients and to enable us, obviously, to operate more efficiently. We're performing very well at the moment, but our commitment to continuing to uplift our broad background and to put more of our businesses into the cloud for a variety of reasons, which I'll highlight in just a second, I think, is something that we've been very focused on strategically and it continues, but we're in the middle of the execution path. 
Historically, developers at the firm have used their own physical data centers to build and host technology. And cloud adoption really enables innovation by allowing talent that we have all across the organization to focus their time where it really matters and to be able to much more directly create services and applications that can directly service our clients' needs rather than doing what I call as undifferentiated kind of heavy lifting tech build that manage what was more traditional tech infrastructure. 
The cloud really provides low-friction access to technologies such as big data, machine learning, analytics, which enables us to continuously deliver products to meet the growing demand that our clients have as they want to connect with us. And it's allowing us to accelerate some of the initiatives we have, and you highlighted some of them like Transaction Banking and some of the things we're doing on the Marcus platform. And so there's no question that there are real efficiencies for us that are coming out of that. 
We know that the cloud is not for everything, and so there are some services. And I'll give you an example like high-frequency trading that are better served on-premise, and so we clearly operate in a hybrid environment. And we also choose our partners in kind of a multicloud or what we call a polycloud strategy so that we can take the best-of-breed offerings that each of these different technology platforms have and allow that to better leverage what we can do for our clients. 
So overall, we're in this journey that's very, very intentional. It's aligned with our strategic objectives of delivering better services to our clients and operating the firm more efficiently. And I think we're getting real benefit from it in the execution of our strategy, but I think there's more upside in that as we continue to build the financial cloud, so to speak, for some of our principal businesses. 
I mean, Stephen, would you add anything to that? Or do you want to quantify some things a little more?"

So Mike, if you -- you heard me say before, our noncomp expenses, so excluding litigation. So just looking at the core noncomp expense, year-to-date is up 11%. If you look at the gross expense that, that represents, about 1/3 of that increase is related to technology. So about 1/3 of the increase of noncompensation expense in the firm through the first 9 months relates to technology. And this is spent all across the firm. So it's both, in particular, initiatives like Consumer, TxB, Marquee, but equally, it's spent broadly on the broader uplift of platforms in and around the firm. Cloud-based engineering is one that David brought to your attention. 
In all of these spends, we sweat the ROI of this investment. And so as an example, part of the uplift will enable us to create greater opportunity for automation, which will play out as a return across the whole of the firm. So I just offer that to you just to give you some sort of dimension, if you will, from a true expense line as to what David was otherwise describing."

I would conclude, however, that it is how it's been built on a very cost-efficient basis and built with a level of security that I think satisfies us and our client base, meaning I think it's a draw card in the context of it. 
The reason, Mike, is kind of self-evident, which is that it's built in the cloud. As David noted, it's not built with multiple instances of the Transaction Banking platform across redundant data centers. It benefits without necessarily costing us to sort of improve security upgrades to sort of technology and the like. That is the benefit of sitting within the cloud itself.

But fundamentally, this is an example of us seeing an opportunity to build a digital platform that took friction out of an activity that was deeply embedded in our corporate clients. As a user of that activity, we saw that experience and we saw that there were ways that, that experience could be improved, and we've built a platform that delivers a better experience.

I think the merchant network that they've developed, we have over 10,000 merchants and they developed over 15 years is extremely valuable. And then the work we did to try to have a point-of-sale merchant network and look at that, we think it would have taken us close to 10 years to develop a similar network. And so the ability to acquire that network bring a very, very high-quality customers. These are customers that own homes. These are customers that have high FICO scores, very, very attractive into Goldman Sachs. It allowed us to do something that fits seamlessly into our platform and allowed us to expand the point-of-sale activities that we were doing.

When you think about the different businesses in which you want to grow, you've done a lot of these smaller bolt-ons, some in the wealth side with United Capital and Folio several years ago and NN and GreenSky more recently. 
Going from here, is there any particular business that you think is quite compelling, given either some combination of ripe inorganic opportunities that the market might be underappreciating similar to -- or your -- the platform can be different within Goldman than it is as a standalone, the way it was with GreenSky? How should investors think about priorities and direction from here and how to stack?"

I'll bring you back -- I really want to bring you back and center you around what we said during our Investor Day. We laid out a strategy that said we would continue to invest in our core businesses to grow market share and increase their positioning. I think we've done that. There's still some opportunities to continue to do that. But we highlighted a handful of areas where we saw opportunities to grow and expand our competitive position while also increasing the mix of durable fee-based revenues into the business. 
And when you look at those areas, it's Transaction Banking, it's Asset Management, it's Wealth Management and it's our digital consumer bank. And so as we look forward, I still think there are opportunities to grow all 4 of those areas. I think we can continue to grow them organically. But when there are opportunities to make an acquisition that can accelerate our competitive position and our growth in one of those areas, we're going to take a hard look at it. 
As I've said before, the bar for us to do something very significant is extraordinarily high. I think there are still opportunities. There may be opportunities in the coming years for us to do things that can accelerate those areas, but we are focused on those 4 areas because those 4 areas diversify the durability of our revenues and allow us to continue to grow a more durable and consistent earnings stream. And so that's the frame that we'll continue to look at. I wouldn't point to anything more specifically."

And when we look at some of the, I guess, stand-alone alternative manager peers, they've done a great job in recent years of expanding the product menu and then consolidating LP relationships where they're connecting on numerous products and so that effectively creates a network effect. 
And so looking at Goldman, where do you guys feel like you are with LPs? And is the opportunity to add more LPs? Or is there opportunity to connect with more Goldman Sachs product? And then I guess on the product side alternatives, are there any areas where you feel like you could accelerate investment or those could be areas that could help you connect, I guess, with your LPs, existing LPs on more products?"

But I'll go back to some of the things that we said at Investor Day that kind of geared or stored our focus on this. 
We've been in these businesses for a long time, and we actually have something that I think is very differentiated in that we have a truly broad global product offering that is relatively built out and has been built out for a number of years. We have positions in private equity, in growth equity, in credit, in real estate, in infrastructure and we also have them globally around the world. And when you look at a lot of the freestanding firms, there are some that have that broad array, but very few have all the products on a global basis the way we're set up. 
What was differentiated or different about our business and alternatives before we rolled it together and got it focused is, generally, our LP relationships came through our private wealth network, and we have raised an enormous amount of money through our private wealth network, including the partners of the firm. While we had some institutional LP relationships, we had not really been a large institutional funder into this business platform. And given our relationship with a lot of these institutions broadly from other activities, we knew that if we took a One GS approach at really taking a long-term view in building relationships with those institutional partners, we could grow our partnership with them. 
So a big part of the growth opportunity has been adding new LPs to our ecosystem. And if you look at strategic solutions, which we raised last year, there were a number of -- probably a dozen new significant institutional LPs that the first time they were coming on to our platform was in that strategic solutions fund. So I think there's a big opportunity for us to continue to expand that. It's something we're very focused on. But the opportunity for us is less in product addition, although we are adding products. We've just raised the Horizon Fund, which is an ESG-centered funds, will allow us to allocate capital into certain climate technologies, and we'll add other product capabilities that we think are interesting. But our focus is on meaningfully using the Goldman Sachs platform and the broad institutional relationships we have to really meaningfully expand the list of institutional LPs that are partnered with us. And I think we have a lot of upside to run on that."

So there's no question that activities that we're involved in are digitizing quickly. I think there's a meaningful acceleration in the disruption that the digitalization of financial services is occurring. There are places that, that digitization is allowing us to disrupt and accelerate our position. The two we've talked about a bunch today on this call that are happening because of digital infrastructure, our ability to do what we're doing in Transaction Banking is taking some of this digital disruption and using it in a different way. What we're doing in building a digital consumer bank is also relying on this. 
The broader digital ecosystem, I think, is in early stages. I think we're a version 1.0. I think you'll continue to see a lot of disruption on traditional ways of financial services are delivered and consumed. I think big competitive platforms will continue to be a place where more financial services are intermediated. I think there are lots of complications around the regulatory structure and how the regulatory structure will ultimately manage some of this as the technology allows for more disruption. But I think we're very early in the game. And I think it is a big opportunity for the firm, and the firm continues to be focused on it."

So the targets were set at the same time though, bear in mind, the environment then and now is quite different in the context of interest rates. So we've seen Fed funds come down from the time of Investor Day, I don't know, I want to say about 150 basis points, maybe a little more. The consequence of that is that the value of deposits, the economic value of deposits is not as rich now as we had imagined back at Investor Day. But equally in the context of an expectation of rising interest rates, we'll see a return to the value of those deposits otherwise modeled out. And therefore, on the forward rate curve, our view is that we'll be able to achieve that $1 billion revenue target. 
I'd point out that of the $50 billion, more of them are operational. That's sort of step one to achieving the value of that. And that has been a big quarter-on-quarter increase from about 14% the last quarter. 
And I think more broadly, in Transaction Banking, about 2/3 of the revenue from the time we modeled it through now is correlated to deposit intake with the balance around FX and other fees. And so as we see interest rates come back, the value of those deposits will as well."
