Words cannot fully reflect Mike's many contributions to our company for over 3 decades, and I'm so immensely grateful for his partnership with me throughout the year. 
Moving on to financial matters, including a summary of the quarter and year. 
During the fourth quarter, we invested over $1 billion in high-quality real estate, including $467 million in the U.K., bringing us to over $2.3 billion invested during 2020, approximately $921 million of which was invested in the U.K. Investments during the year were largely concentrated in the grocery and home improvement industries, both of which continue to thrive during the current economic environment. 
We maintained low leverage and ample liquidity throughout the year while enhancing our financial flexibility. Highlights include the establishment of a $1 billion commercial paper program, our successful debut public issuance of sterling denominated unsecured notes and record low coupon rates for 5 years and 12-year dollar-denominated bonds in the REIT sector. 
We have also been active in the equity capital markets to accretively fund our acquisition pipeline. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we raised approximately [ $605 ] million of equity, primarily through our ATM program. And in January, we raised an additional $670 million of equity through an overnight offering. 
Accordingly, our balance sheet is well positioned to address what continues to be an active investment pipeline. To that end, we are introducing 2021 acquisitions guidance of over $3.25 billion, as we are well positioned to continue the momentum we experienced at the close of last year and in January. 
In the fourth quarter of 2020, we invested approximately $1 billion in 70 properties located in 22 states and the U.K. at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.4% with a weighted average lease term of 13.4 years. 
On a total revenue basis, approximately 68% of total acquisitions during the quarter were from investment-grade rated tenants. 71% of the revenue is generated from retail tenants. These assets are leased to 31 different tenants in 19 industries. 
Of the $1 billion invested during the quarter, $541 million was invested domestically in 59 properties at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.2% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.1 years. 
During the quarter, $467 million was invested internationally in 11 properties located in the U.K. at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.7% and with a weighted average lease term of 11.7 years. 
During 2020, we invested over $2.3 billion in 244 properties located in 30 states in the U.K. at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.9% and with a weighted average lease term of 13.2 years. 
On a revenue basis, 61% of 2020 acquisitions are from investment-grade rated tenants. 87% of the revenues are generated from retail and 13% are from industrial assets. 
These assets are leased to 56 different tenants in 26 industries, 2 of the most significant industries represented our grocery and home improvement. Of the $2.3 billion invested during 2020, nearly $1.4 billion was invested domestically in 220 properties at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.8% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.9 years. And approximately $921 million was invested internationally in 24 properties located in the U.K. at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.1% and with a weighted average lease term of 10.8 years. 
Transaction flow remains healthy as we sourced approximately $17.1 billion in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we sourced approximately $63.6 billion in potential transaction opportunities. The most we have ever reviewed in a given year. Of these opportunities, $42.4 billion were domestic opportunities and $21.2 billion were international opportunities. 
Investment-grade opportunities represented 50% of the volumes sourced during the year. Of the $63.6 [ billion ] sourced, 56% were portfolios and 44%, approximately, $28.2 billion were one-off assets. 
Of the $1 billion in total acquisitions closed in the fourth quarter, 66% were one-off transactions. 
Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy during the quarter, averaging approximately 130 basis points. 
Moving to dispositions. During the quarter, we sold 60 properties for net proceeds of $77.5 million, realizing an unlevered IRR of 8.7%. This brings us to 125 properties sold during 2020 for $261 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.8%, and we realized an unlevered IRR of 11.6%. 
Our portfolio remains well diversified by clients, industry, geography and property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At year-end, our properties were leased to approximately 600 clients in 51 separate industries located in 49 states, Puerto Rico and the U.K. 
Approximately 84% of rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at approximately 11% of rental revenue. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 5.7% of rental revenue. Convenience stores remains our largest industry at 11.9% of rental revenue. 
Within our overall retail portfolio, approximately 95% of our rent comes from tenants with a service, nondiscretionary and/or low price point component to that business. We continue to believe these characteristics allow our tenants to operate in a variety of economic environments and to compete more effectively with e-commerce. 
These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate, where the vast majority of recent U.S. retailer bankruptcies have been in industries that do not possess these characteristics. We remain constructive on the credit quality of the portfolio with over half of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment-grade rated tenants. 
Occupancy based on the number of properties was 97.9% at year-end. During the fourth quarter, we released 77 properties, recapturing 100.3% of the expiring rents. 
During 2020, we re-leased 314 properties, recapturing 100% of the expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold over 3,500 properties with leases expiring, recapturing over 100% of rent on those properties that were released. 
In light of COVID-19, rent collection across our portfolio has remained stable over recent months. During the fourth quarter, we collected 93.6% of contractual rent due and further improvement in rent collection percentages is primarily dependent upon improvements in the theater industry, which I will touch on shortly. 
We collected 100% of contractual rent for the fourth quarter from investment-grade rated tenants, which further validates the importance of our high-quality real estate portfolio, least to large, well capitalized clients. 
While we have not historically prioritized investment-grade rated tenants as a primary objective. During periods of economic uncertainty, high-grade credit tenants tend to provide more reliable streams of income as the last several quarters have exemplified. 
Our top 4 industries, convenience stores, grocery stores, drug stores and dollar stores, each sell essential goods and represent over 37% of rental revenue, and we have received nearly all of the contractual rent due to us from tenants in these industries since the pandemic began. 
Uncollected rent continues to be primarily in the theater industry, representing approximately 80% of uncollected rent in December. 
As the theater industry remains challenged, I would like to update the investment community on our latest view. The industry represents 5.6% of our contractual base. While we do expect the industry to downsize in the future, we continue to believe it will remain a viable industry in a post pandemic environment, especially for high budget blockbuster movies. 
You might recall that the U.S. box office reached an all-time high as recent as 2018, and 2019 produced the highest grossing worldwide film of all times in Avengers: Endgame. We continue to believe, particularly for blockbuster movies that a theatrical release will be the preferred distribution channel for studios going forward, given the superior economics supported to them versus streaming platforms. 
That said, we do acknowledge that the industry is changing and that there likely will be a rationalization of theaters in a post pandemic reality. 
Under this scenario, underperforming theaters may not survive. We continue to maintain a full reserve, the outstanding receivable balance for 37 of our 77 total theater assets and continue to recognize revenue on a cash basis for these 37 assets. 
During the fourth quarter, we established a full reserve for 1 additional theater asset, and we disposed off 1 theater asset previously on cash accounting. 
To be clear, we do not expect to lose the entirety of rent associated with these properties longer term, even in the event of potential closures. As of year-end, the total allowance for these 37 theaters totaled $23.7 million, including $1.8 million of which is a straight-line rent receivable reserve and thus has no AFFO impact. 
Moving on. Our same-store rental revenue decreased 3.2% during the quarter and 1.7% year-to-date. Our reported same-store growth includes deferred rent and unpaid rent that we have deemed to be collectible over the existing lease term, but it excludes rent where collectibility is deemed less than probable. The decrease in same-store rental revenue is primarily driven by reserves we recognized in the theater industry and to a lesser extent, the health and fitness industry. 
Now to provide additional detail on our financial results for the quarter, I would like to hand it off to Christie."

I'm looking forward to working together with our teams to deliver our strategic objectives and realization of dreams and aspirations for all at Realty Income with Sumit and our Board of Directors. 
I also look forward to engaging with our investment community over time. We are grateful for the support of all of our loyal shareholders who have invested in Realty Income for over 26 years as a public company and for our future. 
I would now like to provide a general overview of our recent financial results, starting with the balance sheet. We have continued to maintain our conservative capital structure and remain one of only a handful of REITs with at least 2 A ratings. 
During the quarter, we completed our debut public offering of Sterling denominated senior unsecured totes, issuing GBP 400 million due 2030 for an effective annual yield to maturity of 1.71%. 
We also issued [ 725 million ] of senior unsecured notes in December through a dual tranche offering of 5-year and 12-year notes. Achieving record low U.S. dollar coupon rates in the REIT sector for each of those tenors. 
Additionally, we raised approximately $655 million of equity during the quarter, primarily through our ATM program. And in January 2021, we raised approximately $670 million through an overnight equity offering, which we earmarked to prefund an active investment pipeline to start the year. 
We ended the year with low leverage and strong coverage metrics with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 5.3x or 5.2x on a pro forma basis, adjusting for the annualized impact of acquisitions and dispositions during the quarter. 
And our fixed charge coverage ratio remained strong at 5.1x. We ended the year with full availability under our $3 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility. No borrowings outstanding on our $1 billion commercial paper program and over $824 million of cash on hand. 
In January, we completed the early redemption of all $950 million, 3.25 notes due 2022, which was done to reduce our near-term refinancing risk and take advantage of attractive borrowing rates in the fixed income market. 
Looking forward, our overall debt maturity schedule remains in excellent shape with only $44 million of debt maturities through year-end 2021, excluding commercial paper borrowings. 
Now moving on to our income statement. AFFO per share during the quarter was $0.84 and $3.39 per the year on a fully diluted basis, representing annual growth of 2.1%. 
For 2020, our AFFO per share was negatively impacted by non-straight-line rent reserves of $44.1 million, which represents approximately $0.13 per share of dilution, over half of which is attributed to the theater industry. 
Now moving on to guidance. As we introduced our initial 2021 earnings estimate, we acknowledge that while some uncertainty related to the theater industry remains together with the backdrop of the pandemic, our confidence in providing guidance is supported by the overall health and stability of our portfolio combined with the acquisition pipeline. 
To that end, our 2021 AFFO per share guidance of $3.44 to $3.49, represents approximately 1.5% to 3% growth over 2020. 
Moving on to dividends. In December, we increased the dividend for the 109th time in our company's history. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of approximately 4.4%. And we are proud to be 1 of only 3 REITs in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat index for having increased our dividend every year for the last 25 consecutive years. 
And now I'd like to hand our call back over to Sumit."

And the question was asked, where do you think you're going to end the year up? And we had said that it was going to be right around 98%. And the fact that we came at 97.9% was fairly accurate. And what we saw coming was the NPC bankruptcy filing. As you might recall, we have approximately 150 assets with NPC, most of which happens to be the Pizza Hut. And then we have 19 assets that are Wendy's that's also run by NPC. 
We were expecting 66 assets to be rejected through the bankruptcy process. And that was the reason why we had guided the market to a 98 -- approximately a 98% occupancy number. We were -- and those 66 assets did come back to us during the fourth quarter, which is the largest driver of this 97.9%. You will see that the net increase in vacant assets from third quarter to fourth quarter was circa 45 assets. So despite the fact that we got 66 assets back, we were able to resolve a lot more assets than we had originally thought because these assets are very well located, Vikram, and we were able to attract either QSRs that wanted to take some of these assets. And we feel very good about being able to resolve these assets fairly quickly. 
The other point I'll make is most of these Pizza Huts with NPC had less than 2 years remaining on their lease term. And so our asset management team had already begun the process of trying to figure out alternatives. Knowing fully well that these were the assets that would come back, even if it were to have not filed bankruptcy. 
So we feel pretty good about being able to resolve these assets. And as you can see from the resolution, we have the most number of resolutions in the fourth quarter. This was a record quarter for us. And so it's a testament to the team that we have in place, Ben and TJ, who drive that particular process for us, continue to do an absolutely amazing job despite the backdrop of the pandemic. And we are very hopeful that we will climb right back up above 98%. 
Look, we have frictional vacancy, and we've always suggested that to the group that because we want to have the ability to reposition some of these assets, we are always going to be in this 98% -- circa 98% occupancy rate because we do want to reposition some of these assets, which does take us time, and that will continue to be what we target going forward."

Good question, Haendel. As you pointed out, the lower cap rate was largely driven by the mix of assets that we purchased here in the U.S. If you look at the prepared remarks, I suggested that 29% of what we purchased here in the U.S. were industrial assets, single-tenant industrial assets. These were very well placed assets with clients that who are executing on their omnichannel strategy had lease terms that were [ north ] of 10 years, some 15-year leases, good growth in markets that we wanted to enhance our exposure and with rents that were right around market rents. And so as you know, the industrial assets tend to be trading a lot more aggressively. And as such, that certainly had a bit of a downdraft on our cap rate, but the fact that we were able to do 5.2% for the U.S. assets was largely driven by that."

Look, we came out in early January with what our pipeline looked for the first quarter. And you might recall we had about $800 million -- slightly above $800 million that we had disclosed to the market at that time that we had in our pipeline, and we were 12 days into the year. So I don't think it should have come as a surprise that we had an incredibly healthy pipeline developed coming out of the fourth quarter. And if you look at what we were able to achieve in the fourth quarter of $1 billion, we had a tremendous amount of momentum that sort of carried forward into the first quarter and that has continued. It is also a testament to the amount of sourcing that we are able to do, the new swim lanes that we have created for ourselves to continue to grow the portfolio. And I think it's a testament to the strategy that we put in place a couple of years ago to be able to now post numbers that seem very large relative to what we have come out with in years past. But that's precisely the path that we wanted to go down. 
You mentioned what is the expected cap rates? I think you should expected cap rates to be similar to what we achieved in 2020. And given the mix of portfolio, the optimal portfolio allocation that we have sort of highlighted to the market, it's really going to be a function of which particular portfolio or assets closed within a quarter as to whether the cap rates are going to come out. 
If it's going to have a slightly more industrial plan to it, it's going to be lower cap rates. If it's going to be more retail, it's going to have a slightly higher cap rate. Having said that, even retail, especially though those types of retail that are deemed essential, portfolios are now trading in the mid-4s. And so the pricing environment has gotten a lot more aggressive. But thankfully, we have the cost of capital, and we were still able to generate 160 basis points of spread for the entire year, which is north of our historical spread. So we feel very good about the quality of assets we are buying and how we are reshaping our portfolio along the lines of what we had shared with the market in the third quarter, et cetera. 
So really, the cap rate is going to be a function of the composition of assets that we drive within a given quarter. 
The last question you had talked about was 1031. And what is the impact or our ability to issue OP units. Well, it's not new for us. We have done this in the past. We've bought assets from retail shareholders who wanted to buy -- wanted to take OP units as consideration for proceeds, and we were able to satisfy that. So could I see that momentum picking up potentially to defer having to pay taxes? 
Absolutely. And we are very well equipped to take advantage of that. And use our equity as currency to provide that to potential sellers. 
But having said all of that, 1031 is not a big part of our business, even on the disposition side. As you can see, most of the assets that we sell tend to be vacant assets, and that doesn't lend itself to the 1031 market. It's primarily developers or tenants who want to own their own assets that tend to play in that particular area. And on the occupied side, a lot of the transactions we did in 2020 were existing tenants exercising their option to purchase. And that's the reason why we were able to generate very good proceeds and very good overall returns. And the opportunistic sales tend to be an area where perhaps we run into some 1031 buyers. But that, I would say, is about 25% of the sellers that we interact with. 
So for us, I think the -- on the disposition side is going to be fairly muted. On the acquisition side, I think not having 1031 be as aggressive, especially on the smaller boxes like QSRs and drug stores, et cetera. We could see cap rates increase because of the lack of 1031 buyers. And so that could potentially accrue to our benefit, especially when we are engaging in these one-off asset acquisitions."

And then I'll hand it off to Christie, if that's okay, Greg. 
For us, we wanted to make sure that we came out with a range that represented the facts on the ground today. And we wanted to make sure that the range was conservative enough where even if the situation were not to improve, and it was to be, as we have experienced early on in the year in January and December of last year that this is the range that we feel very comfortable with. 
What I'm suggesting is that there could be a fair amount of upside to the range that we have shared. And it's largely a function of what's going to happen to the theater industry at large, but also, to a smaller extent, to the health and fitness industry. And there, we feel very confident that the theater business is going to improve, especially with the vaccination having taken hold and every day, we see more news about Pfizer and Moderna and now potentially J&J being on the approved list, that the acceleration of getting to a point where we have herd immunity is very realistic. 
And I've seen base case models that suggest that as early as end of June, we could get close to having herd immunity. The other data point that I would point to, Greg, is what we have seen in China. And over the Chinese -- the Lunar New Year, we can -- they had record ticket sales. And in fact, one of the movies that was shown had almost $50 million more in sales than the record that had been set by Avengers: Endgame here in the U.S. and in Canada, and their opening we can't. And so all of these facts sort of lead us to believe that there is a possibility that there is a fair amount of upside on the assumptions that we have shown in our model. And that could that could help get us to the top end of the range. And if a lot of other things fall into place, potentially, we could do even better. 
So -- but we can't go out with that expectation. When you lay out all the various different scenarios. You come up with what's the probability weighted outcome. And that's what we have shared with the market. But there are things that could play in our favor, and it really is a function of how you think about the theater industry and what you think the recovery is going to look like. And we've shared with you at nauseam some of the assumptions that we have drawn in terms of taking 37 of our 77 assets and viewing it on a cash accounting basis and how that percolates through the base model. If your view shifts, to say, that's perhaps a bit too conservative then there is good upside. And that's what we are super excited about. There are certainly other levers for us to play, like you correctly pointed out, the acquisition market is something we are super excited about. And part of it is intentional and part of it is a function of more and more operators and clients that we want to do business with, wanting to engage in sale-leaseback transactions. And so that too could act as a potential tailwind. And look, we've come out with numbers. You've seen our history about the early estimates that we come out with and what we are able to achieve during the year. But not saying that -- but there too, there could be some tailwinds. So there's acquisition fronts. There are assumptions that we have made about the theater business and the health and fitness business. There are assumptions we've made about how quickly we could get to a point where things are starting to normalize, et cetera. 
And all of those have room and capacity for potentially surprising on the upside. So we feel pretty good. And I'll hand it back to Christie, if there's anything else you would like to add."

It's probably a little bit bigger than that. Of our leases have CPI adjustments. And -- but a lot of these have a floor in the ceiling associated with them.

And -- but a lot of these have a floor in the ceiling associated with them. So yes, a rising CPI environment, we have some level of protection, but there does tend to be -- especially here in the U.S., there tends to be a floor in the ceiling associated with it. 
For us, the -- we've encountered this problem before. What happens in an inflationary environment? The fact that we have leases that are net lease in nature. We are less sort of less susceptible to an environment where inflation expectation and actual inflation goes up because so much of the cost, either insurance, property, taxes, et cetera, are paid by our tenants. And so from that perspective, we feel pretty good. We started to see the [ 10-year ] treasury go up in anticipation of expected inflation going up. But thankfully, so far, our spreads have come down as well. And our all-in cost in the tenure has gone up slightly, but not dramatically. We can still issue tenure -- in today's environment, we think right around the 2122 ZIP code. And that is still relative to what we've been able to do in the past, a very good all-in costs on the [ 10-year ] financing. So we feel pretty good about that. Some of this is now offset by what we are seeing in the U.K. as well as in Europe, where interest rates continue to be low, inflation expectations are very much contained. And so there, our all-in cost of financing continues to be super exciting. And so the fact that we have created all of these different alternatives also helps us shield us somewhat from inflation expectations arising in particular geographies and so we feel pretty good about that as well. And the fact that we have long-term leases also is a benefit. 
Look, at some point, if the inflation expectations are going up, and it is largely translating to better GDP growth, et cetera, that should translate to better fundamentals for our tenants. And so not so much this year, we only have about 1.7% of our leases expiring. But in future years, that should start to reflect on higher market rents, et cetera. And so especially in 2022, 2023, we have a bit more of a expiration with regards to our leases, I could see us marking to market some of our leases during renewal time. And so I think from all of those perspectives, we feel pretty good. 
One of the questions that often comes up, okay, if the interest rate environment continues to go up, it's going to impact your cost of capital, and that is absolutely true. But what we have found in prior cycles is that cap rates tend to follow suit as well. And there is definitely a lag, but it does sort of follow and then it allows us to continue to maintain the spreads that we have. And in certain situations, even enhance our spreads if the cap rate moves faster than our cost of capital. So we feel like we are very well positioned as a company. And based on some of the investments we've made and some of the areas that we have focused on, we feel like we are very well situated to handle an interest rate environment that increases an inflationary expectation environment that increases."

And the remaining of the story is really around health and fitness, which is primarily the remaining 16% of uncollected rent. And we did incur some collections on the health and fitness business.

There's a reason why we have that sheet in our supplemental, and we want to lay it out as clearly as possible. This is another one of the avenues us to continue to gain exposure to certain clients and do it at a cap rate that is north of what you would be able to transact in the open market. And so it is about $160 million of commitment, $100 million of which is not funded yet. But if you look at the breakup, you will see that it's largely driven by 2 forward commitments we have on the non-retail side of the business. And so what that allows us to do is, again, enter into these contracts in a particular asset type that is trading super aggressively and be able to transact and get assets maybe 40, 50, 60 basis points north of where these assets would be trading have they been available today. And so I think that is part of the advantage of doing this. And this is, again, using our credit, using our scale and size to be able to get some of these assets at higher cap rates than what we would on the open market. 
The other side of this is repositioning. I think it was Vikram, who had asked about, hey, how are you thinking about these assets from NPC. We have a history of being able to reposition some of our assets and be able to really capture and enhance our rent from the same exact location by simply repositioning these assets. And that is something we've been doing for a few years. They tend to be smaller dollar amounts. 
But once again, we've given you that detail in the supplemental. And that will continue to be a bigger and bigger portion of our business. And I think as you've seen, the velocity of our lease terminations, et cetera, will only increase. And this part of our business, which we have seasoned over many years, will start to play a bigger, bigger role and will certainly, we hope, be a value-enhancing part of our business model. 
And so I would love to see this business continue to increase within the parameters of what I just shared with you and help us create another source of value creation for the overall business."

And we've already shared with you that, look, we don't think that the footprint of the theater business, pre-pandemic is going to be exactly the same post pandemic. So there will be some level of rationalization. But the good news is there is a fair amount of demand for last mile distribution, and there's much more of a focus on development of multifamily, given some of the trends that we are seeing in some of these markets. So it is quite possible that these assets, given that they sit on potentially 10, 12, even 15 acres of land, could be repositioned to a higher and better use. But that question, Wes, I think, is going to be very specific to the particular location and where that particular theta falls in the performance rankings. And if it tends to be in the top 2 quartile, I would say that, yes, the likelihood of it remaining at theater is high. But if not, I could easily see it being repositioned. 
Perhaps not easily but certainly repositioned."

What we had seen in -- even as late last year that there was a portfolio discount, not a portfolio premium. But there has -- we have seen a couple of portfolios come to market that have traded very expensively. And so I'm not quite sure where this trend is going to go, Todd. But -- and I think I mentioned this already that even some industries and some tenants that we had seen pre-pandemic are now trading at levels as a portfolio, 40, 50 basis points lower. So it's tough to tell. I don't think it is a point that could be made across all industries and all operators. I do think that in most industries and especially the higher-yielding industries. If there's a portfolio transaction, you will tend to see a discount, not a premium. But in certain industries and the industries that are in favor today, we are certainly seeing a little bit of tightening. With regards to $3.25 billion, we are not underwriting to very large portfolio transactions. That is not part of our overall forecast, Todd. So if that were to happen, I think that would be above and beyond the numbers that we have shared with you. And so that, too, could be a potential tailwind for our business. As you might know, there are several public sale-leaseback transactions in the market, none of which are reflected in the numbers that we have shared. 
With respect to cap rates, it is -- it has compressed. And it has compressed even over the last 5 months, 4 months. So whether it's retail here in the U.K. industrial, as you know, it's probably steady but still fairly aggressive cap rates. It's -- all has tended to become a lot more expensive today than it was 6 months ago. 
In the U.K., thankfully, the cap rate market is a bit more stable. I wouldn't go so far as to say that it's compressing. But it's funny, we tend to do certain transactions where we are the only ones who are engaging in conversations and then we will find 1 or 2 other potential buyers start to come in on subsequent transactions. 
So this is an interesting acquisitions environment that we find ourselves in right now. And -- but we feel very good. Again, the advantages that we have, we feel like we'll be able to get more than our share of transactions done, and we will continue to do it as spreads that will be very favorable and will help us drive earnings growth."

Now the way I would define large portfolios is $1 billion plus. Most peers would run into concentration questions doing half that size. Especially if they already have a preexisting exposure to that particular client. But we find ourselves in the enviable position of being able to continue to increase the allocation for a given client, and it's largely a testament to the size of our overall business and balance sheet. But clearly, when you start talking $5 billion, $6 billion, those are types of transactions that don't come very often. And when they do, outside of us, I don't know if there is any other public net lease buyer that could potentially entertain absorbing that sort of size. Then in terms of who are the alternative buyers of this. It's largely driven by what is available on the financing side of the equation. And ABS has become a preferred mechanism of financing these large scale transactions, especially with highly rated operators. And then once those boxes are checked, you can pretty much assume some of the private equity folks getting involved and being super excited about playing in that size because they can put capital to work, and lever up the portfolio to, call it, 85%, 90% and be able to get very -- enhance their cash-on-cash yield. So that's the group that would be the traditional competition for very large sale-leaseback opportunities with highly rated operators. 
But when interest rate starts to move in the direction that it has, then that does start to put pressure on some of these players because the cost of financing on that 80%, 90% leverage starts to creep up. So it really is going to have to be coupled with what we see in the financing market to help define who the potential competition could be."

Moving on to financial matters, including a summary of the quarter and year. During the fourth quarter, we invested over $1 billion in high-quality real estate, including $467 million in the U.K., bringing us to over $2.3 billion invested during 2020, approximately $921 million of which was invested in the U.K. Investments during the year were largely concentrated in the grocery and home improvement industries, both of which continue to thrive during the current economic environment. We maintained low leverage and ample liquidity throughout the year while enhancing our financial flexibility. Highlights include the establishment of a $1 billion commercial paper program, our successful debut public issuance of Sterling-denominated unsecured notes and record low coupon rates for 5-year and 12-year dollar-denominated bonds in the REIT sector.
We have also been active in the equity capital markets to accretively fund our acquisition pipeline. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we raised approximately $655 million of equity, primarily through our ATM program. And in January, we raised an additional $670 million of equity through an overnight offering. Accordingly, our balance sheet is well positioned to address what continues to be an active investment pipeline. To that end, we are introducing 2021 acquisitions guidance of over $3.25 billion as we are well positioned to continue the momentum we experienced at the close of last year and in January.
In the fourth quarter of 2020, we invested approximately $1 billion in 70 properties located in 22 states and the U.K. at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.4% with a weighted average lease term of 13.4 years. On a total revenue basis, approximately 68% of total acquisitions during the quarter were from investment grade-rated tenants. 71% of the revenue is generated from retail tenants. These assets are leased to 31 different tenants in 19 industries. Of the $1 billion invested during the quarter, $541 million was invested domestically in 59 properties at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.2% and with a weighted average lease term of 15.1 years. During the quarter, $467 million was invested internationally in 11 properties located in the U.K. at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.7% and with a weighted average lease term of 11.7 years.
During 2020, we invested over $2.3 billion in 244 properties located in 30 states in the U.K. at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.9% and with a weighted average lease term of 13.2 years. On a revenue basis, 61% of 2020 acquisitions are from investment grade-rated tenants. 87% of the revenues are generated from retail and 13% are from industrial assets. These assets are leased to 56 different tenants in 26 industries, 2 of the most significant industries represented our grocery and home improvement. Of the $2.3 billion invested during 2020, nearly $1.4 billion was invested domestically in 220 properties at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 5.8% and with a weighted average lease term of 14.9 years. And approximately $921 million was invested internationally in 24 properties located in the U.K. at a weighted average initial cash cap rate of 6.1% and with a weighted average lease term of 10.8 years.
Transaction flow remains healthy as we sourced approximately $17.1 billion in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we sourced approximately $63.6 billion in potential transaction opportunities, the most we have ever reviewed in a given year. Of these opportunities, $42.4 billion were domestic opportunities and $21.2 billion were international opportunities. Investment-grade opportunities represented 50% of the volumes sourced during the year. Of the $63.6 billion sourced, 56% were portfolios and 44%, approximately $28.2 billion, were one-off assets. Of the $1 billion in total acquisitions closed in the fourth quarter, 66% were one-off transactions. Our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were healthy during the quarter, averaging approximately 130 basis points.
Moving to dispositions. During the quarter, we sold 60 properties for net proceeds of $77.5 million, realizing an unlevered IRR of 8.7%. This brings us to 125 properties sold during 2020 for $261 million at a net cash cap rate of 7.8%, and we realized an unlevered IRR of 11.6%. Our portfolio remains well diversified by clients, industry, geography and property type, which contributes to the stability of our cash flow. At year-end, our properties were leased to approximately 600 clients in 51 separate industries located in 49 states, Puerto Rico and the U.K. Approximately 84% of rental revenue is from our traditional retail properties. The largest component outside of retail is industrial properties at approximately 11% of rental revenue. Walgreens remains our largest tenant at 5.7% of rental revenue. Convenience stores remains our largest industry at 11.9% of rental revenue.
Within our overall retail portfolio, approximately 95% of our rent comes from tenants with a service, nondiscretionary and/or low price point component to that business. We continue to believe these characteristics allow our tenants to operate in a variety of economic environments and to compete more effectively with e-commerce. These factors have been particularly relevant in today's retail climate where the vast majority of recent U.S. retailer bankruptcies have been in industries that do not possess these characteristics. We remain constructive on the credit quality of the portfolio with over half of our annualized rental revenue generated from investment grade-rated tenants.
Occupancy based on the number of properties was 97.9% at year-end. During the fourth quarter, we re-leased 77 properties, recapturing 100.3% of the expiring rents. During 2020, we re-leased 314 properties, recapturing 100% of the expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have re-leased or sold over 3,500 properties with leases expiring, recapturing over 100% of rent on those properties that were re-leased.
In light of COVID-19, rent collection across our portfolio has remained stable over recent months. During the fourth quarter, we collected 93.6% of contractual rent due. And further improvement in rent collection percentages is primarily dependent upon improvements in the theater industry, which I will touch on shortly. We collected 100% of contractual rent for the fourth quarter from investment grade-rated tenants, which further validates the importance of a high-quality real estate portfolio, least to large well-capitalized clients.
While we have not historically prioritized investment grade-rated tenants as a primary objective, during periods of economic uncertainty, high-grade credit tenants tend to provide more reliable streams of income, as the last several quarters have exemplified. Our top 4 industries, convenience stores, grocery stores, drug stores and dollar stores, each sell essential goods and represent over 37% of rental revenue. And we have received nearly all of the contractual rent due to us from tenants in these industries since the pandemic began. Uncollected rent continues to be primarily in the theater industry, representing approximately 80% of uncollected rent in December.
As the theater industry remains challenged, I would like to update the investment community on our latest view. The industry represents 5.6% of our contractual base. While we do expect the industry to downsize in the future, we continue to believe it will remain a viable industry in a post-pandemic environment, especially for high-budget blockbuster movies. You might recall that the U.S. box office reached an all-time high as recent as 2018, and 2019 produced the highest-grossing worldwide film of all time since Avengers: Endgame.
We continue to believe, particularly for blockbuster movies, that a theatrical release will be the preferred distribution channel for studios going forward given the superior economics afforded to them versus streaming platforms. That said, we do acknowledge that the industry is changing and that there likely will be a rationalization of theaters in a post-pandemic reality. Under this scenario, underperforming theaters may not survive.
We continue to maintain a full reserve the outstanding receivable balance for 37 of our 77 total theater assets and continue to recognize revenue on a cash basis for these 37 assets. During the fourth quarter, we established a full reserve for 1 additional theater asset, and we disposed of 1 theater asset previously on cash accounting. To be clear, we do not expect to lose the entirety of rent associated with these properties longer term, even in the event of potential closures. As of year-end, the total allowance for these 37 theaters totaled $23.7 million, including $1.8 million of which is a straight-line rent receivable reserve and thus has no AFFO impact.
Moving on. Our same-store rental revenue decreased 3.2% during the quarter and 1.7% year-to-date. Our reported same-store growth includes deferred rent and unpaid rent that we have deemed to be collectible over the existing lease term but excludes rent where collectability is deemed less than probable. The decrease in same-store rental revenue is primarily driven by reserves we recognized in the theater industry and, to a lesser extent, the health and fitness industry.
Now to provide additional detail on our financial results for the quarter, I would like to hand it off to Christie."

I'm looking forward to working together with our teams to deliver our strategic objectives and realization of dreams and aspirations for all at Realty Income with Sumit and our Board of Directors. I also look forward to engaging with our investment community over time. We are grateful for the support of all of our loyal shareholders who have invested in Realty Income for over 26 years as a public company and for our future.
I would now like to provide a general overview of our recent financial results, starting with the balance sheet. We have continued to maintain our conservative capital structure and remain one of only a handful of REITs with at least 2 A ratings. During the quarter, we completed our debut public offering of Sterling-denominated senior unsecured notes, issuing GBP 400 million due 2030 for an effective annual yield to maturity of 1.71%. We also issued $725 million of senior unsecured notes in December through a dual-tranche offering of 5-year and 12-year notes, achieving record-low U.S. dollar coupon rates in the REIT sector for each of those tenors. Additionally, we raised approximately $655 million of equity during the quarter, primarily through our ATM program. And in January 2021, we raised approximately $670 million through an overnight equity offering, which we earmarked to prefund an active investment pipeline to start the year.
We ended the year with low leverage and strong coverage metrics with a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 5.3x or 5.2x on a pro forma basis, adjusting for the annualized impact of acquisitions and dispositions during the quarter. And our fixed charge coverage ratio remained strong at 5.1x. We ended the year with full availability under our $3 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility, no borrowings outstanding on our $1 billion commercial paper program and over $824 million of cash on hand. In January, we completed the early redemption of all $950 million 3.25% notes due 2022, which was done to reduce our near-term refinancing risk and take advantage of attractive borrowing rates in the fixed income market. Looking forward, our overall debt maturity schedule remains in excellent shape with only $44 million of debt maturities through year-end 2021, excluding commercial paper borrowings.
Now moving on to our income statement. AFFO per share during the quarter was $0.84 and $3.39 per the year on a fully diluted basis, representing annual growth of 2.1%. For 2020, our AFFO per share was negatively impacted by nonstraight-line rent reserves of $44.1 million, which represents approximately $0.13 per share of dilution, over half of which is attributed to the theater industry.
Now moving on to guidance. As we introduced our initial 2021 earnings estimate, we acknowledge that while some uncertainty related to the theater industry remains, together with the backdrop of the pandemic, our confidence in providing guidance is supported by the overall health and stability of our portfolio combined with the acquisition pipeline. To that end, our 2021 AFFO per share guidance of $3.44 to $3.49 represents approximately 1.5% to 3% growth over 2020.
Moving on to dividends. In December, we increased the dividend for the 109th time in our company's history. We have increased our dividend every year since the company's listing in 1994, growing the dividend at a compound average annual rate of approximately 4.4%. And we are proud to be one of only 3 REITs in the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index for having increased our dividend every year for the last 25 consecutive years.
And now I'd like to hand our call back over to Sumit."

Thank you. So at the end of the third quarter, we were right at 98.6%. And the question was asked, where do you think you're going to end the year at, and we had said that it was going to be right around 98%. And the fact that we came at 97.9% was fairly accurate. And what we saw coming was the NPC bankruptcy filing. As you might recall, we have approximately 150 assets with NPC, most of which happens to be the Pizza Hut. And then we have 19 assets that are Wendy's that's also run by NPC. We were expecting 66 assets to be rejected through the bankruptcy process. And that was the reason why we had guided the market to a 98 -- approximately a 98% occupancy number. We were -- and those 66 assets did come back to us during the fourth quarter, which is the largest driver of this 97.9%.
You will see that the net increase in vacant assets from third quarter to fourth quarter was circa 45 assets. So despite the fact that we got 66 assets back, we were able to resolve a lot more assets than we had originally thought because these assets are very well located, Vikram, and we were able to attract either QSRs that wanted to take some of these assets. And we feel very good about being able to resolve these assets fairly quickly. The other point I'll make is most of these Pizza Huts with NPC had less than 2 years remaining on their lease term. And so our asset management team had already begun the process of trying to figure out alternatives, knowing fully well that these were the assets that would come back, even if it were to have not filed bankruptcy.
So we feel pretty good about being able to resolve these assets. And as you can see from the resolution, we have the most number of resolutions in the fourth quarter. This was a record quarter for us. And so it's a testament to the team that we have in place, Ben and T.J., who drive that particular process for us, continue to do an absolutely amazing job despite the backdrop of the pandemic. And we are very hopeful that we will climb right back up above 98%. Look, we have frictional vacancy, and we've always suggested that to the group that because we want to have the ability to reposition some of these assets, we are always going to be in this 98% -- circa 98% occupancy rate because we do want to reposition some of these assets, which does take us time, and that will continue to be what we target going forward."

And what type of pricing differential are you seeing there?"

Good question, Haendel. As you pointed out, the lower cap rate was largely driven by the mix of assets that we purchased here in the U.S. If you look at the prepared remarks, I suggested that 29% of what we purchased here in the U.S. were industrial assets, single-tenant industrial assets. These were very well-placed assets with clients that were executing on their omnichannel strategy, had lease terms that were north of 10 years, some 15-year leases, good growth in markets that we wanted to enhance our exposure and with rents that were right around market rents. And so as you know, the industrial assets tend to be trading a lot more aggressively. And as such, that certainly had a bit of a downdraft on our cap rate, but the fact that we were able to do 5.2% for the U.S. assets was largely driven by that."

Look, we came out in early January with what our pipeline looked for the first quarter. And you might recall we had about $800 million -- slightly above $800 million that we had disclosed to the market at that time that we had in our pipeline, and we were 12 days into the year. So I don't think it should have come as a surprise that we had an incredibly healthy pipeline developed coming out of the fourth quarter. And if you look at what we were able to achieve in the fourth quarter of $1 billion, we had a tremendous amount of momentum that sort of carried forward into the first quarter and that has continued. It is also a testament to the amount of sourcing that we are able to do, the new swim lanes that we have created for ourselves to continue to grow the portfolio. And I think it's a testament to the strategy that we put in place a couple of years ago to be able to now post numbers that seem very large relative to what we had come out within years' past. But that's precisely the path that we wanted to go down.
You mentioned what is the expected cap rates. I think you should expected cap rates to be similar to what we achieved in 2020. And given the mix of portfolio, the optimal portfolio allocation that we have sort of highlighted to the market, it's really going to be a function of which particular portfolio or assets closed within a quarter as to whether the cap rates are going to come out. If it's going to have a slightly more industrial plan to it, it's going to be lower cap rates. If it's going to be more retail, it's going to have a slightly higher cap rate. Having said that, even retail, especially those types of retail that are deemed essential, portfolios are now trading in the mid-4s. And so the pricing environment has gotten a lot more aggressive. But thankfully, we have the cost of capital, and we were still able to generate 160 basis points of spread for the entire year, which is north of our historical spread. So we feel very good about the quality of assets we are buying and how we are reshaping our portfolio along the lines of what we had shared with the market in the third quarter, et cetera. So really, the cap rate is going to be a function of the composition of assets that we drive within a given quarter.
The last question you had talked about was 1031. And what is the impact or our ability to issue OP units. Well, it's not new for us. We have done this in the past. We've bought assets from retail shareholders who wanted to buy -- wanted to take OP units as consideration for proceeds, and we were able to satisfy that. So could I see that momentum picking up potentially to defer having to pay taxes? Absolutely. And we are very well equipped to take advantage of that and use our equity as currency to provide that to potential sellers. But having said all of that, 1031 is not a big part of our business, even on the disposition side. As you can see, most of the assets that we sell tend to be vacant assets, and that doesn't lend itself to the 1031 market. It's primarily developers or tenants who want to own their own assets that tend to play in that particular area.
And on the occupied side, a lot of the transactions we did in 2020 were existing tenants exercising their option to purchase. And that's the reason why we were able to generate very good proceeds and very good overall returns. And the opportunistic sales tend to be an area where perhaps we run into some 1031 buyers. But that, I would say, is about 25% of the sellers that we interact with. So for us, I think the -- on the disposition side, it's going to be fairly muted. On the acquisition side, I think not having 1031 be as aggressive, especially on the smaller boxes like QSRs and drug stores, et cetera, we could see cap rates increase because of the lack of 1031 buyers. And so that could potentially accrue to our benefit, especially when we are engaging in these one-off asset acquisitions."

But why don't I take that a little bit? And then I'll hand it off to Christie, if that's okay, Greg. For us, we wanted to make sure that we came out with a range that represented the facts on the ground today. And we wanted to make sure that the range was conservative enough where even if the situation were not to improve, and it was to be, as we have experienced early on in the year, in January and December of last year, that this is the range that we feel very comfortable with.
What I'm suggesting is that there could be a fair amount of upside to the range that we have shared. And it's largely a function of what's going to happen to the theater industry at large but also, to a smaller extent, to the health and fitness industry. And there, we feel very confident that the theater business is going to improve, especially with the vaccination having taken hold, and every day, we see more news about Pfizer and Moderna and now potentially J&J being on the approved list, that the acceleration of getting to a point where we have herd immunity is very realistic. And I've seen base case models that suggest that as early as end of June, we could get close to having herd immunity.
The other data point that I would point to, Greg, is what we have seen in China. And over the Chinese -- the Lunar New Year weekend, they had record ticket sales. And in fact, one of the movies that was shown had almost $50 million more in sales than the record that had been set by Avengers: Endgame here in the U.S. and in Canada in their opening weekend. And so all of these facts sort of lead us to believe that there is a possibility that there is a fair amount of upside on the assumptions that we have shown in our model. And that could help get us to the top end of the range. And if a lot of other things fall into place, potentially, we could do even better. So -- but we can't go out with that expectation. When you lay out all the various different scenarios, you come up with what's the probability weighted outcome, and that's what we have shared with the market.
But there are things that could play in our favor, and it really is a function of how you think about the theater industry and what you think the recovery is going to look like. And we've shared with you ad nauseam some of the assumptions that we have drawn in terms of taking 37 of our 77 assets and viewing it on a cash accounting basis and how that percolates through the base model. If your view shifts to say that's perhaps a bit too conservative, then there is good upside. And that's what we are super excited about. There are certainly other levers for us to play, like you correctly pointed out. The acquisition market is something we are super excited about. And part of it is intentional and part of it is a function of more and more operators and clients that we want to do business with, wanting to engage in sale-leaseback transactions. And so that too could act as a potential tailwind.
And look, we've come out with numbers. You've seen our history about the early estimates that we come out with and what we are able to achieve during the year. But not saying that -- but there, too, there could be some tailwinds. So there's acquisition fronts. There are assumptions that we have made about the theater business and the health and fitness business. There are assumptions we've made about how quickly we could get to a point where things are starting to normalize, et cetera. And all of those have room and capacity for potentially surprising on the upside. So we feel pretty good.
And I'll hand it back to Christie, if there's anything else you would like to add."

And -- but a lot of these have a floor and a ceiling associated with them. So yes, a rising CPI environment, we have some level of protection, but there does tend to be -- especially here in the U.S., there tends to be a floor and a ceiling associated with it. For us, the -- we've encountered this problem before. What happens in an inflationary environment? The fact that we have leases that are net lease in nature, we are less -- sort of less susceptible to an environment where inflation expectation and actual inflation goes up because so much of the cost either in insurance, property, taxes, et cetera, are paid by our tenants. And so from that perspective, we feel pretty good.
We started to see the 10-year treasury go up in anticipation of expected inflation going up. But thankfully, so far, our spreads have come down as well. And our all-in cost in the 10-year has gone up slightly but not dramatically. We can still issue 10-year, in today's environment, we think, right around the 2122 ZIP code. And that is still relative to what we've been able to do in the past, a very good all-in costs on the 10-year financing. So we feel pretty good about that. Some of this is now offset by what we are seeing in the U.K. as well as in Europe where interest rates continue to be low, inflation expectations are very much contained. And so there, our all-in cost of financing continues to be super exciting. And so the fact that we've created all of these different alternatives also helps us -- shield us somewhat from inflation expectations arising in particular geographies and so we feel pretty good about that as well. And the fact that we have long-term leases also is a benefit.
Look, at some point, if the inflation expectations are going up, and it is largely translating to better GDP growth, et cetera, that should translate to better fundamentals for our tenants. And so not so much this year, we only have about 1.7% of our leases expiring. But in future years, that should start to reflect on higher market rents, et cetera. And so especially in 2022, 2023, we have a bit more of expiration with regards to our leases, I could see us marking to market some of our leases during renewal time. And so I think from all of those perspectives, we feel pretty good.
One of the questions that often comes up, okay, if the interest rate environment continues to go up, it's going to impact your cost of capital, and that is absolutely true. But what we have found in prior cycles is that cap rates tend to follow suit as well. And there is definitely a lag, but it does sort of follow and then it allows us to continue to maintain the spreads that we have and, in certain situations, even enhance our spreads if the cap rate moves faster than our cost of capital. So we feel like we are very well positioned as a company. And based on some of the investments we've made and some of the areas that we have focused on, we feel like we are very well situated to handle an interest rate environment that increases, an inflationary expectation environment that increases."

And so the goal is to continue to look for transactions and not be constrained by geography but look for the right transactions.
And there are markets that we have identified in Western Europe that we would like to be able to grow into, but it's largely a function of do we have the right operators willing to transact at the right prices, et cetera, et cetera. So are we open to acquiring in Western Europe? The answer is a categorical yes. But do I expect to see something happen in Spain? I don't have a timeline for that. Or something in France or Italy or Germany, I don't have a timeline for you.

And I'm not trying to be facetious here, it is deemed an essential retail, and they have continued to perform. Having said that, the most important thing that we are trying to focus on is the fact that the operators that we want to do business with, they have an omnichannel strategy. If you look at the U.K. grocers that we have partnered with, they dominate the click-and-collect market, and they dominate the delivery services. And so most of the partners that we have, if you sort of unpack the 10% -- and it's not quite 10%, but it's getting there -- of our exposure, you'll find that all of the operators that we have done business with are -- substantially, all of the operators that we've done business with tend to have this omnichannel strategy, very well established or in the process of having it very well established. They have the wherewithal and the balance sheet to do so.
And I do think that, that is going to be the future of this particular industry, which is why we got very comfortable that it's not just the industry, but it's the operators that we have targeted within these industries that we have done business with. And they will be not only surviving but thriving in the new environment where, potentially, there is going to be more click and collect or delivery services. So we feel very good about our specific exposure within this industry. I don't know if this was a question or not as to whether -- are we sort of getting up against our limits with 10%. I would say no. Our investment policy allows us to go as high as 15%. And for certain industries, we can always go back to the Board and request exceptions. But of course, we have to put forth our thesis as to why it makes sense. But this is an industry we feel very comfortable with, Brent."

There's a reason why we have that sheet in our supplemental, and we want to lay it out as clearly as possible. This is another one of the avenues us to continue to gain exposure to certain clients and do it at a cap rate that is north of what you would be able to transact in the open market. And so it is about $160 million of commitment, $100 million of which is not funded yet. But if you look at the breakup, you will see that it's largely driven by 2 forward commitments we have on the nonretail side of the business. And so what that allows us to do is, again, enter into these contracts in a particular asset type that is trading super aggressively and be able to transact and get assets maybe 40, 50, 60 basis points north of where these assets would be trading have they been available today. And so I think that is part of the advantage of doing this. And this is, again, using our credit, using our scale and size to be able to get some of these assets at higher cap rates than what we would on the open market.
The other side of this is repositioning. I think it was Vikram who had asked about, hey, how are you thinking about these assets from NPC? We have a history of being able to reposition some of our assets and be able to really capture and enhance our rent from the same exact location by simply repositioning these assets. And that is something we've been doing for a few years. They tend to be smaller dollar amounts. But once again, we've given you that detail in the supplemental. And that will continue to be a bigger and bigger portion of our business. And I think as you've seen, the velocity of our lease terminations, et cetera, will only increase. And this part of our business, which we have seasoned over many years, will start to play a bigger, bigger role and will certainly, we hope, be a value-enhancing part of our business model. And so I would love to see this business continue to increase within the parameters of what I just shared with you and help us create another source of value creation for the overall business."

So there will be some level of rationalization. But the good news is there is a fair amount of demand for last-mile distribution, and there's much more of a focus on development of multifamily given some of the trends that we are seeing in some of these markets. So it is quite possible that these assets, given that they sit on potentially 10, 12, even 15 acres of land, could be repositioned to a higher and better use. But that question, Wes, I think, is going to be very specific to the particular location and where that particular theater falls in the performance rankings. And if it tends to be in the top 2 quartile, I would say that, yes, the likelihood of it remaining at theater is high. But if not, I could easily see it being repositioned, perhaps not easily but, certainly, repositioned."

What we had seen, even as late as last year, that there was a portfolio discount, not a portfolio premium. But there has -- we have seen a couple of portfolios come to market that have traded very expensively. And so I'm not quite sure where this trend is going to go, Todd. But -- and I think I mentioned this already that even some industries and some tenants that we had seen pre-pandemic are now trading at levels, as a portfolio, 40, 50 basis points lower. So it's tough to tell. I don't think it is a point that could be made across all industries and all operators. I do think that in most industries and especially the higher-yielding industries, if there's a portfolio transaction, you will tend to see a discount, not a premium. But in certain industries and the industries that are in favor today, we are certainly seeing a little bit of tightening.
With regards to $3.25 billion, we are not underwriting to very large portfolio transactions. That is not part of our overall forecast, Todd. So if that were to happen, I think that would be above and beyond the numbers that we have shared with you. And so that, too, could be a potential tailwind for our business. As you might know, there are several public sale-leaseback transactions in the market, none of which are reflected in the numbers that we have shared. With respect to cap rates, it is -- it has compressed. And it has compressed even over the last 5 months, 4 months. So whether it's retail here in the U.K., industrial, as you know, is probably steady but still fairly aggressive cap rates. It all has tended to become a lot more expensive today than it was 6 months ago.
In the U.K., thankfully, the cap rate market is a bit more stable. I wouldn't go so far as to say that it's compressing. But it's funny, we tend to do certain transactions where we are the only ones who are engaging in conversations, and then we will find 1 or 2 other potential buyers start to come in on subsequent transactions. So this is an interesting acquisitions environment that we find ourselves in right now. And -- but we feel very good. Again, the advantages that we have, we feel like we'll be able to get more than our share of transactions done, and we will continue to do it at spreads that will be very favorable and will help us drive earnings growth."

Net lease and what Realty Income is, is very different from those other companies in terms of the type of business, in terms of creating growth with this longer-duration net leases, really where the competitive advantage is the cost of capital and obviously, the relationships that the company has.

Now the way I would define large portfolios is $1 billion plus. Most peers would run into concentration questions doing half that size, especially if they already have a preexisting exposure to that particular client. But we find ourselves in the enviable position of being able to continue to increase the allocation for a given client, and it's largely a testament to the size of our overall business and balance sheet. But clearly, when you start talking $5 billion, $6 billion, those are types of transactions that don't come very often. And when they do, outside of us, I don't know if there is any other public net lease buyer that could potentially entertain absorbing that sort of size.
Then in terms of who are the alternative buyers of this, it's largely driven by what is available on the financing side of the equation. And ABS has become a preferred mechanism of financing these large-scale transactions, especially with highly rated operators. And then once those boxes are checked, you can pretty much assume some of the private equity folks getting involved and being super excited about playing in that size because they can put capital to work and lever up the portfolio to, call it, 85%, 90% and be able to get very -- enhance their cash-on-cash yield. So that's the group that would be the traditional competition for very large sale-leaseback opportunities with highly rated operators. But when interest rate starts to move in the direction that it has, then that does start to put pressure on some of these players because the cost of financing on that 80%, 90% leverage starts to creep up. So it really is going to have to be coupled with what we see in the financing market to help define who the potential competition could be."

The continued strength of our business is made possible by the incredible partnerships we have with all stakeholders. I would like to express my gratitude and appreciation to our Realty Income team, who continues to effectively execute our strategic objectives while enduring a sustained remote work environment.
As we've announced last week, we are excited to have reached a definitive merger agreement with VEREIT, which would further distance ourselves as a leader in the net lease industry and create a company with a combined enterprise value of approximately $50 billion. We believe shareholders of both companies will enjoy meaningful value creation through immediate earnings accretion and expanded platform with enhanced size, scale and diversification, driving further growth opportunities and strategic and financing synergies, which are enhanced by Realty Income's A rated balance sheet and access to well-priced capital.
We are very excited about the strategic transaction and look forward to continuing to drive future growth together as a combined enterprise. However, today, we will focus on what was a very successful first quarter for Realty Income. Our first quarter results illustrate our ability to grow through a variety of swing lanes afforded to us by our size and scale by completing over $1 billion in acquisitions. Notably, in this quarter, we invested approximately $403 million in high-quality real estate in the U.K., highlighting the continued strength of our international platform and bringing our total investment in the U.K. to over $2 billion since the first international acquisitions we closed in 2019.
Domestically, we invested $625 million in real estate, including our first ever acquisition in Hawaii, becoming the first and only REIT to own property in all U.S. states. Our accomplishments during the quarter continued to demonstrate the momentum in our business and highlight our ability to leverage our size and scale to drive our business forward in pursuit of sustainable growth.
On the subject of sustainable growth, our team continues to make tremendous progress through our ESG initiatives as ESG considerations continue to permeate throughout our organization at every level. In April, we published our inaugural Sustainability Report, which details our company's commitments, goals and progress to date with regard to environmental, social and government initiatives.
I invite all Realty Income stakeholders to share in our dedication to embrace a changing world for the benefit of all those we serve, and I encourage everyone listening to read our 2020 Sustainability Report found on the Corporate Responsibility page of our website. Additionally, we are excited to share an updated investor presentation with the marketplace. On the home page of our website, you can find our new deck, which highlights our fundamental business philosophies, key competitive advantages and plan for future growth.
Turning to results for the quarter. Our global investment pipeline remains a significant driver of growth for our business. Our business is simple. We seek to acquire high-quality real estate leased to leading operators in economically-resilient industries in pursuit of stable and increasing cash flow generation. Our confidence in continuing to grow our platform stems from the quality of our real estate portfolio, which is designed for resiliency through a variety of economic environments. Key to mitigating economic risk, we believe, in portfolio diversification by geography, client, industry and property type, as we continue to grow our real estate portfolio.
In the first quarter of 2021, we invested over $1 billion in high-quality real estate, and we remain very comfortable with our 2021 acquisition guidance of over $3.25 billion. On a total revenue basis, approximately 39% of total acquisitions during the quarter are leased to investment-grade rated clients, which brings our total investment grade client exposure for the portfolio to approximately 50%. Aligning with our ethos, the weighted average remaining lease term of the assets added to our portfolio during the quarter was 12.6 years. And at the end of the quarter, the weighted average lease term of our total portfolio was 8.9 years.
As of quarter end, our real estate portfolio includes over 600 clients who operate in 56 different industries. Approximately 84% of rental revenue comes from our traditional retail properties, while industrial properties generated about 11% of rental revenue.
With regard to our retail business, we seek to invest in industries with a service, nondiscretionary and/or low price point component to the business as we believe these characteristics make for economically resilient operations that can more effectively compete with e-commerce. As such, of our acquisitions during the quarter, the largest industry representative was grocery stores. Walgreens remains our largest client at 5.5% of rental revenue and convenience stores remain our largest industry at 12% of rental revenue.
Our investment philosophy primarily focuses on acquiring freestanding single-unit commercial properties leased to best-in-class clients under long-term net lease agreements typically in excess of 10 years. We believe the market is efficient. As such, we are seeing a competitive environment for high-quality assets leased to strong operators. Cap rates, as you all know, reflect an aggregation of many factors, including, but not limited to, fundamental real estate economics, lease term, credit of the client or their sponsor, rent relative to the market, average rent coverage by the operator and alternative use of the real estate. Accordingly, the quality of our acquisitions is reflected in our average initial cash cap rate during the first quarter of 5.3%.
Our size and scale allow us to be highly selective in pursuing investment opportunities that fit our stringent criteria. This quarter, we sourced nearly $20 billion of transaction opportunities ultimately investing in approximately 5% of the prospects sourced and reviewed. Additionally, our cost of capital allows us to invest accretively even when pursuing the highest quality assets.
During the first quarter, our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were 115 basis points. The quality of the assets we acquired flows through the entire life cycle of our portfolio allowing us to favorably recapture rent on expiring leases and maintain a healthy level of occupancy.
During the quarter, we released 54 units, recapturing 103.5% of expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have executed over 3,600 releases or sales on expiring leases, recapturing over 100% of rent on those re-leased contracts. And occupancy at quarter end was 98%. Our size and scale afford us the ability to execute large-scale sale-leaseback transactions, which are often sourced through existing partnerships with best-in-class clients, but also serve as an attractive way to establish new relationships.
The transaction we closed in Hawaii is an excellent example of the sale-leaseback opportunities we can execute. In this instance, we partnered with Par Petroleum to acquire 22 well-located convenience stores for approximately $116 million. All 22 properties fall under 1 triple-net master lease agreement with an initial 15-year lease term, and all assets are located in many main locations, primarily on the Island of Hawaii.
This quarter, about 24% of all acquisitions we closed were executed as sale-leaseback transactions. The merger between Realty Income and VEREIT will enhance our ability to execute large-scale leaseback transactions through expanded capacity to buy in bulk, which improve our competitive positioning when competing for portfolio or sale-leaseback transactions in the fragmented net lease industry. As we have previously articulated, the ability to buy at wholesale prices and at a discount to the one-off market is a competitive advantage. We are often one of only a handful of buyers for large-scale portfolio transactions, particularly those that would otherwise create untenable client or industry concentration issues for our competitors.
Pro forma for the closing of the transaction, we will have approximately $2.5 billion of annualized rental revenue. For every $1 billion of acquisition to a single creditor industry, our exposure to that creditor industry will increase by approximately 2% compared to around 3.5% based on our current size.
By leveraging our size and scale, we continue to effectively execute through our international platform via healthy acquisition volume in the U.K. Fundamentally, we are replicating our U.S. business strategy seeking to curate a high-quality real estate portfolio leads to leading operators in economically resilient industries. Our total first quarter acquisition volume includes approximately $403 million of international acquisitions in the U.K., which brings our total investment volume to more than $2 billion since the first transaction we closed in the U.K. in 2019.
Our international pipeline has accelerated even more quickly than originally anticipated. This quarter's international acquisition volume represents nearly 40% of our total investment volume during the quarter, a figure that is truly incremental to the U.S. business and one that we expect to grow.
Now I'll pass it over to Christie to provide financial updates."

I'll start with some high-level background and then move into our financial results for the quarter.
We are the only net lease REIT in the S&P 500, one of the top 10 largest U.S. REIT by enterprise value and the largest company in the net lease REIT sector. Upon closing our recently announced merger with VEREIT, Realty Income is expected to be the sixth largest REIT in the R&D in terms of equity market capitalization. Our size and scale in conjunction with our conservative balance sheet and financial strength have afforded us to a credit rating by the major rating agencies. And our $3 billion multicurrency revolver, grants with ample access to well-priced capital that allows us to opportunistically raise permanent long-term capital when the markets are most favorable.
During the quarter, we raised approximately $670 million through an overnight equity offering to reduce our financing risk by prefunding our active global investment pipeline. In January 2021, we completed the early redemption of all $950 million, 3.25% notes due in 2022 to take advantage of attractive borrowing rates in the fixed income market while reducing our near-term financing risk. This redemption was primarily funded through our December issuance of $725 million of senior unsecured notes through a dual tranche offering of a 5-year and 12-year note, which achieved record low U.S. dollar coupon rates in the REIT sector for each of those tenors. As a result, our fixed charge coverage ratio, I'm pleased to report, has hit an all-time high at 5.8x this quarter.
We believe funding our business with approximately 2/3 equity and 1/3 debt contributes to maintaining a conservative balance sheet. We ended the quarter with net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 5.3x or 5.2x on a pro forma basis adjusting for the annualized impact of acquisitions and dispositions during the quarter. And our near-term debt maturities remain minimal with only $26 million of debt maturing through year-end 2021, excluding our commercial paper program and borrowings outstanding on our revolving credit facility.
At the end of the first quarter, we had full availability of our $3 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility, $675 million outstanding under our $1 billion commercial paper program. And over $184 million of cash on hand, providing approximately $2.5 billion of liquidity available to capitalize on our active global investment pipeline.
During the quarter, our business generated $0.86 of AFFO per share, and we are maintaining our 2021 AFFO per share guidance of $3.44 to $3.49 on a stand-alone Realty Income basis, unadjusted for the expected merger. Remember, we currently have 37 of our 79 theater assets on cash accounting. These 37 theaters represent about $25.5 million of annual rent remaining in 2021. And we've reserved $33.2 million as allowance for bad debt on these assets net of $1.9 million of straight-line rent receivables. In total, this $58.7 million translates to approximately $0.15 that is not currently included in AFFO per share guidance. We are encouraged by the recent momentum in the theater space such as increased nationwide openings and the release of blockbuster films.
Most recently, Scott Bill versus Com brought in approximately $49 million during the opening weekend specifically Wednesday to Sunday and generated more than $390 million of revenue within the first 2 weeks of its global release, turning a profit of more than $200 million. However, until we are confident these particular theaters can continue to pay us contractual rent, we will continue to recognize revenue for these 37 theaters on a cash basis.
As a monthly dividend company, we would be remiss not to discuss the dividend when providing business results. In April, we declared our 610th consecutive monthly dividends, and we now increased the dividend 110x since our listing in the New York Stock Exchange in 1994. Since 1994, we have increased the dividend every year, growing dividends per share at a compound average annual growth rate of approximately 4.4%. And as a result of increasing the dividend every year for the past 25 consecutive years, we are proud to be a member of the exclusive S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which consists of only 3 REITs and 65 companies overall.
I would now like to hand our call back to Sumit."

And the credit enhancement that it achieved, the results that it is now posting, the fact that it gave -- that it paid 100% of the rent in the fourth quarter to VEREIT, all of that gave us confidence that it's turned the corner and being vertically integrated organization such as Thai Union is made us feel like 7% of the number that we can live with.

The question is, we've talked about how pro forma for this acquisition, it allows us to pursue larger transactions. I will say that you don't have multibillion-dollar transactions coming in every week. But when you do they can be a step growth opportunity just like a consolidation is in our industry. But given our size today, doing a multibillion-dollar transaction, we were somewhat constrained pursuing that. Even if it checked all the other boxes, i.e., we like the credit, we like the operator, we like the industry, we like the makeup of the real estate, we like the rent composition, et cetera, et cetera. You feel constrained, just given how much of your portfolio concentration gets impacted by a single tenant. But once you start to increase your platform, the ability to absorb larger transactions when they present themselves, certainly enhance it. And there have been opportunities, and I don't want to get into details where even in the past 12 months, there have been opportunities to pursue transactions, where given everything that we have, relationship to check the boxes across the spectrum, we were still constrained by the allocation that we had to be able to pursue this particular transaction single handedly. And those are the types of constraints that do get alleviated, the larger your platform becomes. And it does allow you to be able to present yourself as a one-stop shop for some of these very well-capitalized businesses, that we want to continue to be their one-stop shop, which we have been in this one example that I'm referencing.
So yes, I do think that post this consolidation that it will enhance our position to pursue transactions that we were somewhat constrained to do so in our current size and scale."

We are still in the process of collecting those inbounds and trying to figure out what's real from what's not real. We have been very clear that our -- the path that we control is the spin-off path. To answer your question more directly, it's essentially all of our office assets, along with the vast majority of the VEREIT office assets outside of the 6 assets that are constrained by a CMBS pool, which is cross-collateralized across multiple asset types.
So outside of the 6, our goal would be to basically spin off all of the remaining assets, which is in right around 97 properties, $182 million, $183 million in rent, weighted average lease circa 4, 76%, 77% investment-grade tenants, that's the makeup of the portfolio.

And it's -- the biggest contributor to that watch list is the Theater business. So they are very much tied. And our collection is also largely a function of the collection in the theater business. We feel, you ask me to give you a reference point as to how we feel about the theater business today versus when we first got into the pandemic, we feel a lot better today than we did then. There have been actual examples here in the U.S., which were preceded by example, playing out in China and in Japan, which lend credence to the hypothesis that we had that the theater business, once the contents were starting to get released and the social distancing norms were relaxed, that the theater business was going to be able to bounce back. That thesis has largely proven out to be the case, Ronald. I mean, if you look at the only 1 example that we currently have of a big blockbuster movie that came out, which was the Godzilla versus Kong. In the first 5 days, it generated right around $49 million. We've been tracking how it has done subsequent to that as well, and it's right in that high 80s right around $90 million is the collection here in the U.S. theaters.
If you look at it globally, it's close to $390 million. And the budget to make that movie was right around $180 million, $190 million. So $200 million profit largely being gathered through the theater release. And that just continues to lay credence to that as content starts to come in, as these theaters are allowed to open, AMC is largely open here in the U.S. Regal is still not. Regal is still targeting late -- mid- to late May to open up all of its theaters. And so we do believe that this election is going to become a function of the theaters opening. And based on the discussions that we've had with our operators, we continue to feel very optimistic that in the near term, those collection numbers will start to go up. But look, we are also blessed with a balance sheet to lend grace to some of these operators as long as we believe that their operating model is going to come through and it's going to be a viable business model going forward. And we genuinely believe that the theater industry and specifically, these 2 operators are going to be viable operators going forward. And so if we have the ability to lend our balance sheet, give them a little bit more grace in terms of stabilizing their operating business model. That's what we've done. And we feel very good about that decision."

Clearly, there are areas of the portfolio, one of which we touched on has turned the corner, but it wasn't something that we would have pursued in isolation 6 years ago when they chose to do that transaction. But by and large, I would say, we were pleasantly surprised when we underwrote all of their assets, all of their operators at the quality of the portfolio they had. And there was an to be made here for whatever reason, and we are grateful because it allowed us to create a lot of value for our business, that they were trading at a massive discount to what we believe is the inherent value, especially of their retail and industrial portfolio. And so the other point I would like to highlight is the fact that they are complementary to our focus. This is why things like convenience stores, which we are big fans of with certain operators, I want to qualify, allows us to go from 12% to 9% pro forma for the combination. It allows us to take our grocery from 10% to 8% because they don't have those allocations in their portfolio. And so that certainly helps us create additional capacity. Plus on the theater business, they didn't have much of an exposure. So it allows us to bring down our theater exposure from 5.7%, 5.6% to 3.8%. And which is starting to get closer to the optimal allocation that we have been talking about over the last couple of quarters. So pleasantly surprised on the upside, which is one of the main reasons why we decided to move forward. And we're so grateful that we found a like-minded person in Glen and his management team to move forward with a transaction that we genuinely believe is a win-win for both parties.

So Haendel, quarter-over-quarter these numbers are going to vary, and it is largely a function of the mix. If you're going to be heavily industrial focus, but the cap rates are going to be on the lower end, if you're going to be more retail focused i",654,"Yes. So Haendel, quarter-over-quarter these numbers are going to vary, and it is largely a function of the mix. If you're going to be heavily industrial focus, but the cap rates are going to be on the lower end, if you're going to be more retail focused it will be on the higher end. I'm making general comments. Obviously, there are exceptions to even to what I just said. But if you look at what drove the U.K. cap rate, it was largely 2 industrial transactions that we did with the same seller that we have a very good relationship with. One was an industrial asset in the Greater London area, highly sought, clearly, a last-mile location. And we got it at a cap rate we felt very comfortable owning this particular asset. Another one was in the suburbs of Birmingham. It's leased to a single-A credit. Again, a fantastic distribution center, below market rents. Something that we feel like is going to be super additive to our portfolio going forward. And that's what really drove the cap rate to where it was. Had we excluded those two, our cap rate would have been closer to where we did our fourth quarter U.K. transaction, which was, I believe, if I remember correctly, 5 6, 5 7 cap rate.
So it really is going to be a function of mix. It's going to be a function of which geography dominates, et cetera, et cetera. But I don't think you should expect the cap rate we posted in the first quarter to be the new norm. I would still say that we should average right in that mid-5s to slightly above that. That will be the goal. And in quarters where we do some more higher-yielding stuff because it's things that we found that the people are not focused on yet. We could see a potential 6. But it really is going to be a function of the mix. It's going to be a function of asset type, lease term geography, all of those things that go into defining what the -- what a quarter cap rate signifies. But I think the bigger point here is this is the second quarter in a row where we've done $1 billion. And I've seen a lot of numbers coming out talking about, oh, in order for them to get to the high single-digit growth rate. They're going to have to do $4 billion of acquisition. We welcome that challenge. In fact, we are excited about that challenge. And we've already talked about what creating these new verticals for us, new markets of growth for us has done to our sourcing numbers, which is now translating into actual close.
So for us, the numbers being posted, yes, for most net lease businesses, that's a staggering number. But for us, it's something that we welcome. And we also agree with the market that it is for us to show to you that we are capable of doing this on a quarter after quarter after quarter basis. So that's where the fun part is for us and the team. We look forward to that challenge, and we look forward to posting numbers with assets that doesn't compromise what we have said is our risk profile. And that's the key message here that we are doing all of this and we are growing a platform and we are growing our portfolio with the right type of industries, right operators, right geographies, right growth rates, all of the things that will create sustained value over the long term.
So I know you didn't quite ask that, but I just wanted to make sure that we have put the answer around cap rates in context to what it is that we are trying to do. And the sustainability of what it is that we are trying to do. So forgive me for that time."

If data is changing on the ground, if trends are changing, we are constantly trying to mark-to-market. But what we don't want to do is over-indexed to any near-term phenomenon. Just like we didn't over-index to the fact that, hey, the theater business and the health and fitness business really took a beating in an environment where you have social distancing requirements. And does that mean we should go down to 0 in both those businesses? The answer is no.
And so what we are trying to figure out is what are the trends, especially given the long-term nature of the leases that we enter into, what is the trend long term that we are going to underwrite to. And just because something creates a potential opportunity in near term, if we can't get comfortable with the long-term prospects, we will largely stay away from those types of situations.
Now that doesn't mean we don't get a few things wrong. And in hindsight, we don't go back saying, ""Oh, we should have played that a different way because our conclusion was inaccurate."" But we, I believe, have gotten more things right than wrong, and that has served us well. So the answer to your question is, without getting into specifics, that we are constantly trying to upgrade our thesis to reflect what's on the ground. But we don't try to overindex to it without taking into consideration the long-term impacts of those immediate trends that we are seeing.
I'll throw something out there, which is the exact opposite of what you're suggesting. I think there is an opportunity in the office sector. Now are we going to go into the office sector? No. There's a reason why we have said we are going to be spinning off all of our office assets. But I do believe that given the environment today and given how negative the sentiment is around the office asset type, there is value to be had. If somebody is willing to take a longer-term perspective on what is office going to look like? And that's the reason why we want to create a spin-off if that is the route we end up eventually effectuating. Why I -- we want to set it up for success.

Thank you.

Very good questions, Caitlin. Thank you. I should have actually completed my answer on the U.K. giving a little bit more color on the structuring side of the equation.
So we went into the U.K., recognizing that there's going to be an associated tax leakage. And when we underwrite transactions, we take into account what is our effective tax rate, what is the statutory tax rate? What's the effective tax rate? How much are we really making in terms of actual spreads? et cetera, et cetera. And of course, comparing it to the cost of capital, which is also much lower in the U.K. and seeing if it made sense, it made a lot of sense. And by and large, I think we are tracking to the effective tax rates that we had shared with the market 2 years ago in April of 2019.
What I would like to add, Caitlin, is there is a change that is being contemplated that would actually increase the statutory tax rate in the U.K. market. But what we have been exploring and hopefully, we'll be able to implement in the near term, is restructuring our Realty Income Limited, the legal entity that is housed there, where we will actually end up potentially saving 400 basis points off of our effective tax rate. So do you expect to see this -- the taxes being paid in the U.K. continuing to go up? Absolutely, you should. But not at the same rate as you have seen over the last 3 years. We are getting more efficient. We are structuring our transactions going forward in a manner where we are actually going to see on an effective basis, a decrease in the tax leakage associated with our investments. And we are constantly looking at how are we going to be financing this transaction? And does it still make sense? And the answer is a resounding yes, it does. And that's the reason why we are continuing to do what we're doing."

The guidance that you guys have put out assumes that same-store revenue improved as the year goes on. There was commentary earlier on hopefully improving theater collections and performance and acquisitions are expected to continue. But the AFFO guidance kind of barely implies any growth from the 1Q run rate. So I was just wondering why is that? How does the improving same-store revenues and acquisitions not translate into more meaningful AFFO for the guidance? Or is the AFFO guidance just pretty conservative at this point?"

I'll let you conclude that for yourself. But I do think Christie mentioned as to the 37 assets that are on cash accounting, so much of the improvement that could play out in the future has not been sort of reflected in the guidance that we have shown, but nor have we changed our cash accounting on those 37 assets. So we really -- if you want to use the word conservative, fine, we just really want to see actual collections go back up to levels that warrant a change in our thesis around cash accounting versus not. And then that will certainly translate to higher AFFO per share trend lines. But we tend to be a little bit more deliberate. And yes, things are looking very optimistic. But until it's not actually starting to reflect in closed monthly statements, we are going to stay the course. And obviously, what we have and the reason why we haven't adjusted is for the merger is because, first and foremost, there are conditions involved. And even if this were to close, it won't happen until the fourth quarter, which clearly would have a very minimal impact this year. And so for those reasons, we have kept the guidance exactly the same. We want to digest what we just announced last week. We also want to get another quarter under our belt and then we revisit earnings at the end of the second quarter and share with you what our latest thoughts are on that."

You could, but that will be more of a function of the size of the platform has just increased rather than getting disproportionately larger because there's a lot more assets on their side that we would want to recycle that. Time will tell, but I suspect that it will be commensurate with what we have established as a stand-alone company today."

Our desire to go to other geographies and other markets are largely being driven by our underwriting, our ability to absorb new markets, the team that we have in place, the maturity of our understanding of these various different markets, that's what's driving our desires. And so yes, could we do more because the scale benefits of absorbing $15 billion platform, the answer is absolutely yes. We can do more. And so I think that's where the benefit comes.

But again, it's a function of the mix where the development dollars are going. If it is going towards industrial assets, which you will see that it is, the vast majority of the capital is going towards takeout. And those cap rates, if they have a 5 in front of them, that's a great outcome. Because guess what happens once these assets are fully developed and you go out into the open market, and you try to buy it from the open market. It potentially has a low 4s, even a 3 handle in front of it. And that is the reason why we feel like, yes, these cap rates, headline cap rates may look low. But if you really dive in behind the numbers, And you're trying to figure out what is the product that they are being able to get through this development funding, takeout funding, whatever you want to call it versus what could they buy the same particular asset if it were available today? There is still 100 basis points, maybe 50 basis points, if you want to be conservative uplift that we are getting by partnering with some of these very well-established global developers. So that's really where the value creation is.
To answer your question more specifically, what do I see the yield on development. If you look at retail, when you look at retail development, it depends on whether it's a repositioning or a greenfield or what has it. On repositioning, that's where the maximum value creation occurs. We already have the piece of land, we go down the path of creating of repositioning an asset with the expectation that -- and I threw some of these numbers out at you, that we could have rents compared to the prerepositioning of 150, 200, even 300 basis -- 300 percentages of points. So that's the kind of uplift in value we could generate through this.
Now that is a small portion of our business, a very small portion. But I just want to put in perspective that you see a blended number. But if you go behind the number, there is a fair amount of value creation. And largely, we want to be viewed as a one-stop shop by our tenants, who know us as landlords that hold assets for the long term. And if we can help them harness our vacant asset portfolio by repositioning it for their needs. We want to be the certain. And that's the reason for having this. But in terms of how big is it going to become, what is the trend line going to look like. I -- it's going to be a function of what dominates in that 1 given quarter."

A lot more of it could come from the U.K., given the ARB between a 10 years sterling-denominated unsecured bond versus a U.S. unsecured bond. And we may choose, again, just to match fund our assets with locally denominated capital, we may choose to overlever some of those assets.

The continued strength of our business is made possible by the incredible partnerships we have with all stakeholders. I would like to express my gratitude and appreciation to our Realty Income team, who continues to effectively execute our strategic objectives while enduring a sustained remote work environment.
As we've announced last week, we are excited to have reached a definitive merger agreement with VEREIT, which would further distance ourselves as a leader in the net lease industry and create a company with a combined enterprise value of approximately $50 billion. We believe shareholders of both companies will enjoy meaningful value creation through immediate earnings accretion and expanded platform with enhanced size, scale and diversification, driving further growth opportunities and strategic and financing synergies, which are enhanced by Realty Income's A-rated balance sheet and access to well-priced capital. We are very excited about the strategic transaction and look forward to continuing to drive future growth together as a combined enterprise.
However, today, we will focus on what was a very successful first quarter for Realty Income. Our first quarter results illustrate our ability to grow through a variety of swim lanes afforded to us by our size and scale by completing over $1 billion in acquisitions. Notably, in this quarter, we invested approximately $403 million in high-quality real estate in the U.K., highlighting the continued strength of our international platform and bringing our total investment in the U.K. to over $2 billion since the first international acquisitions we closed in 2019.
Domestically, we invested $625 million in real estate, including our first ever acquisition in Hawaii, becoming the first and only REIT to own property in all U.S. states. Our accomplishments during the quarter continued to demonstrate the momentum in our business and highlight our ability to leverage our size and scale to drive our business forward in pursuit of sustainable growth.
On the subject of sustainable growth, our team continues to make tremendous progress through our ESG initiatives as ESG considerations continue to permeate throughout our organization at every level. In April, we published our inaugural Sustainability Report, which details our company's commitments, goals and progress to date with regard to environmental, social and government initiatives.
I invite all Realty Income stakeholders to share in our dedication to embrace a changing world for the benefit of all those we serve, and I encourage everyone listening to read our 2020 Sustainability Report found on the Corporate Responsibility page of our website. Additionally, we are excited to share an updated investor presentation with the marketplace. On the homepage of our website, you can find our new deck, which highlights our fundamental business philosophies, key competitive advantages and plan for future growth.
Turning to results for the quarter. Our global investment pipeline remains a significant driver of growth for our business. Our business is simple. We seek to acquire high-quality real estate leased to leading operators in economically resilient industries in pursuit of stable and increasing cash flow generation. Our confidence in continuing to grow our platform stems from the quality of our real estate portfolio, which is designed for resiliency through a variety of economic environments. Key to mitigating economic risk, we believe, in portfolio diversification by geography, client, industry and property type, as we continue to grow our real estate portfolio.
In the first quarter of 2021, we invested over $1 billion in high-quality real estate, and we remain very comfortable with our 2021 acquisition guidance of over $3.25 billion. On a total revenue basis, approximately 39% of total acquisitions during the quarter are leased to investment-grade rated clients, which brings our total investment grade client exposure for the portfolio to approximately 50%. Aligning with our ethos, the weighted average remaining lease term of the assets added to our portfolio during the quarter was 12.6 years. And at the end of the quarter, the weighted average lease term of our total portfolio was 8.9 years.
As of quarter end, our real estate portfolio includes over 600 clients who operate in 56 different industries. Approximately 84% of rental revenue comes from our traditional retail properties, while industrial properties generated about 11% of rental revenue.
With regard to our retail business, we seek to invest in industries with a service, nondiscretionary and/or low price point component to the business as we believe these characteristics make for economically resilient operations that can more effectively compete with e-commerce. As such, of our acquisitions during the quarter, the largest industry representative was grocery stores. Walgreens remains our largest client at 5.5% of rental revenue and convenience stores remain our largest industry at 12% of rental revenue.
Our investment philosophy primarily focuses on acquiring freestanding single-unit commercial properties leased to best-in-class clients under long-term net lease agreements typically in excess of 10 years. We believe the market is efficient. As such, we are seeing a competitive environment for high-quality assets leased to strong operators. Cap rates, as you all know, reflect an aggregation of many factors, including, but not limited to, fundamental real estate economics, lease term, credit of the client or their sponsor, rent relative to the market, average rent coverage by the operator and alternative use of the real estate. Accordingly, the quality of our acquisitions is reflected in our average initial cash cap rate during the first quarter of 5.3%.
Our size and scale allow us to be highly selective in pursuing investment opportunities that fit our stringent criteria. This quarter, we sourced nearly $20 billion of transaction opportunities, ultimately investing in approximately 5% of the prospects sourced and reviewed. Additionally, our cost of capital allows us to invest accretively even when pursuing the highest quality assets.
During the first quarter, our investment spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital were 115 basis points. The quality of the assets we acquired flows through the entire life cycle of our portfolio, allowing us to favorably recapture rent on expiring leases and maintain a healthy level of occupancy.
During the quarter, we re-leased 54 units, recapturing 103.5% of expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have executed over 3,600 re-leases or sales on expiring leases, recapturing over 100% of rent on those re-leased contracts. And occupancy at quarter end was 98%. Our size and scale afford us the ability to execute large-scale sale-leaseback transactions, which are often sourced through existing partnerships with best-in-class clients, but also serve as an attractive way to establish new relationships.
The transaction we closed in Hawaii is an excellent example of the sale-leaseback opportunities we can execute. In this instance, we partnered with Par petroleum to acquire 22 well-located convenience stores for approximately $116 million. All 22 properties fall under 1 triple-net master lease agreement with an initial 15-year lease term, and all assets are located in many main locations, primarily on the Island of Oahu.
This quarter, about 24% of all acquisitions we closed were executed as sale-leaseback transactions. The merger between Realty Income and VEREIT will enhance our ability to execute large-scale leaseback transactions through expanded capacity to buy in bulk, which improve our competitive positioning when competing for portfolio or sale-leaseback transactions in the fragmented net lease industry. As we have previously articulated, the ability to buy at wholesale prices and at a discount to the one-off market is a competitive advantage. We are often one of only a handful of buyers for large-scale portfolio transactions, particularly those that would otherwise create untenable client or industry concentration issues for our competitors.
Pro forma for the closing of the transaction, we will have approximately $2.5 billion of annualized rental revenue. For every $1 billion of acquisition to a single creditor industry, our exposure to that creditor industry will increase by approximately 2% compared to around 3.5% based on our current size.
By leveraging our size and scale, we continue to effectively execute through our international platform via healthy acquisition volume in the U.K. Fundamentally, we are replicating our U.S. business strategy, seeking to curate a high-quality real estate portfolio leased to leading operators in economically resilient industries. Our total first quarter acquisition volume includes approximately $403 million of international acquisitions in the U.K., which brings our total investment volume to more than $2 billion since the first transaction we closed in the U.K. in 2019.
Our international pipeline has accelerated even more quickly than originally anticipated. This quarter's international acquisition volume represents nearly 40% of our total investment volume during the quarter, a figure that is truly incremental to the U.S. business and one that we expect to grow.
Now I'll pass it over to Christie to provide financial updates."

I'll start with some high-level background and then move into our financial results for the quarter.
We are the only net lease REIT in the S&P 500, one of the top 10 largest U.S. REIT by enterprise value and the largest company in the net lease REIT sector. Upon closing our recently announced merger with VEREIT, Realty Income is expected to be the sixth largest REIT in the RMZ in terms of equity market capitalization. Our size and scale in conjunction with our conservative balance sheet and financial strength have afforded us 2 A credit ratings by the major rating agencies. And our $3 billion multicurrency revolver grants us ample access to well-priced capital that allows us to opportunistically raise permanent long-term capital when the markets are most favorable.
During the quarter, we raised approximately $670 million through an overnight equity offering to reduce our financing risk by prefunding our active global investment pipeline. In January 2021, we completed the early redemption of all $950 million, 3.25% notes due in 2022 to take advantage of attractive borrowing rates in the fixed income market while reducing our near-term financing risk. This redemption was primarily funded through our December issuance of $725 million of senior unsecured notes through a dual tranche offering of a 5-year and 12-year note, which achieved record low U.S. dollar coupon rates in the REIT sector for each of those tenors. As a result, our fixed charge coverage ratio, I'm pleased to report, has hit an all-time high at 5.8x this quarter.
We believe funding our business with approximately 2/3 equity and 1/3 debt contributes to maintaining a conservative balance sheet. We ended the quarter with net debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio of 5.3x or 5.2x on a pro forma basis adjusting for the annualized impact of acquisitions and dispositions during the quarter. And our near-term debt maturities remain minimal with only $26 million of debt maturing through year-end 2021, excluding our commercial paper program and borrowings outstanding on our revolving credit facility.
At the end of the first quarter, we had full availability of our $3 billion multicurrency revolving credit facility, $675 million outstanding under our $1 billion commercial paper program, And over $184 million of cash on hand, providing approximately $2.5 billion of liquidity available to capitalize on our active global investment pipeline.
During the quarter, our business generated $0.86 of AFFO per share, and we are maintaining our 2021 AFFO per share guidance of $3.44 to $3.49 on a stand-alone Realty Income basis, unadjusted for the expected merger. Remember, we currently have 37 of our 79 theater assets on cash accounting. These 37 theaters represent about $25.5 million of annual rent remaining in 2021. And we've reserved $33.2 million as allowance for bad debt on these assets net of $1.9 million of straight-line rent receivables. In total, this $58.7 million translates to approximately $0.15 that is not currently included in AFFO per share guidance. We are encouraged by the recent momentum in the theater space such as increased nationwide openings and the release of blockbuster films.
Most recently, Godzilla vs. Kong brought in approximately $49 million during the opening weekend, 5 days specifically Wednesday to Sunday and generated more than $390 million of revenue within the first 2 weeks of its global release, turning a profit of more than $200 million. However, until we are confident these particular theaters can continue to pay us contractual rent, we will continue to recognize revenue for these 37 theaters on a cash basis.
As a monthly dividend company, we would be remiss not to discuss the dividend when providing business results. In April, we declared our 610th consecutive monthly dividend, and we now increased the dividend 110x since our listing in the New York Stock Exchange in 1994. Since 1994, we have increased the dividend every year, growing dividends per share at a compound average annual growth rate of approximately 4.4%. And as a result of increasing the dividend every year for the past 25 consecutive years, we are proud to be a member of the exclusive S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which consists of only 3 REITs and 65 companies overall.
I would now like to hand our call back to Sumit."

But once you start to increase your platform, the ability to absorb larger transactions when they present themselves, certainly enhance it. And there have been opportunities, and I don't want to get into details when even in the past 12 months, there have been opportunities to pursue transactions, where given everything that we have, relationship to check the boxes across the spectrum, we were still constrained by the allocation that we had to be able to pursue this particular transaction single-handedly. And those are the types of constraints that do get alleviated, the larger your platform becomes. And it does allow you to be able to present yourself as a one-stop shop for some of these very well-capitalized businesses, that we want to continue to be their one-stop shop, which we have been in this one example that I'm referencing.
So yes, I do think that post this consolidation that it will enhance our position to pursue transactions that we were somewhat constrained to do so in our current size and scale."

But thank you for asking the question. Yes. Look, we've been pleasantly surprised by the inbounds. We are still in the process of collecting those inbounds and trying to figure out what's real from what's not real. We have been very clear that our -- the path that we control is the spin-off path. To answer your question more directly, it's essentially all of our office assets, along with the vast majority of the VEREIT office assets outside of the 6 assets that are constrained by a CMBS pool, which is cross-collateralized across multiple asset types.
So outside of the 6, our goal would be to basically spin off all of the remaining assets, which is right around 97 properties, $182 million, $183 million in rent, weighted average lease circa 4, 76%, 77% investment-grade tenants, that's the makeup of the portfolio. But as we had thought would happen, once we announced, there have been inbound calls, we are just gathering in the information, but it is still too early to tell what's real from what's not. We are going to continue down the path that we control. And if something were to happen in the meantime, that's great. But it's too early to tell."

And it's -- the biggest contributor to that watch list is the theater business. So they are very much tied. And our collection is also largely a function of the collection in the theater business.
We feel -- you ask me to give you a reference point as to how we feel about the theater business today versus when we first got into the pandemic, we feel a lot better today than we did then. There have been actual examples here in the U.S., which were preceded by example, playing out in China and in Japan, which lend credence to the hypothesis that we had that the theater business, once the contents were starting to get released and the social distancing norms were relaxed, that the theater business was going to be able to bounce back.
That thesis has largely proven out to be the case, Ronald. I mean if you look at the only 1 example that we currently have of a big blockbuster movie that came out, which was the Godzilla vs. Kong. In the first 5 days, it generated right around $49 million. We've been tracking how it has done subsequent to that as well, and it's right in that high 80s right around $90 million is the collection here in the U.S. theaters.
If you look at it globally, it's close to $390 million. And the budget to make that movie was right around $180 million, $190 million. So $200 million profit largely being gathered through the theater release. And that just continues to lay credence to that as content starts to come in, as these theaters are allowed to open. AMC is largely open here in the U.S. Regal is still not. Regal is still targeting late -- mid- to late May to open up all of its theaters.
And so we do believe that this election is going to become a function of the theaters opening. And based on the discussions that we've had with our operators, we continue to feel very optimistic that in the near term, those collection numbers will start to go up. But look, we are also blessed with a balance sheet to lend grace to some of these operators as long as we believe that their operating model is going to come through and it's going to be a viable business model going forward. And we genuinely believe that the theater industry and specifically, these 2 operators are going to be viable operators going forward. And so if we have the ability to lend our balance sheet, give them a little bit more grace in terms of stabilizing their operating business model, that's what we've done. And we feel very good about that decision."

But there's one thing I want to point out that when we take a look at the momentum as it relates to the collection rates in theaters, it's steady and improving. So stabilized from year-end, we were about 10% collection. And then throughout the quarter, we've gained momentum to build towards 16%.

Ronald, they've got 3,500 properties that has been constructed over the last 11 years since they became public. Clearly, there are areas of the portfolio, one of which we touched on has turned the corner, but it wasn't something that we would have pursued in isolation 6 years ago when they chose to do that transaction. But by and large, I would say, we were pleasantly surprised when we underwrote all of their assets, all of their operators at the quality of the portfolio they had. And there was an ARB to be made here for whatever reason, and we are grateful because it allowed us to create a lot of value for our business, that they were trading at a massive discount to what we believe is the inherent value, especially of their retail and industrial portfolio.
And so the other point I would like to highlight is the fact that they are complementary to our focus. This is why things like convenience stores, which we are big fans of with certain operators, I want to qualify, allows us to go from 12% to 9% pro forma for the combination. It allows us to take our grocery from 10% to 8% because they don't have those allocations in their portfolio. And so that certainly helps us create additional capacity. Plus on the theater business, they didn't have much of an exposure. So it allows us to bring down our theater exposure from 5.7%, 5.6% to 3.8% and which is starting to get closer to the optimal allocation that we have been talking about over the last couple of quarters.
So pleasantly surprised on the upside, which is one of the main reasons why we decided to move forward. And we're so grateful that we found a like-minded person in Glen and his management team to move forward with a transaction that we genuinely believe is a win-win for both parties. So yes, super happy to absorb that retail and industrial portfolio into the pro forma Realty Income business."

So Haendel, quarter-over-quarter, these numbers are going to vary, and it is largely a function of the mix. If you're going to be heavily industrial-focused, but the cap rates are going to be on the lower end, if you're going to be more retail-focuse",650,"Yes. So Haendel, quarter-over-quarter, these numbers are going to vary, and it is largely a function of the mix. If you're going to be heavily industrial-focused, but the cap rates are going to be on the lower end, if you're going to be more retail-focused, it will be on the higher end. I'm making general comments. Obviously, there are exceptions to even to what I just said.
But if you look at what drove the U.K. cap rate, it was largely 2 industrial transactions that we did with the same seller that we have a very good relationship with. One was an industrial asset in the Greater London area, highly sought, clearly, a last-mile location. And we got it at a cap rate we felt very comfortable owning this particular asset.
Another one was in the suburbs of Birmingham. It's leased to a single A credit. Again, fantastic distribution center, below market rents. Something that we feel like is going to be super additive to our portfolio going forward. And that's what really drove the cap rate to where it was. Had we excluded those two, our cap rate would have been closer to where we did our fourth quarter U.K. transaction, which was, I believe, if I remember correctly, 5.6%, 5.7% cap rate.
So it really is going to be a function of mix. It's going to be a function of which geography dominates, et cetera, et cetera. But I don't think you should expect the cap rate we posted in the first quarter to be the new norm. I would still say that we should average right in that mid-5s to slightly above that. That will be the goal. And in quarters where we do some more higher-yielding stuff because it's things that we found that the people are not focused on yet, we could see a potential 6. But it really is going to be a function of the mix. It's going to be a function of asset type, lease term, geography, all of those things that go into defining what the -- what a quarter cap rate signifies.
But I think the bigger point here is, this is the second quarter in a row where we've done $1 billion. And I've seen a lot of numbers coming out talking about, oh, in order for them to get to the high single-digit growth rate, they're going to have to do $4 billion of acquisition. We welcome that challenge. In fact, we are excited about that challenge. And we've already talked about what creating these new verticals for us, new markets of growth for us has done to our sourcing numbers, which is now translating into actual close.
So for us, the numbers being posted, yes, for most net lease businesses, that's a staggering number. But for us, it's something that we welcome. And we also agree with the market that it is for us to show to you that we are capable of doing this on a quarter after quarter after quarter basis. So that's where the fun part is for us and the team. We look forward to that challenge, and we look forward to posting numbers with assets that doesn't compromise what we have said is our risk profile. And that's the key message here that we are doing all of this and we are growing a platform and we are growing our portfolio with the right type of industries, right operators, right geographies, right growth rates, all of the things that will create sustained value over the long term.
So I know you didn't quite ask that, but I just wanted to make sure that we have put the answer around cap rates in context to what it is that we are trying to do and the sustainability of what it is that we are trying to do. So forgive me for that Haendel."

If data is changing on the ground, if trends are changing, we are constantly trying to mark-to-market. But what we don't want to do is over-index to any near-term phenomenon. Just like we didn't over-index to the fact that, hey, the theater business and the health and fitness business really took a beating in an environment where you have social distancing requirements. And does that mean we should go down to 0 in both those businesses? The answer is no.
And so what we are trying to figure out is what are the trends, especially given the long-term nature of the leases that we enter into, what is the trend long term that we are going to underwrite to. And just because something creates a potential opportunity near term, if we can't get comfortable with the long-term prospects, we will largely stay away from those types of situations.
Now that doesn't mean we don't get a few things wrong. And in hindsight, we don't go back saying, ""Oh, we should have played that a different way because our conclusion was inaccurate."" But we, I believe, have gotten more things right than wrong, and that has served us well. So the answer to your question is, without getting into specifics, that we are constantly trying to upgrade our thesis to reflect what's on the ground. But we don't try to over-index to it without taking into consideration the long-term impacts of those immediate trends that we are seeing.
I'll throw something out there, which is the exact opposite of what you're suggesting. I think there is an opportunity in the office sector. Now are we going to go into the office sector? No. There's a reason why we have said we are going to be spinning off all of our office assets. But I do believe that given the environment today and given how negative the sentiment is around the office asset type, there is value to be had. If somebody is willing to take a longer-term perspective on what is office going to look like. And that's the reason why we want to create a spin-off if that is the route we end up eventually effectuating.
Why I -- we want to set it up for success. And it is a play on what we are seeing near term. And then it's forecasting out that trend line to see what do we think is going to happen to office 5, 7, 10 years from now. Where do we see growth? Yes, growth. I use that word with office. Where do we see opportunities? And there is an argument to be made that, that could play out. So time will tell."

Very good questions, Caitlin. Thank you. I should have actually completed my answer on the U.K. giving a little bit more color on the structuring side of the equation.
So we went into the U.K., recognizing that there's going to be an associated tax leakage. And when we underwrite transactions, we take into account what is our effective tax rate, what is the statutory tax rate? What's the effective tax rate? How much are we really making in terms of actual spreads, et cetera, et cetera. And of course, comparing it to the cost of capital, which is also much lower in the U.K. and seeing if it made sense, it made a lot of sense. And by and large, I think we are tracking to the effective tax rates that we had shared with the market 2 years ago in April of 2019.
What I would like to add, Caitlin, is there is a change that is being contemplated that would actually increase the statutory tax rate in the U.K. market. But what we have been exploring and hopefully, we'll be able to implement in the near term, is restructuring our Realty Income Limited, the legal entity that is housed there, where we will actually end up potentially saving 400 basis points off of our effective tax rate.
So do you expect to see this -- the taxes being paid in the U.K. continuing to go up? Absolutely, you should. But not at the same rate as you have seen over the last 2 years. We are getting more efficient. We are structuring our transactions going forward in a manner where we are actually going to see on an effective basis, a decrease in the tax leakage associated with our investments. And we are constantly looking at how are we going to be financing this transaction? And does it still make sense? And the answer is a resounding yes, it does. And that's the reason why we are continuing to do what we're doing."

We just really want to see actual collections go back up to levels that warrant a change in our thesis around cash accounting versus not. And then that will certainly translate to higher AFFO per share trend lines.
But we tend to be a little bit more deliberate. And yes, things are looking very optimistic. But until it's not actually starting to reflect in closed monthly statements, we are going to stay the course. And obviously, what we have and the reason why we haven't adjusted is -- for the merger is because, first and foremost, there are conditions involved. And even if this were to close, it won't happen until the fourth quarter, which clearly would have a very minimal impact this year. And so for those reasons, we have kept the guidance exactly the same. We want to digest what we just announced last week. We also want to get another quarter under our belt and then we revisit earnings at the end of the second quarter and share with you what our latest thoughts are on that."

But yes, it takes time. And yes, that means more -- they're sitting on more nonoccupied assets. But we are very comfortable doing that if that is the right economic solution to do. So -- and just to put things in perspective, that 131 was 140 at the end of the fourth quarter because we got 65 of our NPC assets back. And the team was able to not only absorb the first quarter expirations, but make a dent and a pretty good one on those assets that were handed back in the NPC transaction.
I am super comfortable with the team that we have and the asset management team that is led by TJ. They are a phenomenal group. And what we would like to be able to do is when we absorb VEREIT is to be able to implement the same business model, which is the reason why we think we want to hold on to a lot of their folks and potentially share our business model with them and try to generate the same types of results that we've been able to generate on a stand-alone basis.

But again, it's a function of the mix where the development dollars are going. If it is going towards industrial assets, which you will see that it is, the vast majority of the capital is going towards takeout. And those cap rates, if they have a 5 in front of them, that's a great outcome. Because guess what happens once these assets are fully developed and you go out into the open market, and you try to buy it from the open market. It potentially has a low 4s, even a 3 handle in front of it.
And that is the reason why we feel like, yes, these cap rates, headline cap rates may look low. But if you really dive in behind the numbers, and you're trying to figure out what is the product that they are being able to get through this development funding, takeout funding, whatever you want to call it versus what could they buy the same particular asset if it were available today. There is still 100 basis points, maybe 50 basis points, if you want to be conservative uplift that we are getting by partnering with some of these very well-established global developers. So that's really where the value creation is.
To answer your question more specifically, what do I see the yield on development. If you look at retail, when you look at retail development, it depends on whether it's a repositioning or a greenfield or what have you. On repositioning, that's where the maximum value creation occurs. We already have the piece of land, we go down the path of creating -- of repositioning an asset with the expectation that -- and I threw some of these numbers out at you, that we could have rents compared to the prerepositioning of 150, 200, even 300 basis -- 300 percentages of points. So that's the kind of uplift in value we could generate through this.
Now that is a small portion of our business, a very small portion. But I just want to put in perspective that you see a blended number. But if you go behind the number, there is a fair amount of value creation. And largely, we want to be viewed as a one-stop shop by our tenants, who know us as landlords that hold assets for the long term.

But we do not want to do anything that's going to compromise our A- A3 rating. Now the mix of where that debt comes from could absolutely change. A lot more of it could come from the U.K., given the ARB between a 10 years sterling-denominated unsecured bond versus a U.S. unsecured bond. And we may choose, again, just to match fund our assets with locally denominated capital, we may choose to overlever some of those assets.
But there is a threshold beyond, which we are not going to go even on a stand-alone basis. But yes, we can certainly have more of the mix coming from the U.K. given the lower cost there than the U.S. And then if you look at it on a fully consolidated basis, it's going to have the same profile that you would expect of an A3- rated company.

Building enduring relationships is inherent in all of our stakeholders for their continued support. I would like to express my appreciation to all of my colleagues who continue to relentlessly pursue our growth initiatives, while in the sustained remote work environment. 
We are pleased with the momentum across all facets of our business, which is reflected in our revised 2021 AFFO per share guidance of $3.53 to $3.59. Our increased guidance range represents an improvement of 2.7% at the midpoint compared to our prior range as well as an improvement of 5% at the midpoint versus last year and is a function of several tailwinds to our business: first, an increase to our 2021 acquisition volume guidance to approximately $4.5 billion; second, the continued improvement in rent collections from our theater clients; third, our well-priced capital markets
activity since the start of June, which further positioned our balance sheet for continued growth; fourth, our active asset management activities, which resulted in occupancy of 98.5% at quarter end and rent recapture rates in excess of 104% on lease expirations during the quarter; fifth, the overall quality of our portfolio, which has been curated, refined and underwritten over our 52-year history continues to perform throughout a variety of environments. 
We'll discuss each of these elements in greater detail shortly. 
Year-to-date, we have added approximately $2.2 billion of high-quality real estate to our portfolio, including $1.1 billion of new acquisitions in the second quarter. 
We continue to expand our platform as our size and scale remain key competitive advantages that translate directly into shareholder value. 
This quarter, we sourced more than $20 billion of acquisition opportunities, ultimately selecting and closing on less than 6%. 
On a total revenue basis, approximately 54% of the acquisitions made during the quarter are leased to investment-grade rated clients, which brings our total investment-grade client exposure to approximately 50%. 
The weighted average remaining lease term of the assets added to our portfolio during the quarter was 11.5 years. 
The largest industry represented in our second quarter acquisitions was U.K. grocery stores, and 7-Eleven remains our largest client. 
We remain well diversified as our portfolio consists of over 6,700 assets leased to approximately 630 clients who operate in 58 separate industries located in all 50 U.S. states, Puerto Rico and the U.K. And during the quarter, we continued to generate healthy investment spreads of approximately 172 basis points while acquiring, in our view, the highest quality product in the marketplace. 
The quality of our acquisitions is evident throughout the entire life cycle of our portfolio as we have consistently demonstrated favorable recapture rates on expiring leases while maintaining a healthy occupancy level throughout a variety of economic cycles. 
During the quarter, we re-leased 58 units, recapturing 104.7% of expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have executed over 3,700 re-leases or sales on expiring leases, recapturing over 100% of rent on these re-leased contracts. And occupancy at quarter end was 98.5% based on property count. 
Our international investment activities continue to support our growth outlook, and our U.K. portfolio has now grown to over $2.7 billion. This quarter, the U.K. accounted for over 50% of the $1.1 billion of total acquisitions only. 
Year-to-date, we've added approximately $1 billion in high-quality real estate in the U.K. across 41 properties. And of the more than $21 billion in acquisitions opportunity that we sourced, approximately 31% is related to international markets. 
As we continue to expand our international platform, we will look for additional geographies that offer opportunities similar to that of the U.K. We seek to acquire real estate in markets where opportunities are abundant. There is considerable demand for sale-leaseback transactions from industry-leading operators, and the local real estate can generate long-term IRRs in excess of our long-term cost of cabin. 
At this time, I'll pass it over to Christie, who will further discuss results from the quarter."

We continue to prioritize a conservative balance sheet structure while procuring attractively priced capital. 
At quarter end, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 5.4x and 5.3x on a pro forma basis, adjusting for the annualized impact of acquisitions and dispositions during the quarter. I would note that these ratios are before our $9.2 million share offering, which closed subsequent to quarter end. 
Our fixed charge coverage ratio hit an all-time high for the second quarter in a row, coming in at 6.0x. And during the quarter, we raised over $457 million of equity primarily through our ATM program. 
Subsequent to quarter end, we executed on 2 capital-raising activities to further enhance the strength of our balance sheet. In July, we raised approximately $594 million to an overnight equity offering. Proceeds were used to pay down short-term borrowings and support our active global investment pipeline. Additionally, in July, we issued our debut green bond, a GBP 750 million multi-tranche denominated unsecured bond offering of 6 years and 12-year notes, priced at a combined all-in rate of 1.48% and a weighted average term of approximately 8.8 years. 
We're proud to be the first net lease REIT to demonstrate our commitment to our ESG initiatives with a green bond. This green bond creates further partnership opportunities with our clients to implement sustainable practices at the properties within our portfolio, providing support for environmentally conscious initiatives while achieving mutual sustainability goals. 
And we estimate that over 40% of the proceeds have already been allocated to existing green projects. More information about our green financing framework can be found on the corporate responsibility page of our website. 
This quarter, our business generated $0.88 of AFFO per share. And as Sumit mentioned, increasing greater rent collections are one of the drivers of our improved earnings outlook for 2021. 
In June, we collected approximately 51% of contractual theater rents. And in July, we collected 98.9% of our contractual theater rent. As a reminder, we own 79 total theater properties, which account for 5.4% of our annualized contractual rent. 42 of our theater assets are not on cash accounting, and we continue to recognize 100% of revenue on these assets on an accrual basis, consistent with our accounting treatment during the duration of the pandemic. The remaining 37 theater assets are currently on cash accounting, meaning we will not recognize any revenue associated with these clients until it has been received. These clients accounted for $34 million of annualized contractual rent or about $2.8 million of contractual rent per month. 
During the second quarter, we collected 38.3% of theater rent. The rent collections from June and July represented a significant improvement from prior periods. Our theater clients paid us 14% of contractual rent in the first quarter and an average of 31% in April and May. Assuming the pace of collections we recognize to the theater industry in July continues on through the remainder of the year, we would not expect to accrue any additional theater reserves going forward. 
We believe the increased rent collections reflect significant positive momentum in the theater industry. One after another, the latest blockbusters continue to demonstrate a return to normalcy for the theater industry. In mid-July, opening weekend of Black Widow brought in approximately $158 million in revenue globally, earning the record for the biggest opening weekend since the pandemic. 
We are cautiously optimistic the momentum we're seeing will continue while closely monitoring the COVID-19 variants. 
As a monthly dividend company, our mission is to invest in people and places to deliver dependable monthly dividends that increase over time. In July, we declared our 613th consecutive monthly dividends, and we have now increased the dividend 111x since our listing on the New York Stock Exchange in 1994. Since 1994, we have increased the dividend every year, growing dividends per share at a compound average annual growth rate of approximately 4.4%. And as a result, it's increasing the dividend every year for the last 25 consecutive years. 
We're proud to be a member of the exclusive S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which consists of only 3 REITs and 65 companies overall. 
Now I would like to hand our call back to Sumit."

In terms of our volume, look, this is a continuation of a theme that we started the year with. And as you might recall, Nate, January, we had come out with a very robust pipeline. 
We've already sourced year-to-date more than $40 billion. And clearly, at the run rate that we've been able to achieve over the last 3 quarters and year-to-date, you can have a sense for the robustness of the pipeline. 
And I think the biggest surprise for us has been our -- the volume that we've been able to generate in the U.K., some of which sort of translated to what we were able to accomplish in the second quarter. But even if you look year-to-date, it's representing about 40% of acquisitions. 
And the quality of the product that we're continuing to see, the relationships that we've been able to establish and grow in the U.K. during a very short period over the last 2 years is a testament to why we feel very comfortable with having increased our acquisition guidance by another $1.25 billion given that we are clipping away at $1 billion. 
So in terms of the pipeline, we are very happy with what we are seeing. We are very comfortable with the product that we are seeing. And I think this is -- this trend is going to continue. In terms of the makeup, you might have seen that depending on the quarter, anywhere between 25% to 30% of what we are acquiring is industrial. 
In the second quarter, 15% of overall acquisition was industrial, largely driven by about 35% industrial in the U.S. And we -- again, on the relationship front have been able to make a fair amount of progress, are seeing acquisition opportunities, sometimes before it even hits the market and being able to try to get some of these transactions over the finish line with the relationships that we have developed. And I think you should expect to see this 15% to 25% of our volume coming from the industrial side of the equation in terms of asset type continue over the next few quarters. 
In terms of cap rate, look, it's a very aggressive market. I think in previous calls, I've mentioned that cap rates have continued to compress, tighten whatever the right word is. And it's -- I think it's a testament to certainly the type of products that we are pursuing, but more so to the fact that net lease is a very unique way of investing in real estate that is very specific. 
And as such, for the type of products that we pursue, we have continued to see cap rates compress. And by the way, this is across the spectrum on the credit curve. It's not just on the investment grade side. In fact, I'd argue on the investment grade side, the compression has been more muted on a relative basis versus what we have seen on the high-yield side of the equation. So -- and that trend is continuing, and we saw that in the second quarter as well. 
I believe on the industrial front, it has continued to tighten, but it has -- the speed with which it's tightening has certainly slowed down. And we're seeing products on the industrial side for well-located assets in the high 3% cap rate, low 4% [indiscernible] on the rare occasion, high 4%, low 5% ZIP code depending on location. 
On the retail side, it's a similar story for high-quality assets with long lease terms, good growth, you're seeing in the low 4% to low 5% ZIP code. And then if you're willing to compromise on lease term or growth rates or what have you, perhaps credit, you can see transactions transacting in the mid-5% to low 7% ZIP code. But the stuff that one buys in the high 6s, low 7%, that has credit profiles, lease terms, et cetera, that obviously has a much higher risk profile associated to it. 
So I don't know if I got all your questions in, Nate, but please let me know if I missed something."

Look, in terms of predicting what can happen in the future, some of what you see is publicly available. You have seen some large companies come out and say as part of their financing, sale leaseback is going to be a source of capital, and they've come out with multibillion dollar numbers. And those are the ones that are obvious, both you've seen that here in the U.S. and you've seen that in the U.K. as well, with some of the M&A work that happened and large sale-leaseback opportunities on the industrial front in one specific transaction in the U.K. and then there was a retail client here in the U.S. that has come out with something like that. 
But I think what we would like to be able to change is to proactively go and be a solution for transactions that may not be in the public eye. And given the fact that we will have the size and scale, it is more difficult for me to predict as to how many of those opportunities can we create. 
When you talk to large companies and you go in there and you say, ""Oh, we can do -- we can take $1 billion of your real estate off the balance sheet."" Sometimes that's not meaningful enough to engage in a conversation. I mean, here, we are talking about $70 million, $80 million, $100 million companies, and that sort of capital doesn't really move the needle for them. 
And so what we are very optimistic about is to be able to use our pro forma on larger scale to be able to have more aggressively some of these conversations that we started a few years ago. And the feedback that we had received was, ""Oh, yes, thanks a lot, just not big enough for us to be meaningful to engage."" 
And so I think those conversations, we hope to get over the finish line and create more opportunities. But Catlin, I can't sit here and tell you that there will be 1 or 2 of those transactions per year. I think we have to view those where we are generating those transactions on our own as opportunistic. And time will tell as to how many of those we can sort of get over the finish line. But even if you were to just look at the ones that are not opportunistic, the ones that are [indiscernible] M&A capital strategies, you're starting to see a lot more today than you ever did in the past. And I've just referenced 2 transactions in the recent, call it, 5 months, 6 months period. 
I'm not trying to suggest that you should extrapolate that. But those types of transactions didn't see the light of day 3 years ago, 4 years ago. And so that's what gives us confidence that being a larger company will allow us to more proactively take advantage of these opportunities that present themselves. and be that one-stop shop, which even with our current size, we sometimes fall short."

And again, what gives us a lot of confidence is if you look at our collection numbers in July, which we shared with you, it's about 99%. And some could argue over that 99% may have built in a lot of abatements and a reduction in rent that you might have passed on to clients. And I just want to make sure that we make it very clear that it doesn't. 
I mean, if you look at the numbers, and we've put this out publicly, if you look at the abatement number, it's about slightly more than $1 million on $1.6 billion of rent. So it's about 90 basis points is what we have -- not even actually, it's a lot less than that, what we have updated, and these are largely to smaller operators. So when we collecting above 99% on rent that has largely not been abated, it's very similar to what we had pre-COVID that should be a testament to the credit profile of the tenants that we are exposed to, and that is by design. 
So we feel very good about where we are and especially with every month that goes by this continued optimism that we have in our ability to get back to pre-pandemic levels without having to give abatements, I think, is a testament to the credit quality of our operators."

And obviously, if we -- as our portfolio has grown and now it's about $2.7 billion in the U.K., a lot of these third-party providers provide services that we can accommodate internally at margins that are superior to what we were getting outsourcing those particular functions. 
So as we have grown, we are bringing in-house more and more of these services. One of the other things that we are trying to look at and consider is as we grow into additional markets, and we believe that to be a matter of time, where is it that we should be domiciled, et cetera? And that work has -- we've made a tremendous amount of progress on that front as well. 
So before we bring in some of these functions in-house, we wanted to make sure that we were structured appropriately to accommodate our continued growth in Europe. And so there will be more to come on that front, but we will certainly be able to create synergies by bringing some of these outsourced services in-house. And it's largely going to be a function of where we ultimately decide to be headquartered to help support the European expansion. And -- but those discussions are ongoing, and we'll have more to report on that front as and when we establish our operations, et cetera."

And we were hoping to actually close on a few transactions that were slightly more higher yielding in the first quarter that slipped into the second quarter, which is the primary reason for this higher cap rate. 
In terms of competition, every day that goes by, I'm exaggerating, of course, the competition in the U.K. is increasing. I think people have started to realize that, that is a market that affords good risk-adjusted returns. And so I don't see competition as being the dictate as to whether we should increase, decrease the quantum of transactions that we pursue in the U.K.. We have a very defined -- clearly defined strategy in the U.K. And if there are transactions that we see, if they meet those particular criteria, we pursue it and we pursue it aggressively. And I think that's what's going to dictate the amount of volume. 
Now clearly, the volume has increased, and part of it is because it took us a while to establish ourselves, establish our name and establish those -- the reputation that we have and the relationships that we've built. But if there are opportunities and more opportunities to -- if the volume of opportunities increase, you can totally see us increasing the amount of acquisitions that we get over the finish line in the U.K. But we're going to be very true to our strategy that we laid out, and that's not to say it's a static strategy that doesn't get looked at, and it doesn't get added to or subtracted from. It's just something that we spend a lot of time first figuring out what is the right product to pursue and then react to that strategy that we have thoughtfully laid out for ourselves. So it could be volume of acquisitions increase as more and more products start to come to the fourth [indiscernible] For sure, it could. 
Is competition increasing? Yes. But I think the way for us to think about our international strategy is to think in terms of newer markets to continue to add to the volume of overall acquisitions, not necessarily do more in a given location."

But I will say that as we have become more visible in given geographies, just like we did in the U.K., people are getting familiar with our names. And so there might have been transactions that we might not have seen 2 years ago or 1.5 years ago, that we are now seeing because people understand that we -- they understand what we were able to do in the U.K. That reputation has translated to Continental Europe.

So Haendel, when you say U.K., we've been looking at transactions in Scotland, Wales and England. Those are the 3 countries that we focused on. 
So the fact that we have closed on a particular transaction, and I don't recall off the top of my head whether we did or we didn't, is not new. We -- from the time we've gone into the U.K., we've been looking at all 3 countries -- not Northern Island yet, just to be clear. 
The cap rate is really a function of what gets closed in a given quarter handle. As you know, the industrial market is trade at lower cap rates, especially if it has the lease term, et cetera. And it's a similar story on the retail front as well. Perhaps it's slightly higher than the industrial side, but not that much higher, especially if it has lease term and it's with 1 of the top 3 operators, top 4 operators on the grocery side of the business. 
So it really is a question of whether it's industrial or retail. Within retail, is it grocery or home improvement? What is the duration of the lease term? All of that goes into the mix to define what the cap rate is. And yes, within the 3 countries as well, there is a slight discrepancy in terms of cap rates, what a similar asset would trade in Scotland versus in England. But it's a function of all of those various factors that go into what the cap rate is for a given transaction. 
And we have, like I have said before, a very clearly defined strategy. And depending on what gets over the finish line, that translates to the cap rates that we've shared. So this particular quarter, it was about 6%. And in the first quarter, it was in the low 5s. So it blended out to -- in the mid- to high 5% cap rates, which I think is what one should expect going forward."

And -- but if we do, and it just happens to have a high 6% cap rate associated with it, and the fact that we have certain competencies on our asset management and leasing side of the equation, which we believe are true competencies that are -- that make us based on some of the results that we've shared, we feel a lot better about being able to pursue those opportunities. 
And the more assets that we reposition, et cetera, the better we are able to underwrite some of the risk that's inherent in the high-yielding opportunities that we see. And so as we continue to build on our competency of repositioning assets and being able to generate spreads that are north of what the existing spreads were, I think we will look at more higher-yielding opportunities.

So Ronald, it's a long -- the range of cap rates that I've shared with you that we are seeing in the market on assets that we are pursuing, I do think that where we have seen compression, the retails continue -- the retail assets continue to compress more today than the industrial assets. And -- but we hear stories of certain transactions that happen at cap rates that we've never seen before. And -- but I would consider that to be one-off, but it is a question of a lot of capital chasing, the same set of products that we find ourselves interested in. And that has resulted in the environment that we find ourselves. 
Having said all of that, we are still generating -- in the second quarter, we generated over 170 basis points in spread, which is better than our average spread over the duration of our history of acquiring assets. So even in this environment, we are very competitive and we are able to grow our portfolio and generate above-average spreads. 
So we feel very good about where we are, but I don't think that it's a sustainable environment where cap rates continue to compress, especially if it's -- funny I say this, but the 10-year trading in the 1 15, 1 16 ZIP Code, but where the expectation is that inflation should come in and interest rates at some point will start to go back up.

I think, Brent, what AMC was able to do is largely along the lines of what their CEO has suggested to the market that they now are sitting on plenty of capital, where they can play offense and where they see opportunities with assets that are well located, but the operator is no longer there or is in a distressed situation, they're going out and buying out the operators. That I think is very prudent. 
We haven't been in the market trying to sell our assets or anything like that. We had a thesis that we have shared with you and with the market about the theater business as an industry. We've also shared with you that the assets that we believe we have tend to be very well located and, in terms of performance, are in the top 2 quartiles a vast majority of our assets. 
And so our expectations have always been that this business will come back, and we will start to collect 100% of our rent and that our operators will start to pay back some of the deferred rent, which in one case has already started. 
But I did see some news around assets having traded, and I think it might have been 1 of our peer companies that sold a couple of layer assets. But we really are not playing in the market rent. For us, it was more of about in the off chance that we do get some of these assets back, how can we reposition them. And I think I've made comments in the past around our confidence in being able to reposition some of these assets just given their location and given the demand for alternative use. 
So -- but we haven't been looking to buy more assets nor have we been looking to sell any or theater asset. So can't really comment on that outside of what I saw in the press."

But traditionally, we had always seen a discount on the portfolio transactions vis-a-vis what you see in the one-off market. And my expectation would be that in order to facilitate multibillion-dollar sale-leaseback transactions that, that discount will continue to be there vis-a-vis the one-off markets. But time will tell. 
We certainly have seen a compression on that discount, but I believe that there will have to be a discount in order for an institutional buyer like ourselves to continue to engage. Otherwise, what's the difference? We could pick these assets off in the one-off market, and we certainly have the infrastructure to do that. So that's my belief."

If we were to do a similar issuance here in the U.S., I think the delta would be 30 to 40 basis points, maybe even larger. 
Now obviously, the environment today is very different from when we went to the market. But nevertheless, I saw a quote not just too long ago, on a 10-year unsecured bond, it was 1.95, 1.98. And we got August a 9-year weighted average on the bond issuance that we just did, and that was at 1 4 8. So yes, that 50 basis point delta continues to be there, and that's really the advantage that we have, that we have assets that could be financed with capital being raised locally. And so that's where the cost of capital advantage comes in."

And did I hear you correctly, it seems like at the beginning of the call, you were kind of indicating that maybe you're looking to -- I know you've historically always been in industrial, but maybe you can further grow that platform? 
And if so, I mean, how has your kind of underwriting on industrial assets changed over the years? I mean, maybe this is a misconception on my part, but I've always kind of thought of your industrial investments being primarily kind of high investment-grade rated tenants on long kind of lease term. Has there been any push into areas that maybe have shorter duration leases, maybe some of the more I guess, less name brand tenants in an industrial asset, just anything on that front and how that platform is evolving."

So John, I think we've been asked this question around our industrial portfolio and what is the allocation that we would like to see in an optimal portfolio. And we've said circa 20%. 
Today, we are right around 12%. So our desire is to grow that asset time to the 20% ZIP code. So I don't think your question is around why are we doing it. I think you premised your question by saying we have been in industrial. So I think that hasn't changed. Obviously, as we have underwritten industrial assets now for over 10 years, I think our first investment was in 2010, 2011 time frame. 
We have evolved in terms of being able to take on assets that may have only 9 years left on a lease rather than what we used to feel comfortable around doing 10 years ago, which was 15-year leases or 20-year leases and potentially doing it only through the sale-leaseback channels rather than providing capital for takeouts, et cetera. 
And so clearly, on the lease term, we are very comfortable taking on high single digit, mid-single-digit lease terms, if we can get very comfortable with the market and inherent rent and what the price per square feet is for given assets and what the market can looks like on future rental growth as well as alternative tenants that could step in. And if that allows us to pursue some transactions, we will absolutely do that. 
We are very proud of our industrial asset management team. And we share with you the renewals and the releases that we have on a blended basis. And those types of numbers have continued to give us confidence to grow our business and to grow our platform and to bring in more and more people along with the team that we already have. That's very comfortable playing across a lease term plan across the credit spectrum, et cetera. Having said all of that, we are still predominantly investment grade. But we are very comfortable playing across the credit spectrum on the industrial side, if we believe it's well located with good real estate metrics associated with it."

And once you look at the mix, you pursue a particular strategy. And that's largely what's driving the decision-making process. And what we found was, yes, that some of the assets that we sold actually were the bankrupt assets, that we were -- that we got back from NPC. 
They were in high demand, but not for re-lease. They were in high demand with folks that wanted to buy these assets outright. And when you look at the return profile, it was superior to us holding it and trying to find a new client that could step into those assets. 
Having said that, there are some assets that we actually re-leased to new clients as well. So it's a combination of strategies that we execute, but the underlying premise and the goal has always been what is going to maximize our returns and whichever -- whatever that answer is that it's selling its data versus finding a new tenant, that's dictated by this return profile."

Building enduring relationships is inherent to our purpose as an organization, and I would like to thank all of our stakeholders for their continued support. I would like to express my appreciation to all of my Realty Income colleagues who continue to relentlessly pursue our growth initiatives while in this sustained remote work environment. 
We are pleased with the momentum across all facets of our business, which is reflected in our revised 2021 AFFO per share guidance of $3.53 and $3.59. Our increased guidance range represents an improvement of 2.7% at the midpoint compared to our prior range as well as an improvement of 5% at the midpoint versus last year, and is a function of several tailwinds to our business.
First, an increase to our 2021 acquisition volume guidance to approximately $4.5 billion; second, the continued improvement in rent collections from our theater clients; third, our well-priced capital markets activity since the start of June, which further positioned our balance sheet for continued growth; fourth, our active asset management activities, which resulted in occupancy of 98.5% at quarter end, and rent recapture rates in excess of 104% on lease expirations during the quarter; fifth, the overall quality of our portfolio, which has been curated, refined and underwritten over our 52-year history continues to perform throughout a variety of environments.
We'll discuss each of these elements in greater detail shortly. Year-to-date, we have added approximately $2.2 billion of high-quality real estate to our portfolio, including $1.1 billion of new acquisitions in the second quarter. We continue to expand our platform as our size and scale remain key competitive advantages that translate directly into shareholder value. This quarter, we sourced more than $20 billion of acquisition opportunities, ultimately selecting and closing on less than 6%. On a total revenue basis, approximately 54% of the acquisitions made during the quarter are leased to investment-grade rated clients, which brings our total investment-grade client exposure to approximately 50%. 
The weighted average remaining lease term of the assets added to our portfolio during the quarter was 11.5 years. The largest industry represented in our second quarter acquisitions was U.K. grocery stores, and 7-Eleven remains our largest client. We remain well diversified as our portfolio consists of over 6,700 assets leased to approximately 630 clients who operate in 58 separate industries located in all 50 U.S. states, Puerto Rico and the U.K. And during the quarter, we continued to generate healthy investment spreads of approximately 172 basis points while acquiring, in our view, the highest quality product in the marketplace. 
The quality of our acquisitions is evident throughout the entire life cycle of our portfolio as we have consistently demonstrated favorable recapture rates on expiring leases while maintaining a healthy occupancy level throughout a variety of economic cycles. During the quarter, we re-leased 58 units, recapturing 104.7% of expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have executed over 3,700 re-leases or sales on expiring leases, recapturing over 100% of rent on these re-leased contracts. And occupancy at quarter end was 98.5% based on property count.
Our international investment activities continue to support our growth outlook, and our U.K. portfolio has now grown to over $2.7 billion. This quarter, the U.K. accounted for over 50% of the $1.1 billion of total acquisitions only. Year-to-date, we've added approximately $1 billion in high-quality real estate in the U.K. across 41 properties. And of the more than $21 billion in acquisitions opportunity that we sourced, approximately 31% is related to international markets.
As we continue to expand our international platform, we will look for additional geographies that offer opportunities similar to that of the U.K. We seek to acquire real estate in markets where opportunities are abundant. There is considerable demand for sale-leaseback transactions from industry-leading operators, and the local real estate can generate long-term IRRs in excess of our long-term cost of capital.
At this time, I'll pass it over to Christie, who will further discuss results from the quarter."

We continue to prioritize a conservative balance sheet structure while procuring attractively-priced capital. At quarter end, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 5.4x or 5.3x on a pro forma basis, adjusting for the annualized impact of acquisitions and dispositions during the quarter. I would note that these ratios are before our $9.2 million share offering, which closed subsequent to quarter end. Our fixed charge coverage ratio hit an all-time high for the second quarter in a row, coming in at 6.0x, and during the quarter, we raised over $457 million of equity primarily through our ATM program.
Subsequent to quarter end, we executed on 2 capital-raising activities to further enhance the strength of our balance sheet. In July, we raised approximately $594 million to an overnight equity offering. Proceeds were used to pay down short-term borrowings and support our active global investment pipeline. Additionally, in July, we issued our debut green bond, a GBP 750 million multi-tranche denominated unsecured bond offering of 6 years and 12-year notes, priced at a combined all-in rate of 1.48% and a weighted average term of approximately 8.8 years.
We're proud to be the first net lease REIT to demonstrate our commitment to our ESG initiatives with a green bond. This green bond creates further partnership opportunities with our clients to implement sustainable practices at the properties within our portfolio, providing support for environmentally-conscious initiatives while achieving mutual sustainability goals, and we estimate that over 40% of the proceeds have already been allocated to existing green projects. More information about our Green Financing Framework can be found on the corporate responsibility page of our website.
This quarter, our business generated $0.88 of AFFO per share, and as Sumit mentioned, increasing greater rent collections are one of the drivers of our improved earnings outlook for 2021. In June, we collected approximately 51% of contractual theater rents, and in July, we collected 98.9% of our contractual theater rent. As a reminder, we own 79 total theater properties, which account for 5.4% of our annualized contractual rent. 42 of our theater assets are not on cash accounting, and we continue to recognize 100% of revenue on these assets on an accrual basis, consistent with our accounting treatment during the duration of the pandemic.
The remaining 37 theater assets are currently on cash accounting, meaning we will not recognize any revenue associated with these clients until it has been received. These clients accounted for $34 million of annualized contractual rent or about $2.8 million of contractual rent per month. During the second quarter, we collected 38.3% of theater rent. The rent collections from June and July represented significant improvement from prior periods. Our theater clients paid us 14% of contractual rent in the first quarter and an average of 31% in April and May.
Assuming the pace of collections we recognize that the theater industry in July continues on through the remainder of the year, we would not expect to accrue any additional theater reserves going forward. We believe the increased rent collections reflect significant positive momentum in the theater industry. One after another, the latest blockbusters continue to demonstrate a return to normalcy for the theater industry. In mid-July, opening weekend of Black Widow brought in approximately $158 million in revenue globally, earning the record for the biggest opening weekend since the pandemic. We are cautiously optimistic the momentum we're seeing will continue while closely monitoring the COVID-19 variants.
As a monthly dividend company, our mission is to invest in people and places to deliver dependable monthly dividends that increase over time. In July, we declared our 613th consecutive monthly dividends, and we have now increased the dividend 111 times since our listing on the New York Stock Exchange in 1994. Since 1994, we have increased the dividend every year, growing dividends per share at a compound average annual growth rate of approximately 4.4%. And as a result, it's increasing the dividend every year for the last 25 consecutive years. We're proud to be a member of the exclusive S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which consists of only 3 REITs and 65 companies overall.
Now I would like to hand our call back to Sumit."

So I hope to attempt to answer all of them, but I might miss a few. In terms of our volume, look, this is a continuation of a theme that we started the year with. And as you might recall, Nate, January, we had come out",707,"Nate, thank you for your questions. So I hope to attempt to answer all of them, but I might miss a few. In terms of our volume, look, this is a continuation of a theme that we started the year with. And as you might recall, Nate, January, we had come out with a very robust pipeline. We've already sourced, year-to-date, more than $40 billion. And clearly, at the run rate that we've been able to achieve over the last 3 quarters and year-to-date, you can have a sense for the robustness of the pipeline.
And I think the biggest surprise for us has been our -- the volume that we've been able to generate in the U.K., some of which sort of translated to what we were able to accomplish in the second quarter. But even if you look year-to-date, it's representing about 40% of acquisitions. And the quality of the product that we're continuing to see, the relationships that we've been able to establish and grow in the U.K. during a very short period over the last 2 years is a testament to why we feel very comfortable with having increased our acquisition guidance by another $1.25 billion given that we are clipping away at $1 billion. So in terms of the pipeline, we are very happy with what we are seeing. We are very comfortable with the product that we are seeing. And I think this is -- this trend is going to continue.
In terms of the makeup, you might have seen that depending on the quarter, anywhere between 25% to 30% of what we are acquiring is industrial. In the second quarter, 15% of overall acquisition was industrial, largely driven by about 35% industrial in the U.S. And we, again, on the relationship front, have been able to make a fair amount of progress, are seeing acquisition opportunities, sometimes before it even hits the market and being able to try to get some of these transactions over the finish line with the relationships that we have developed. And I think you should expect to see this 15% to 25% of our volume coming from the industrial side of the equation in terms of asset type continue over the next few quarters.
In terms of cap rate, look, it's a very aggressive market. I think in previous calls, I've mentioned that cap rates have continued to compress, tighten, whatever the right word is. And it's -- I think it's a testament to certainly the type of products that we are pursuing, but more so to the fact that net lease is a very unique way of investing in real estate that is very specific. And as such, for the type of products that we pursue, we have continued to see cap rates compress. And by the way, this is across the spectrum on the credit curve. It's not just on the investment-grade side. In fact, I'd argue on the investment-grade side, the compression has been more muted on a relative basis versus what we have seen on the high-yield side of the equation. So -- and that trend is continuing, and we saw that in the second quarter as well.
I believe on the industrial front, it has continued to tighten, but it has -- the speed with which it's tightening has certainly slowed down. And we are seeing products on the industrial side for well-located assets in the high 3% cap rate, low 4% ZIP code to, on the rare occasion, high 4%, low 5% ZIP code depending on location.  On the retail side, it's a similar story. For high-quality assets with long lease terms, good growth, you're seeing in the low 4% to low 5% ZIP code. And then if you're willing to compromise on lease term or growth rates or what have you, perhaps credit, you can see transactions transacting in the mid-5% to low 7% ZIP code. 
But the stuff that one buys in the high 6s, low 7%, that has credit profiles, lease terms, et cetera, that obviously has a much higher risk profile associated to it. So I don't know if I got all your questions in, Nate, but please let me know if I missed something."

Look, in terms of predicting what can happen in the future, some of what you see is publicly available. You have seen some large companies come out and say as part of their financing, sale-leaseback is going to be a source of capital, and they've come out with multibillion dollar numbers.  And those are the ones that are obvious, both you've seen that here in the U.S. and you've seen that in the U.K. as well, with some of the M&A work that happened and large sale-leaseback opportunities on the industrial front in one specific transaction in the U.K. and then there was a retail client here in the U.S. that has come out with something like that.
But I think what we would like to be able to change is to proactively go and be a solution for transactions that may not be in the public eye. And given the fact that we will have the size and scale, it is more difficult for me to predict as to how many of those opportunities can we create. When you talk to large companies and you go in there and you say, ""Oh, we can do -- we can take $1 billion of your real estate off the balance sheet."" Sometimes that's not meaningful enough to engage in a conversation. I mean, here we are talking about $70 billion, $80 billion, $100 billion companies, and that sort of capital doesn't really move the needle for them.
And so what we are very optimistic about is to be able to use our pro forma larger scale to be able to have more aggressively some of these conversations that we started a few years ago. And the feedback that we had received was, ""Oh, yes, thanks a lot. Just not big enough for us to be meaningful to engage."" And so I think those conversations, we hope to get over the finish line and create more opportunities. But Caitlin, I can't sit here and tell you that there will be 1 or 2 of those transactions per year. I think we have to view those where we are generating those transactions on our own as opportunistic, and time will tell as to how many of those we can sort of get over the finish line.
But even if you were to just look at the ones that are not opportunistic, the ones that are [indiscernible] M&A capital strategies, you're starting to see a lot more today than you ever did in the past. And I've just referenced 2 transactions in the recent, call it, 5 months, 6 months period. I'm not trying to suggest that you should extrapolate that, but those types of transactions didn't see the light of day 3 years ago, 4 years ago. And so that's what gives us confidence that being a larger company will allow us to more proactively take advantage of these opportunities that present themselves, and be that one-stop shop, which even with our current size, we sometimes fall short."

Our watch list stands right around 4% currently, Caitlin. And again, what gives us a lot of confidence is if you look at our collection numbers in July, which we shared with you, it's about 99%. And some could argue, ""Oh, but that 99% may have built",240,"Yes. Our watch list stands right around 4% currently, Caitlin. And again, what gives us a lot of confidence is if you look at our collection numbers in July, which we shared with you, it's about 99%. And some could argue, ""Oh, but that 99% may have built in a lot of abatements and a reduction in rent that you might have passed on to clients."" And I just want to make sure that we make it very clear that it doesn't. I mean, if you look at the numbers, and we've put this out publicly. If you look at the abatement number, it's about slightly more than $1 million on $1.6 billion of rent. So it's about 90 basis points is what we have -- not even actually, it's a lot less than that, what we have updated, and these are largely to smaller operators. 
So when we are collecting above 99% on rent that has largely not been abated, it's very similar to what we had pre-COVID that should be a testament to the credit profile of the tenants that we are exposed to, and that is by design. So we feel very good about where we are and especially with every month that goes by this continued optimism that we have in our ability to get back to pre-pandemic levels without having to give abatements, I think, is a testament to the credit quality of our operators."

So Katy, part of the strategy we had was to use a combination of folks that we had in-house and some companies that we felt very comfortable with outsourcing to as third-party providers for services that we needed. And obviously, if we -- as our portfolio has grown, and now it's about $2.7 billion in the U.K., a lot of these third-party providers provide services that we can accommodate internally at margins that are superior to what we were getting outsourcing those particular functions. So as we have grown, we are bringing in-house more and more of these services. One of the other things that we are trying to look at and consider is as we grow into additional markets, and we believe that to be a matter of time, where is it that we should be domiciled, et cetera? 
And that work has -- we've made a tremendous amount of progress on that front as well. So before we bring in some of these functions in-house, we wanted to make sure that we were structured appropriately to accommodate our continued growth in Europe. And so there'll be more to come on that front, but we will certainly be able to create synergies by bringing some of these outsourced services in-house, and it's largely going to be a function of where we ultimately decide to be headquartered to help support the European expansion. And -- but those discussions are ongoing, and we'll have more to report on that front as and when we establish our operations, et cetera."

And we were hoping to actually close on a few transactions that were slightly more higher yielding in the first quarter that slipped into the second quarter, which is the primary reason for this higher cap rate.
In terms of competition, every day that goes by -- I'm exaggerating, of course. The competition in the U.K. is increasing. I think people have started to realize that, that is a market that affords good risk-adjusted returns. And so I don't see competition as being the dictate as to whether we should increase, decrease the quantum of transactions that we pursue in the U.K. We have a very defined -- clearly defined strategy in the U.K. And if there are transactions that we see, if they meet those particular criteria, we pursue it and we pursue it aggressively. And I think that's what's going to dictate the amount of volume.
Now clearly the volume has increased, and part of it is because it took us a while to establish ourselves, establish our name and establish those -- the reputation that we have and the relationships that we've built. But if there are opportunities and more opportunities to -- if the volume of opportunities increase, you can totally see us increasing the amount of acquisitions that we get over the finish line in the U.K. But we're going to be very true to our strategy that we've laid out, and that's not to say it's a static strategy that doesn't get looked at and it doesn't get added to or subtracted from.
It's just something that we spend a lot of time first figuring out what is the right product to pursue and then react to that strategy that we have thoughtfully laid out for ourselves. So it could be volume of acquisitions increase as more and more products start to come to the fore? For sure, it could. Is competition increasing? Yes. But I think the way for us to think about our international strategy is to think in terms of newer markets to continue to add to the volume of overall acquisitions, not necessarily do more in a given location."

But I will say that as we have become more visible in given geographies, just like we did in the U.K., people are getting familiar with our names. And so there might have been transactions that we might not have seen 2 years ago or 1.5 years ago,that we are now seeing because people understand that we -- they understand what we were able to do in the U.K. That reputation has translated to Continental Europe.

So the fact that we have closed on a particular transaction, and I don't recall off the top of my head whether we did or we didn't, is not new. We -- from the time we've gone into the U.K., we've been looking at all 3 countries -- not Northern Island yet, just to be clear.
The cap rate is really a function of what gets closed in a given quarter handle. As you know, the industrial market is -- trades at lower cap rates, especially if it has the lease term, et cetera. And it's a similar story on the retail front as well. Perhaps it's slightly higher than the industrial side, but not that much higher, especially if it has lease term and it's with 1 of the top 3 operators, top 4 operators on the grocery side of the business.
So it really is a question of whether it's industrial or retail. Within retail, is it grocery or home improvement? What is the duration of the lease term? All of that goes into the mix to define what the cap rate is. And yes, within the 3 countries as well, there is a slight discrepancy in terms of cap rates, what a similar asset would trade in Scotland versus in England. But it's a function of all of those various factors that go into what the cap rate is for a given transaction.
And we have, like I have said before, a very clearly defined strategy. And depending on what gets over the finish line, that translates to the cap rates that we've shared. So this particular quarter, it was about 6%. And in the first quarter, it was in the low 5s. So it blended out to -- in the mid- to high 5% cap rates, which I think is what one should expect going forward."

And the more assets that we reposition, et cetera, the better we are able to underwrite some of the risk that's inherent in the high-yielding opportunities that we see. And so as we continue to build on our competency of repositioning assets and being able to generate spreads that are north of what the existing spreads were, I think we will look at more higher-yielding opportunities.

And -- but we hear stories of certain transactions that happen at cap rates that we've never seen before. And -- but I would consider that to be one-off, but it is a question of a lot of capital chasing, the same set of products that we find ourselves interested in. And that has resulted in the environment that we find ourselves.
Having said all of that, we are still generating -- in the second quarter, we generated over 170 basis points in spread, which is better than our average spread over the duration of our history of acquiring assets. So even in this environment, we are very competitive and we are able to grow our portfolio and generate above-average spreads. So we feel very good about where we are, but I don't think that it's a sustainable environment where cap rates continue to compress, especially if it's -- it's funny I say this, but the 10-year trading in the [ 1 15 ], [ 1 16 ] ZIP Code, but where the expectation is that inflation should come in and interest rates at some point will start to go back up.

They're going out and buying out the operators. That, I think, is very prudent.
We haven't been in the market trying to sell our assets or anything like that. We had a thesis that we have shared with you and with the market about the theater business as an industry. We've also shared with you that the assets that we believe we have tend to be very well located and, in terms of performance, are in the top 2 quartiles, a vast majority of our assets. And so our expectations have always been that this business will come back, and we will start to collect 100% of our rent and that our operators will start to pay back some of the deferred rent, which in one case has already started.
But I did see some news around assets having traded, and I think it might have been 1 of our peer companies that sold a couple of their assets. But we really are not playing in the market rent. For us, it was more of about in the off chance that we do get some of these assets back, how can we reposition them? And I think I've made comments in the past around our confidence in being able to reposition some of these assets just given their location and given the demand for alternative use.

And so that's where the cost of capital advantage comes in."

And did I hear it correctly? It seemed like at the beginning of the call, you were kind of indicating that maybe you're looking to -- I know you've historically always been in industrial, but maybe you can further grow that platform.
And if so, I mean, how has your kind of underwriting on industrial assets changed over the years? I mean, maybe this is a misconception on my part, but I've always kind of thought of your industrial investments being primarily kind of high investment-grade rated tenants on long kind of lease term. Has there been any push into areas that maybe have shorter duration leases, maybe some of the more I guess, less name brand tenants in an industrial asset? Just anything on that front and how that platform is evolving."

So John, I think we've been asked this question around our industrial portfolio and what is the allocation that we would like to see in an optimal portfolio. And we've said circa 20%. Today, we are right around 12%. So our desire is to grow that asset type to the 20% ZIP code. So I don't think your question is around why are we doing it. I think you prefaced your question by saying we have been in industrial.
So I think that hasn't changed. Obviously, as we have underwritten industrial assets now for over 10 years, I think our first investment was in 2010, 2011 time frame. We have evolved in terms of being able to take on assets that may have only 9 years left on a lease rather than what we used to feel comfortable around doing 10 years ago, which was 15-year leases or 20-year leases and potentially doing it only through the sale-leaseback channels rather than providing capital for takeouts, et cetera.
And so clearly, on the lease term, we are very comfortable taking on high-single-digit, mid-single-digit lease terms, if we can get very comfortable with the market and inherent rent and what the price per square feet is for given assets and what the market can -- looks like on future rental growth as well as alternative tenants that could step in. And if that allows us to pursue some transactions, we will absolutely do that. 
We are very proud of our industrial asset management team, and we share with you the renewals and the releases that we have on a blended basis. And those types of numbers have continued to give us confidence to grow our business and to grow our platform and to bring in more and more people along with the team that we already have that's very comfortable playing across a lease term, playing across the credit spectrum, et cetera. Having said all of that, we are still predominantly investment grade. But we are very comfortable playing across the credit spectrum on the industrial side, if we believe it's well located with good real estate metrics associated with it."

And as we go forward, yes, green bonds is something that we're interested in. One of the things that we had talked about in our prepared remarks is the fact that the bond that we executed have about 40% fulfillment as it relates to real estate that meets the criteria. We're focused on completing that, not only with acquisitions that we execute in the U.K. and eventually potentially on the continent, but also in the U.S. And we think it's a great vehicle for us to move forward with not only from a liability management perspective and driving competitive weighted average cost of capital.

And once you look at the mix, you pursue a particular strategy. And that's largely what's driving the decision-making process. And what we found was, yes, that some of the assets that we sold actually were the bankrupt assets, that we were -- that we got back from NPC. They were in high demand, but not for re-lease. They were in high demand with folks that wanted to buy these assets outright. And when you look at the return profile, it was superior to us holding it and trying to find a new client that could step into those assets.
Having said that, there are some assets that we actually re-leased to new clients as well. So it's a combination of strategies that we execute, but the underlying premise and the goal has always been what is going to maximize our returns and whichever -- whatever that answer is whether it's selling its vacant versus finding a new tenant that's dictated by this return profile."

Building enduring relationships is inherent to our purpose as an organization, and I would like to thank all of our stakeholders for their continued support. I would like to express my appreciation to all of my Realty Inc",666,"Thanks, Julie. Welcome, everyone. Building enduring relationships is inherent to our purpose as an organization, and I would like to thank all of our stakeholders for their continued support. I would like to express my appreciation to all of my Realty Income colleagues who continue to relentlessly pursue our growth initiatives while in this sustained remote work environment. 
We are pleased with the momentum across all facets of our business, which is reflected in our revised 2021 AFFO per share guidance of $3.53 and $3.59. Our increased guidance range represents an improvement of 2.7% at the midpoint compared to our prior range as well as an improvement of 5% at the midpoint versus last year, and is a function of several tailwinds to our business.
First, an increase to our 2021 acquisition volume guidance to approximately $4.5 billion; second, the continued improvement in rent collections from our theater clients; third, our well-priced capital markets activity since the start of June, which further positioned our balance sheet for continued growth; fourth, our active asset management activities, which resulted in occupancy of 98.5% at quarter end, and rent recapture rates in excess of 104% on lease expirations during the quarter; fifth, the overall quality of our portfolio, which has been curated, refined and underwritten over our 52-year history continues to perform throughout a variety of environments.
We'll discuss each of these elements in greater detail shortly. Year-to-date, we have added approximately $2.2 billion of high-quality real estate to our portfolio, including $1.1 billion of new acquisitions in the second quarter. We continue to expand our platform as our size and scale remain key competitive advantages that translate directly into shareholder value. This quarter, we sourced more than $20 billion of acquisition opportunities, ultimately selecting and closing on less than 6%. On a total revenue basis, approximately 54% of the acquisitions made during the quarter are leased to investment-grade rated clients, which brings our total investment-grade client exposure to approximately 50%. 
The weighted average remaining lease term of the assets added to our portfolio during the quarter was 11.5 years. The largest industry represented in our second quarter acquisitions was U.K. grocery stores, and 7-Eleven remains our largest client. We remain well diversified as our portfolio consists of over 6,700 assets leased to approximately 630 clients who operate in 58 separate industries located in all 50 U.S. states, Puerto Rico and the U.K. And during the quarter, we continued to generate healthy investment spreads of approximately 172 basis points while acquiring, in our view, the highest quality product in the marketplace. 
The quality of our acquisitions is evident throughout the entire life cycle of our portfolio as we have consistently demonstrated favorable recapture rates on expiring leases while maintaining a healthy occupancy level throughout a variety of economic cycles. During the quarter, we re-leased 58 units, recapturing 104.7% of expiring rent. Since our listing in 1994, we have executed over 3,700 re-leases or sales on expiring leases, recapturing over 100% of rent on these re-leased contracts. And occupancy at quarter end was 98.5% based on property count.
Our international investment activities continue to support our growth outlook, and our U.K. portfolio has now grown to over $2.7 billion. This quarter, the U.K. accounted for over 50% of the $1.1 billion of total acquisitions only. Year-to-date, we've added approximately $1 billion in high-quality real estate in the U.K. across 41 properties. And of the more than $21 billion in acquisitions opportunity that we sourced, approximately 31% is related to international markets.
As we continue to expand our international platform, we will look for additional geographies that offer opportunities similar to that of the U.K. We seek to acquire real estate in markets where opportunities are abundant. There is considerable demand for sale-leaseback transactions from industry-leading operators, and the local real estate can generate long-term IRRs in excess of our long-term cost of capital.
At this time, I'll pass it over to Christie, who will further discuss results from the quarter."

We continue to prioritize a conservative balance sheet structure while procuring attractively priced capital. At quarter end, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 5.4x or 5.3x on a pro forma basis, adjusting for the annualized impact of acquisitions and dispositions during the quarter. I would note that these ratios are before our $9.2 million share offering, which closed subsequent to quarter end. Our fixed charge coverage ratio hit an all-time high for the second quarter in a row, coming in at 6.0x, and during the quarter, we raised over $457 million of equity primarily through our ATM program.
Subsequent to quarter end, we executed on 2 capital-raising activities to further enhance the strength of our balance sheet. In July, we raised approximately $594 million to an overnight equity offering. Proceeds were used to pay down short-term borrowings and support our active global investment pipeline. Additionally, in July, we issued our debut green bond, a GBP 750 million multi-tranche denominated unsecured bond offering of 6 years and 12-year notes, priced at a combined all-in rate of 1.48% and a weighted average term of approximately 8.8 years.
We're proud to be the first net lease REIT to demonstrate our commitment to our ESG initiatives with a green bond. This green bond creates further partnership opportunities with our clients to implement sustainable practices at the properties within our portfolio, providing support for environmentally-conscious initiatives while achieving mutual sustainability goals, and we estimate that over 40% of the proceeds have already been allocated to existing green projects. More information about our Green Financing Framework can be found on the corporate responsibility page of our website.
This quarter, our business generated $0.88 of AFFO per share, and as Sumit mentioned, increasing greater rent collections are one of the drivers of our improved earnings outlook for 2021. In June, we collected approximately 51% of contractual theater rents, and in July, we collected 98.9% of our contractual theater rent. As a reminder, we own 79 total theater properties, which account for 5.4% of our annualized contractual rent. 42 of our theater assets are not on cash accounting, and we continue to recognize 100% of revenue on these assets on an accrual basis, consistent with our accounting treatment during the duration of the pandemic.
The remaining 37 theater assets are currently on cash accounting, meaning we will not recognize any revenue associated with these clients until it has been received. These clients accounted for $34 million of annualized contractual rent or about $2.8 million of contractual rent per month. During the second quarter, we collected 38.3% of theater rent. The rent collections from June and July represented significant improvement from prior periods. Our theater clients paid us 14% of contractual rent in the first quarter and an average of 31% in April and May.
Assuming the pace of collections we recognize that the theater industry in July continues on through the remainder of the year, we would not expect to accrue any additional theater reserves going forward. We believe the increased rent collections reflect significant positive momentum in the theater industry. One after another, the latest blockbusters continue to demonstrate a return to normalcy for the theater industry. In mid-July, opening weekend of Black Widow brought in approximately $158 million in revenue globally, earning the record for the biggest opening weekend since the pandemic. We are cautiously optimistic the momentum we're seeing will continue while closely monitoring the COVID-19 variants.
As a monthly dividend company, our mission is to invest in people and places to deliver dependable monthly dividends that increase over time. In July, we declared our 613th consecutive monthly dividends, and we have now increased the dividend 111 times since our listing on the New York Stock Exchange in 1994. Since 1994, we have increased the dividend every year, growing dividends per share at a compound average annual growth rate of approximately 4.4%. And as a result, it's increasing the dividend every year for the last 25 consecutive years. We're proud to be a member of the exclusive S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which consists of only 3 REITs and 65 companies overall.
Now I would like to hand our call back to Sumit."

So I hope to attempt to answer all of them, but I might miss a few. In terms of our volume, look, this is a continuation of a theme that we started the year with. And as you might recall, Nate, January, we had come out",707,"Nate, thank you for your questions. So I hope to attempt to answer all of them, but I might miss a few. In terms of our volume, look, this is a continuation of a theme that we started the year with. And as you might recall, Nate, January, we had come out with a very robust pipeline. We've already sourced, year-to-date, more than $40 billion. And clearly, at the run rate that we've been able to achieve over the last 3 quarters and year-to-date, you can have a sense for the robustness of the pipeline.
And I think the biggest surprise for us has been our -- the volume that we've been able to generate in the U.K., some of which sort of translated to what we were able to accomplish in the second quarter. But even if you look year-to-date, it's representing about 40% of acquisitions. And the quality of the product that we're continuing to see, the relationships that we've been able to establish and grow in the U.K. during a very short period over the last 2 years is a testament to why we feel very comfortable with having increased our acquisition guidance by another $1.25 billion given that we are clipping away at $1 billion. So in terms of the pipeline, we are very happy with what we are seeing. We are very comfortable with the product that we are seeing. And I think this is -- this trend is going to continue.
In terms of the makeup, you might have seen that depending on the quarter, anywhere between 25% to 30% of what we are acquiring is industrial. In the second quarter, 15% of overall acquisition was industrial, largely driven by about 35% industrial in the U.S. And we, again, on the relationship front, have been able to make a fair amount of progress, are seeing acquisition opportunities, sometimes before it even hits the market and being able to try to get some of these transactions over the finish line with the relationships that we have developed. And I think you should expect to see this 15% to 25% of our volume coming from the industrial side of the equation in terms of asset type continue over the next few quarters.
In terms of cap rate, look, it's a very aggressive market. I think in previous calls, I've mentioned that cap rates have continued to compress, tighten, whatever the right word is. And it's -- I think it's a testament to certainly the type of products that we are pursuing, but more so to the fact that net lease is a very unique way of investing in real estate that is very specific. And as such, for the type of products that we pursue, we have continued to see cap rates compress. And by the way, this is across the spectrum on the credit curve. It's not just on the investment-grade side. In fact, I'd argue on the investment-grade side, the compression has been more muted on a relative basis versus what we have seen on the high-yield side of the equation. So -- and that trend is continuing, and we saw that in the second quarter as well.
I believe on the industrial front, it has continued to tighten, but it has -- the speed with which it's tightening has certainly slowed down. And we are seeing products on the industrial side for well-located assets in the high 3% cap rate, low 4% ZIP code to, on the rare occasion, high 4%, low 5% ZIP code depending on location.  On the retail side, it's a similar story. For high-quality assets with long lease terms, good growth, you're seeing in the low 4% to low 5% ZIP code. And then if you're willing to compromise on lease term or growth rates or what have you, perhaps credit, you can see transactions transacting in the mid-5% to low 7% ZIP code. 
But the stuff that one buys in the high 6s, low 7%, that has credit profiles, lease terms, et cetera, that obviously has a much higher risk profile associated to it. So I don't know if I got all your questions in, Nate, but please let me know if I missed something."

Look, in terms of predicting what can happen in the future, some of what you see is publicly available. You have seen some large companies come out and say as part of their financing, sale-leaseback is going to be a source of capital, and they've come out with multibillion dollar numbers.  And those are the ones that are obvious, both you've seen that here in the U.S. and you've seen that in the U.K. as well, with some of the M&A work that happened and large sale-leaseback opportunities on the industrial front in one specific transaction in the U.K. and then there was a retail client here in the U.S. that has come out with something like that.
But I think what we would like to be able to change is to proactively go and be a solution for transactions that may not be in the public eye. And given the fact that we will have the size and scale, it is more difficult for me to predict as to how many of those opportunities can we create. When you talk to large companies and you go in there and you say, ""Oh, we can do -- we can take $1 billion of your real estate off the balance sheet."" Sometimes that's not meaningful enough to engage in a conversation. I mean, here we are talking about $70 billion, $80 billion, $100 billion companies, and that sort of capital doesn't really move the needle for them.
And so what we are very optimistic about is to be able to use our pro forma larger scale to be able to have more aggressively some of these conversations that we started a few years ago. And the feedback that we had received was, ""Oh, yes, thanks a lot. Just not big enough for us to be meaningful to engage."" And so I think those conversations, we hope to get over the finish line and create more opportunities. But Caitlin, I can't sit here and tell you that there will be 1 or 2 of those transactions per year. I think we have to view those where we are generating those transactions on our own as opportunistic, and time will tell as to how many of those we can sort of get over the finish line.
But even if you were to just look at the ones that are not opportunistic, the ones that are [indiscernible] M&A capital strategies, you're starting to see a lot more today than you ever did in the past. And I've just referenced 2 transactions in the recent, call it, 5 months, 6 months period. I'm not trying to suggest that you should extrapolate that, but those types of transactions didn't see the light of day 3 years ago, 4 years ago. And so that's what gives us confidence that being a larger company will allow us to more proactively take advantage of these opportunities that present themselves, and be that one-stop shop, which even with our current size, we sometimes fall short."

Our watch list stands right around 4% currently, Caitlin. And again, what gives us a lot of confidence is if you look at our collection numbers in July, which we shared with you, it's about 99%.

And again, what gives us a lot of confidence is if you look at our collection numbers in July, which we shared with you, it's about 99%. And some could argue, ""Oh, but that 99% may have built in a lot of abatements and a reduction in rent that you might have passed on to clients."" And I just want to make sure that we make it very clear that it doesn't. I mean, if you look at the numbers, and we've put this out publicly. If you look at the abatement number, it's about slightly more than $1 million on $1.6 billion of rent. So it's about 90 basis points is what we have -- not even actually, it's a lot less than that, what we have updated, and these are largely to smaller operators. 
So when we are collecting above 99% on rent that has largely not been abated, it's very similar to what we had pre-COVID that should be a testament to the credit profile of the tenants that we are exposed to, and that is by design. So we feel very good about where we are and especially with every month that goes by this continued optimism that we have in our ability to get back to pre-pandemic levels without having to give abatements, I think, is a testament to the credit quality of our operators."

So as we have grown, we are bringing in-house more and more of these services. One of the other things that we are trying to look at and consider is as we grow into additional markets, and we believe that to be a matter of time, where is it that we should be domiciled, et cetera? 
And that work has -- we've made a tremendous amount of progress on that front as well. So before we bring in some of these functions in-house, we wanted to make sure that we were structured appropriately to accommodate our continued growth in Europe. And so there'll be more to come on that front, but we will certainly be able to create synergies by bringing some of these outsourced services in-house, and it's largely going to be a function of where we ultimately decide to be headquartered to help support the European expansion. And -- but those discussions are ongoing, and we'll have more to report on that front as and when we establish our operations, et cetera."

And we were hoping to actually close on a few transactions that were slightly more higher yielding in the first quarter that slipped into the second quarter, which is the primary reason for this higher cap rate.
In terms of competition, every day that goes by -- I'm exaggerating, of course. The competition in the U.K. is increasing. I think people have started to realize that, that is a market that affords good risk-adjusted returns. And so I don't see competition as being the dictate as to whether we should increase, decrease the quantum of transactions that we pursue in the U.K. We have a very defined -- clearly defined strategy in the U.K. And if there are transactions that we see, if they meet those particular criteria, we pursue it and we pursue it aggressively. And I think that's what's going to dictate the amount of volume.
Now clearly the volume has increased, and part of it is because it took us a while to establish ourselves, establish our name and establish those -- the reputation that we have and the relationships that we've built. But if there are opportunities and more opportunities to -- if the volume of opportunities increase, you can totally see us increasing the amount of acquisitions that we get over the finish line in the U.K. But we're going to be very true to our strategy that we've laid out, and that's not to say it's a static strategy that doesn't get looked at and it doesn't get added to or subtracted from.
It's just something that we spend a lot of time first figuring out what is the right product to pursue and then react to that strategy that we have thoughtfully laid out for ourselves. So it could be volume of acquisitions increase as more and more products start to come to the fore? For sure, it could. Is competition increasing? Yes. But I think the way for us to think about our international strategy is to think in terms of newer markets to continue to add to the volume of overall acquisitions, not necessarily do more in a given location."

And I think that has largely been the reason why we haven't sort of gotten into some of the other markets. 
But I will say that as we have become more visible in given geographies, just like we did in the U.K., people are getting familiar with our names. And so there might have been transactions that we might not have seen 2 years ago or 1.5 years ago, that we are now seeing because people understand that we -- they understand what we were able to do in the U.K. That reputation has translated to Continental Europe.
And the fact that we have pursued a few transactions has obviously led credence to our ability and our desire to grow our portfolio in those particular markets.

So the fact that we have closed on a particular transaction, and I don't recall off the top of my head whether we did or we didn't, is not new. We -- from the time we've gone into the U.K., we've been looking at all 3 countries -- not Northern Island yet, just to be clear.
The cap rate is really a function of what gets closed in a given quarter handle. As you know, the industrial market is -- trades at lower cap rates, especially if it has the lease term, et cetera. And it's a similar story on the retail front as well. Perhaps it's slightly higher than the industrial side, but not that much higher, especially if it has lease term and it's with 1 of the top 3 operators, top 4 operators on the grocery side of the business.
So it really is a question of whether it's industrial or retail. Within retail, is it grocery or home improvement? What is the duration of the lease term? All of that goes into the mix to define what the cap rate is. And yes, within the 3 countries as well, there is a slight discrepancy in terms of cap rates, what a similar asset would trade in Scotland versus in England. But it's a function of all of those various factors that go into what the cap rate is for a given transaction.
And we have, like I have said before, a very clearly defined strategy. And depending on what gets over the finish line, that translates to the cap rates that we've shared. So this particular quarter, it was about 6%. And in the first quarter, it was in the low 5s. So it blended out to -- in the mid- to high 5% cap rates, which I think is what one should expect going forward."

And the more assets that we reposition, et cetera, the better we are able to underwrite some of the risk that's inherent in the high-yielding opportunities that we see. And so as we continue to build on our competency of repositioning assets and being able to generate spreads that are north of what the existing spreads were, I think we will look at more higher-yielding opportunities.

And -- but we hear stories of certain transactions that happen at cap rates that we've never seen before. And -- but I would consider that to be one-off, but it is a question of a lot of capital chasing, the same set of products that we find ourselves interested in. And that has resulted in the environment that we find ourselves.
Having said all of that, we are still generating -- in the second quarter, we generated over 170 basis points in spread, which is better than our average spread over the duration of our history of acquiring assets. So even in this environment, we are very competitive and we are able to grow our portfolio and generate above-average spreads. So we feel very good about where we are, but I don't think that it's a sustainable environment where cap rates continue to compress, especially if it's -- it's funny I say this, but the 10-year trading in the [ 1 15 ], [ 1 16 ] ZIP Code, but where the expectation is that inflation should come in and interest rates at some point will start to go back up.

They're going out and buying out the operators. That, I think, is very prudent.
We haven't been in the market trying to sell our assets or anything like that. We had a thesis that we have shared with you and with the market about the theater business as an industry. We've also shared with you that the assets that we believe we have tend to be very well located and, in terms of performance, are in the top 2 quartiles, a vast majority of our assets. And so our expectations have always been that this business will come back, and we will start to collect 100% of our rent and that our operators will start to pay back some of the deferred rent, which in one case has already started.
But I did see some news around assets having traded, and I think it might have been 1 of our peer companies that sold a couple of their assets. But we really are not playing in the market rent. For us, it was more of about in the off chance that we do get some of these assets back, how can we reposition them? And I think I've made comments in the past around our confidence in being able to reposition some of these assets just given their location and given the demand for alternative use.

And if so, I mean, how has your kind of underwriting on industrial assets changed over the years? I mean, maybe this is a misconception on my part, but I've always kind of thought of your industrial investments being primarily kind of high investment-grade rated tenants on long kind of lease term.

I think you prefaced your question by saying we have been in industrial.
So I think that hasn't changed. Obviously, as we have underwritten industrial assets now for over 10 years, I think our first investment was in 2010, 2011 time frame. We have evolved in terms of being able to take on assets that may have only 9 years left on a lease rather than what we used to feel comfortable around doing 10 years ago, which was 15-year leases or 20-year leases and potentially doing it only through the sale-leaseback channels rather than providing capital for takeouts, et cetera.
And so clearly, on the lease term, we are very comfortable taking on high-single-digit, mid-single-digit lease terms, if we can get very comfortable with the market and inherent rent and what the price per square feet is for given assets and what the market can -- looks like on future rental growth as well as alternative tenants that could step in. And if that allows us to pursue some transactions, we will absolutely do that. 
We are very proud of our industrial asset management team, and we share with you the renewals and the releases that we have on a blended basis. And those types of numbers have continued to give us confidence to grow our business and to grow our platform and to bring in more and more people along with the team that we already have that's very comfortable playing across a lease term, playing across the credit spectrum, et cetera. Having said all of that, we are still predominantly investment grade. But we are very comfortable playing across the credit spectrum on the industrial side, if we believe it's well located with good real estate metrics associated with it."

And as we go forward, yes, green bonds is something that we're interested in. One of the things that we had talked about in our prepared remarks is the fact that the bond that we executed have about 40% fulfillment as it relates to real estate that meets the criteria. We're focused on completing that, not only with acquisitions that we execute in the U.K. and eventually potentially on the continent, but also in the U.S. And we think it's a great vehicle for us to move forward with not only from a liability management perspective and driving competitive weighted average cost of capital.

I think we had close to 40 resolutions on that front. So and -- and then if you look at what the return profile has been, it continues to be year-to-date in that 8% plus unlevered returns.

So we've been very successful, and part of it is a testament to the team that we have in place.

Then you might have noticed that on the Circle K Couche-Tard side, that went lower, and it's primarily because they sold some of the assets that were our assets to Casey's. And so that's the reason for some of the Couche-Tard concentration to be reduced from what you had seen in the previous quarter. So that's really what's happening.
It's not us going out and doing transactions or what have you. Having said that, if transactions were to be available, we would absolutely pursue it.

And once you look at the mix, you pursue a particular strategy. And that's largely what's driving the decision-making process. And what we found was, yes, that some of the assets that we sold actually were the bankrupt assets, that we were -- that we got back from NPC. They were in high demand, but not for re-lease. They were in high demand with folks that wanted to buy these assets outright. And when you look at the return profile, it was superior to us holding it and trying to find a new client that could step into those assets.
Having said that, there are some assets that we actually re-leased to new clients as well. So it's a combination of strategies that we execute, but the underlying premise and the goal has always been what is going to maximize our returns and whichever -- whatever that answer is whether it's selling its vacant versus finding a new tenant that's dictated by this return profile."

Our strong relationships with all our stakeholders enable the success of our business, and we thank everyone listening for your continued support. Additionally, I would like to express my appreciation of our expanded Realty Income team for their tireless efforts in executing on our strategic objectives. 
Today, our business is at an inflection point where the advantages of our growing size and scale provide us an accelerating number of opportunities, compounding our attitude for growth. We see momentum accelerating across all facets of our business, as a result of the following growth catalysts. 
First, the depth and breadth of our active global pipeline remains robust. During the third quarter, we acquired over $1.6 billion of real estate across 3 countries, resulting in approximately $3.8 billion year-to-date. We now expect to invest in over $5 billion of real estate in 2021, an increase from our prior guidance of $4.5 billion. 
Second, we believe our expansion into Continental Europe during the third quarter will significantly deepen our addressable market at attractive spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital, particularly given the comparatively low unsecured borrowing rates in the European bond market. 
Third, our asset management activities continued to generate strong results. At the end of the third quarter, our portfolio was 98.8% occupied, and we achieved a reentry capture rate of 107.2%, illustrating the relentless efforts of our asset management team and highlighting the quality of our real estate. 
And finally, with the closing of the VEREIT merger, we believe our size, scale and diversification will further enhance many of our competitive advantages, which we suspect should allow us to augment our investment activities in the future. The closing of our merger with VEREIT as well as the anticipated and subsequent spin-off of substantially all the combined companies' office properties, which as previously announced, is expected to be completed on November 12, allows us to provide enhanced clarity on our near-term earnings run rate. 
To that end, we are increasing our 2021 AFFO per share guidance to $3.55 to $3.60, representing 5.5% annual growth at the midpoint. And we are introducing 2022 AFFO per share guidance of $3.84 to $3.97, representing 9.2% annual growth at the midpoint. Our 2022 guidance assumes over $5 billion of acquisitions and over $40 million of year 1 G&A synergies we have identified as a result of economies of scale from the merger. 
These guidance ranges also assume that the anticipated spin-off of our office properties is consummated as anticipated on November 12. 
With the closing of the merger, our combined company eclipses $50 billion in enterprise value with size and scale to support numerous growth verticals, providing flexibility to close large transactions without creating concentration risk. Additionally, through this merger, Realty Income has inherited a pipeline, platform and talented acquisition team focused on sourcing high-yielding products that will be additive to our existing pipeline. 
Further, over time, we expect to generate meaningful earnings accretion by refinancing VEREIT's outstanding debt, supported by our comparatively lower borrowing costs driven by our A3a- ratings and capacity to issue debt in lower-yielding markets. 
Finally, we are excited to integrate the capabilities of many talented VEREIT colleagues into the Realty Income business as we continue to execute our growth initiatives as one team. 
Now turning to the results for the quarter. We continue to add attractive real estate to our portfolio at a rapid pace. During the third quarter, we sourced nearly $24 billion of acquisition opportunities, ultimately selecting and closing on less than 6%. Of the $1.6 billion of real estate we added to the portfolio in Q3, the largest industry represented was U.K. grocery stores. On a revenue basis, approximately 38% of the acquisitions made during the quarter we leased to investment-grade rated clients, and our total investment-grade client exposure remains approximately 50%. 
The weighted average remaining lease term of the assets added to our portfolio during the quarter was 13.4 years. And in aggregate, all of our acquisition activities during the quarter resulted in healthy investment spreads of approximately 164 basis points. 
As of quarter end, our portfolio remains well diversified, including over 7,000 assets leased to approximately 650 clients who operate in 60 separate industries located in all 50 U.S. states, Puerto Rico, the U.K. and Spain. 
Giving pro forma effect to the closing of the merger and the anticipated spin-off of our combined office assets as of September 30, 2021, our portfolio now includes over 10,500 assets located in all 50 U.S. states, Puerto Rico, the U.K. and Spain. Our international pipeline continues to add meaningful value to our portfolio, and we believe it will remain an important driver of growth going forward. 
In total, of the nearly $24 billion in acquisition opportunities that we sourced this quarter, approximately 34% was associated with international opportunities. 
During the third quarter, we added approximately $532 million of high-quality real estate in the U.K. and Spain across 31 properties, bringing our total international portfolio to over $3.2 billion. This quarter, our international acquisition accounted for approximately 33% total acquisition volume. 
As previously announced in September, we made our debut acquisitions in Continental Europe through a sale-leaseback transaction with Carrefour in Spain. Subsequent to quarter end, we announced the completion of an additional Carrefour transaction in Spain, bringing the value of our Continental Europe portfolio to approximately EUR 160 million. 
We are optimistic about our momentum in Spain as we look to replicate the success of our international growth platform throughout the continent with best-in-class operators who are leaders in their respective industries. 
The health of our core portfolio remains of utmost importance as we continue to expand our platform. At the end of the third quarter, occupancy was 98.8% based on property count, which represents an increase of 30 basis points as compared to last quarter. During the quarter, we re-leased 50 units, recapturing 107.2% of expiring rent, bringing our year-to-date recapture rate to 105.5%. 
We continue to report on quarterly recapture rates and believe this is one of the most objective ways to measure underlying portfolio quality in the net lease industry. Since our listing in 1994, we have executed over 3,800 re-leases or sales on expiring leases, recapturing over 100% of rent on those released contracts. 
At this time, I'll pass it over to Christie, who will further discuss results from the quarter."

This quarter, our business generated AFFO per share of $0.91, strengthened by our acquisition pace and the collection of almost 100% of contractual rent in the third quarter. 
During the quarter, our theater clients paid approximately 99.6% of contractual rent, representing a meaningful improvement compared to the 38% collection rate in the second quarter. 
We continue to be encouraged by the strong box-office performance of recent blockbuster releases, which we believe signals the long-term viability of the theater industry. 
I was looking forward to the release that the James Bond film, No Time to Die, for months. And based on recent box office numbers, so were many across the globe. 
We currently have 34 of our 79 theater assets on cash accounting, with approximately $37 million of non-straight-line reserves on our balance sheet. 
Like our business strategy, our approach to evaluating when these 34 theater assets moved back to an accrual basis and the appropriate time to reverse the allowance for bad debt reserves will be conservative and data-driven. More specifically, we will assess the likelihood of collecting on these amounts by evaluating store level and industry-wide data. in conjunction with sustaining payment of past due rent over a healthy period of time. 
As we continue to expand our platform, we will remain steadfast in prioritizing low leverage and a conservative balance sheet strategy while financing our growth initiatives with attractively priced capital. 
At the quarter end, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 5x, or 4.9x on a pro forma basis, adjusting for the annualized impact of acquisitions and dispositions during the quarter. Our fixed charge COGS ratio hit an all-time high for the third quarter in a row coming in at 6.1x. And during the quarter, we raised over $1.6 billion of equity, approximately $594 million, which was through an overnight offering that closed in July, and the remainder primarily through our ATM program. 
During the quarter, we also issued our debut green bond offering, a 750 million multi-tranche sterling-denominated unsecured bond offering, which priced at a blended yield of approximately 1.48% for an 8.8-year blended tenor. We look forward to continuing to partner with our clients around sustainable practices in accordance with our green financing framework. 
And now I'd like to hand our call back to Sumit."

In terms of the composition of the pipeline ahead as well as what we've achieved, what we shared with the market that they should expect the international acquisitio",535,"Thank you, Nate. Good questions. And yes, we are so happy to have the merger behind us. 
In terms of the composition of the pipeline ahead as well as what we've achieved, what we shared with the market that they should expect the international acquisition to represent about 1/3 of our acquisition volume going forward. In terms of pricing, surprisingly, when I looked at the spreads that we are generating either here in the U.S. and comparing it to what we were able to do in Europe, they are very similar for this quarter. And in some quarters, we've seen that we were able to get slightly higher yields in the international markets. And in other quarters, it has been the opposite. 
So there's really -- the way we are thinking about our portfolio is through the macro lens that we've identified, what it is that is of interest to us. And the area that we play in, in Europe is slightly narrower, and it's a function of the product that's available than what we play in the U.S. 
In terms of retail versus industrial, as much as we would like to do more industrial, the pricing in this market keeps us fairly constraint to that 10% on a good quarter, we are able to get to that 15%, 17% ZIP code. But that's the composition of the industrial makeup of the overall acquisition. The rest of it is primarily retail. 
In terms of investment grade versus noninvestment grade, we've said this in the past, and I'll repeat it again. When we look at credit and we do our own analysis, we don't go out saying, if it's a noninvestment-grade credit, we immediately disqualify it for consideration purposes. If you look at what we were able to achieve in the third quarter, only 38% of what we did was investment grade. So we are very comfortable looking at noninvestment grade. And noninvestment grade does not necessarily mean sub-investment grade. It just means that it doesn't have a rating from 1 of the 2 major rating agencies and/or it might actually have a sub-investment grade rating. But we are very comfortable with that. 
The last question that you had as a subpart to your first question was in terms of bearing an overlap with what we are inheriting from VEREIT, and there really isn't much. There are certainly certain acquisition opportunities that we would find VEREIT as a competitor, but they played in an area that we believe can truly be additive to our overall platform and the high REIT side. 
And we are so blessed to inherit this team, and we are really looking forward to being able to completely integrate them into our acquisitions team and have them continue to pursue the transactions that they were pursuing and potentially not be constrained by the cost of capital. So we genuinely believe that this is going to be an incremental to the acquisitions that we were able to achieve on a stand-alone basis. 
And then with respect to pricing, I think I sort of addressed that through my spread comment. So Nate, I don't know if there's anything specific you want me to dive into."

Look, I think the only area where I felt like they probably had non-triple net leases was on the GSA side of the equation on the office portfolio that they had exposure to. Otherwise, largely, Greg, these are triple net leases. 
And if you think about how this particular portfolio was put together, we'll be able to give you a lot more color once we've got it all integrated. But I'd be very surprised to find gross leases -- a preponderance of gross leases on the retail side and the industrial side of the equation. 
Obviously, industrial products, the landlord tends to be responsible for things like roof and structure, which one could argue is not a pure triple net lease, but that is largely the same case with respect to our portfolio as well. But the property maintenance is still the responsibility of the client, the property taxes, the insurances -- insurance on those buildings, that's still the responsibility of the clients. So we still view those as predominantly net leases. 
So with the separation of the office assets through the spin and the GSA leases, I think we are going to be largely a net lease portfolio, very similar to the one that we have. So I don't think that that's going to pose any major issues, Greg."

We've already talked about grocery as being one of the areas that we'd like to focus in on. Home improvement is another area. But it is very unusual to find some of the other industries that we are exposed to on the retail side being available in Mainland Europe. And that's really the point I'm trying to make. 
This is not a constraining factor because I think we've put out some numbers, et cetera, sharing with you how much bigger the actual market is, the addressable market is in Europe that lend itself to net leasable investing. But it really is more of a -- it's just a narrow group of industries that play in that space."

It was more along the lines of if you look at some of our industry concentration, they were starting to creep to double-digit ZIP codes and somewhat beyond that. And the complementary nature of what we are inheriting from VEREIT, I believe, helps us on a couple of industries. 
If you look at a few of our largest industries like convenience stores and groceries, et cetera, all of those concentrations on a pro forma basis is actually going to come down. And so it gives us more capacity to aggressively pursue opportunities that we are finding incredibly compelling to try to get over the finish line. So it just gives us more capacity. That's one. 
The second is being a much larger company, and this is a more recent phenomenon. I think 2 years ago, maybe a little bit longer than that. It was the first time I heard of $1 billion sale leaseback opportunity in our space, and it was on the retail side of the equation. And we've never heard of opportunities of that size. And even for us, if we had some prior exposure to the client, doing a $1 billion transaction, what's going to sort of start to push the concentration risk issue. And now being 1.3, 1.4x the size that we were, it is less of an issue. And the size of sale-leaseback opportunities that are now in play are $1 billion opportunities. 
Now we haven't really seen -- there have been announcements, but we haven't seen anything sort of get over the finish line on that front. But that, to us, is exactly the type of transactions that we would like to be able to show up for and be able to do and be a single point solution for some of our clients that we perhaps would not have been able to pursue in our previous version. And so I think that really is what we feel will be one of the biggest beneficiary. 
And also proactively to go to some of these larger companies and be able to say -- and for large companies, by definition, doing a $500 million sale leaseback doesn't really move the needle for them much. And so to be able to be a solution and provide multibillion-dollar sale-leaseback opportunities for them, I think, could be a lot more compelling. And so those are the types of things that we'd be able to pursue post this closing that we obviously thought a lot about in the past, and we have approached certain clients, but it was -- we were guided by what we were hearing in terms of what is really relevant for some of these folks. 
So I think -- look, time will tell, but it certainly creates the platform for us to now be able to pursue some of these transactions, which we were not able to as aggressively pursue in the past. Ronald?"

And so you should -- and of course, as we learn more about the portfolio that we've acquired and we look out into the future and we, more importantly, digest the 6 -- the $5 billion acquisition guidance that we have for this year, I think we'd be in a much better position to give you much more precise numbers on same-store growth, et cetera, et cetera.

Brent, I'll tell you very honestly, we did a lot of homework before we actually went into any particular market. We looked at transactions that have taken place in the past. We try to understand the nuances of the structure as we took into account the tax implications. 
So a lot of the homework was done prior to us actually engaging with potential clients or the advisory community to start to pursue transactions. So I would say that we weren't overly surprised by the structure of the deal that we've been able to get over the finish line. 
The one thing that has surprised me personally, and I don't know if Neil and Mark are going to share in my comment, but is the volume comment? I do believe that we have been able to create these relationships that have cemented to and have translated into subsequent transactions much more quickly than what we had originally thought. This is very much a relationship-driven market, which we anticipated, but not to the extent that we've seen it play out. 
They're looking for long-term partners. They're looking for partners that are not in the market to flip out assets, and that is right down the fairway for who we are and how we believe in generating value for our investors long term. 
The certainty of close to some is incredibly important, far more so than perhaps here in the U.S. It's not that certainty of close is not important, but they are much more price-sensitive here in the U.S. than perhaps in Continental Europe as well as in the U.K. So reputation, size, scale, the fact that we do what we say does seem to be weighed a lot more significantly in all of Europe than what we had anticipated. So that's where the surprise came in, not in terms of the duration of the lease or the cap rates or the growth that we find embedded in these leases. A lot of that was known to us before we went into these markets."

And so I feel like if you look at the trend and you look at what we've been able to do over the last 3, 4 years, we have generally achieved north of 100% re-leasing spreads. And this, by the way, includes not just clients who are renewing an option, but also new clients that we are bringing in into either empty buildings or buildings that are about to go empty. So this is the complete picture of what we've been able to achieve. 
And that is one of the points that we've been trying to talk about that our business mix on a normalized basis is going to become a 7-year walk business. And a lot of value is either going to get created through this channel or not. And we've been anticipating this and building out our asset management team in anticipation of being able to generate the kind of results that we are hosting on a quarter-by-quarter basis.

But there are differences to the lease structures, et cetera. And once again, I'm not going to go into the details. But what you see as the headline cap rate Yes, you're seeing that they seem to be very close. There are some inter-quarter variability, like I believe in the second quarter, we had a slightly higher cap rate associated with international and it was a function of the type of assets that we got and the length of the lease terms that we were able to achieve, which translated to higher cap rates. But by and large, the spread which is -- which takes into account both the cap rate as well as the cost of capital is very similar right now, very, very similar in both these markets.

But I think the need for that has diminished post this acquisition. We had inbounds from investors who wanted to participate on these one-off transactions, larger transactions outside of the realm of the public eye, and we've largely stayed away from that. because we felt like the transactions that we were actually seeing in the market that was near term, we could handle all on our own. So we haven't had to pursue a partnership at very aggressively. And I think the need for that has diminished even more so now with VEREIT pro forma for the very transaction. And I do believe that our willingness and desire to more actively pursue potential clients that we've talked about, that we might want to speak with and engage with is a lot higher today given that the concentration issues that we could have entered into are somewhat muted now. And so I do think that those types of conversations are going to be a little bit more front and center in terms of what we do and we are going to do it much more proactively. ."

So you should assume that when we discuss the separation of the office assets, we were very clear with the market that we are going to pursue either a spin or a sale and we did. And where we concluded going through those 2 parallel paths was that the spin is a far better option given where we were coming out on the sales side than not, which is precisely why we decided to choose to go down the spinning of the office assets putting a team that was very familiar with all of those assets have been working very hard on asset managing those assets -- was very capable of creating value longer term. 
And what we -- the analysis that we went through was to say, okay, they have a thesis, it's a thesis that makes sense. There are some tailwinds in that particular subsector. Given the success that they've been able to achieve over the last couple of years, you look at that and then you sort of see what they can do with this portfolio going forward. From an alternative perspective, this seems like the absolute right alternative for us to pursue, despite the fact that selling the assets would have been an easier step for Realty Income to take. But we did pursue both those efforts in parallel, and this is the path that on a risk-adjusted basis, yielded the superior outcome for us. And that's the reason why we pursued it."

They were very supportive. When we, in fact, went back after our third quarter announcements and spoke with them, they were, again, very complementary.

It used to be north of 100 basis points not too long ago. 
But for us, we are a yield-driven business. Every incremental yield is a positive for us. And I do believe that in our supplement, we do provide that level of clarity.

Our strong relationships with all our stakeholders enable the success of our business, and we thank everyone listening for your continued support. Additionally, I would like to express my appreciation of our expanded Realty Income team for their tireless efforts in executing on our strategic objectives. 
Today, our business is at an inflection point where the advantages of our growing size and scale provide us an accelerating number of opportunities, compounding our aptitude for growth. We see momentum accelerating across all facets of our business as a result of the following growth catalysts. First, the depth and breadth of our active global pipeline remains robust. During the third quarter, we acquired over $1.6 billion of real estate across 3 countries, resulting in approximately $3.8 billion year-to-date. We now expect to invest in over $5 billion of real estate in 2021, an increase from our prior guidance of $4.5 billion. 
Second, we believe our expansion into Continental Europe during the third quarter will significantly deepen our addressable market at attractive spreads relative to our weighted average cost of capital, particularly given the comparatively low unsecured borrowing rates in the European bond market. 
Third, our asset management activities continued to generate strong results. At the end of the third quarter, our portfolio was 98.8% occupied, and we achieved a rent recapture rate of 107.2%, illustrating the relentless efforts of our asset management team and highlighting the quality of our real estate. 
And finally, with the closing of the VEREIT merger, we believe our size, scale and diversification will further enhance many of our competitive advantages which we suspect should allow us to augment our investment activities in the future. The closing of our merger with VEREIT, as well as the anticipated and subsequent spin-off of substantially all the combined companies' office properties, which, as previously announced, is expected to be completed on November 12, allows us to provide enhanced clarity on our near-term earnings run rate. 
To that end, we are increasing our 2021 AFFO per share guidance to $3.55 to $3.60, representing 5.5% annual growth at the midpoint. And we are introducing 2022 AFFO per share guidance of $3.84 to $3.97, representing 9.2% annual growth at the midpoint. Our 2022 guidance assumes over $5 billion of acquisitions and over $40 million of year 1 G&A synergies we have identified as a result of economies of scale from the merger. These guidance ranges also assume that the anticipated spin-off of our office properties is consummated, as anticipated, on November 12. 
With the closing of the merger, our combined company eclipses $50 billion in enterprise value with size and scale to support numerous growth verticals, providing flexibility to close large transactions without creating concentration risk. Additionally, through this merger, Realty Income has inherited a pipeline, platform and talented acquisition team focused on sourcing high-yielding products that will be additive to our existing pipeline. 
Further, over time, we expect to generate meaningful earnings accretion by refinancing VEREIT's outstanding debt, supported by our comparatively lower borrowing costs driven by our A3/A- ratings and capacity to issue debt in lower-yielding markets. Finally, we are excited to integrate the capabilities of many talented VEREIT colleagues into the Realty Income business as we continue to execute our growth initiatives as one team. 
Now turning to the results for the quarter. We continue to add attractive real estate to our portfolio at a rapid pace. During the third quarter, we sourced nearly $24 billion of acquisition opportunities, ultimately selecting and closing on less than 6%. Of the $1.6 billion of real estate we added to the portfolio in Q3, the largest industry represented was U.K. grocery stores. 
On a revenue basis, approximately 38% of the acquisitions made during the quarter we leased to investment-grade-rated clients, and our total investment-grade client exposure remains approximately 50%. 
The weighted average remaining lease term of the assets added to our portfolio during the quarter was 13.4 years. And in aggregate, all of our acquisition activities during the quarter resulted in healthy investment spreads of approximately 164 basis points. 
As of quarter end, our portfolio remains well diversified, including over 7,000 assets leased to approximately 650 clients who operate in 60 separate industries located in all 50 U.S. states, Puerto Rico, the U.K. and Spain. Giving pro forma effect to the closing of the merger and the anticipated spin-off of our combined office assets as of September 30, 2021, our portfolio now includes over 10,500 assets located in all 50 U.S. states, Puerto Rico, the U.K. and Spain. Our international pipeline continues to add meaningful value to our portfolio, and we believe it will remain an important driver of growth going forward. 
In total, of the nearly $24 billion in acquisition opportunities that we sourced this quarter, approximately 34% was associated with international opportunities. During the third quarter, we added approximately $532 million of high-quality real estate in the U.K. and Spain across 31 properties, bringing our total international portfolio to over $3.2 billion. This quarter, our international acquisition accounted for approximately 33% total acquisition volume. 
As previously announced in September, we made our debut acquisitions in Continental Europe through a sale-leaseback transaction with Carrefour in Spain. Subsequent to quarter end, we announced the completion of an additional Carrefour transaction in Spain, bringing the value of our Continental Europe portfolio to approximately EUR 160 million. We are optimistic about our momentum in Spain as we look to replicate the success of our international growth platform throughout the continent with best-in-class operators who are leaders in their respective industries. 
The health of our core portfolio remains of utmost importance as we continue to expand our platform. At the end of the third quarter, occupancy was 98.8% based on property count, which represents an increase of 30 basis points as compared to last quarter. During the quarter, we re-leased 50 units, recapturing 107.2% of expiring rent, bringing our year-to-date recapture rate to 105.5%. 
We continue to report on quarterly recapture rates and believe this is one of the most objective ways to measure underlying portfolio quality in the net lease industry. Since our listing in 1994, we have executed over 3,800 re-leases or sales on expiring leases, recapturing over 100% of rent on those re-leased contracts. 
At this time, I'll pass it over to Christie, who will further discuss results from the quarter."

This quarter, our business generated AFFO per share of $0.91, strengthened by our acquisition pace and the collection of almost 100% of contractual rents in the third quarter. 
During the quarter, our theater clients paid approximately 99.6% of contractual rent, representing a meaningful improvement compared to the 38% collection rate in the second quarter. We continue to be encouraged by the strong box-office performance of recent blockbuster releases, which we believe signals the long-term viability of the theater industry. 
I was looking forward to the release of the James Bond film, No Time to Die, for months. And based on recent box-office numbers, so were many across the globe. We currently have 34 of our 79 theater assets on cash accounting with approximately $37 million of non-straight-line reserves on our balance sheet. 
Like our business strategy, our approach to evaluating when these 34 theater assets moved back's to an accrual basis and the appropriate time to reverse the allowance for bad debt reserves will be conservative and data driven. More specifically, we will assess the likelihood of collecting on these amounts by evaluating store-level and industry-wide data in conjunction with sustaining payments of past due rents over a healthy period of time. 
As we continue to expand our platform, we will remain steadfast in prioritizing low leverage and a conservative balance sheet strategy while financing our growth initiatives with attractively priced capital. 
At the quarter end, our net debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio was 5x or 4.9x on a pro forma basis, adjusting for the annualized impact of acquisitions and dispositions during the quarter. Our fixed charge coverage ratio hit an all-time high for the third quarter in a row coming in at 6.1x. And during the quarter, we raised over $1.6 billion of equity, approximately $594 million, which was through an overnight offering that closed in July and the remainder primarily through our ATM program. 
During the quarter, we also issued our debut green bond offering, a $750 million multi-tranche, sterling-denominated unsecured bond offering, which priced at a blended yield of approximately 1.48% for an 8.8-year blended tenor. We look forward to continuing to partner with our clients around sustainable practices in accordance with our Green Financing Framework. 
And now I'd like to hand our call back to Sumit."

Good questions. And yes, we are so happy to have the merger behind us. 
In terms of the composition of the pipeline ahead, as well as what we've achieved, what we have -- we shared with the market that they should expect the international acquisition to represent about 1/3 of our acquisition volume going forward. 
In terms of pricing, surprisingly, when I looked at the spreads that we are generating, either here in the U.S. and comparing it to what we were able to do in Europe, they are very similar for this quarter. And in some quarters, we've seen that we were able to get slightly higher yields in the international markets. And in other quarters, it has been the opposite. 
So there's really -- the way we are thinking about our portfolio is through the macro lens that we've identified, what it is that is of interest to us. And the area that we play in, in Europe is slightly narrower, and it's a function of the product that's available than what we play in the U.S. 
In terms of retail versus industrial, as much as we would like to do more industrial, the pricing in this market keeps us fairly constraint to that 10%. On a good quarter, we are able to get to that 15%, 17% ZIP code. But that's the composition of the industrial makeup of the overall acquisition. The rest of it is primarily retail. 
In terms of investment grade versus non-investment grade, we've said this in the past, and I'll repeat it again. When we look at credit and we do our own analysis, we don't go out saying, ""If it's a non-investment-grade credit, we immediately disqualify it for consideration purposes."" If you look at what we were able to achieve in the third quarter, only 38% of what we did was investment grade. So we are very comfortable looking at non-investment grade. And non-investment grade does not necessarily mean sub-investment grade. It just means that it doesn't have a rating from 1 of the 2 major rating agencies, and/or it might actually have a sub-investment grade rating. But we are very comfortable with that. 
The last question that you had as a subpart to your first question was in terms of there being an overlap with what we are inheriting from VEREIT, and there really isn't much. There are certain acquisition opportunities that we would find VEREIT as a competitor, but they played in an area that we believe can truly be additive to our overall platform in the higher-yield side. And we are so blessed to inherit this team, and we are really looking forward to being able to completely integrate them into our acquisitions team and have them continue to pursue the transactions that they were pursuing and potentially not be constrained by the cost of capital. 
So we genuinely believe that this is going to be an incremental to the acquisitions that we were able to achieve on a stand-alone basis. 
And then with respect to pricing, I think I sort of addressed that through my spread comment. So Nate, I don't know if there's anything specific you want me to dive into."

Otherwise, largely, Greg, these are triple net leases. 
And if you think about how this particular portfolio was put together, we'll be able to give you a lot more color once we've got it all integrated. But I'd be very surprised to find gross leases -- a preponderance of gross leases on the retail side and the industrial side of the equation. 
Obviously, industrial products, the landlord tends to be responsible for things like roof and structure, which one could argue is not a pure triple net lease, but that is largely the same case with respect to our portfolio as well. But the property maintenance is still the responsibility of the client, the property taxes. The insurances -- insurance on those buildings, that's still the responsibility of the clients. So we still view those as predominantly net leases. 
So with the separation of the office assets through the spin and the GSA leases, I think we are going to be largely a net lease portfolio, very similar to the one that we have. So I don't think that that's going to pose any major issues, Greg."

Yet, if you were to look at its balance sheet and you were to look at its credit metrics, it would imply a very strong investment-grade credit. But that does not show up in the 38% investment grade. So we've been playing in the area that we've identified coming out of the strategy sessions that we've alluded to in the past, and we feel -- sorry, it's actually Sainsbury's, not Carrefour. Carrefour is actually rated BBB.

It's just not as developed -- I mean, partly, it's driven by being land constrained. You don't have as many freestanding triple-net opportunities in terms of various industries and various tenants playing in that space. Obviously, the size of the actual market is 2x what we have here in the U.S., but the number of industries that lend itself to sort of this triple-net concept are a bit narrower. We've already talked about grocery as being one of the areas that we'd like to focus in on. Home improvement is another area. But it is very unusual to find some of the other industries that we are exposed to on the retail side being available in Mainland Europe. And that's really the point I'm trying to make. 
This is not a constraining factor because I think we've put out some numbers, et cetera, sharing with you how much bigger the actual market is, the addressable market is in Europe that lends itself to net leasable investing.

It was more along the lines of if you look at some of our industry concentration, they were starting to creep to double-digit ZIP codes and somewhat beyond that. And the complementary nature of what we are inheriting from VEREIT, I believe, helps us on a couple of industries. If you look at a few of our largest industries, like convenience stores and groceries, et cetera, all of those concentrations on a pro forma basis is actually going to come down. And so it gives us more capacity to aggressively pursue opportunities that we are finding incredibly compelling to try to get over the finish line. So it just gives us more capacity. That's one. 
The second is being a much larger company, and this is a more recent phenomenon. I think 2 years ago, maybe a little bit longer than that, was the first time I heard of $1 billion sale-leaseback opportunity in our space, and it was on the retail side of the equation. And we've never heard of opportunities of that size. And even for us, if we had some prior exposure to the client, doing a $1 billion transaction, what's going to sort of start to push the concentration risk issue. And now being 1.3, 1.4x the size that we were, it is less of an issue. And the size of sale-leaseback opportunities that are now in play are $1 billion opportunities. 
Now we haven't really seen -- there have been announcements, but we haven't seen anything sort of yet over the finish line on that front. But that, to us, is exactly the type of transactions that we would like to be able to show up for and be able to do and be a single-point solution for some of our clients that we perhaps would not have been able to pursue in our previous version. And so I think that really is what we feel will be one of the biggest beneficiary. 
And also proactively to go to some of these larger companies and be able to say -- and then for large companies, by definition, doing a $500 million sale leaseback doesn't really move the needle for them much. And so to be able to be a solution and provide multibillion-dollar sale-leaseback opportunities for them, I think, could be a lot more compelling. 
And so those are the types of things that we'd be able to pursue post this closing that we obviously thought a lot about in the past, and we have approached certain clients. But it was -- we were guided by what we were hearing in terms of what is really relevant for some of these folks. 
So I think, look, time will tell, but it certainly creates the platform for us to now be able to pursue some of these transactions which we were not able to as aggressively pursue in the past. Ronald?"

And so in terms of the other ascensions like same-store rent and other inputs that go into the model, it is largely along the lines of what we've done in the past. And so you should -- and of course, as we learn more about the portfolio that we've acquired and we look out into the future, and we, more importantly, digest the $5 billion acquisition guidance that we have for this year, I think we'll be in a much better position to give you much more precise numbers on same-store growth, et cetera, et cetera.

Brent, I'll tell you very honestly, we did a lot of homework before we actually went into any particular market. We looked at transactions that have taken place in the past. We try to understand the nuances of the structure as we took into account the tax implications. So a lot of the homework was done prior to us actually engaging with potential clients or the advisory community to start to pursue transactions. So I would say that we weren't overly surprised by the structure of the deal that we've been able to get over the finish line. 
The one thing that has surprised me, personally, and I don't know if Neil and Mark are going to share in my comment, but is the volume comment. I do believe that we have been able to create these relationships that have cemented to and have translated into subsequent transactions much more quickly than what we had originally thought. This is very much a relationship-driven market, which we anticipated, but not to the extent that we've seen it play out. 
They're looking for long-term partners. They're looking for partners that are not in the market to flip out assets, and that is right down the fairway for who we are and how we believe we're generating value for our investors long term. 
The certainty of close to some is incredibly important, far more so than perhaps here in the U.S. It's not that certainty of close is not important, but they are much more price-sensitive here in the U.S. than perhaps in Continental Europe, as well as in the U.K. So reputation, size, scale, the fact that we do what we say does seem to be weighed a lot more significantly in all of Europe than what we had anticipated. 
So that's where the surprise came in, not in terms of the duration of the lease or the cap rates or the growth that we find embedded in these leases. A lot of that was known to us before we went into these markets."

But I do think that over the last 8, 12 and even during the pandemic, the kind of re-leasing that we've been able to achieve without a bunch of capital investments is a testament to the quality of the portfolio that we have. But much more importantly, it's a testament to the asset management team under the tutelage of Janeen that we are able to generate these numbers. 
And so I feel like if you look at the trend and you look at what we've been able to do over the last 3, 4 years, we have generally achieved north of 100% re-leasing spreads. And this, by the way, includes not just clients who are renewing an option but also new clients that we are bringing in into either empty buildings or buildings that are about to go empty. So this is the complete picture of what we've been able to achieve. 
And that is one of the points that we've been trying to talk about that our business on a normalized basis is going to become a 7-year vault business. And a lot of value is either going to get created through this channel or not. And we've been anticipating this and building out our asset management team in anticipation of being able to generate the kind of results that we are posting on a quarter-by-quarter basis.

And once again, I'm not going to go into the details. But what you see as the headline cap rate, yes, you're seeing that they seem to be very close. There are some inter-quarter variability. Like I believe in the second quarter, we had a slightly higher cap rate associated with international, and it was a function of the type of assets that we got and the length of the lease terms that we were able to achieve which translated to higher cap rates. But by and large, the spread which is -- which takes into account both the cap rate, as well as the cost of capital, is very similar right now, very, very similar in both these markets. 
But I do think it's partly driven by we are playing in a much narrower industry spectrum in Europe, and we have been doing a lot more industrial here in the U.S. And it sort of balances out, and it yields a number that you see as the headline number posted on our supplemental."

This is -- this year was a very interesting year for us because we had a very healthy pipeline, just like we do today, coming into the year. But it was post pandemic, and we didn't quite know how things are going to play out. But we felt very good about coming in and saying $3.25 billion, which we have since revised a couple of times. 
And so as we're getting more and more comfortable with the new markets that we are entering into, with the sourcing volumes that we are seeing, with the maturation of the team that we have in place, that's what is giving us the confidence. 
In the beginning, I used to talk with my colleagues, and we would earmark about 20% to 25% international. Well, today, it's closer to 30%, 35%. We built out the team in the international side. We have a much more mature team and a fantastic team on the U.S. side. And now, we're going to inherit a group of veterans from this acquisition. 
So that's really the build-out that we've done internally, and we feel fairly confident about to come out and say, ""Look, this year, we're going to do north of $5 billion.

What we don't want to do is have a particular number dictate our decision-making. We want to come out -- and this is right along the lines of how we've operated the business. This is the largest acquisition volume number that we're going to be coming out with in our history. 
You're right. This is by design that we've created all these avenues, and we should be increasing our guidance. And perhaps there is a level of conservatism, but we would like nothing better to come in, in February and revise our numbers and say, ""You know what? We've had a chance to revisit and be able to come in with a high level of confidence, given all of these other new strategies that we are putting a lot more effort into, i.e., higher yielding, newer markets, being able to have 1 quarter under our belt in Spain, figuring out what we can or cannot do there.""

But I think the need for that has diminished post this acquisition. We had inbounds from investors who wanted to participate on these one-off transactions, larger transactions outside of the realm of the public eye. And we've largely stayed away from that because we felt like the transactions that we were actually seeing in the market that was near term, we could handle all on our own. So we haven't had to pursue a partnership very aggressively. And I think the need for that has diminished even more so now with this -- with pro forma for the VEREIT transaction. And I do believe that our willingness and desire to more actively pursue potential clients that we've talked about, that we might want to speak with and engage with is a lot higher today given that the concentration issues that we could have entered into are somewhat muted now. 
And so I do think that those types of conversations are going to be a little bit more front and center in terms of what we do, and we are going to do it much more proactively. That's correct."

Putting a team that was very familiar with all of those assets have been working very hard on asset managing those assets -- was very capable of creating value longer term. 
And what we -- the analysis that we went through was to say, ""Okay. They have a thesis. It's a thesis that makes sense. There are some tailwinds in that particular subsector given the success that they've been able to achieve over the last couple of years. You look at that, and then you sort of see what they can do with this portfolio going forward."" From an alternative perspective, this seems like the absolute right alternative for us to pursue, despite the fact that selling the assets would have been an easier step for Realty Income to take.

There is no doubt that we are able to get slightly higher yield on development projects than we would on assets that are ready for delivery. And that could range. It could range anywhere between -- and by the way, that has compressed. But it could range anywhere between 25 basis points to, on the odd occasion, maybe 75, 80 basis points. It used to be north of 100 basis points not too long ago. 
But for us, we are a yield-driven business. Every incremental yield is a positive for us. Spenser. So I do believe that, in our supplement, we do provide that level of clarity. We do break out what the development yields are, and so you should be able to track that as part of our overall acquisition volume and how much of it is attributable to the development funding.
