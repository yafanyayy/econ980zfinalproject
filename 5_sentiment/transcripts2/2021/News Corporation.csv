Across this country and around the world in so many places for so many people these past few months have been characterized by considerable upheaval, with social, political, financial and health-related tribulations and turmoil deeply pro",2885,"Thank you, Mike. Across this country and around the world in so many places for so many people these past few months have been characterized by considerable upheaval, with social, political, financial and health-related tribulations and turmoil deeply profoundly affecting many families, economies and communities. I trust that all on this call and your families have been weathering the storm safely and sagely. 
In the midst of this [ turmoil ], which has been a severe stress test for individuals and businesses and countries. I am gratified to report that News Corp has navigated the turbulence and to be candid, significantly, very significantly, increased profitability. We noted 3 months ago that the first quarter was particularly robust. And so I am pleased to report that our second quarter results were even more robust. And this burgeoning is a tribute to the efforts and the commitment and the professionalism of all our employees and to the enduring value of the company's culture created by Rupert Murdoch. 
In fact, the second quarter of fiscal year 2021 was the most profitable quarter since the day News Corp was launched more than 7 years ago. And there were other significant records established. We have the largest profits for Dow Jones since the acquisition of the company in December 2007. While we reported a 77% rise in EBITDA at subscription video services, where at Foxtel, streaming customers hit an historic high, and we also benefited from lower costs. 
As Digital Real Estate Services move accounted for approximately 80% of that segment's EBITDA growth. And history was made when the New York Post reported a profit for the quarter and for the year-to-date, that is the first profit in modern times at the very least, for what was a chronic loss-making master founded in 1801 by Alexander Hamilton. 
In short, Digital Real Estate Services, Book Publishing and Dow Jones all performed powerful in Q2, collectively generating segment EBITDA growth of close to 40%. Their continuing expansion highlights profound potential of the company to increase profits and generate value for our shareholders far into the future. These resilient results are founded on our long-term strategic shift in the company's assets, determine digitization and a relentless discipline on costs. We were adamant that we would not be victims of digital dystopia, but that we would contribute to fashioning a more fruitful future for content creators, and we are seeing the results of that result.  It is fair to say that regulators globally have joined the digital docs. 
In the second quarter, every segment in News Corp showed marked operating improvements and contributed meaningfully to our profitability. We continue to see increased cooperation across the company with valuable digital lessons and insights at each business rigorously applied for the benefit of all and to the benefit of shareholders. While overall revenues at over $2.4 billion declined 3 point -- 3% year-on-year, that was fundamentally due to the sale of News America marketing in 2020. 
On an adjusted basis, a more genuine like-for-like comparison, revenues rose 2% despite the pernicious consequences of COVID-19. Segment EBITDA for the quarter was $497 million, the highest of any quarter since our reincarnation in 2030. Year-over-year, that represents profitability growth of 40%, while our free cash flow available to News Corp for the half rose by $373 million. 
A pandemic is indeed a stress test, and News Corp is surely passing that test. At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, Move's revenue growth was 28%, and that came despite restrictions in certain states on inspections and bus sales. Having been an [ utter ] support of the acquisition of Move, it is worth noting that we believe the net cost of this company, including the substantial settlement we ultimately received from Zillow in our trade secret lawsuit against them is in the fraction of its current value. Net-net, we paid considerably less than $1 billion for Move in 2014. We believe it is worth vastly more today. And how much will it be worth in 5 years as the digitization of sales in the world's largest property market continues at pace. 
At the time of our acquisition, realtor.com was a struggling third place platform with modest profitability and fewer of the 30 million monthly users. There was some TRI -- touting about the acquisition. But we were absolutely clear that our media platforms and growing digital expertise, plus our experience with REA in Australia would enable us to transform the company. 
In the first half of this fiscal year, REALTOR has contributed more to our profit growth than the brilliant beacon that is REA in Australia. So how much is REALTOR worth now? How much is these [indiscernible] ? I will let you do the math. 
To help you do that math, a few specifics. REALTOR traffic has now outgrowing Zillow for 19 of the past 21 months, according to Comscore, including the last 11 months in a row. According to our internal metrics, average unique monthly users in the second quarter were 37% higher than the prior year, and we reached each month, on average, 80 million people. Just to give you a sense of besides scale and loyalty, we had [ 8.7 billion ] total  paid views in the second quarter, more than 1 page for every person on our plant, and that number does not include photo galleries of houses. 
Multiplied the number of visitors by the images in those galleries, and you get a sense of the scale of the intense interaction by users. Traffic has continued to grow since the quarter's end, with unique users reaching a record 94 million for the month of January. During Q2, Moves expanded in the rental market through its acquisition of [ Aveo ], an online property management platform that focuses on doing yourself landlords and tenants. This is significant. Given the fact that DIY landlords own and manage about 3/4 of rentals in the U.S. and a rental market according to U.S. Sensors Bureau data is a $500 billion per business.  So the addressable market is appreciable and appreciated. 
Also in Q2, realtor.com launched an advertising partnership with Rocket Mortgage, while continuing to build an even more seamless process for consumers wishing to qualify for mortgages to purchase a home. In January, REALTOR announced a partnership with Qualia to provide simplified digital home closings, allowing for greater online collaboration between agents and their clients. 
Let us be very clear. Buying a home is by far the largest investment that most families will make. And the purchase around that acquisition, whether it be securing a mortgage or starting with electricity or broadband provider unnecessary and valuable adjacencies. The home purchase is at the very center of that cluster of commerce and REALTORs are at the very center of that purchase. From a macro perspective, the overall housing market in the U.S. not only has proven to be resilient during a tonic crisis. It has demonstrated tangible strength with many positive signs of activity even with listing volumes at a historic low. 
With mortgage rates at a minimum and family is expanding their search for better larger homes and new locations, there is reason to be optimistic about the trajectory of the sector. Resilience and optimism also characterized the housing market in Australia, where the emergence from lockdowns in the quarter has led to significant signs of recovery. Australia is still a growing economy, and it will continue to benefit from its location in the world's fastest-growing region. The deep ties with Asia, including India, give it a distinct advantage, along with its reliable legal procedures and stable coherent cogent political system. 
We believe it is still a country that is far from maximizing its potential and the growth opportunities up announced. In the second quarter, REA acquired a controlling interest in Elara Technologies, making it the majority owner of a large and growing Indian digital real estate portal, including housing.com and proptiger.com. As measured by audience, Elara runs India's fastest-growing digital real estate business, and India itself is one of the world's fastest growing economies.  So the possibilities are profound. 
We are under Tracey Fellows leadership by many measures, the world's largest digital property company, and we are acutely focused on the countries that we believe have the largest digital property potential. Meanwhile, HarperCollins had one of exposed lucrative quarters with double-digit growth across every category. There were many successful new releases. While the back was bolstered both revenue and profitability as did our continued growth in digital. Brian Murray and the team are at a relatively early stage of the development of audio boards and the proliferation of audio devices to the home will only increase the demand for our content. I'm not sure that all investors have yet comprehended the full value of that digital opportunity. 
As for the resident titles in a successful catalog, there was -- didn't you see that coming by Rachel Hollis. The happy in a hurry cookbook [indiscernible]. The greatest secret by [ under burn ] [ frontier follies ] and the continuing strong demand for Magnolia table volume to by [ Goenaga ]. And then in January, there was Bridgeton. We have the series of 9 Bridgeton books by Julio Quinn, which are prospering, given the popularity of the autonomous series for which a new series has recently been announced. 
In all, revenues at HarperCollins ascended 23% in the quarter, and segment EBITDA surged 65% over the prior year. Dow Jones also set records this quarter, including having its highest absolute EBITDA since News Corp acquired the company in late 2007 with segment EBITDA up 43%. While for New York Times [ eked ] out a 1% increase. Digital advertising expanded 29%, the highest quarter in Dow Jones history, while digital advertising at the New York Times fell by 2%. 
Clearly, print was challenged during a pandemic period in which distribution was compromised. But overall advertising was down just 4%. Comparing dramatically with the New York Times, we're at slump 19%. In our Professional Information Business, risk and compliance continued its record of extraordinary expansion with year-over-year revenue growth accelerating to 21%. Q2 marks risk and compliance 22nd consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth year-over-year. 
Given international tension with both the U.S. and China in posing controls on companies. And with the new administration in U.S. in clients a tougher regulation, how bright are the prospects for risk and compliance. If anyone on this call works for a company that is not yet a client, I suggest that you remedy that dereliction. 
Traffic and subscribers across Dow Jones, properties are surging. And Almar and the team are determined to make the most of the opportunity. WSJ digital-only subscriptions were up 28% in market, which also had a successful digital subscription launch in Q2. We have always insisted that our strategy is to upsell at Dow Jones given our non [ paray ] portfolio. And so it's worth noting that more than 70% of those market watch subscribers chose a bundle that included subscription to parents. 
As for traffic, average monthly unique users across the Dow Jones digital network were up 48% in the quarter, reaching $127 million, driven by 64% growth at both the Wall Street Journal and Barron's. In subscription video services, our strategy to reshape the Foxtel Group as a next-generation subscription business is clearly gaining traction with total closing paid subscriptions increasing 12% and setting a new record of over 3.31 million. 
OTT now accounts for 40% of Foxtel's paying subscriber base, with more than 1.3 million streaming subscribers. The actual growth rate in streaming subscribers was over 90%, driven by the strength of Binge, which launched last May and the continued expansion of Kayo. 
In the past, there has been skepticism about whether we could transition from our reliance on traditional broadcast, but those concerns have proven unfounded, and Foxtel is now a company with a diverse portfolio and much momentum. I would like to repeat the EBITDA at the Subscription Video Services segment for the quarter rose 77% on the same quarter last year. 
And for the first half, segment EBITDA was 34% higher. Growth has been crucial for that success. But we have a leadership team at Foxtel steered [ ale ] by [ Jihua Makena ] and [ Patrick Delaney ] that has been absolutely focused on reviewing every aspect of the company's performance and diligently reducing costs where appropriate. 
[ Not ] the inside, foresight and discipline has contributed to the transformation of the company and given us a powerful platform and much optionality for the future. We have now secured long-term rights to the 3 most popular sports in the country, Ausie Rules, Rugby league and cricket, which had stashed success in the summer with the tour of the triumphed Indian team. Record after record was set on the cricket pitch and [ Andres gray ], whether the traditional screen or a digital device. And that multi-platform future is now secured with both Australian rules and Rugby thanks to our partners at Telstra. Over 3 million [ Live Pass ] customers will have the opportunity to transition to Kayo over the coming months so that they can watch their tent when they want to watch, how they want to watch, where they want to watch and on whatever device they want to launch. This is a monumental moment for Foxtel. 
Our News Media segment also contributed meaningfully to use core's profitability this quarter. With digital ad growth in the U.K. and at the New York Post. We had indeed indicated that the New York Post was on a path towards profitability, and it certainly achieved that fall in the second quarter. Our task now is to enjoy its long-term profitability, given the challenges in that sector. Digital ad growth at the post was 64% up year-over-year. For the quarter, digital advertising accounted for nearly 90% of the total page views of the posts were up 37%. It was also a quarter in which the Post reported a significant victory for all media for the freedom of the press. By standing resolute and principled against censorship imposed by Twitter. 
Ultimately, put a realize that have made an egregious mistake and thankfully, reversed it's decision. Our journalist are not lap dogs with laptops. Our journalists are not photographers, are journals do not work. Are journalists are on way to their profound responsibilities. 
In Australia, we were fortunately ahead of the curve in transitioning many of our local and regional print properties to digital platforms, which help them weather the storm of lockdown. Our Australian leadership under Michael Miller was disciplined in reducing costs and yet remains ambitious for our news platforms during this time of transition for journals. And Rebraca Brooks showed real leadership in the U.K. across our baskets like the [ San Altan ], in our emerging digital businesses and it was our radio network, which reached nearly 5 million business. 
In both Australia and the U.K., we are using our skills in video and audio to enhance our traditional platforms, and that is clear at Times Radio, which is an extension of a newspaper founded in London in 1785. On these calls, I've often referenced the ongoing debate with what is loosely called [ Big Digital ]. I personally regard that Monica as a [indiscernible]. 
We're at a pivotal moment of those discussions in Australia, where new regulations and new terms of trade will be introduced. But that debate now extends across the globe. There is not a single serious digital regulator anywhere in the world who is not examining the opacity of algorithms, the integrity of personal data, the social value of professional journalism and the dysfunctional digital ad market. 
This has been an imperative for News Corp for far more than a decade. I gave evidence the health of lord in London on this various subject in 2007. And it has been an imperative because we truly care about the social value of journalism, and we believe that the social value has a commercial value. 
This enduring often [indiscernible] campaign would not have been successful without the further support of Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch and the News Corp Board. We expect that the new tech topography will benefit our company's financial fortunes. That is for certain. And it will also have a material impact in not only the countries in which we operate, but in every country. An ambitious inspired young woman starting a digital news site in Nigeria or in Birmingham, England or Birmingham, Alabama, now has a far better, a far, far better chance of sustainable success. 
Finally, I want to thank all those contributed to the singular success of News Corp in this historic quarter. That would be all our employees who've contributed each day in courageous compassionate ways. I salute those individuals for what they have done and for what they continue to do for the company and for their communities. Thank you. 
While the macro environment remains unpredictable, our goal is to ensure that new score is best positioned for long-term success and that our value is absolutely appreciated by investors. And now I hand you to Susan Panuccio for some wise words."

Fiscal 2021 second quarter total revenues were over $2.4 billion, a decline of 3% versus the prior year, while total segment EBITDA was $497 million, up 40% year-over-year, reflecting strong performances across all of our key reportable segments, driven by a combination of improved operating trends and cost reductions. This is the highest quarterly segment EBITDA since the company was formed in 2013. 
On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact from acquisitions and divestitures, most notably the sale of News American marketing in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 as well as currency fluctuations and other items disclosed in our release revenues rose 2%, while total segment EBITDA grew 39%. Net income for the quarter was $261 million compared to $103 million in the prior year. 
For the quarter, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.39 as compared to $0.14 in the prior year. Adjusted EPS was $0.34 in the quarter compared with $0.18 in the prior year. 
Turning now to the operating segments. Digital Real Estate Services segment revenues were $339 million, an increase of 15% compared to the prior year, which is more than double the rate in the first quarter. Driven by another record quarterly performance for Move. On an adjusted basis, revenues increased 11%. Segment EBITDA rose 20% to $142 million or 19% on an adjusted basis despite higher investment spending, which was in contrast to the first quarter. Results also included $6 million of costs associated with Moves acquisition of Avail and the Elara transaction at REA. 
Moves operating results accounted for over 75% of segment revenue growth and approximately 80% of segment EBITDA growth this quarter. Moves revenues accelerated to $155 million, a 28% year-over-year increase, with real estate revenues rising 30%. As Robert mentioned, realtor.com traffic reached 80 million average monthly unique users, reflecting an increase of 37% year-over-year with growth in December accelerating to 44%. Monthly average lead volume remained very strong, growing over 30%. 
Like the first quarter, we saw strong growth in the performance-based referral model, which accounted for approximately 30% of total Move revenues in the quarter, benefiting from the growth in lead volume, higher home prices and real estate transaction closes. Not only did we see an acceleration in the revenue growth of the referral model this quarter compared to the prior quarter but we also saw growth in connection plus our traditional lead generation product, driven by strong customer demand, enabling improved pricing and higher sell through. 
As our referral revenues are recognized upon transaction closures, only around 20% of the associated revenues from leads generated in this quarter are reflected in the results. This provides a strong pipeline through the balance of the year, assuming continued favorable housing conditions. These results are very encouraging, and we remain focused on expanding our addressable market through the integration of key ancillary services, including our rocket mortgage partnership. 
We've contributed $19 million to the segment EBITDA growth this quarter versus the prior year, driven by the strong top line growth. As we had previously indicated, we are increasing our investment levels in real check, given the rapid performance in lead volume and further expansion into adjacency. Revenues at REA Group rose 6% to $184 million, reflecting a $12 million or 7% benefit from currency fluctuations. 
COVID-19 restrictions eased during the quarter, including the removal of property inspection restrictions in Melbourne. Residential listings for the quarter rose 10%, including 25% growth in Metro Melbourne and 13% growth in Sydney. A new developer project launches increased 12% on the prior year. REA's results benefited from growth in residential debt revenues, which was offset by declines in [commercial] and Asia. It also is worth remembering that as a consequence of COVID, REA did not implement a price increase in July. 
Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for more detail. Turning to Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $511 million, up 2% versus the prior year and included a $33 million or 7% positive impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Adjusted revenues were down 5%, an improvement on the Q1 decline of 7%, benefiting from moderating broadcast subscription revenue declines and the expansion of OTT revenues. 
Foxtel's closing paid subscriber base reached over 3.3 million as of December 31, up 12% year-over-year, with OTT expanding to over 1.3 million paying subscribers, close to double the prior year's number. The Kayo, reaching 624,000 and Binge at 431,000 paying subscribers. Kayo subscribers declined slightly quarter-over-quarter due to seasonality, but the decline was much less pronounced than last year as the business successfully managed the transition from winter to spring and summer sporting codes, underpinned by the exclusive cricket content. 
Residential broadcast subscribers declined about 11% to approximately $1.8 million, relatively consistent with last quarter. Commercial subscribers declined 18% year-over-year to 218,000, with the trend improving sequentially, having bottomed out at 86,000 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 as a consequence of the pandemic. Broadcast shared was somewhat elevated at 17.5% versus 16% in the prior year, impacted by a strategy to reduce [ promotional ] offers, which resulted in the roll-off of lower ARPU subscribers. 
The financial benefit is reflected in a 3% increase in ARPU to almost AUD 80. Segment EBITDA improved 77% to $124 million, the continuing cost transformation at Foxtel desired to rightsize the cost base was the driver of profitability. Total cost declined approximately 10%, including $35 million of lower sports programming rights and production costs, which was primarily driven by savings from renegotiated sports rights partially offset by the $20 million negative impact related to the deferral of these costs from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. 
Expenses also benefited from lower entertainment programming costs and lower overheads. Some of the cost benefits are timing related, which will reverse later in the year, I will touch on these later. 
Moving on to Dow Jones. Dow Jones delivered its highest revenue quarter since separation in 2013 and its higher segment EBITDA quarter since News Corp's acquisition in 2007. Revenues for the quarter were $446 million, up 4% compared to the prior year, with digital revenues accounting for 70% of total revenues this quarter, up 6 percentage points from the prior year. 
Circulation revenues rose 8% due to growth in digital circulation revenues, partially offset by lower single copy and amenity print volume still impacted by COVID-19. As Robert mentioned, Dow Jones again achieved record subscriptions in the quarter with average subscriptions to its consumer products for the quarter exceeding $4 million, up 18% from the prior year and off that digital-only subscriptions were over $3 million, up 29% year-over-year. 
For the Wall Street Journal, there were 3.2 million average subscriptions for the quarter, up nearly 19% from the prior year, with digital-only subscriptions growing 28% to nearly 2.5 million. Revenues from Dow Jones Risk and Compliance grew 21%, which was a faster growth rate than the past 3 quarters. Overall, professional information business revenues rose 4%. 
Advertising revenues, which accounted for 26% of revenues this quarter declined just 4% to $115 million, a marked improvement from the 17% decline last quarter. As Robert mentioned, we had another record quarter for digital advertising with 29% growth and digital accounting for 58% of advertising revenues for the second quarter. We saw growth in all categories, particularly in technology. Print advertising revenues declined 29% year-over-year, which was an improvement from the 39% decline in the first quarter. 
Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter rose 43% to $109 million, with margins expanding to over 24% and up almost 7 percentage points versus the prior year. Costs declined almost 5% this quarter due to lower print volumes and other discretionary savings. At Book Publishing, HarperCollins posted 23% revenue growth to $544 million and a 65% segment EBITDA growth to $104 million, marking the best quarterly performance in its history. Revenue growth was strong across all categories with double digit gains. Robert mentioned the depth of the sub list this quarter, which included strong performances from numerous authors, including Rachel Hollis, Ronda Burn, Redrum and Joanna Gaines and David Wollam among others. Similar to what we saw in the past 2 quarters, we are continuing to benefit from a strong rebound in e-books with overall digital sales up 15% year-over-year. E-book sales increased 21% year-over-year with gains in all categories. While downloadable audio books increased 10% year-over-year. 
We have continued to see higher online sales and, in particular, benefited from strong orders from Amazon and other e-commerce platforms during the holiday season. But perhaps more importantly, we are seeing very strong consumption levels, likely benefiting from stay at home measures and a continuous flow of new content. Revenues increased at low double digits across the backlist, notwithstanding, they contributed 55% of sales this quarter, down from 58% last year due to the larger mix of the front list titles. HarperCollins again demonstrated strong operating leverage despite a 16% increase in cost, in part due to royalties and higher production expenses related to the successful top line performance, margins improved by almost 5 percentage points. 
Turning to News Media. Despite ongoing challenges, we remain focused on rightsizing the cost base and moving towards digital, helped by a moderation in advertising revenue trends. Revenues for the quarter were $573 million, down 29% versus the prior year, of which the impact from the divestment of News America marketing accounted for the majority of the decline. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact from the divestment of NAM and unruly and the other items mentioned in our release, revenues declined 9%, which is an improvement from a 16% decline in the first quarter. 
The decline also reflects $34 million or 4% negative impact from the closure or transition to digital of certain regional and community newspapers in Australia. Circulation and subscription revenues rose 5%, as a $9 million or 4% benefit from currency fluctuations, strong digital paid subscriber growth and cover price increases offset lower new stand sales related to COVID-19. Overall, the year-over-year trends in local currency were better in both the U.K. and Australia compared to the first quarter. Circulation revenues accounted for 45% of total segment revenues. And was slightly higher than advertising this quarter as the mix of revenues become more recurring and predictable. 
Advertising revenue fell $231 million or 48% on a reported basis, of which $191 million or 40% was from the sale of News America marketing. And $28 million or 6% was related to the negative impact from the closure or transition to digital a certain regional community titles in Australia. The remainder of the decline was due to the overall weakness in the print advertising market. 
On a positive note, the New York Post continued to outperform with advertising revenues up 23%. And as Robert mentioned, digital advertising up 64%. In fact, digital revenues at the New York Post exceeded 50% of total revenues this quarter. And overall, the New York Post had its highest digital revenue since 2013. Segment EBITDA for the quarter was $66 million, flat with the prior year despite the $22 million a onetime benefit in the prior year related to a settlement of certain warranty related claims in the U.K. and the absence of the modest contribution from News America marketing. 
Adjusted segment EBITDA increased 5%, which included a $5 million positive contribution from the New York Post. I would now like to talk about some themes in the upcoming quarter and the second half. Overall, we expect to see some slowdown in the second half results with forecasting remaining particularly challenging given the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic. At Digital Real Estate Services, as REO noted, National Residential Listings in Australia for January were flat to the prior year. Results will reflect a small loss related to the consolidation of Elara Technologies in the second half. Please refer to REA's press release and earnings call for more detail. 
At Move, we remain encouraged by the traffic and lead volume trends, which are expected to drive higher revenues in the second half despite the historically low listing volumes across the industry. We expect these higher revenues to fund at least $40 million of additional reinvestments in the second half compared to the prior year in areas such as brand marketing and product development as we focus on gaining market share and expanding into adjacencies. In Subscription Video Services, we have seen more cost churn continue to increase due to the ongoing focus on ARPU and seasonal trends with the end of winter sports. 
However, Kayo has remained resilient, and our OTT subscriber growth led by Binge remains strong. We expect EBITDA results in the second half to be more challenged due in part to the lapping of the prior year cost savings. As a reminder, fiscal 2020 fourth quarter results included a $70 million cost benefit due to the deferral of sports rights and production costs related to COVID-19. We now expect full year overall cost declines, given the better-than-expected revenue performance to be more modest than we had initially expected, with a net reduction of less than AUD 100 million. This includes approximately AUD 80 million of higher sports comp in the second half of fiscal 2021, particularly in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period. 
At Dow Jones, overall revenue trends remained favorable compared to the prior year, including strong digital advertising growth, as we look to the rest of the year, we continue to expect to reinvest in the business as we focus on driving revenue growth to its digital assets and expect second half expenses to increase modestly compared to the prior year. In addition, third quarter will face a more difficult digital advertising growth comparison. 
In Book Publishing, overall industry trends remain favorable, we continue to monitor closely the sustainability of recent consumer spending patterns. Such as the increasing free time for consumers to read and the increase in the average number of books purchased. The second half comparables will be tougher, particularly in the fourth quarter, given the material outperformance last year and as we lap some of the initial benefits at the outset of COVID-19. 
At News Media, the ongoing national knockdown in the U.K. and domestic travel restrictions in Australia continue to put pressure on print circulation, especially with day new [indiscernible] sales and are also creating increased uncertainty on advertising spend across most categories. Cost declines in the second half are expected to moderate from the first half rate as we lap some COVID-19 saving initiatives as well as the divestment of News America marketing and the closure or digital transition of some of our newspapers in Australia in the fourth quarter. 
In our other segment, for the second half, we expect at least a $50 million increase in cost, driven by a combination of higher equity comp related to the stock price performance and the absence of the bonus reductions across the senior executive team in the prior year in response to COVID-19 as well as additional costs related to the implementation of the global shared services initiative. 
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

I might take those questions, and Robert can add and supplement as he will. So just in relation to the sustainability of growth. I mean, we remain very confident in the growth of the business and are encouraged by the traffic and the lead volumes, as we talked about in our preprepared remarks, notwithstanding the industry listing volumes remain at historically low levels. We do expect with the revenue growth, the cost will increase. And I think the interesting thing to note, when we think about the results for this quarter versus the first quarter. Actually, the cost increased this quarter. And so it was really top line revenue growth that was dropping down to the bottom line. So we do think that the revenue growth will continue, and we do want to scale up those costs in the reinvestment areas that I mentioned, marketing and product development. 
Just in relation to shared services, yes, we did quote $100 million for financial year '22. We're still holding that number at this stage, notwithstanding the cost work that we've done across the business. We do still think that there are enormous opportunities, but it will require, obviously, a lot of work and reconfiguration of our systems in order to unlock those savings. But at this stage, the guidance is still [ $100 million ] for financial year '22."

Obviously, there's been a lot of cost work that's been done. And you're right. Some of that is obviously volume related, and some of that will scale up and down depending on how those trade in light of COVID. But there are also significant permanent cost reductions as the teams have been working on. We've had significant reduction in headcount that came through in the back end of last fiscal year that is obviously flowing through here. But we do have a lot of costs that have come out in the overhead space as well. Now some of that naturally will come back in as the businesses open up, but we would also hope that some of that may be permanent as we change the way work going forward. We also had in the back end of last year's significant reduction marketing expenditure within News Media, we would expect to see some of that starts to come back in, but not necessarily the levels that we're seeing. So I think a balance of both as we work forward. 
And I do think actually that there are still permanent cost reduction opportunities that the businesses are working on within that segment. A lot of that has to do with the restructuring of the business and the reconfiguration, and the teams are actively working on that."

Across this country and around the world in so many places for so many people, these past few months have been characterized by considerable upheaval, with social, political, financial and health-related tribulations and turmoil deeply profoundly affecting many families, economies and communities. I trust that all on this call and your families have been weathering the storm safely and safely.
In the midst of this tumult, which has been a severe stress test for individuals and businesses and countries, I am gratified to report that News Corp has navigated the turbulence, and to be candid, significantly very significantly, increased profitability. We noted 3 months ago that the first quarter was particularly robust. And so I am pleased to report that our second quarter results were even more robust. And this burgeoning is a tribute to the efforts and the commitment and the professionalism of all our employees and to the enduring value of the company's culture created by Rupert Murdoch.
In fact, the second quarter of fiscal year 2021 was the most profitable quarter since the new News Corp was launched more than 7 years ago, and there were other significant records established. We have the largest profits for Dow Jones since the acquisition of the company in December 2007. While we reported a 77% rise in EBITDA at subscription video services, where at Foxtel, streaming customers hit an historic high, and we also benefited from lower costs.
As Digital Real Estate Services, Move accounted for approximately 80% of that segment's EBITDA growth. And history was made when the New York Post reported a profit for the quarter and for the year-to-date. That is the first profit in modern times at the very least, for what was a chronic loss-making masthead founded in 1801 by Alexander Hamilton.
In short, Digital Real Estate Services, Book Publishing and Dow Jones all performed powerfully in Q2, collectively generating segment EBITDA growth of close to 40%. Their continuing expansion highlights profound potential of the company to increase profits and generate value for our shareholders far into the future. These resilient results are founded on our long-term strategic shift in the company's assets, determine digitization and a relentless discipline on costs. 
We were adamant that we would not be victims of digital dystopia, but that we would contribute to fashioning a more fruitful future for content creators, and we are seeing the results of that result. It is fair to say that regulators globally have joined the digital dots. 
In the second quarter, every segment in News Corp showed marked operating improvements and contributed meaningfully to our profitability. We continue to see increased cooperation across the company with valuable digital lessons and insights at each business rigorously applied for the benefit of all and to the benefit of shareholders. 
While overall revenues at over $2.4 billion declined 3 point -- 3% year-on-year, that was fundamentally due to the sale of News America Marketing in 2020. On an adjusted basis, a more genuine like-for-like comparison, revenues rose 2% despite the pernicious consequences of COVID-19. Segment EBITDA for the quarter was $497 million, the highest of any quarter since our reincarnation in 2013. Year-over-year, that represents profitability growth of 40%, while our free cash flow available to News Corp for the half rose by $373 million. A pandemic is indeed a stress test, and News Corp is surely passing that test. 
At the Digital Real Estate Services segment, Move's revenue growth was 28%, and that came despite restrictions in certain states on inspections and thus sales. Having been an ardent supporter of the acquisition of Move, it is worth noting that we believe the net cost of this company, including the substantial settlement we ultimately received from Zillow in our trade secret lawsuit against them is a mere fraction of its current value. Net-net, we paid considerably less than $1 billion for Move in 2014. We believe it is worth vastly more today. And how much will it be worth in 5 years as the digitization of sales in the world's largest property market continues at pace.
At the time of our acquisition, realtor.com was a struggling third place platform with modest profitability and fewer than 30 million monthly users. There was some [indiscernible] about the acquisition. But we were absolutely clear that our media platforms and growing digital expertise, plus our experience with REA in Australia would enable us to transform the company.
In the first half of this fiscal year, REALTOR has contributed more to our profit growth than the brilliant beacon that is REA in Australia. So how much is REALTOR worth now? How much is New Corp worth? I will let you do the math. To help you do that math, a few specifics. REALTOR traffic has now outgrowing Zillow for 19 of the past 21 months, according to comScore, including the last 11 months in a row. 
According to our internal metrics, average unique monthly users in the second quarter were 37% higher than the prior year, and we reached each month, on average, 80 million people. Just to give you a sense of site scale and loyalty, we had 8.7 total billion paid views in the second quarter, more than 1 page for every person on our plant, and that number does not include photo galleries of houses.
Multiply the number of visitors by the images in those galleries, and you get a sense of the scale of the intense interaction by users. Traffic has continued to grow since the quarter's end, with unique users reaching a record 94 million for the month of January. 
During Q2, Moves expanded in the rental market through its acquisition of Avail, an online property management platform that focuses on doing yourself landlords and tenants. This is significant given the fact that DIY landlords own and manage about 3/4 of rentals in the U.S. and a rental market according to U.S. Census Bureau data is a $500 billion per year business. So the addressable market is appreciable and appreciated.
Also in Q2, realtor.com launched an advertising partnership with Rocket Mortgage, while continuing to build an even more seamless process for consumers wishing to qualify for mortgages to purchase a home. In January, REALTOR announced a partnership with Qualia to provide simplified digital home closings, allowing for greater online collaboration between agents and their clients.
Let us be very clear. Buying a home is by far the largest investment that most families will make. And the purchase around that acquisition, whether it be securing a mortgage or starting with electricity or broadband provider are necessary and valuable adjacencies. The home purchase is at the very center of that cluster of commerce and REALTOR's are at the very center of that purchase. 
From a macro perspective, the overall housing market in the U.S. not only has proven to be resilient during the time of crisis, it has demonstrated tangible strength with many positive signs of activity even with listing volumes at a historic low. With mortgage rates at a minimum and families expanding their search for better larger homes and new locations, there is reason to be optimistic about the trajectory of the sector. 
Resilience and optimism also characterized the housing market in Australia, with the emergence from lockdowns in the quarter has led to significant signs of recovery. Australia is still a growing economy, and it will continue to benefit from its location in the world's fastest-growing region. The deep ties with Asia, including India, give it a distinct advantage, along with its reliable legal procedures and stable coherent cogent political system. We believe it is still a country that is far from maximizing its potential and the growth opportunities are pronounced.
In the second quarter, REA acquired a controlling interest in Elara Technologies, making it the majority owner of a large and growing Indian digital real estate portal, including housing.com and PropTiger.com. As measured by audience, Elara runs India's fastest-growing digital real estate business, and India itself is one of the world's fastest growing economies. So the possibilities are profound. 
We are under Tracey Fellows leadership by many measures, the world's largest digital property company, and we are acutely focused on the countries that we believe have the largest digital property potential. Meanwhile, HarperCollins had one of its most lucrative quarters with double-digit growth across every category. There were many successful new releases. While the back was bolstered both revenue and profitability as did our continued growth in digital. Brian Murray and the team are at a relatively early stage of the development of audio bot and the proliferation of audio devices to the home will only increase the demand for our content. I'm not sure that all investors have yet comprehended the full value of that digital opportunity.
As for the resident titles and successful catalog, there was: Didn't You See That Coming by Rachel Hollis; The Happy in a Hurry Cookbook, Steve Doocy; The Greatest Secret by Rhonda Byrne; Frontier follies, Ree Drummond; and the continuing strong demand for Magnolia Table, Volume 2 by Joanna Gaines. And then in January, there was Bridgerton. We have the series of 9 Bridgeton books by Julia Quinn, which are prospering, given the popularity of the autonomous series for which a new series has recently been announced.
In all, revenues at HarperCollins ascended 23% in the quarter, and segment EBITDA surged 65% over the prior year. 
Dow Jones also set records this quarter, including having its highest absolute EBITDA since News Corp acquired the company in late 2007 with segment EBITDA up 43%, while for New York Times eked out a 1% increase. Digital advertising expanded 29%, the highest quarter in Dow Jones history, while digital advertising at the New York Times fell by 2%.
Clearly, print was challenged during a pandemic period in which distribution was compromised. But overall advertising was down just 4%. Comparing dramatically with The New York Times, where it slumped 19%. In our professional information business, Risk and Compliance continued its record of extraordinary expansion with year-over-year revenue growth accelerating to 21%. Q2 marks Risk and Compliance 22nd consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth year-over-year. 
Given international tension with both the U.S. and China in posing controls on companies, and with the new administration in U.S. inclined a tougher regulation, how bright are the prospects for Risk and Compliance. If anyone on this call works for a company that is not yet a client, I suggest that you remedy that dereliction. Traffic and subscribers across Dow Jones properties are surging. And Almar and the team are determined to make the most of the opportunity. 
WSJ digital-only subscriptions were up 28% and MarketWatch also had a successful digital subscription launch in Q2. We have always insisted that our strategy is to upsell at Dow Jones given our nonpareil portfolio. And so it's worth noting that more than 70% of those market watch subscribers chose a bundle that included subscription to parents.
As for traffic, average monthly unique users across the Dow Jones digital network were up 48% in the quarter, reaching $127 million, driven by 64% growth at both the Wall Street Journal and Barron's. 
In Subscription Video Services, our strategy to reshape the Foxtel Group as the next-generation subscription business is clearly gaining traction with total closing paid subscriptions increasing 12% and setting a new record of over 3.31 million.
OTT now accounts for 40% of Foxtel's paying subscriber base, with more than 1.3 million streaming subscribers. The actual growth rate in streaming subscribers was over 90% driven by the strength of Binge, which launched last May and the continued expansion of Kayo.
In the past, there has been skepticism about whether we could transition from our reliance on traditional broadcast, but hat those concerns have proven unfounded, and Foxtel is now a company with a diverse portfolio and much momentum. I would like to repeat that EBITDA at the Subscription Video Services segment for the quarter rose 77% on the same quarter last year.
And for the first half, segment EBITDA was 34% higher. Growth has been crucial for that success. But we have a leadership team at Foxtel steered ably by Siobhan McKenna and Patrick Delany that has been absolutely focused on reviewing every aspect of the company's performance and diligently reducing costs where appropriate. That insight, foresight and discipline have contributed to the transformation of the company and given us a powerful platform and much optionality for the future. 
We have now secured long-term rights to the 3 most popular sports in the country, Aussie Rules, Rugby League and cricket, which had astounded success in the summer with the tour of the triumphant Indian team. Record after record was set on the cricket pitch and on the screen, whether they were traditional screen or a digital device. And that multi-platform future is now secure with both Australian Rules and Rugby, thanks to our partners at Telstra. Over 3 million live pass customers will have the opportunity to transition to Kayo over the coming months so that they can watch their teams, when they want to watch, how they want to watch, where they want to watch and on whatever device they want to launch. This is a monumental moment for Foxtel.
Our News Media segment also contributed meaningfully to News Corp's profitability this quarter, with digital ad growth in the U.K. and at The New York Post. We had indeed indicated that the New York Post was on a path towards profitability, and it certainly achieved that doll in the second quarter. Our task now is to ensure its long-term profitability, given the challenges in that sector. Digital ad growth at the post was 64% up year-over-year. For the quarter, digital advertising accounted for nearly 90% of the total, page views of the posts were up 37%. It was also a quarter in which The Post reported a significant victory for all media for the freedom of the press by standing resolute and principled against censorship imposed by Twitter.
Ultimately, Twitter realized that it's made an egregious mistake and thankfully, reversed it's decision. Our journalist are not lap dogs with laptops. Our journalists are not stenographers, our journalists are not wonks. Our journalists are on way to their profound responsibilities.
In Australia, we were fortunately ahead of the curve in transitioning many of our local and regional print properties to digital platforms, which help them weather the storm of lockdown. Our Australian leadership under Michael Miller was disciplined in reducing costs and yet remained ambitious for our news platforms during this time of transition for journals. And Rebekah Brooks showed real leadership in the U.K. across our baskets like The Sun and The Times in our emerging digital businesses and it will as our radio network, which reached nearly 5 million listeners.
In both Australia and the U.K., we are using our skills in video and audio to enhance our traditional platforms, and that is clear at Times Radio, which is an extension of a newspaper founded in London in 1785. 
On these calls, I've often referenced the ongoing debate with what is loosely called Big Digital. I personally regard that Monica as a euphemism. We're at a pivotal moment of those discussions in Australia, where new regulations and new terms of trade will be introduced. But that debate now extends across the globe. There is not a single serious digital regulator anywhere in the world who is not examining the Ampacity of algorithms, the integrity of personal data, the social value of professional journalism and the dysfunctional digital ad market. 
This has been an imperative for News Corp for far more than a decade. I gave evidence the health of lord in London on this various subject in 2007. And it has been an imperative because we truly care about the social value of journalism, and we believe that the social value has a commercial value.  
This enduring often solitary campaign would not have been successful without the further support of Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch and the News Corp Board. We expect that the new tech topography will benefit our company's financial fortunes. That is for certain. And it will also have a material impact in not only the countries in which we operate, but in every country. An ambitious inspired young woman starting a digital news site in Nigeria or in Birmingham, England or Birmingham, Alabama, now has a far better, a far, far better chance of sustainable success.
Finally, I want to thank all those contributed to the singular success of News Corp in this historic quarter. That would be all our employees who've contributed each day in courageous compassionate ways. I salute those individuals for what they have done and for what they continue to do for the company and for their communities. Thank you. 
While the macro environment remains unpredictable, our goal is to ensure that new score is best positioned for long-term success and that our value is absolutely appreciated by investors. 
And now I hand you to Susan Panuccio for some wise words."

Fiscal 2021 second quarter total revenues were over $2.4 billion, a decline of 3% versus the prior year, while total segment EBITDA was $497 million, up 40% year-over-year, reflecting strong performances across all of our key reportable",2531,"Thank you, Robert. Fiscal 2021 second quarter total revenues were over $2.4 billion, a decline of 3% versus the prior year, while total segment EBITDA was $497 million, up 40% year-over-year, reflecting strong performances across all of our key reportable segments, driven by a combination of improved operating trends and cost reductions. This is the highest quarterly segment EBITDA since the company was formed in 2013. 
On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact from acquisitions and divestitures, most notably the sale of News America Marketing in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 as well as currency fluctuations and other items disclosed in our release revenues rose 2%, while total segment EBITDA grew 39%. 
Net income for the quarter was $261 million compared to $103 million in the prior year. For the quarter, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.39 as compared to $0.14 in the prior year. Adjusted EPS was $0.34 in the quarter compared with $0.18 in the prior year. 
Turning now to the operating segments. Digital Real Estate Services segment revenues were $339 million, an increase of 15% compared to the prior year, which is more than double the rate in the first quarter, driven by another record quarterly performance for Move. On an adjusted basis, revenues increased 11%. Segment EBITDA rose 20% to $142 million or 19% on an adjusted basis despite higher investment spending, which was in contrast to the first quarter. Results also included $6 million of costs associated with Move's acquisition of Avail and the Elara transaction at REA. 
Move's operating results accounted for over 75% of segment revenue growth and approximately 80% of segment EBITDA growth this quarter. Move's revenues accelerated to $155 million, a 28% year-over-year increase, with real estate revenues rising 30%. As Robert mentioned, realtor.com traffic reached 80 million average monthly unique users, reflecting an increase of 37% year-over-year with growth in December accelerating to 44%. Monthly average lead volume remained very strong, growing over 30%. 
Like the first quarter, we saw strong growth in the performance-based referral model, which accounted for approximately 30% of total Move revenues in the quarter, benefiting from the growth in lead volume, higher home prices and real estate transaction closes. Not only did we see an acceleration in the revenue growth of the referral model this quarter compared to the prior quarter but we also saw growth in Connection Plus, our traditional lead generation product, driven by strong customer demand, enabling improved pricing and higher sell through. 
As our referral revenues are recognized upon transaction closures, only around 20% of the associated revenues from leads generated in this quarter are reflected in the results. This provides a strong pipeline through the balance of the year, assuming continued favorable housing conditions. These results are very encouraging, and we remain focused on expanding our addressable market through the integration of key ancillary services, including our Rocket Mortgage partnership. 
We've contributed $19 million to the segment EBITDA growth this quarter versus the prior year, driven by the strong top line growth. As we had previously indicated, we are increasing our investment levels in REALTOR, given the rapid performance in lead volume and further expansion into adjacency. 
Revenues at REA Group rose 6% to $184 million, reflecting a $12 million or 7% benefit from currency fluctuations. COVID-19 restrictions eased during the quarter, including the removal of property inspection restrictions in Melbourne. Residential listings for the quarter rose 10%, including 25% growth in Metro Melbourne and 13% growth in Sydney. A new developer project launches increased 12% on the prior year. 
REA's results benefited from growth in residential revenues, which was offset by declines in commercial and Asia. It also is worth remembering that as a consequence of COVID, REA did not implement a price increase in July. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for more detail. 
Turning to Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $511 million, up 2% versus the prior year and included a $33 million or 7% positive impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Adjusted revenues were down 5%, an improvement on the Q1 decline of 7%, benefiting from moderating broadcast subscription revenue declines and the expansion of OTT revenues. 
Foxtel's closing paid subscriber base reached over 3.3 million as of December 31, up 12% year-over-year, with OTT expanding to over 1.3 million paying subscribers, close to double the prior year's number with Kayo reaching 624,000 and Binge at 431,000 paying subscribers. Kayo subscribers declined slightly quarter-over-quarter due to seasonality, but the decline was much less pronounced than last year as the business successfully managed to transition from winter to spring and summer sporting codes, underpinned by the exclusive cricket content. 
Residential broadcast subscribers declined about 11% to approximately $1.8 million, relatively consistent with last quarter. Commercial subscribers declined 18% year-over-year to 218,000, with the trend improving sequentially, having bottomed out at 86,000 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 as a consequence of the pandemic. 
Broadcast churn was somewhat elevated at 17.5% versus 16% in the prior year, impacted by a strategy to reduce promotional offers, which resulted in the roll-off of lower ARPU subscribers. The financial benefit is reflected in a 3% increase in ARPU to almost AUD 80. 
Segment EBITDA improved 77% to $124 million, the continuing cost transformation at Foxtel, desire to rightsize the cost base was the driver of profitability. Total cost declined approximately 10%, including $35 million of lower sports programming rights and production costs, which was primarily driven by savings from renegotiated sports rights partially offset by the $20 million negative impact related to the deferral of these costs from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. 
Expenses also benefited from lower entertainment programming costs and lower overheads. Some of the cost benefits are timing related, which will reverse later in the year, I will touch on these later. 
Moving on to Dow Jones. Dow Jones delivered its highest revenue quarter since separation in 2013 and its higher segment EBITDA quarter since News Corp's acquisition in 2007. Revenues for the quarter were $446 million, up 4% compared to the prior year, with digital revenues accounting for 70% of total revenues this quarter, up 6 percentage points from the prior year. 
Circulation revenues rose 8% due to growth in digital circulation revenues, partially offset by lower single copy and amenity print volume still impacted by COVID-19. As Robert mentioned, Dow Jones again achieved record subscriptions in the quarter with average subscriptions to its consumer products for the quarter exceeding $4 million, up 18% from the prior year and off that digital-only subscriptions were over $3 million, up 29% year-over-year. 
For the Wall Street Journal, there were 3.2 million average subscriptions for the quarter, up nearly 19% from the prior year, with digital-only subscriptions growing 28% to nearly 2.5 million. Revenues from Dow Jones Risk and Compliance grew 21%, which was a faster growth rate than the past 3 quarters. Overall, professional information business revenues rose 4%. 
Advertising revenues, which accounted for 26% of revenues this quarter declined just 4% to $115 million, a marked improvement from the 17% decline last quarter. As Robert mentioned, we had another record quarter for digital advertising with 29% growth and digital accounting for 58% of advertising revenues for the second quarter. We saw growth in all categories, particularly in technology. Print advertising revenues declined 29% year-over-year, which was an improvement from the 39% decline in the first quarter. 
Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter rose 43% to $109 million, with margins expanding to over 24% and up almost 7 percentage points versus the prior year. Costs declined almost 5% this quarter due to lower print volumes and other discretionary savings. 
At Book Publishing, HarperCollins posted 23% revenue growth to $544 million and a 65% segment EBITDA growth to $104 million, marking the best quarterly performance in its history. Revenue growth was strong across all categories with double digit gains. Robert mentioned the depth of the sub list this quarter, which included strong performances from numerous authors, including Rachel Hollis, Rhonda Byrne, Ree Drummond and Joanna Gaines and David Walliams among others. Similar to what we saw in the past 2 quarters, we are continuing to benefit from a strong rebound in e-books with overall digital sales up 15% year-over-year. E-book sales increased 21% year-over-year with gains in all categories, while downloadable audio books increased 10% year-over-year. 
We have continued to see higher online sales and, in particularly, benefited from strong orders from Amazon and other e-commerce platforms during the holiday season. But perhaps more importantly, we are seeing very strong consumption levels, likely benefiting from stay-at-home measures and a continuous flow of new content. 
Revenues increased at low double digits across the backlist, notwithstanding, they contributed 55% of sales this quarter, down from 58% last year due to the larger mix of the frontlist titles. HarperCollins again demonstrated strong operating leverage despite a 16% increase in cost, in part due to royalties and higher production expenses related to the successful top line performance, margins improved by almost 5 percentage points. 
Turning to News Media. Despite ongoing challenges, we remain focused on rightsizing the cost base and moving towards digital, helped by a moderation in advertising revenue trends. Revenues for the quarter were $573 million, down 29% versus the prior year, of which the impact from the divestment of News America marketing accounted for the majority of the decline. 
On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact from the divestment of NAM and Unruly and the other items mentioned in our release, revenues declined 9%, which is an improvement from a 16% decline in the first quarter. The decline also reflects $34 million or 4% negative impact from the closure or transition to digital of certain regional and community newspapers in Australia. 
Circulation and subscription revenues rose 5%. There's a $9 million or 4% benefit from currency fluctuations, strong digital paid subscriber growth and cover price increases offset lower news stand sales related to COVID-19. Overall, the year-over-year trends in local currency were better in both the U.K. and Australia compared to the first quarter. Circulation revenues accounted for 45% of total segment revenues. And was slightly higher than advertising this quarter as the mix of revenues become more reoccurring and predictable. 
Advertising revenue fell $231 million or 48% on a reported basis, of which $191 million or 40% was from the sale of News America Marketing, and $28 million or 6% was related to the negative impact from the closure or transition to digital of certain regional community titles in Australia. The remainder of the decline was due to the overall weakness in the print advertising market. 
On a positive note, the New York Post continued to outperform with advertising revenues up 23%, and as Robert mentioned, digital advertising up 64%. In fact, digital revenues at the New York Post exceeded 50% of total revenues this quarter. And overall, the New York Post had its highest digital revenue since 2013. 
Segment EBITDA for the quarter was $66 million, flat with the prior year despite the $22 million a onetime benefit in the prior year related to a settlement of certain warranty related claims in the U.K. and the absence of the modest contribution from News America marketing. Adjusted segment EBITDA increased 5%, which included a $5 million positive contribution from the New York Post. 
I would now like to talk about some things in the upcoming quarter and the second half. Overall, we expect to see some slowdown in the second half results with forecasting remaining particularly challenging given the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic. At Digital Real Estate Services, as REA noted, National Residential Listings in Australia for January were flat to the prior year. Results will reflect a small loss related to the consolidation of Elara Technologies in the second half. Please refer to REA's press release and earnings call for more detail. 
At Move, we remain encouraged by the traffic and lead volume trends, which are expected to drive higher revenues in the second half despite the historically low listing volumes across the industry. We expect these higher revenues to fund at least $40 million of additional reinvestments in the second half compared to the prior year in areas such as brand marketing and product development as we focus on gaining market share and expanding into adjacencies. 
In Subscription Video Services, we have seen broadcast churn continue to increase due to the ongoing focus on ARPU and seasonal trends with the end of winter sports. However, Kayo has remained resilient, and our OTT subscriber growth led by Binge remains strong. We expect EBITDA results in the second half to be more challenged due in part to the lapping of the prior year cost savings. 
As a reminder, fiscal 2020 fourth quarter results included a $70 million cost benefit due to the deferral of sports rights and production costs related to COVID-19. We now expect full year overall cost declines, given the better-than-expected revenue performance to be more modest than we had initially expected, with a net reduction of less than AUD 100 million. This includes approximately AUD 80 million of higher sports comp in the second half of fiscal 2021, particularly in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period. 
At Dow Jones, overall revenue trends remained favorable compared to the prior year, including strong digital advertising growth. As we look to the rest of the year, we continue to expect to reinvest in the business as we focus on driving revenue growth to its digital assets and expect second half expenses to increase modestly compared to the prior year. In addition, third quarter will face a more difficult digital advertising growth comparison. 
In Book Publishing, overall industry trends remain favorable, we continue to monitor closely the sustainability of recent consumer spending patterns, such as the increasing free time for consumers to read and the increase in the average number of books purchased. The second half comparables will be tougher, particularly in the fourth quarter, given the material outperformance last year and as we lap some of the initial benefits at the outset of COVID-19. 
At News Media, the ongoing national lockdown in the U.K. and domestic travel restrictions in Australia continue to put pressure on print circulation, especially with daily newsstand and are also creating increased uncertainty on advertising spend across most categories. Cost declines in the second half are expected to moderate from the first half rate as we lap some COVID-19 saving initiatives as well as the divestment of News America Marketing and the closure or digital transition of some of our newspapers in Australia in the fourth quarter. 
In our other segment, for the second half, we expect at least a $50 million increase in cost, driven by a combination of higher equity comp related to the stock price performance and the absence of the bonus reductions across the senior executive team in the prior year in response to COVID-19 as well as additional costs related to the implementation of the global shared services initiative. 
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

And just in relation to the second question for Foxtel. When we think about the trends that we're looking at and the next steps for the assets, well, clearly, OTT will be an ongoing focus for us in that business. As well as the stability in broadcast as the team focus on the management of the base subscribers within broadcast. And they are clearly focused on costs as well. They've done a tremendous job in the first half or really over the last 10 months since COVID-19 started in taking out the underlying cost of the business, the renegotiation of sports and entertainment contracts, but we'll be particularly looking forward to the growth within the OTT properties."

And so it was really top line revenue growth that was dropping down to the bottom line. So we do think that the revenue growth will continue, and we do want to scale up those costs in the reinvestment areas that I mentioned, marketing and product development. 
Just in relation to shared services, yes, we did quote $100 million for financial year '22. We're still holding that number at this stage, notwithstanding the cost work that we've done across the business. We do still think that there are enormous opportunities, but it will require, obviously, a lot of work and reconfiguration of our systems in order to unlock those savings. But at this stage, the guidance is still $100 million for financial year '22."

There's a lack of visibility for many of our businesses. And you can see that reflected in our words today. We are certainly taking nothing for granted despite the excellence of the Q2 results. 
But at Move, the signs are positive, at least in January, and David and the team at REALTOR. With January normally a slower month, unique users rose 37% to $94 million, and the lead volume remained robust. Those are indicators, but we are taking nothing for granted."

Just interested in whether you can make any comments about the extent to which those cost reductions are permanent. You obviously indicated that print circulation may be challenged in future quarters. So I don't know if that just results in lower print costs, which may come back down the track. And whether you, in fact, see further opportunities for cost reductions within that division.
And then second question is around SVS. Following the announcement of the Telstra live pass users transitioning to Kayo, do you have a sense for how many of -- how many of those circa 3 million users do you expect to transition? And do you have any projections you're willing to share around how many of those you'd expect to hold on to after that promotional period is over?"

Obviously, there's been a lot of cost work that's been done. And you're right. Some of that is obviously volume related, and some of that will scale up and down depending on how those businesses trade in light of COVID. But there are also significant permanent cost reductions that the teams have been working on. We've had significant reduction in head count that came through in the back end of last fiscal year that is obviously flowing through here. But we do have a lot of costs that have come out in the overhead space as well. 
Now some of that naturally will come back in as the businesses open up, but we would also hope that some of that may be permanent as we change the way that we work going forward. We also had in the back end of last year significant reduction in marketing expenditure within News Media, we would expect to see some of that start to come back in, but not necessarily the levels that we're seeing. So I think a balance of both as we look forward.
And I do think actually that there are still permanent cost reduction opportunities that the businesses are working on within that segment. A lot of that has to do with the restructuring of the business and the reconfiguration, and the teams are actively working on that."

While some nations, including America are spasmodically emerging from the ravages of the pandemic, other regions continue to suffer profoundly. We certainly hope that the [indiscernible] of the virus will abate and trust that all on this call are navigating these perplexing times safely and securely. 
I must again salute the people of News Corp as they continue their extraordinary work for the company and for their communities in these demanding circumstances. Their efforts, their expertise and their endurance have yielded strong results for our company and for the millions of people who find comfort and inspiration and illumination from the news, information, insight and entertainment. our businesses around the world deliver each and every day. 
It is further testament to the efforts of all in News Corp that fiscal year 2021 has been defined by improving revenue trends and flourishing profitability. Impact in strictly financial terms this year is on a trajectory to be the most successful since our reincarnation in 2013 in profitability, highlighting how much the character of the company has evolved over that period. 
Patently, the strategy of simplifying the asset mix, the vigorous pursuit of digitization, the disciplined cost reductions and the investment focus on 3 growth areas: Digital Real Estate, Dow Jones and Book Publishing, have proven to be particularly fruitful. You will have noticed that since our last earnings call in February, we announced 3 significant acquisitions that we firmly expect will immediately increase revenue and EBITDA upon closing. The first being Investors Business Daily to be operated by Dow Jones. The second was Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Books and Media segment, which will become part of HarperCollins; and the third was Mortgage Choice by REA Group, which will add heft to their Mortgage Broking business. 
And since our last earnings announcement, we have reached historic and lucrative deals with Google and with Facebook, as we continue our campaign for equitable and substantial compensation from the big tech platforms for our premium journalism, whether in text, audio or video. The 3-year Google deal is global and involves the creation of a subscription platform, ad revenue sharing and partnerships in audio journalism as well as video journalism on YouTube. That agreement is evolving well and should be a platform for further cooperation between our companies in the future. 
The Facebook deal also for 3 years involves leading metro newspapers in Australia and a large array of regional and local mastheads as well as Sky News Australia and will have a material and meaningful impact on our business in Australia. This deal is in addition to that launch with Facebook in the U.S. in 2019, involving Dow Jones and the New York Post. We are yet to reach agreement with Facebook in the U.K. and hope that reason will descend imminently. 
We note that U.K. is chairing the G7 and applaud the diligent and intelligent work of [ Andrea Cashel ] and the Competition and Marcus Authority, which has developed great insight into the digital landscape and will play a crucial role in drafting a G7 response and in raising social and commercial consciousness. As the terms of trade change, we can expect to see tangible benefits flow to those who report and distribute news to the public, and I am confident that will include publishers large and small, urban and rural in many countries and in many languages. 
For us, in Australia, the deals will obviously improve the results at our newspapers but also enable us to hire journalists to improve the coverage in underserved regions and communities. 
Finally, Before turning to the quarter's results, I would like to highlight the successful completion of a [indiscernible] bond offering, which was multiple times oversubscribed at an attractive coupon and thus, a resounding vote of confidence in the company's strategy and its prospects. 
As for the third quarter of fiscal year 2021, I am pleased to report that we achieved nearly $300 million in profits, up 23% year-over-year. We have now had 3 successive quarters of double-digit profit increases, and we strongly believe these rather positive results reflect an increase in our core profitability. Revenues in the third quarter exceeded $2.3 billion, representing a 3% increase from the prior year. 
Turning first to the resolutely robust Digital Real Estate Services segment, moves revenue growth was 37%, exceeding Q2's 28% growth. Move and realtor.com's value to News Corp to the real estate industry and to consumers is becoming more obvious with each passing quarter. Overall, Digital Real Estate Services revenues were up 34% year-over-year, and segment EBITDA surged 58%. realtor.com traffic growth has outpaced that of Zillow for 14 consecutive months through March, and the significant growth disparity between the 2 has been widening markedly according to comScore in March. realtor's traffic growth outpaced Zillow and Trulia by nearly 30 percentage points. 
Why this extraordinary growth at realtor? Because we are focused on our consumers, whether that be a family buying or selling a house or the agents handling that important transaction. We are not flipping houses. We are not competing with our clients. We are not building up a stock of bricks-and-mortar inventory. We are not worrying over the wallpaper or fretting over fences or stuck up on stucco. We are absolutely digital and devoted to our consumers. 
This reputational and functional advantage for realtor comes at a moment of genuine momentum for the U.S. real estate market. Our internal metrics show that average monthly unique views in the quarter were 44% higher than the prior year and reached 108 million uniques for the month of March alone, a burgeoning of 60% versus the prior year. Not only is realtor.com serving homebuyers and sellers, we are serving renters and landlords as well. We expanded our rentals offering by acquiring Avail, where revenue growth has exceeded initial expectations, and we are excited about the opportunity that lies ahead in this lucrative market segment. 
In Australia, the real estate market is thriving, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne. REA Group, the clear leader in that country's digital real estate sector, saw revenues increase by 32%. During the quarter, REA announced that it proposed to acquire 100% of the shares in Mortgage Choice Limited. The proposed acquisition aligns with REA's financial services strategy by leveraging the group's digital expertise, motivated property buyers and data insights across a larger network. 
At Dow Jones, revenues rose 6% year-over-year, and segment EBITDA led an impressive 61%. Overall advertising, which was slightly down in Q2, moved into positive terrain in Q3, with digital advertising 30% higher in the quarter, almost double the growth rate of the New York Times. Digital now represents 61% of all advertising compared to a ratio of 48% in the prior year. Digital-only subs at Dow Jones and The Wall Street Journal surged 29%, and Dow Jones digital-only net adds in the quarter exceeded those of the New York Times for its new subscriptions. 
MarketWatch is achieving record-high revenues and is now benefiting from multiple revenue strengths with the successful launch of its subscription offering in October. Risk & Compliance reported growth of 24% in the quarter marking 23 consecutive quarters of double-digit expansion. This strength underscores R&C's value as a global leader in data intelligence, including in anti-money laundering, anticorruption and commercial risk assessment. 
With increasingly stringent demands from the U.S. government and bodies around the world for strict compliance and heightened emphasis on ESG, we believe Dow Jones Risk & Compliance is perfectly poised to benefit. If anyone on this call would like to minimize risk or maximize compliance, please do reach out. 
Meanwhile, we are on the cusp of integrating Investors Business Daily. That deal closed this week, and we expect IBD will provide innumerable opportunities for cross-selling and upselling with the Dow Jones portfolio of products. IBD will also be a source of important expertise and insight as 90% of its revenue is digital, and the company has a compelling lucrative suite of software products. 
Book Publishing is another engine of growth for News Corp as HarperCollins continued on its extremely positive trajectory with 19% revenue growth in the quarter compared to a year earlier and segment EBITDA surging 45%, as both our powerful backlist and notable frontlist performed strongly. 
One of the standouts in the third quarter was the Bridgerton series, which is now the most successful series of HarperCollins in fiscal '21. Other strong performers included The Boy, the mole, the Fox and the horse by Charlie Mackesy and  Cicely Tyson's memoir, Just as I am. 
The power of the HarperCollins substantial backlist in Q3 reinforces our enthusiasm, the anticipated integration of the newly acquired Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Books & Media segment, which should close in Q4. This acquisition will greatly expand the HarperCollins backlist with an additional 7,000 titles, including such monumental works, the Lord of Rings Trilogy, Animal Farm and 1984. And loved children's books like Curious George, the Polar Express, Little Prince and many, many more. 
We look forward with eager anticipation to Amazon's production of JRR Tolkien's works due in coming years. As with HMH, we will have acquired the U.S. rights to that extraordinary collection and will now own the global English language right. As Tolkien himself wrote, the greatest adventure is what lies ahead today and tomorrow are yet to be set. 
In Subscription Video Services, our strategy to rapidly expand streaming has been transformational for Foxtel. The express growth of Kayo and Binge together with Foxtel Now saw a number of paying OTT subscribers reach approximately [ 1.6 million ] as at the end of March. That represents a doubling of streaming subscribers over the past year alone and extraordinary achievements. 
In Toto, Foxtel closing subscribers grew to a record of over 3.5 million, up 21% year-over-year driving a significant increase in profitability. Kayo Sports has helped make Foxtel the preeminent home of sports in Australia with a record 2.2 million sports subscribers. Of these, Kayo accounted for 851,000 paying subscribers as at March 31, more than double the prior year, where it was 408,000. 
In recent days, Kayo exceeded 1 million total subscribers, with paying subscribers expected to reach that milestone imminently. A strong summer of cricket and the start of the dominant winter sports saw Kayo generate more momentum. This was supported by our recent agreement with Telstra, which has seen Kayo replaced Telstra Live Pass in the AFL Live app and NRL official app, making Kayo the exclusive streaming home of the extremely popular Aussie Rules and Rugby League competitions. 
Not yet 1 year old, the Binge entertainment streaming service reached 516,000 paying subscribers, up nearly 20% on the second quarter. Binge has established consistent weekly subscriber growth underpinned by the growing awareness of the Binge brand, the popularity of hit shows such as the Flight Attendant, The Walking Dead and Zach Snyder's Justice League and its deserved reputation for user-friendly tech savvy access to the world's best content. 
Foxtel's resurgence during the pandemic, coupled with the continuing value of its broadcast product, the rapid growth of Kayo and Binge and a relentless focus on cost transformation have delivered a much enhanced financial performance that certainly gives us flexibility and optionality. 
In the News Media segment, revenues declined somewhat as expected. The difference was entirely attributable to the sale of News America Marketing and the restructuring of regional and community titles in Australia, most of which became digital-only [ properties ]. 
In the U.K., circulation revenues increased, while the New York Post continued revenue growth driven by strong expansion in digital advertising. 
Finally, I want to express my enduring gratitude for the thousands of people who work at News Corp around the world for their creativity, their commitment and their collaborative spirit, which has been a guiding for us as we navigate through the unchartered turbulent waters of the pandemic. The past 12 months have seen record profits in many of our businesses, a strong reinforcement of our digital imperative and particularly potent performances by the 3 sectors that we had targeted for expedited growth. It is clear that our investors are increasingly embracing that strategy and profiting from that strategy. 
And now I turn to Susan Panuccio for words of financial wisdom."

Our",2662,"Thank you, Robert. Fiscal 2021 third quarter total revenues were over $2.3 billion, an increase of 3% versus the prior year, while total segment EBITDA was $298 million, up 23% year-over-year, reflecting strong performances across our key segments. 
Our 3 core pillars: Dow Jones, Digital Real Estate Services and Book Publishing collectively grew segment EBITDA by 55% versus the prior year. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact from acquisitions and divestitures, most notably the sale of News America Marketing in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 as well as currency fluctuations and other items disclosed in our release, revenues rose 4%, while total segment EBITDA grew 24%. 
Net income for the quarter was $96 million compared to a net loss of $1 billion in the prior year, which reflects the absence of a noncash impairment charge related to Foxtel and News America Marketing in the prior period. For the quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.13 as compared to a net loss per share of $1.24 last year. And our adjusted EPS were $0.09 in the quarter compared to $0.03 in the prior year. 
Turning now to the operating segments. Digital Real Estate Services segment revenues were $351 million, an increase of 34% compared to the prior year, which was more than double the growth rate we saw in the second quarter. The performance was driven by another record quarterly performance at Mood together with improvements at REA as well as the Elara consolidation and positive impact from foreign exchange fluctuations. On an adjusted basis, revenues increased 22%. 
Segment EBITDA rose 58% to $117 million or 52% on an adjusted basis, the fastest quarterly growth rate in nearly 4 years. Move's revenues accelerated to $162 million, a 37% increase year-over-year, with real estate revenues rising 43%. Move contributed $36 million or 84% of the segment EBITDA growth this quarter, the highest contribution to growth to the segment for the fiscal year. 
realtor.com's traffic increased to 98 million average monthly unique users in the third quarter, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 44%. Notably in March, realtor's unique users eclipsed 100 million the first time, reaching over 108 million unique users, up 60% compared to the prior year. Monthly average lead volume remained very strong, growing over 40%, which was higher than the second quarter rate despite continued inventory constraints across the industry. 
We saw very strong growth across both the traditional lead generation and referral businesses in the third quarter with a notable acceleration from the second quarter rate in the growth of connections, our traditional lead generation products, which benefited from higher traffic and lead volumes, higher retention rates and improved pricing. These results underscore the success of our strategy of choice and flexibility. 
Revenues from the referral business continued to grow strongly, representing 25% of total Move revenues, lower than the first half mainly due to the acceleration in the traditional lead generation business, coupled with the seasonality impact. Overall, the drivers behind the performance of the referral model remained similar to the prior quarter with continued strong transaction volumes, higher home pricing and stable to higher referral fees. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect to continue reinvesting in Move primarily in marketing and product development balancing continued improvement in profitability with revenue growth. 
We are pleased to see strong growth across both as the team accelerates the pace of innovation and new products as we expand into adjacencies. 
Turning to REA Group. Revenues at REA rose 32% to $189 million, reflecting a $28 million or 19% positive impact from currency fluctuations and a $7 million from the acquisition of Elara. Australian National residential listings for the quarter rose 8%, with Melbourne up 13% and Sydney up 5%, with growth rates improving throughout the quarter. New developer project launches increased by 14% compared to the prior year. REA's results also benefited from an increase in residential revenues despite the absence of a price increase this fiscal year as part of REA's COVID-19 support initiatives. 
Like realtor, REA's benefiting from record traffic with realestate.com.au hitting an all-time high of 137 million monthly visits in March, up 60% year-over-year, and buyer inquiries are also at record highs. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for more detail. 
Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment, revenues for the quarter were $523 million, up 13% versus the prior year and included a $79 million or 17% positive impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Adjusted revenues were down 4%, continuing the improving trend through the fiscal year as the expansion of OTT revenues partially offset the declines in broadcast subscription revenue. 
Total closing paid subscribers across Foxtel were over $3.5 million as of March 31, up 21% versus the prior year as the team focused on maintaining its premium broadcast customers, while the Kayo and Binge streaming services delivered subscriber growth at scale. The comparison versus the prior year was helped by the absence of the initial impact of COVID-19 and the launch of Binge in the fourth quarter. 
Total paying OTT subscribers expanded to nearly 1.6 million paying subscribers, up 120% compared to the prior year, with Kayo reaching 851,000 and binge at 516,000 paying subscribers. Including trialists, Kayo and Binge reached 914,000 and 679,000 subscribers, respectively, which is indicative of the strong consumer interest in each of the product's unique content set. 
Kayo's growth has been enhanced by the recent agreement with Telstra to replace Telstra's Live Pass with Kayo, accelerating the penetration and adoption of the product. While the revenue impact from the addition of former Live Pass customers will be minimally new one of the agreement due to the pricing promotion, we see this partnership as a unique opportunity and window to introduce Kayo to a new audience. 
Residential broadcast subscribers declined 12% from the prior year to over 1.7 million and commercial subscribers also declined 12% to 235,000. However, the trend improved sequentially as COVID-19 restrictions continue to ease particularly in pubs and clubs, albeit the accommodation sector remains challenged. 
Broadcast churn was elevated at 20.1% versus 17.5% in the prior year as the team continued to balance churn with revenue optimization. As a result, ARPU continued to rise both year-over-year and sequentially, partly mitigating broadcast subscriber volume declines. Broadcast ARPU rose 2% to over AUD 80 or USD 62. 
Segment EBITDA improved 34% to $91 million and was up [ 13% ] on an adjusted basis. The improvement was driven by $22 million of lower sports programming rights and production costs as well as lower transmission, marketing and employee costs. 
Finally, on Foxtel, they refinanced their existing AUD 650 million revolving credit and working capital facilities and extended the maturity out 18 months to May 2024 at a slight price improvement. 
Moving on to Dow Jones, Dow Jones delivered another outstanding quarter with year-over-year growth for both revenue and segment EBITDA accelerating versus the second quarter and the first half rate. Revenues for the quarter were $421 million, up 6% compared to the prior year, with digital revenues accounting for 74% of total revenues this quarter, up 6 percentage points from the prior year. Circulation revenues again rose 8% due to the growth in digital circulation revenues, partially offset by lower single coffee and amenity print volume, which is still impacted by COVID-19 restrictions. 
Dow Jones continue to post record both nearly 4.3 million average subscriptions to its consumer products in the quarter, up 19% from the prior year. Of that, nearly 3.3 million were digital-only subscriptions, reflecting 238,000 sequential net adds and 29% year-over-year growth. 
For the Wall Street Journal, there were approximately 3.4 million average subscriptions for the quarter, up 21% from the prior year, with digital-only subscriptions growing 29% to over 2.6 million. Revenues from Dow Jones Risk & Compliance grew 24%, improving from the Q2 rate and was the fastest growth since the first quarter of fiscal 2020. 
Overall, Professional information business revenues rose 9%. Within Professional Information Business, Risk & Compliance with the largest source of revenues this quarter for the first time on record and is now approaching $200 million in revenues for the full year compared to approximately $160 million in fiscal 2020. 
Advertising revenues, which accounted for 20% of revenues this quarter, grew 1% to $85 million, a marked improvement from the 4% decline last quarter and was the first growth since the first quarter of fiscal 2020. As Robert mentioned, digital advertising revenues had the fastest growth in a decade, up 30% and accounting for 61% of advertising revenues for the third quarter. 
It is worth noting that this level of growth came despite a tough prior year comparison of up over 20%, which, at the time, was a record quarterly performance. Encouragingly, the growth was again broad-based with notable gains in the financial services category. We saw growth in both volume and yield, particularly in direct display. Print advertising revenues declined 25% year-over-year, which was an improvement from the 29% decline in the second quarter. 
Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter rose 61% to $82 million, with margins expanding close to 7 percentage points versus the prior year. Total costs declined 2% this quarter, which was better than we had expected, mostly due to lower print volumes and other discretionary savings, partially offset by higher compensation costs. 
Book Publishing, HarperCollins posted 19% revenue growth to $490 million and 45% segment EBITDA growth to $80 million, reflecting another very strong quarter and continues to benefit from the industry-wide increase in consumption. Like the second quarter, revenue growth was again broad-based and was led by the General Trade Children's U.K. and foreign language categories, The back list was the key driver this quarter accounting for 62% of sales, led by very strong sales from the Bridgerton series by Julia Quinn. 
Similar to previous quarters, we are continuing to benefit from a strong rebound in e-books with sales up 38% year-over-year and gains in all categories, while downloadable audio books increased 42% year-over-year. Overall digital sales were up 38%. 
HarperCollins again demonstrated strong operating leverage despite a 15% increase in total costs in part due to royalties and higher production expenses related to the successful top line performance. Margins improved by 3 percentage points. 
Turning to News Media. We continue to remain focused on rightsizing the cost base and moving towards digital within the segment. Revenues for the quarter were $550 million, down 25% versus the prior year, of which the impact from the divestment of News America Marketing accounted for the majority of the decline. On an adjusted basis, revenues declined only 7%, which is an improvement from the 9% decline last quarter. Decline also reflects the $28 million or 4% negative impact from the closure or transition to digital and certain regional and community newspapers in Australia. 
Circulation and subscription revenues rose 13%, driven by a $26 million or 10% benefit from currency fluctuations, strong digital paid subscriber growth and cover price increases partially offset by lower newsstand sales related to COVID-19. 
Advertising revenues decreased $215 million or 50% compared to the prior year, reflecting a $199 million or 47% negative impact from the divestiture of News America Marketing and a $23 million or 5% negative impact related to the closure or transition to digital of certain regional and community newspapers in Australia. 
The remainder of the movement was driven by favorable foreign exchange, partly offset by the continued weakness in the print advertising market exacerbated by COVID-19. 
Advertising performance was mixed across the regions with Australia showing moderating declines compared to the second quarter rate, particularly driven by increased retail spending. While the U.K.'s year-over-year performance weakened mostly compared to the second quarter, impacted by another lockdown, which started at the end of 2020. In the U.S., the trends remained robust with the New York Post posting 21% advertising revenue growth, of which digital advertising grew 32%. 
Segment EBITDA for the quarter was $8 million compared to $24 million in the prior year due primarily to the absence of the contribution from News America Marketing. Adjusted segment EBITDA increased by $5 million. 
In our other segment, the third quarter costs were higher than we expected, primarily driven by higher equity compensation due to the rising share price and the initial investment spending related to the implementation of our global shared services initiative. 
I would now like to talk about some themes for the upcoming quarter. As noted in the past call, forecasting remains challenging given the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic. Our Digital Real Estate Services, national residential listings in Australia for April were up 98% compared to the prior year. While the market dynamics are strong, these growth rates are exaggerated by the severe COVID-19-related declines experienced in April 2020. Please refer to REA's press release and earnings call for more details. 
At Move, we remain very encouraged by overall trends and expect the revenue momentum to continue. We continue to expect additional reinvestments at Move in areas such as brand marketing and product development as we focus on gaining market share and expanding into adjacencies. 
In Subscription Video Services, we have seen broadcast churn trends moderate during April, and we remain encouraged by strong OTT demand from Kayo and Binge. We expect EBITDA results to be challenged during large part to the lapping of the prior year cost savings. 
As a reminder, the prior year's fourth quarter results included USD 70 million of lower sports programming costs, mainly due to the suspension of sporting events as a result of COVID-19. For the current fiscal fourth quarter, we expect to incur those rights, which will be impacted by the rising Aussie dollar versus the U.S. dollar as well as some additional costs for further OTT investments. 
At Dow Jones, overall revenue trends remained favorable compared to the prior year, including strong digital advertising growth. As mentioned last quarter, we expect to reinvest in the business as we focus on driving revenue growth through its digital assets and expect second half expenses to increase modestly compared to the prior year. 
Import Publishing, overall industry trends remain favorable, but we continue to monitor closely the sustainability of recent consumer spending patterns, such as the increasing free time for consumers to read and the increase in the average number of the books purchased. We continue to expect performance to moderate in the fourth quarter, in part due to the strong performance in the prior year, which benefited from increased consumer demand at the onset of COVID-19 lockdowns and restrictions as well as the successful release of Magnolia Table Volume 2. 
At News Media, we expect continued improvement in the fourth quarter as we lap both the impact from COVID-19 and the sale of News America Marketing in May 2020. Cost decline should moderate as we lap COVID-19 saving initiatives as well as the divestment of News America Marketing and the closure or digital transition of some of our newspapers in Australia in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. We expect overall profitability trends to improve, and we expect modest revenue impacts from our new licensing agreements. 
In our Other segment, we expect the fourth quarter cost to increase around $20 million versus the prior year, in part due to the reduction of bonuses in the prior year, higher share price and the costs related to the global shared services initiative. 
Our year-to-date free cash flow available was $762 million compared to $63 million in the prior year, benefiting from higher EBITDA, improvements in working capital and lower CapEx. Some of the working capital improvement is timing related, but we're very pleased with the progress made to date. Also note that the fourth quarter balance sheet will reflect the proceeds from our recent senior notes offering, together with the 3 recently announced acquisitions, which will impact our interest expense and cash balance. 
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

In relation to Dow Jones, we would expect to see higher costs in Q4 largely as a consequence of compensation and marketing expenditure. But we have been very encouraged by the ongoing cost focus in that business. And as you could see, they had a pretty good cost result for this quarter as well. 
So probably more investment coming through at realtor than what we would expect to see in Dow Jones."

The Wall Street journalism obviously rises above the sort of almost rhetorically the page tiering the jaundiced journalism that you see in some other places.

While some nations, including America, are spasmodically emerging from the ravages of the pandemic, other regions continue to suffer profoundly. We certainly hope that the vicissitudes of the virus will abate and trust that all on this call are navigating these perplexing times safely and securely. 
I must again salute the people of News Corp as they continue their extraordinary work for the company and for their communities in these demanding circumstances. Their efforts, their expertise and their endurance have yielded strong results for our company and for the millions of people who find comfort and inspiration and illumination from the news, information, insight and entertainment our businesses around the world deliver each and every day. 
It is further testament to the efforts of all in News Corp that fiscal year 2021 has been defined by improving revenue trends and flourishing profitability. In fact, in strictly financial terms, this year is on a trajectory to be the most successful since our reincarnation in 2013 in profitability, highlighting how much the character of the company has evolved over that period. 
Patently, the strategy of simplifying the asset mix, the vigorous pursuit of digitization, the disciplined cost reductions and the investment focus on 3 growth areas: Digital Real Estate, Dow Jones and Book Publishing, have proven to be particularly fruitful. 
You will have noticed that since our last earnings call in February, we announced 3 significant acquisitions that we firmly expect will immediately increase revenue and EBITDA upon closing. The first being Investor’s Business Daily to be operated by Dow Jones; the second was Houghton Mifflin Harcourt's Books and Media segment, which will become part of HarperCollins; and the third was Mortgage Choice by REA Group, which will add heft to their Mortgage Broking business. 
And since our last earnings announcement, we have reached historic and lucrative deals with Google and with Facebook, as we continue our campaign for equitable and substantial compensation from the big tech platforms for our premium journalism, whether in text, audio or video. The 3-year Google deal is global and involves the creation of a subscription platform, ad revenue sharing and partnerships in audio journalism as well as video journalism on YouTube. That agreement is evolving well and should be a platform for further cooperation between our companies in the future. 
The Facebook deal, also for 3 years, involves leading metro newspapers in Australia and a large array of regional and local mastheads as well as Sky News Australia and will have a material and meaningful impact on our business in Australia. This deal is in addition to that launch with Facebook in the U.S. in 2019, involving Dow Jones and the New York Post. We are yet to reach agreement with Facebook in the U.K. and hope that reason will descend imminently. 
We note the U.K. is chairing the G7 and applaud the diligent and intelligent work of Andrea Coscelli and the Competition and Markets Authority, which has developed great insight into the digital landscape and will play a crucial role in drafting a G7 response and in raising social and commercial consciousness. As the terms of trade change, we can expect to see tangible benefits flow to those who report and distribute news to the public. And I am confident that will include publishers large and small, urban and rural, in many countries and in many languages. 
For us, in Australia, the deals will obviously improve the results at our newspapers but also enable us to hire journalists to improve the coverage in underserved regions and communities. 
Finally, Before turning to the quarter's results, I would like to highlight the successful completion of our inaugural bond offering, which was multiple times oversubscribed at an attractive coupon and thus, a resounding vote of confidence in the company's strategy and its prospects. 
As for the third quarter of fiscal year 2021, I am pleased to report that we achieved nearly $300 million in profits, up 23% year-over-year. We have now had 3 successive quarters of double-digit profit increases, and we strongly believe these rather positive results reflect an increase in our core profitability. Revenues in the third quarter exceeded $2.3 billion, representing a 3% increase from the prior year. 
Turning first to the resolutely robust Digital Real Estate Services segment, Move's revenue growth was 37%, exceeding Q2's 28% growth. Move and realtor.com's value to News Corp, to the real estate industry and to consumers is becoming more obvious with each passing quarter. Overall, Digital Real Estate Services revenues were up 34% year-over-year, and segment EBITDA surged 58%. realtor.com traffic growth has outpaced that of Zillow for 14 consecutive months through March, and the significant growth disparity between the 2 has been widening markedly according to comScore in March. REALTOR's traffic growth outpaced Zillow and Trulia by nearly 30 percentage points. 
Why this extraordinary growth at REALTOR? Because we are focused on our consumers, whether that be a family buying or selling a house or the agents handling that important transaction. We are not flipping houses. We are not competing with our clients. We are not building up a stock of bricks-and-mortar inventory. We are not worrying over the wallpaper or fretting over fences or stuck up on stucco. We are absolutely digital and devoted to our consumers. 
This reputational and functional advantage for REALTOR comes at a moment of genuine momentum for the U.S. real estate market. Our internal metrics show that average monthly unique views in the quarter were 44% higher than the prior year and reached 108 million uniques for the month of March alone, a burgeoning of 60% versus the prior year. Not only is realtor.com serving homebuyers and sellers, we are serving renters and landlords as well. We expanded our rentals offering by acquiring Avail, where revenue growth has exceeded initial expectations, and we are excited about the opportunity that lies ahead in this lucrative market segment. 
In Australia, the real estate market is thriving, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne. REA Group, the clear leader in that country's digital real estate sector, saw revenues increase by 32%. During the quarter, REA announced that it proposed to acquire 100% of the shares in Mortgage Choice Limited. The proposed acquisition aligns with REA's financial services strategy by leveraging the group's digital expertise, motivated property buyers and data insights across a larger network. 
At Dow Jones, revenues rose 6% year-over-year, and segment EBITDA led an impressive 61%. Overall advertising, which was slightly down in Q2, moved into positive terrain in Q3, with digital advertising 30% higher in the quarter, almost double the growth rate of the New York Times. Digital now represents 61% of all advertising compared to a ratio of 48% in the prior year. Digital-only subs at Dow Jones and The Wall Street Journal surged 29%, and Dow Jones digital-only net adds in the quarter exceeded those of the New York Times for its new subscriptions. 
MarketWatch is achieving record-high revenues and is now benefiting from multiple revenue streams with the successful launch of its subscription offering in October. Risk & Compliance reported growth of 24% in the quarter, marking 23 consecutive quarters of double-digit expansion. This strength underscores R&C's value as a global leader in data intelligence, including in anti-money laundering, anticorruption and commercial risk assessment. 
With increasingly stringent demands from the U.S. government and bodies around the world for strict compliance and heightened emphasis on ESG, we believe Dow Jones Risk & Compliance is perfectly poised to benefit. If anyone on this call would like to minimize risk or maximize compliance, please do reach out. 
Meanwhile, we are on the cusp of integrating Investor’s Business Daily. That deal closed this week, and we expect IBD will provide innumerable opportunities for cross-selling and upselling with the Dow Jones portfolio of products. IBD will also be a source of important expertise and insight as 90% of its revenue is digital, and the company has a compelling lucrative suite of software products. 
Book Publishing is another engine of growth for News Corp as HarperCollins continued on its extremely positive trajectory with 19% revenue growth in the quarter compared to a year earlier, and segment EBITDA surging 45%, as both our powerful backlist and notable front list performed strongly. 
One of the standouts in the third quarter was the Bridgerton series, which is now the most successful series of HarperCollins in fiscal '21. Other strong performers included The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse by Charles Mackesy (sic) [ Charlie Mackesy ] and Cicely Tyson's memoir, Just as I Am. 
The power of the HarperCollins substantial backlist in Q3 reinforces our enthusiasm, the anticipated integration of the newly acquired Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Books and Media segment, which should close in Q4. This acquisition will greatly expand the HarperCollins backlist with an additional 7,000 titles, including such monumental works as The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Animal Farm and 1984; and loved children's books like Curious George, The Polar Express, The Little Prince and many, many more. 
We look forward with eager anticipation to Amazon's production of J.R.R. Tolkien's works due in coming years. As with HMH, we will have acquired the U.S. rights to that extraordinary collection and will now own the global English language rights. As Tolkien himself wrote, ""The greatest adventure is what lies ahead. Today and tomorrow are yet to be said."" 
In Subscription Video Services, our strategy to rapidly expand streaming has been transformational for Foxtel. The express growth of Kayo and Binge together with Foxtel Now saw a number of paying OTT subscribers reach approximately 1.6 million as at the end of March. That represents a doubling of streaming subscribers over the past year alone, an extraordinary achievement. 
In total, Foxtel closing subscribers grew to a record of over 3.5 million, up 21% year-over-year driving a significant increase in profitability. Kayo Sports has helped make Foxtel the preeminent home of sports in Australia with a record 2.2 million sports subscribers. Of these, Kayo accounted for 851,000 paying subscribers as at March 31, more than double the prior year, where it was 408,000. 
In recent days, Kayo exceeded 1 million total subscribers, with paying subscribers expected to reach that milestone imminently. A strong summer of cricket and the start of the dominant winter sports saw Kayo generate more momentum. This was supported by our recent agreement with Telstra, which has seen Kayo replace Telstra Live Pass in the AFL Live app and NRL official app, making Kayo the exclusive streaming home of the extremely popular Aussie Rules and Rugby League competitions. 
Not yet 1 year old, the Binge entertainment streaming service reached 516,000 paying subscribers, up nearly 20% on the second quarter. Binge has established consistent weekly subscriber growth, underpinned by the growing awareness of the Binge brand, the popularity of hit shows such as The Flight Attendant, The Walking Dead and Zack Snyder's Justice League and it's deserved reputation for a user-friendly, tech savvy access to the world's best content. 
Foxtel's resurgence during the pandemic, coupled with the continuing value of its broadcast product, the rapid growth of Kayo and Binge and a relentless focus on cost transformation have delivered a much enhanced financial performance that certainly gives us flexibility and optionality. 
In the News Media segment, revenues declined somewhat as expected. The difference was entirely attributable to the sale of News America Marketing and the restructuring of regional and community titles in Australia, most of which became digital-only [ properties ]. 
In the U.K., circulation revenues increased, while The New York Post continued revenue growth driven by strong expansion in digital advertising. 
Finally, I want to express my enduring gratitude for the thousands of people who work at News Corp around the world for their creativity, their commitment and their collaborative spirit, which has been a guiding force as we navigate through the uncharted, turbulent waters of the pandemic. The past 12 months have seen record profits in many of our businesses, a strong reinforcement of our digital imperative and particularly potent performances by the 3 sectors that we had targeted for expedited growth. It is clear that our investors are increasingly embracing that strategy and profiting from that strategy. 
And now I turn to Susan Panuccio for words of financial wisdom."
212741644,712729119,2273905,"News Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, May 06, 2021",2021-05-06,"Earnings Calls","News Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Robert. Fiscal 2021 third quarter total revenues were over $2.3 billion, an increase of 3% versus the prior year, while total segment EBITDA was $298 million, up 23% year-over-year, reflecting strong performances across our key segments. Our",2670,"Thank you, Robert. Fiscal 2021 third quarter total revenues were over $2.3 billion, an increase of 3% versus the prior year, while total segment EBITDA was $298 million, up 23% year-over-year, reflecting strong performances across our key segments. 
Our 3 core pillars, Dow Jones, Digital Real Estate Services and Book Publishing, collectively grew segment EBITDA by 55% versus the prior year. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impact from acquisitions and divestitures, most notably the sale of News America Marketing in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 as well as currency fluctuations and other items disclosed in our release, revenues rose 4%, while total segment EBITDA grew 24%. 
Net income for the quarter was $96 million compared to a net loss of $1 billion in the prior year, which reflects the absence of a noncash impairment charge related to Foxtel and News America Marketing in the prior period. For the quarter, we reported earnings per share of $0.13 as compared to a net loss per share of $1.24 last year. And our adjusted EPS were $0.09 in the quarter compared to $0.03 in the prior year. 
Turning now to the operating segments. Digital Real Estate Services segment revenues were $351 million, an increase of 34% compared to the prior year, which was more than double the growth rate we saw in the second quarter. The performance was driven by another record quarterly performance at Move together with improvements at REA as well as the Elara consolidation and positive impact from foreign exchange fluctuations. On an adjusted basis, revenues increased 22%. 
Segment EBITDA rose 58% to $117 million or 52% on an adjusted basis, the fastest quarterly growth rate in nearly 4 years. Move's revenues accelerated to $162 million, a 37% increase year-over-year, with real estate revenues rising 43%. Move contributed $36 million or 84% of the segment EBITDA growth this quarter, the highest contribution to growth to the segment for the fiscal year. 
realtor.com's traffic increased to 98 million average monthly unique users in the third quarter, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 44%. Notably in March, REALTOR's unique users eclipsed 100 million the first time, reaching over 108 million unique users, up 60% compared to the prior year. Monthly average lead volume remained very strong, growing over 40%, which was higher than the second quarter rate despite continued inventory constraints across the industry. 
We saw very strong growth across both the traditional lead generation and referral businesses in the third quarter, with a notable acceleration from the second quarter rate in the growth of Connections Plus, our traditional lead generation product, which benefited from higher traffic and lead volumes, higher retention rates and improved pricing. These results underscore the success of our strategy of choice and flexibility. 
Revenues from the referral business continued to grow strongly, representing 25% of total Move revenues, lower than the first half mainly due to the acceleration in the traditional lead generation business, coupled with the seasonality impact. Overall, the drivers behind the performance of the referral model remained similar to the prior quarter with continued strong transaction volumes, higher home pricing and stable to higher referral fees. As we mentioned last quarter, we expect to continue reinvesting in Move primarily in marketing and product development, balancing continued improvement in profitability with revenue growth. 
We are pleased to see strong growth across both as the team accelerates the pace of innovation and new products as we expand into adjacencies. 
Turning to REA Group. Revenues at REA rose 32% to $189 million, reflecting a $28 million or 19% positive impact from currency fluctuations and a $7 million from the acquisition of Elara. Australian national residential listings for the quarter rose 8%, with Melbourne up 13% and Sydney up 5%, with growth rates improving throughout the quarter. New developer project launches increased by 14% compared to the prior year. REA's results also benefited from an increase in residential [ debt rental fees ] despite the absence of a price increase this fiscal year as part of REA's COVID-19 support initiative. 
Like REALTOR, REA is benefiting from record traffic with realestate.com.au hitting an all-time high of 137 million monthly visits in March, up 60% year-over-year, and buyer inquiries are also at record high. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for more detail. 
Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $523 million, up 13% versus the prior year and included a $79 million or 17% positive impact from foreign currency fluctuation. Adjusted revenues were down 4%, continuing the improving trend through the fiscal year as the expansion of OTT revenues partially offset the declines in broadcast subscription revenue. 
Total closing paid subscribers across Foxtel were over 3.5 million as of March 31, up 21% versus the prior year as the team focused on maintaining its premium broadcast customers, while the Kayo and Binge streaming services delivered subscriber growth at scale. The comparison versus the prior year was helped by the absence of the initial impact of COVID-19 and the launch of Binge in the fourth quarter. 
Total paying OTT subscribers expanded to nearly 1.6 million paying subscribers, up 120% compared to the prior year, with Kayo reaching 851,000 and binge at 516,000 paying subscribers. Including trialists, Kayo and Binge reached 914,000 and 679,000 subscribers, respectively, which is indicative of the strong consumer interest in each of the product's unique content set. 
Kayo's growth has been enhanced by the recent agreement with Telstra to replace Telstra's Live Pass with Kayo, accelerating the penetration and adoption of the product. While the revenue impact from the addition of former Live Pass customers will be minimally new one at the agreement due to the pricing promotion, we see this partnership as a unique opportunity and window to introduce Kayo to a new audience. 
Residential broadcast subscribers declined 12% from the prior year to over 1.7 million and commercial subscribers also declined 12% to 235,000. However, the trend improved sequentially as COVID-19 restrictions continue to ease particularly in pubs and clubs, albeit the accommodation sector remains challenged. 
Broadcast churn was elevated at 20.1% versus 17.5% in the prior year as the team continued to balance churn with revenue optimization. As a result, ARPU continued to rise both year-over-year and sequentially, partly mitigating broadcast subscriber volume declines. Broadcast ARPU rose 2% to over AUD 80 or USD 62. 
Segment EBITDA improved 34% to $91 million and was up 13% on an adjusted basis. The improvement was driven by $22 million of lower sports programming rights and production costs as well as lower transmission, marketing and employee costs. 
Finally, on Foxtel, they refinanced their existing AUD 650 million revolving credit and working capital facilities and extended the maturity out 18 months to May 2024 at a slight price improvement. 
Moving on to Dow Jones, Dow Jones delivered another outstanding quarter with year-over-year growth for both revenue and segment EBITDA accelerating versus the second quarter and the first half rate. Revenues for the quarter were $421 million, up 6% compared to the prior year, with digital revenues accounting for 74% of total revenues this quarter, up 6 percentage points from the prior year. Circulation revenues again rose 8% due to the growth in digital circulation revenues, partially offset by lower single coffee and amenity print volume, which is still impacted by COVID-19 restrictions. 
Dow Jones continue to post record subscriptions with nearly 4.3 million average subscriptions to its consumer products in the quarter, up 19% from the prior year. Of that, nearly 3.3 million were digital-only subscriptions, reflecting 238,000 sequential net adds and 29% year-over-year growth. 
For the Wall Street Journal, there were approximately 3.4 million average subscriptions for the quarter, up 21% from the prior year, with digital-only subscriptions growing 29% to over 2.6 million. Revenues from Dow Jones Risk & Compliance grew 24%, improving from the Q2 rate and was the fastest growth since the first quarter of fiscal 2020. 
Overall, Professional Information Business revenues rose 9%. Within Professional Information Business, Risk & Compliance was the largest source of revenue this quarter for the first time on record and is now approaching $200 million in revenues for the full year compared to approximately $160 million in fiscal 2020. 
Advertising revenues, which accounted for 20% of revenues this quarter, grew 1% to $85 million, a marked improvement from the 4% decline last quarter and was the first growth since the first quarter of fiscal 2020. As Robert mentioned, digital advertising revenues had the fastest growth in a decade, up 30% and accounting for 61% of advertising revenues for the third quarter. 
It is worth noting that this level of growth came despite a tough prior year comparison of up over 20%, which, at the time, was a record quarterly performance. Encouragingly, the growth was again broad-based with notable gains in the financial services category. We saw growth in both volume and yield, particularly in direct display. Print advertising revenues declined 25% year-over-year, which was an improvement from the 29% decline in the second quarter. 
Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter rose 61% to $82 million, with margins expanding close to 7 percentage points versus the prior year. Total costs declined 2% this quarter, which was better than we had expected, mostly due to lower print volumes and other discretionary savings, partially offset by higher compensation costs. 
Our Book Publishing, HarperCollins, posted 19% revenue growth to $490 million and 45% segment EBITDA growth to $80 million, reflecting another very strong quarter and continues to benefit from the industry-wide increase in consumption. Like the second quarter, revenue growth was again broad-based and was led by the general trade, children's, U.K. and foreign language categories, The backlist was the key driver this quarter, accounting for 62% of sales, led by very strong sales from the Bridgerton series by Julia Quinn. 
Similar to previous quarters, we are continuing to benefit from a strong rebound in e-books with sales up 38% year-over-year and gains in all categories, while downloadable audio books increased 42% year-over-year. Overall digital sales were up 38%. 
HarperCollins again demonstrated strong operating leverage. Despite a 15% increase in total costs in part due to royalties and higher production expenses related to the successful top line performance, margins improved by 3 percentage points. 
Turning to News Media. We continue to remain focused on rightsizing the cost base and moving towards digital within the segment. Revenues for the quarter were $550 million, down 25% versus the prior year, of which the impact from the divestment of News America Marketing accounted for the majority of the decline. On an adjusted basis, revenues declined only 7%, which is an improvement from the 9% decline last quarter. Decline also reflects the $28 million or 4% negative impact from the closure or transition to digital and certain regional and community newspapers in Australia. 
Circulation and subscription revenues rose 13%, driven by a $26 million or 10% benefit from currency fluctuations, strong digital paid subscriber growth and a couple of price increases, partially offset by lower newsstand sales related to COVID-19. 
Advertising revenues decreased $215 million or 50% compared to the prior year, reflecting a $199 million or 47% negative impact from the divestiture of News America Marketing and a $23 million or 5% negative impact related to the closure or transition to digital of certain regional and community newspapers in Australia. 
The remainder of the movement was driven by favorable foreign exchange, partly offset by the continued weakness in the print advertising market exacerbated by COVID-19. 
Advertising performance was mixed across the regions, with Australia showing moderating declines compared to the second quarter rate, particularly driven by increased retail spending. While the U.K.'s year-over-year performance weakened mostly compared to the second quarter, impacted by another lockdown, which started at the end of 2020. In the U.S., the trends remained robust with the New York Post posting 21% advertising revenue growth, of which digital advertising grew 32%. 
Segment EBITDA for the quarter was $8 million compared to $24 million in the prior year due primarily to the absence of the contribution from News America Marketing. Adjusted segment EBITDA increased by $5 million. 
In our other segment, the third quarter costs were higher than we expected, primarily driven by higher equity compensation due to the rising share price and the initial investment spending related to the implementation of our global shared services initiative. 
I would now like to talk about some themes for the upcoming quarter. As noted in the past call, forecasting remains challenging given the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic. At Digital Real Estate Services, national residential listings in Australia for April were up 98% compared to the prior year. While the market dynamics are strong, these growth rates are exaggerated by the severe COVID-19-related declines experienced in April 2020. Please refer to REA's press release and earnings call for more details. 
At Move, we remain very encouraged by overall trends and expect the revenue momentum to continue. We continue to expect additional reinvestments at Move in areas such as brand marketing and product development as we focus on gaining market share and expanding into adjacencies. 
In Subscription Video Services, we have seen broadcast churn trends moderate during April, and we remain encouraged by strong OTT demand from Kayo and Binge. We expect EBITDA results to be challenged due in large part to the lapping of the prior year cost savings. 
As a reminder, the prior year's fourth quarter results included USD 70 million of lower sports programming costs, mainly due to the suspension of sporting events as a result of COVID-19. For the current fiscal fourth quarter, we expect to incur those rights, which will be impacted by the rising Aussie dollar versus the U.S. dollar as well as some additional costs for further OTT investments. 
At Dow Jones, overall revenue trends remained favorable compared to the prior year, including strong digital advertising growth. As mentioned last quarter, we expect to reinvest in the business as we focus on driving revenue growth through its digital assets and expect second half expenses to increase modestly compared to the prior year. 
In Book Publishing, overall industry trends remain favorable, but we continue to monitor closely the sustainability of recent consumer spending patterns, such as the increasing free time for consumers to read and the increase in the average number of books purchased. We continue to expect performance to moderate in the fourth quarter, in part due to the strong performance in the prior year, which benefited from increased consumer demand at the onset of COVID-19 lockdowns and restrictions as well as the successful release of Magnolia Table Volume 2. 
At News Media, we expect continued improvement in the fourth quarter as we lap both the impact from COVID-19 and the sale of News America Marketing in May 2020. Cost decline should moderate as we lap COVID-19 saving initiatives as well as the divestment of News America Marketing and the closure or digital transition of some of our newspapers in Australia in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. We expect overall profitability trends to improve, and we expect modest revenue impacts from our new licensing agreements. 
In our Other segment, we expect the fourth quarter cost to increase around $20 million versus the prior year, in part due to the reduction of bonuses in the prior year, higher share price and the costs related to the global shared services initiative. 
Our year-to-date free cash flow available was $762 million compared to $63 million in the prior year, benefiting from higher EBITDA, improvements in working capital and lower CapEx. Some of the working capital improvement is timing related, but we're very pleased with the progress made to date. Also note that the fourth quarter balance sheet will reflect the proceeds from our recent senior notes offering, together with the 3 recently announced acquisitions, which will impact our interest expense and cash balance. 
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

So if you compare that to the Q3 numbers, we also expect those numbers to scale up from a variable cost perspective given the revenue growth. 
In relation to Dow Jones, we would expect to see higher costs in Q4 largely as a consequence of compensation and marketing expenditure. But we have been very encouraged by the ongoing cost focus in that business. And as you could see, they had a pretty good cost result for this quarter as well. 
So probably more investment coming through at REALTOR than what we would expect to see in Dow Jones."

The Wall Street Journal's journalism obviously rises above the -- sort of gormless rhetoric, the [ pants-tearing ], the jaundiced journalism that you see in some other places. And so the Dow Jones results certainly rise above those of the New York Times, both in circulation now in the news segment and in digital advertising, which was almost double that of the New York Times.

The stresses and strains of a pandemic have stretched the social fabric and the commercial campus. I want, foremostly, to express my gratitude to the employees of News Corporation, who around the world, have navigated these testing times with professionalism and with principal, their efforts, their creativity and their commitment have built on the company's proud foundations and been a catalyst for these impressive results for News Corp and for our group companies. 
Overall, revenues in fiscal '21 rose 4% and by 30% in the fourth quarter, that is 30%, indicating that the company is surely gaining in momentum, while profitability improved by 26% for the year. We have continued to focus our investment on growth areas, with the acquisition of Investor's Business Daily, Mortgage Choice in Australia and the Books & Media division of Horton Mifflin Harcourt. We have also continued to simplify the business with the rationalization of REA's Asian property business and the amicable settlement of residual litigation regarding News America Marketing, which we successfully sold just ahead of fiscal '21. 
Our strong cash generation has given us increased optionality. Our cash balance exceeded $2.2 billion at the end of June. And so we were able to take advantage of the required sale of Opus which we expect to strengthen and ultimately transform the Dow Jones professional information business. And our clearly robust cash position has prompted as a company to actively review our capital returns policy with a greater focus on buybacks. 
A few highlights before delving deeper into the businesses. For fiscal 2021, we had a record number of digital subscriptions at our key masters, record traffic at realtor.com, where audience growth, according to comScore, is significantly outpacing that of its main rival, and record subscriber growth at Foxtel, where at the end of June, our paid streaming subscribers reached over 2 million, an increase year-on-year of 155%, a profound escalation that included the successful launch of Binge last year. That success has naturally given us much optionality as we consider Foxtel's rather favorable future. In short, we had the most profitable year since we created the new News Corp. Dow Jones had its most profitable year since it was acquired in 2007, and HarperCollins and move also recorded their most profitable years, and we believe there is clearly more growth ahead. 
The past year has seen the revaluing of our content through landmark news payment agreements with the major tech platforms. These deals, the financial terms of which are confidential, will add significant revenue annually, clearly into 9 figures and are a profoundly important part of the ongoing transformation of the content landscape. We are also watching the evolution of the digital ad market, which historically has lacked transparency, the active interest of regulators around the world should reduce the opacity and provide higher yields for publishers. 
At Dow Jones, subscriber growth continued at pace, leading to a significant increase in segment EBITDA for the fourth quarter and for the year, up 15% and 41%, respectively. The full year segment EBITDA was indeed the most lucrative since the company's acquisition. Digital consumer subscriptions, which were 26% higher in the quarter, contributed to that growth as did an overall increase in advertising revenues for the year of 4% as a surge in digital ads more than compensated for a decline in print advertising. 
At The Wall Street Journal, subscriptions grew 15% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, reaching nearly $3.5 million, and digital-only subs growing by nearly $100,000 from the third quarter and by 21% year-over-year, now comprise nearly 80% of total subscriptions. Advertising in the fourth quarter rose 45% and digital advertising was 53% higher. It is worth highlighting the success of our risk and compliance business, particularly as we contemplate the future potential of the just announced agreement to acquire Opus. 
Revenues at Risk & Compliance increased 23% for the fiscal year and burgeoned by 30% in the fourth quarter compared to a year earlier, marking 6 straight years of over 20% growth. We believe that the professional information business will continue to expand at a strong rate, and Opus will be the cornerstone for commodities, energy and renewables digital business that will have a long-term positive impact on our earnings. We are excited to be adding a new growth lever to Dow Jones, whose performance has manifestly been exceptional. We firmly believe Opus and Dow Jones will be more than the sum of their parts. 
Our acquisition of Investor's Business Daily was completed in May, and we expect to see the positive impact of this high-margin digital operation in coming quarters. We believe that there are multiple opportunities to cross-sell and upsell products as IBD will benefit from Dow Jones reach and Dow Jones will prosper from IBD's range of high-value specialist investment offerings. We are confident that Almar Latour and the team at Dow Jones are poised to deliver ongoing excellent results. 
The Foxtel narrative is particularly positive as our early emphasis on streaming and on securing long-term valuable sports and entertainment rights has put the company on a decidedly upward trajectory. Our paying subscribers were 40% higher and fiscal year revenue rose 10%, while our EBITDA growth was 11%. There was a noticeable acceleration in revenue growth in the fourth quarter when it surged 33%, driven by our streaming products and thanks in part to positive currency fluctuations. The strong growth in the streaming business which is taking advantage of and successfully monetizing existing rights was evident in the fourth quarter with the number of total paying streaming subscribers was 155% higher than at the same time last year. We are obviously pleased with the exponential evolution of both Kayo, our sports streaming product, which has rights to Australia's most popular sports, and Binge, our entertainment streaming service, as they combine world-class technology, clever user interfaces and high-quality compelling content. 
It is worth pausing for a moment to consider how the Foxtel narrative has changed decisively and positively over the past 18 months. Then we were being asked whether we would need to put extra funds into Foxtel. And now we have attractive options for a growing thoroughly contemporary business that has a tangible upside. Our immediate task and that of our team led admirably by Siobhan McKenna and Patrick Delaney is to keep driving the business to keep striving because those options will certainly be enhanced by continued success. 
Digital real estate is another fast-growing sector for the company, and we are proud of the performance of both REA and Realtor. Many of you will recall, there was a certain skepticism when we acquired Move, the realtor.com parent, a certain doubt about our ability to turn around the company's then flagging fortunes. Well, there's no overstatement to say there has been a realtor renaissance with fiscal 2021 profit contribution from Move increasing by $100 million as its revenue scale. 
For the year, revenue grew by 36% and the rate accelerated to 68% in the fourth quarter. Audience numbers hit record highs during the quarter. As measured by the independent comScore, Audience growth has exceeded that of Zillow and Trulia for 17 successive months, an averaged more than 20 percentage points faster in the last 8 months. That is a telling testament to the great work by Tracy Fellows, David Doctoro and to all at Realtor. 
The 2 core pillars of the Realtor business, the premium referral model and lead generation, have both reported superlative growth. And those who watch the industry closely will have noted that a key indicator, the number of houses listed for sale has increased in the past 2 months. The more inventory on the market, the more opportunities for the REALTOR team to deliver their best-in-class services to buyers, sellers and agents. 
Our REA had a supernal year with revenue growth of 27%, benefiting from currency and a robust housing recovery in Australia. Revenue growth actually accelerated in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, again, listings were a key driver of that success with full year listing 15% higher, while those in the fourth quarter surged 54%. One of the absolute lessons of the pandemic is that families and investors have focused on property as both a source of returns but also of enduring security. The [aloha] of real estate is real and the profits are palpable. 
Meanwhile, we are expanding into sensible adjacencies, in particular, mortgages, which will also benefit from the renewed flow of listings. SmartLine is already thriving, and Owen Wilson and the team are confident that Mortgage Choice will benefit from that increased activity by offering borrowers the best possible range of loans. We look forward to updating you in coming quarters with the progress at both Mortgage Choice and SmartLine. 
HarperCollins is another resilient source of revenue growth, profits and cash generation for the company. Revenue for the full year rose 19%, while segment EBITDA was 42% higher as the company benefited from digital sales, the rediscovery of books as a medium and an extensive lucrative backlist. For example, the company has certainly profited from the immense popularity of Bridgeton, the eponymous Netflix series, which has been extended into a second season to the benefit of Julia Quin's novels and HarperCollins. The company's prospects and its backlist have been bolstered by the addition of the Horton Mifflin Harcourt Books & Media segment, which has a living library of 7,000 titles including the perennially popular George Orwell and Curious George. 
We also acquired the U.S. rights to JRR Tokens works, including the Hobbit and the Lord of Rings Trilogy, and now have global English language rights, which will surely benefit from the upcoming blockbuster Amazon series based on those classic  [indiscernible] books. Brian Murray and the HarperCollins team have focused on driving digital and direct-to-consumer offerings, and it is worth noting that e-book sales rose 14% during the year, while audio books expanded a healthy 22%.
Clearly, there is much interest by various podcast-related companies in our unique audio book offerings, and we stand to gain from the proliferation of streaming audio. For those of you who have perused our numbers, it is clear that there has been a strong improvement in the profitability of the News Media businesses with News U.K., News Corp Australia and the New York Post all performing admirably and contributing to News Corp's overall enhanced profitability. There was disciplined cost control and sage leadership throughout those businesses and a strong recovery in advertising during the fourth quarter. 
In the U.K., our businesses delivered a significant profit contribution for the year, with digital subscriptions increasing markedly and listening at wireless rising sharply during the European football championships with advertising benefiting accordingly. And we look forward with Electrity to the launch of the Premier League season next week. The Sun remains the country's largest digital news brand and advertising revenue across the properties in the U.K. rebounded in the fourth quarter compared to a year earlier. That rebound is a silent reach, engagement and provenance are important to advertisers. And at our U.K. media companies, under Rebraca Brooks leadership, provide a uniquely effective forum. 
At News Corp Australia where Michael Miller and the team took the bold and necessary decision to convert most of our regional and community papers to digital only platforms, we saw a 25% increase in digital subscribers at the masters in the fourth quarter, while there was a healthy recovery in advertising. Clearly, businesses are subject to the vagaries of the virus in Australia, but the robust recovery in recent months is a hopeful harbinger. The New York Post was on the very cusp of making an annual profit for the first time in many decades perhaps for the first time since the age of Alexander Hamilton, which is testament to the [indiscernible] work of Sanjiang Kolar, Keith pool and all of the post. The post was a digital success in fiscal '21, generating 45% digital ad growth, including an acceleration in the fourth quarter with 65% growth. That is 65% growth. And we should harvest further savings from the exiting of our Bronx printing plant, which is attracting much demand from companies seeking this prime side. 
I would like to thank all who have printed and distributed to post in Dow Jones publications through the decades. They provided a great service to the company and to society by delivering news and insight every morning around the Greater New York region. All of our employees deserve gratitude for their stellar contributions, both for the company and their communities over the past complicated, sometimes stressful year. Their efforts have been a crucial part of our unprecedented success and provided a firm foundation for ongoing revenue growth and increasing profitability. 
As I mentioned earlier, we are generating record profits and cash, and that has given us the ability to make opportunistic acquisitions to bolster the company and generate even more momentum. We will certainly be thoughtful and strategic in deploying our assets and will, as always, be cognizant of our responsibility to and the interest of all of our shareholders. 
And now I hand you over to Susan Panuccio, who will provide more salient details about an extraordinary year."
212741644,1674769285,2365679,"News Corporation, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2021",2021-08-05,"Earnings Calls","News Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Robert. Fiscal 2021 fourth quarter total revenues were almost $2.5 billion, up 30%, the highest level since the second quarter of fiscal 2019 when we still own use America Marketing. Total segment EBITDA was $210 million, up 8% versus the prior",2565,"Thank you, Robert. Fiscal 2021 fourth quarter total revenues were almost $2.5 billion, up 30%, the highest level since the second quarter of fiscal 2019 when we still own use America Marketing. Total segment EBITDA was $210 million, up 8% versus the prior year, including record high segment EBITDA at Digital Real Estate Services. Total segment EBITDA included several nonrecurring items that depressed year-over-year comparisons this quarter, including $49 million of nonrecurring legal settlement and transaction costs. The results also include $11 million of one-off costs at Foxtel, which I'll come back to. 
Excluding the divestment of News America Marketing, acquisitions, currency fluctuations and the other items disclosed in our release, adjusted revenues increased 20% and adjusted total segment EBITDA increased 26%, driven by a strong performance of Digital Real Estate Services and a big year-over-year improvement in News Media. For the quarter, we reported a net loss per share of $0.02 compared to a loss of $0.67 in the prior year. Last year's loss included $292 million of noncash impairment charges primarily related to fixed assets in the U.K. and Australia. 
Fiscal 2021 results included a $64 million tax benefit due to an adjustment to a valuation allowance in the U.S. and a $54 million noncash write-down of Foxtel's investment related to the Nickelodeon Australian joint venture, which is now covered through a separate affiliate agreement. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.16 in the quarter compared to a loss per share of $0.03 in the prior year. Importantly, on a full year basis, free cash flow available to News Corp improved to $731 million from $180 million in the prior year, driven by higher total segment EBITDA, improvements in working capital and lower capital spending. 
Moving on to the results for the individual reporting segments, starting with Digital Real Estate Services. Segment revenues were $413 million, an increase of 74% compared to the prior year, a sharp acceleration from the third quarter growth rate of 34%. The performance was driven by another record quarterly performance at Move, together with very strong results at REA and to a lesser extent, a positive impact from foreign currency fluctuations. On an adjusted basis, revenues increased 59%. Segment EBITDA rose 92% to $136 million or 99% on an adjusted basis. Move's revenues were $186 million, a 68% increase year-over-year with real estate revenues rising 77%, a significant acceleration from the 43% growth in the prior quarter. 
Move contributed $17 million to the segment EBITDA growth this quarter, achieving strong profit improvements despite $30 million of additional marketing expenses consistent with our commentary that the bulk of the expected increase in cost the second half would materialize in the fourth quarter. For the full fiscal 2021 year, Move increased its profit contribution by $100 million and was the single biggest profit driver across News Corp this year. We saw accelerated revenue growth across both the traditional lead generation and referral businesses in the quarter. The traditional lead generation business continued to benefit from strong agent demand, improved retention rates, higher yield and lead volume growth. Revenues from the referral business represented approximately 30% of total Move revenues, up from 25% in the prior quarter, partly due to seasonality with revenue growth driven by an increase in lead volume, record home pricing and higher referral fees. 
In addition, advertising and rental revenue also showed strength during the quarter with the combined revenues more than doubling versus the prior year, only partially offset by the lower revenues resulting from the sale of top producer in the third quarter. realtor.com's traffic reached a quarterly record of 106 million average monthly users, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 32%. Lead volume grew 14% year-over-year, a slower growth rate than the prior quarter as we lapped tougher comparisons with the prior year, which saw growth rates in the mid-30s coupled with ongoing industry supply constraints compared to the prior quarter, lead volume grew 8%. 
REA had an exceptional quarter with revenues rising 79% year-over-year to $227 million, including a $34 million or 27% positive impact from currency fluctuations. REA's results benefited from a material increase in residential premier debt revenues despite the absence of a price increase this fiscal year as part of REA's prior year COVID-19 support initiatives. Australian National residential new buy listings for the quarter rose 54% with Melbourne and Sydney both up 64% as growth rates were somewhat exaggerated by the impacts from COVID-19 last year. 
Listing volumes were not only higher than the prior year, but also higher than fiscal 2019 and 2018 levels. Traffic remained robust with total visits to realestate.com.au for June at $123 million, up 8% year-over-year, and the visits multiplier against its nearest competitor reaching a record high of over 3.4x in June. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for more details. 
Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $542 million, up 33% versus the prior year and included an $85 million or 21% positive impact from foreign currency fluctuations. The growth rate also improved sequentially. Adjusted revenues increased 12% with higher revenues from the streaming products more than offsetting the revenue declines from the broadcast product in the quarter, helped by the COVID-19 comparison. Total closing paid subscribers across Foxtel reached nearly $3.9 million as of June 30, with total subscriptions, including trialists, over $4 million and were up 40% versus the prior year, a material acceleration from the third quarter driven by continued growth in paid streaming subscribers and a year-over-year recovery in commercial, which was hit particularly hard from COVID-19 last year. Sequentially, paid subscribers rose 10%. 
The Kayo total subscribers increased to almost $1.1 million and Binge total subscribers increased to 827,000. In the aggregate, total streaming subscribers reached over 2.1 million with paying subscribers up more than 150% to just over $2 million. Streaming products are now delivering meaningful growth at scale and over 50% at Foxtel's total paid subscribers are now on streaming platforms. Residential broadcast subscribers declined to less than 1.7 million and commercial subscribers while growing sharply year-over-year continue to be impacted by COVID-19 restrictions and further lockdown, notably in the accommodation sector. We saw broadcast churn moderate from the past 2 quarters to 17.1%, but up from 13.2% in the prior year, with the team continuing their focus on retaining high-value subscribers and driving ARPU growth. ARPU increased 4% to AUD 81 from the prior year, partially offsetting broadcast subscriber volume declines. 
Segment EBITDA declined 37% to $66 million or 46% on an adjusted basis. As we communicated in our prior call, the decline was largely timing related, driven by $84 million of higher sports programming rights and production costs in the quarter, which we didn't have in the prior year due to COVID-19, together with higher marketing expenses. In addition, Foxtel had approximately $11 million of onetime costs, mainly related to iQ3 and iQ4 promotional activity. Importantly, looking at Subscription Video Services for the full year, segment EBITDA increased 11% and was relatively stable in local currency, which includes the impact of $57 million of sports rights costs that were deferred from last year. The business also generated meaningful free cash flow across the year as increasing scale in streaming is leading to improved financial momentum within the company and lower capital intensity. 
Moving on to Dow Jones. Dow Jones delivered revenue of $449 million, up 18% compared to the prior year, including 2 months of revenue from the acquisition of investors business daily with digital revenues accounting for 72% of total revenues this quarter. Circulation and subscription revenues increased $34 million or 11%, driven by a 12% increase in circulation revenues, reflecting the continued strong growth in digital-only subscription for Dow Jones consumer products and the acquisition of IBD. 
Dow Jones subscriptions increased to over 4.5 million average subscriptions to its consumer products in the quarter, up 19% from the prior year. Of that, nearly $3.5 million were digital-only subscriptions, up 26% year-over-year. IBD had over 100,000 subscriptions at quarter end with the majority being digital only. 
Professional information business revenues rose 11%, driven primarily by risk and compliance. Revenue growth from Risk & Compliance accelerated yet again with a year-over-year increase of 30% and marked the fastest growth in 3 years. For the year, Risk & Compliance reached approximately $195 million of revenues, up 23%. Advertising revenues, which accounted for 23% of revenues this quarter, grew 45% to $103 million, the highest fourth quarter growth rate since News Corp's acquisition and was also higher than the fourth quarter fiscal 2019. 
Digital advertising posted record growth with revenues up 53%, with all categories performing above expectations. We saw a significant increase in yield, particularly in direct display. Print advertising revenues rose 36% year-over-year, primarily benefiting from the COVID-19 comparison. Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter rose 15% to $69 million. EBITDA margins were relatively stable year-over-year as higher revenue growth was partially offset by the timing of marketing expenses for both brand and conferences, IBD integration costs and higher compensation costs. Costs were also notably depressed in the prior year due to COVID-19-related savings initiatives. 
As we previously communicated, much of the cost increase this quarter were planned investments with some timing-related items. Dow Jones achieved the highest level of profitability since its acquisition this fiscal year, with margins expanding to nearly 20%, up almost 5 percentage points from the prior year. On an adjusted basis, segment revenues and EBITDA for the quarter rose 14% and 12%, respectively. 
At Book Publishing, for the fourth quarter, HarperCollins posted 21% revenue growth from the prior year and segment EBITDA rose 2%. Adjusted revenues grew 11% and adjusted segment EBITDA was flat to the prior year. The moderation in growth was impacted by the lapping of COVID-19 benefits in the prior year and mix of titles as last year's results included the Magnolia Table Volume II. Despite a difficult prior year comparison, book consumption levels remain high. fourth quarter continued to benefit from Bridgeton but to a lesser extent than the prior quarter. While physical sales continued their momentum this quarter, digital revenues declined 3% in the quarter, reflecting a difficult comparison to the prior year when many bricks-and-mortar stores were closed due to COVID-19. E-book sales fell 11% in the quarter, but were partly offset by 11% growth in download audio. 
This quarter's results also include almost 2 months of results from the acquisition of the HMH book Media segment. We're excited about the acquisition and feel very confident about achieving the cost synergy target of $20 million within 2 years, and the team are actively exploring revenue opportunities, notably in licensing and animation. 
Turning to News Media. Revenues for the quarter were $595 million, up 21% versus the prior year, driven by the recovery of the advertising market from COVID-19-related weaknesses in the prior year. Growth in circulation and subscription revenues and a $73 million or 14% and positive impact from franc currency fluctuations. Growth was partially offset by a $58 million or 12% negative impact from the divestiture of News America Marketing in May 2020. 
On an adjusted basis, revenues rose 21% as we cycled the steep declines from COVID-19 last year. Circulation and subscription revenues rose 26%, driven by a $34 million or 15% benefit from currency fluctuations strong digital paid subscriber growth and cover price increases as well as the recovery of print volumes from COVID-19-related weakness in the prior year. Advertising revenues increased $31 million or 15% compared to the prior year, benefiting from the COVID-19 comparison with strong gains in both print and digital advertising revenues across key masters as well as a $29 million or 14% increase from foreign currency. Those gains came despite a $58 million or 28% negative impact related to the divestment of News America Marketing and a $10 million or 5% negative impact related to the closure or transition to digital of certain regional and community newspapers in Australia. 
On a reported basis, advertising revenues in Australia rose 34% or 14% in local currency, while News U.K. advertising revenues rose 86% or 65% in local currency. In the U.S., the trends remained strong with the New York Post posting 60% advertising revenue growth, of which digital advertising grew 65%. Segment EBITDA for the quarter was breakeven compared to a loss of $44 million in the prior year. 
In the other segment, fourth quarter results include nonrecurring legal settlement costs. Excluding that charge, costs were modestly higher than we had expected, primarily driven by higher equity compensation across both cash and noncash expenditure. 
I would now like to talk about some themes for the upcoming quarter and fiscal 2022. Visibility remains limited, especially in Australia due to ongoing COVID-19 lockdowns. That said, we are very encouraged by our July trends and are looking to build on that momentum into fiscal 2022. Our Digital Real Estate Services, as noted in their release, revenue in fiscal 2022 will benefit from a price rise in July for REA, and they also noted that new buy listings declined 3% in the month. Results will also include the acquisition of Mortgage Choice. Please refer to REA's press release for more details. 
At Move, we continue to see strong pricing in agent demand despite ongoing supply constraints. Like the fourth quarter, we expect to balance reinvestments with revenue growth as we focus on expanding into adjacencies. 
In Subscription Video Services, we are pleased with the ongoing performance of Kayo and Binge and the efforts to improve broadcast ARPU. We do expect a modest impact in the first quarter due to the current lockdowns in Australia, particularly in commercial venues. For the year, we expect costs in local currency to be stable with fiscal 2021 and revenue trends to continue to improve as the streaming products continue to scale. 
At Dow Jones, overall trends across the business remains strong. We expect costs to increase as we focus on top line growth, but we will remain focused on margin expansion. Dow Jones will also see incremental content licensing revenues from Google. 
In Book Publishing, overall trends remain favorable despite lapping the benefits from COVID-19. While publishing faces a difficult comparison given its fiscal 2021 performance, we remain very encouraged by HarperCollins strong release slate and favorable secular trends. We also expect to see additional contribution from the acquisition of HMH. 
At News Media, we expect the segment to show notable improvement in fiscal 2022, driven by the contributions from the deals with Google and Facebook, improving advertising trends and disciplined cost action. 
CapEx for the year is expected to be approximately $100 million higher in fiscal 2022 and partly driven by higher technology costs and the rollout of the IP-enabled iQ5 set-top box at Foxtel. We will continue to manage spend closely throughout the year as we did during fiscal 2021. 
And finally, free cash flow generation will remain a priority in the coming year. The company ends the year stronger, better capitalized and with new levers of growth. We're excited about the potential for our recent acquisitions, including our announcement this week on Opus. And as Robert mentioned, we are now actively reviewing our capital allocation policy as we look to balance reinvestment and growth with healthy shareholder returns. 
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

On buybacks, obviously, we're indicating that there's more vigorous largely a discussion about capital allocation for a start. We have more capital to allocate, given the strong cash generation in the company over the past year and for the foreseeable future. The acquisition of Opus does not change that thinking, which is an advanced stage. So I'll reiterate what we said earlier, we are actively reviewing our capital returns policy with a greater focus on buybacks. As for REALTOR, REALTOR is at a very early stage of its exponential evolution. The growth over the past year come despite a really paucity of listings. And the encouraging sign is the level of listings is on the rise again, and the immutable laws of supply and demand, as always, is beginning to take effect. And it is worth reiterating that we've grown faster than Zillow and Trulia, as measured independently for 17 successive months, and in the past 8 months, that growth has exceeded 20 percentage points. And that is a profound transformation and surely indicates that the fundamentals are favorable."

The stresses and strains of a pandemic have stretched the social fabric and the commercial canvas. I want, foremostly, to express my gratitude to the employees of News Corporation, who around the world, have navigated these testing times with professionalism and with principal. Their efforts, their creativity and their commitment have built on the company's proud foundations and been a catalyst for these impressive results for News Corp and for our group companies.
Overall, revenues in fiscal '21 rose 4% and by 30% in the fourth quarter, that is 30%, indicating that the company is surely gaining in momentum, while profitability improved by 26% for the year. We have continued to focus our investment on growth areas, with the acquisition of Investor's Business Daily, Mortgage Choice in Australia and the Books & Media division of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. We have also continued to simplify the business with the rationalization of REA's Asian property business and the amicable settlement of residual litigation regarding News America Marketing, which we successfully sold just ahead of fiscal '21.  
Our strong cash generation has given us increased optionality. Our cash balance exceeded $2.2 billion at the end of June. And so we were able to take advantage of the required sale of Opus which we expect to strengthen and ultimately transform the Dow Jones' Professional Information business. And our clearly robust cash position has prompted the company to actively review our capital returns policy with a greater focus on buybacks.  
A few highlights before delving deeper into the businesses. For fiscal 2021, we had a record number of digital subscriptions at our key mastheads. Record traffic at realtor.com, where audience growth, according to comScore, is significantly outpacing that of its main rival, and record subscriber growth at Foxtel, where at the end of June, our paid streaming subscribers reached over 2 million, an increase year-on-year of 155%, a profound escalation that included the successful launch of Binge last year. That success has naturally given us much optionality as we consider Foxtel's rather favorable future. In short, we had the most profitable year since we created the new News Corp. Dow Jones had its most profitable year since it was acquired in 2007, and HarperCollins and Move also recorded their most profitable years, and we believe there is clearly more growth ahead.  
The past year has seen the revaluing of our content through landmark news payment agreements with the major tech platforms. These deals, the financial terms of which are confidential, will add significant revenue annually, clearly into 9 figures and are a profoundly important part of the ongoing transformation of the content landscape. We are also watching the evolution of the digital ad market, which historically has lacked transparency, the active interest of regulators around the world should reduce the opacity and provide higher yields for publishers.  
At Dow Jones, subscriber growth continued to pace, leading to a significant increase in segment EBITDA for the fourth quarter and for the year, up 15% and 41%, respectively. The full year segment EBITDA was indeed the most lucrative since the company's acquisition. Digital consumer subscriptions, which were 26% higher in the quarter, contributed to that growth as did an overall increase in advertising revenues for the year of 4% as a surge in digital ads more than compensated for a decline in print advertising.  
At The Wall Street Journal, subscriptions grew 15% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, reaching nearly 3.5 million, and digital-only subs growing by nearly 100,000 from the third quarter and by 21% year-over-year, now comprise nearly 80% of total subscriptions. 
Advertising in the fourth quarter rose 45% and digital advertising was 53% higher. 
It is worth highlighting the success of our Risk & Compliance business, particularly as we contemplate the future potential of the just announced agreement to acquire Opus. Revenues at Risk & Compliance increased 23% for the fiscal year and burgeoned by 30% in the fourth quarter compared to a year earlier, marking 6 straight years of over 20% growth. 
We believe that the Professional Information business will continue to expand at a strong rate, and that Opus will be the cornerstone for commodities, energy and renewables digital business that will have a long-term positive impact on our earnings. We are excited to be adding a new growth lever to Dow Jones, whose performance has manifestly been exceptional. We firmly believe Opus and Dow Jones will be more than the sum of their parts.  
Our acquisition of Investor's Business Daily was completed in May, and we expect to see the positive impact of this high-margin digital operation in coming quarters. We believe that there are multiple opportunities to cross-sell and upsell products as IBD will benefit from Dow Jones reach and Dow Jones will prosper from IBD's range of high-value specialist investment offerings. We are confident that Almar Latour and the team at Dow Jones are poised to deliver ongoing excellent results.  
The Foxtel narrative is particularly positive as our early emphasis on streaming and on securing long-term valuable sports and entertainment rights has put the company on a decidedly upward trajectory. Our paying subscribers were 40% higher and fiscal year revenue rose 10%, while our EBITDA growth was 11%. There was a noticeable acceleration in revenue growth in the fourth quarter when it surged 33%, driven by our streaming products and thanks in part to positive currency fluctuations. 
The strong growth in the streaming business, which is taking advantage of and successfully monetizing existing rights was evident in the fourth quarter with the number of total paying streaming subscribers was 155% higher than at the same time last year. We are obviously pleased with the exponential evolution of both Kayo, our sports streaming product, which has rights to Australia's most popular sports, and Binge, our entertainment streaming service, as they combine world-class technology, clever user interfaces and high-quality compelling content.  
It is worth pausing for a moment to consider how the Foxtel narrative has changed decisively and positively over the past 18 months. Then we were being asked whether we would need to put extra funds into Foxtel. And now we have attractive options for a growing, thoroughly contemporary business that has a tangible upside. Our immediate task and that of our team led admirably by Siobhan McKenna and Patrick Delany is to keep driving the business to keep striving because those options will certainly be enhanced by continued success.  
Digital Real Estate is another fast-growing sector for the company, and we are proud of the performance of both REA and REALTOR. Many of you will recall, there was a certain skepticism when we acquired Move, the realtor.com parent, a certain doubt about our ability to turn around the company's then flagging fortunes. Well, there's no overstatement to say there has been a realtor renaissance with fiscal 2021 profit contribution from Move increasing by $100 million as its revenue scaled.  
For the year, revenue grew by 36% and the rate accelerated to 68% in the fourth quarter. Audience numbers hit record highs during the quarter. As measured by the independent comScore, audience growth has exceeded that of Zillow and Trulia for 17 successive months, an average more than 20 percentage points faster in the last 8 months. That is a telling testament to the great work by Tracey Fellows, David Doctorow and to all at REALTOR.  
The 2 core pillars of the REALTOR business, the premium referral model and lead generation, have both reported superlative growth. And those who watch the industry closely will have noted that a key indicator, the number of houses listed for sale has increased in the past 2 months. The more inventory on the market, the more opportunities for the REALTOR team to deliver their best-in-class services to buyers, sellers and agents.  
Our REA had a supernal year with revenue growth of 27%, benefiting from currency and a robust housing recovery in Australia. Revenue growth actually accelerated in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, again, listings were a key driver of that success with full year listing 15% higher, while those in the fourth quarter surged 54%. One of the absolute lessons of the pandemic is that families and investors have focused on property as both a source of returns but also of enduring security. The [aloha] of real estate is real and the profits are palpable.  
Meanwhile, we are expanding into sensible adjacencies, in particular, mortgages, which will also benefit from the renewed flow of listings. Smartline is already thriving, and Owen Wilson and the team are confident that Mortgage Choice will benefit from that increased activity by offering borrowers the best possible range of loans. We look forward to updating you in coming quarters with the progress at both Mortgage Choice and Smartline.  
HarperCollins is another resilient source of revenue growth, profits and cash generation for the company. Revenue for the full year rose 19%, while segment EBITDA was 42% higher as the company benefited from digital sales, the rediscovery of books as a medium and an extensive lucrative backlist. For example, the company has certainly profited from the immense popularity of Bridgeton, the eponymous Netflix series, which has been extended into a second season to the benefit of Julia Quinn's novels and HarperCollins. The company's prospects and its backlist have been bolstered by the addition of the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Books & Media segment, which has a living library of 7,000 titles including the perennially popular George Orwell and Curious George.  
We also acquired the U.S. rights to J.R.R. Tolkien's works, including the Hobbit and the Lord of Rings trilogy, and now have global English language rights, which will surely benefit from the upcoming blockbuster Amazon series based on those classic  perdurable books. 
Brian Murray and the HarperCollins team have focused on driving digital and direct-to-consumer offerings, and it is worth noting that e-book sales rose 14% during the year, while audio books expanded a healthy 22%. Clearly, there is much interest by various podcast-related companies in our unique audio book offerings, and we stand to gain from the proliferation of streaming audio. 
For those of you who have perused our numbers, it is clear that there has been a strong improvement in the profitability of the News Media businesses with News U.K., News Corp Australia and the New York Post, all performing admirably and contributing to News Corp's overall enhanced profitability. There was disciplined cost control and sage leadership throughout those businesses and a strong recovery in advertising during the fourth quarter.  
In the U.K., our businesses delivered a significant profit contribution for the year, with digital subscriptions increasing markedly and listening at wireless rising sharply during the European football championships with advertising benefiting accordingly. And we look forward with alacrity to the launch of the Premier League season next week. The Sun remains the country's largest digital news brand and advertising revenue across the properties in the U.K. rebounded in the fourth quarter compared to a year earlier. That rebound is a sign that reach, engagement and provenance are important to advertisers and that our U.K. media companies, under Rebekah Brooks' leadership, provide a uniquely effective forum.  
At News Corp Australia where Michael Miller and the team took the bold and necessary decision to convert most of our regional and community papers to digital-only platforms, we saw a 25% increase in digital subscribers at the mastheads in the fourth quarter, while there was a healthy recovery in advertising. Clearly, businesses are subject to the vagaries of the virus in Australia, but the robust recovery in recent months is a hopeful harbinger. 
The New York Post was on the very cusp of making an annual profit for the first time in many decades, perhaps for the first time since the age of Alexander Hamilton, which is testament to the epoch work of Sean Giancola, Keith Poole and all of the Post. The Post was a digital success in fiscal '21, generating 45% digital ad growth, including an acceleration in the fourth quarter with 65% growth. That is 65% growth. And we should harvest further savings from the exiting of our Bronx printing plant, which is attracting much demand from companies seeking this prime side.  
I would like to thank all who have printed and distributed the Post in Dow Jones publications through the decades. They provided a great service to the company and to society by delivering news and insight every morning around the Greater New York region. All of our employees deserve gratitude for their stellar contributions, both for the company and their communities over the past complicated, sometimes stressful year. Their efforts have been a crucial part of our unprecedented success and provided a firm foundation for ongoing revenue growth and increasing profitability.  
As I mentioned earlier, we are generating record profits and cash, and that has given us the ability to make opportunistic acquisitions to bolster the company and generate even more momentum. We will certainly be thoughtful and strategic in deploying our assets and will, as always, be cognizant of our responsibility to and the interest of all of our shareholders.  
And now I hand you over to Susan Panuccio, who will provide more salient details about an extraordinary year."

Fiscal 2021 fourth quarter total revenues were almost $2.5 billion, up 30%, the highest level since the second quarter of fiscal 2019 when we still owned News America Marketing.

Fiscal 2021 fourth quarter total revenues were almost $2.5 billion, up 30%, the highest level since the second quarter of fiscal 2019 when we still owned News America Marketing. Total segment EBITDA was $210 million, up 8% versus the prior year, including record high segment EBITDA at Digital Real Estate Services. Total segment EBITDA included several nonrecurring items that depressed year-over-year comparisons this quarter, including $49 million of nonrecurring legal settlement and transaction costs. The results also include $11 million of one-off costs at Foxtel, which I'll come back to.  
Excluding the divestment of News America Marketing, acquisitions, currency fluctuations and the other items disclosed in our release, adjusted revenues increased 20% and adjusted total segment EBITDA increased 26%, driven by a strong performance of Digital Real Estate Services and a big year-over-year improvement in News Media. For the quarter, we reported a net loss per share of $0.02 compared to a loss of $0.67 in the prior year. Last year's loss included $292 million of noncash impairment charges, primarily related to fixed assets in the U.K. and Australia.  
Fiscal 2021 results included a $64 million tax benefit due to an adjustment to valuation allowance in the U.S. and a $54 million noncash write-down of Foxtel's investment related to the Nickelodeon Australian joint venture, which is now covered through a separate affiliate agreement. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.16 in the quarter compared to a loss per share of $0.03 in the prior year. 
Importantly, on a full year basis, free cash flow available to News Corp improved to $731 million from $180 million in the prior year, driven by higher total segment EBITDA, improvements in working capital and lower capital spending.  
Moving on to the results for the individual reporting segments, starting with Digital Real Estate Services. Segment revenues were $413 million, an increase of 74% compared to the prior year, a sharp acceleration from the third quarter growth rate of 34%. The performance was driven by another record quarterly performance at Move, together with very strong results at REA and to a lesser extent, a positive impact from foreign currency fluctuations. On an adjusted basis, revenues increased 59%. Segment EBITDA rose 92% to $136 million or 99% on an adjusted basis. 
Move's revenues were $186 million, a 68% increase year-over-year with real estate revenues rising 77%, a significant acceleration from the 43% growth in the prior quarter. Move contributed $17 million to the segment EBITDA growth this quarter, achieving strong profit improvements despite $30 million of additional marketing expenses consistent with our commentary that the bulk of the expected increase in cost the second half would materialize in the fourth quarter. 
For the full fiscal 2021 year, Move increased its profit contribution by $100 million and was the single biggest profit driver across News Corp this year. We saw accelerated revenue growth across both the traditional lead generation and referral businesses in the quarter. The traditional lead generation business continued to benefit from strong agent demand, improved retention rates, higher yield and lead volume growth. Revenues from the referral business represented approximately 30% of total Move revenues, up from 25% in the prior quarter, partly due to seasonality with revenue growth driven by an increase in lead volume, record home pricing and higher referral fees.  
In addition, advertising and rental revenue also showed strength during the quarter with the combined revenues more than doubling versus the prior year, only partially offset by the lower revenues resulting from the sale of top producer in the third quarter. 
The realtor.com's traffic reached a quarterly record of 106 million average monthly users, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 32%. Lead volume grew 14% year-over-year, a slower growth rate than the prior quarter as we lapped tougher comparisons with the prior year, which saw growth rates in the mid-30s coupled with ongoing industry supply constraints. Compared to the prior quarter, lead volume grew 8%.  
REA had an exceptional quarter with revenues rising 79% year-over-year to $227 million, including a $34 million or 27% positive impact from currency fluctuations. REA's results benefited from a material increase in residential premier debt revenues despite the absence of a price increase this fiscal year as part of REA's prior year COVID-19 support initiatives. 
Australian national residential new buy listings for the quarter rose 54% with Melbourne and Sydney both up 64% as growth rates were somewhat exaggerated by the impacts from COVID-19 last year. 
Listing volumes were not only higher than the prior year, but also higher than fiscal 2019 and 2018 levels. Traffic remained robust with total visits to realestate.com.au for June at 123 million, up 8% year-over-year, and the visits multiplier against its nearest competitor reaching a record high of over 3.4x in June. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for more details.  
Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $542 million, up 33% versus the prior year and included an $85 million or 21% positive impact from foreign currency fluctuations. The growth rate also improved sequentially. Adjusted revenues increased 12% with higher revenues from the streaming products more than offsetting the revenue declines from the broadcast product in the quarter, helped by the COVID-19 comparison. 
Total closing paid subscribers across Foxtel reached nearly 3.9 million as of June 30, with total subscriptions, including trialists, over 4 million and were up 40% versus the prior year, a material acceleration from the third quarter driven by continued growth in paid streaming subscribers and a year-over-year recovery in commercial, which was hit particularly hard from COVID-19 last year. Sequentially, paid subscribers rose 10%.  
Kayo total subscribers increased to almost 1.1 million and Binge total subscribers increased to 827,000. In the aggregate, total streaming subscribers reached over 2.1 million with paying subscribers up more than 150% to just over 2 million. Streaming products are now delivering meaningful growth at scale and over 50% at Foxtel's total paid subscribers are now on streaming platforms. 
Residential broadcast subscribers declined to less than 1.7 million and commercial subscribers, while growing sharply year-over-year, continued to be impacted by COVID-19 restrictions and further lockdowns, notably in the accommodation sector. We saw broadcast churn moderate from the past 2 quarters to 17.1%, but up from 13.2% in the prior year, with the team continuing their focus on retaining high-value subscribers and driving ARPU growth. ARPU increased 4% to AUD 81 from the prior year, partially offsetting broadcast subscriber volume declines.  
Segment EBITDA declined 37% to $66 million or 46% on an adjusted basis. As we communicated in our prior call, the decline was largely timing related, driven by $84 million of higher sports programming rights and production costs in the quarter, which we didn't have in the prior year due to COVID-19, together with higher marketing expenses. 
In addition, Foxtel had approximately $11 million of one-time costs, mainly related to iQ3 and iQ4 promotional activity. Importantly, looking at Subscription Video Services for the full year, segment EBITDA increased 11% and was relatively stable in local currency, which includes the impact of $57 million of sports rights costs that were deferred from last year. The business also generated meaningful free cash flow across the year as increasing scale in streaming is leading to improved financial momentum within the company and lower capital intensity.  
Moving on to Dow Jones. Dow Jones delivered revenue of $449 million, up 18% compared to the prior year, including 2 months of revenue from the acquisition of Investor's Business Daily with digital revenues accounting for 72% of total revenues this quarter. Circulation and subscription revenues increased $34 million or 11%, driven by a 12% increase in circulation revenues, reflecting the continued strong growth in digital-only subscription for Dow Jones consumer products and the acquisition of IBD.  
Dow Jones subscriptions increased to over 4.5 million average subscriptions to its consumer products in the quarter, up 19% from the prior year. Of that, nearly 3.5 million were digital-only subscriptions, up 26% year-over-year. IBD had over 100,000 subscriptions at quarter end with the majority being digital-only.  
Professional Information business revenues rose 11%, driven primarily by Risk & Compliance. Revenue growth from Risk & Compliance accelerated yet again with a year-over-year increase of 30% and marked the fastest growth in 3 years. For the year, Risk & Compliance reached approximately $195 million of revenues, up 23%. Advertising revenues, which accounted for 23% of revenues this quarter, grew 45% to $103 million, the highest fourth quarter growth rate since News Corp's acquisition and was also higher than the fourth quarter fiscal 2019.  
Digital advertising posted record growth with revenues up 53%, with all categories performing above expectations. We saw a significant increase in yield, particularly in direct display. Print advertising revenues rose 36% year-over-year, primarily benefiting from the COVID-19 comparison. Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter rose 15% to $69 million. EBITDA margins were relatively stable year-over-year as higher revenue growth was partially offset by the timing of marketing expenses for both brand and conferences, IBD integration costs and higher compensation costs. Costs were also notably depressed in the prior year due to COVID-19-related savings initiatives.  
As we previously communicated, much of the cost increase this quarter were planned investments with some timing-related items. Dow Jones achieved the highest level of profitability since its acquisition this fiscal year, with margins expanding to nearly 20%, up almost 5 percentage points from the prior year. On an adjusted basis, segment revenues and EBITDA for the quarter rose 14% and 12%, respectively.  
At Book Publishing, for the fourth quarter, HarperCollins posted 21% revenue growth from the prior year and segment EBITDA rose 2%. Adjusted revenues grew 11% and adjusted segment EBITDA was flat to the prior year. The moderation in growth was impacted by the lapping of COVID-19 benefits in the prior year and mix of titles as last year's results included the Magnolia Table Volume II. 
Despite a difficult prior year comparison, book consumption levels remain high. Fourth quarter continued to benefit from Bridgeton but to a lesser extent than the prior quarter. While physical sales continued their momentum this quarter, digital revenues declined 3% in the quarter, reflecting a difficult comparison to the prior year when many bricks-and-mortar stores were closed due to COVID-19. E-book sales fell 11% in the quarter, but were partly offset by 11% growth in downloadable audio.  
This quarter's results also include almost 2 months of results from the acquisition of the HMH Books & Media segment. We're excited about the acquisition and feel very confident about achieving the cost synergy target of $20 million within 2 years, and the team are actively exploring revenue opportunities, notably in licensing and animation.  
Turning to News Media. Revenues for the quarter were $595 million, up 21% versus the prior year, driven by the recovery of the advertising market from COVID-19-related weaknesses in the prior year. Growth in circulation and subscription revenues and a $73 million or 14% positive impact from foreign currency fluctuations. Growth was partially offset by a $58 million or 12% negative impact from the divestiture of News America Marketing in May 2020. On an adjusted basis, revenues rose 21% as we cycled the steep declines from COVID-19 last year. 
Circulation and subscription revenues rose 26%, driven by a $34 million or 15% benefit from currency fluctuations, strong digital paid subscriber growth and cover price increases as well as the recovery of print volumes from COVID-19-related weakness in the prior year. 
Advertising revenues increased $31 million or 15% compared to the prior year, benefiting from the COVID-19 comparison with strong gains in both print and digital advertising revenues across key mastheads as well as a $29 million or 14% increase from foreign currency. Those gains came despite a $58 million or 28% negative impact related to the divestment of News America Marketing and a $10 million or 5% negative impact related to the closure or transition to digital of certain regional and community newspapers in Australia.  
On a reported basis, advertising revenues in Australia rose 34% or 14% in local currency, while News U.K. advertising revenues rose 86% or 65% in local currency. In the U.S., the trends remained strong with the New York Post posting 60% advertising revenue growth, of which digital advertising grew 65%. Segment EBITDA for the quarter was breakeven compared to a loss of $44 million in the prior year.  
In the Other segment, fourth quarter results include nonrecurring legal settlement costs. Excluding that charge, costs were modestly higher than we had expected, primarily driven by higher equity compensation across both cash and noncash expenditure.  
I would now like to talk about some themes for the upcoming quarter and fiscal 2022. Visibility remains limited, especially in Australia due to ongoing COVID-19 lockdowns. That said, we are very encouraged by our July trends and are looking to build on that momentum into fiscal 2022. Our Digital Real Estate Services, as noted in their release, revenue in fiscal 2022 will benefit from a price rise in July for REA, and they also noted that new buy listings declined 3% in the month. Results will also include the acquisition of Mortgage Choice. Please refer to REA's press release for more details.  
At Move, we continue to see strong pricing in agent demand despite ongoing supply constraints. Like the fourth quarter, we expect to balance reinvestments with revenue growth as we focus on expanding into adjacencies.  
In Subscription Video Services, we are pleased with the ongoing performance of Kayo and Binge and the efforts to improve broadcast ARPU. We do expect a modest impact in the first quarter due to the current lockdowns in Australia, particularly in commercial venues. For the year, we expect costs in local currency to be stable with fiscal 2021 and revenue trends to continue to improve as the streaming products continue to scale.  
At Dow Jones, overall trends across the business remains strong. We expect costs to increase as we focus on top line growth, but we will remain focused on margin expansion. Dow Jones will also see incremental content licensing revenues from Google.  
In Book Publishing, overall trends remain favorable despite lapping the benefits from COVID-19. While publishing faces a difficult comparison given its fiscal 2021 performance, we remain very encouraged by HarperCollins strong release slate and favorable secular trends. We also expect to see additional contribution from the acquisition of HMH.  
At News Media, we expect the segment to show notable improvement in fiscal 2022, driven by the contributions from the deals with Google and Facebook, improving advertising trends and disciplined cost action.  
CapEx for the year is expected to be approximately $100 million higher in fiscal 2022, partly driven by higher technology costs and the rollout of the IP-enabled iQ5 set-top box at Foxtel. We will continue to manage spend closely throughout the year as we did during fiscal 2021.  
And finally, free cash flow generation will remain a priority in the coming year. The company ends the year stronger, better capitalized and with new levers of growth. We're excited about the potential for our recent acquisitions, including our announcement this week on Opus. And as Robert mentioned, we are now actively reviewing our capital allocation policy as we look to balance reinvestment and growth with healthy shareholder returns.  
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

On buybacks, obviously, we're indicating that there's a more vigorous, livier discussion about capital allocation. For a start, we have more capital to allocate, given the strong cash generation in the company over the past year and for the foreseeable future. The acquisition of Opus does not change that thinking, which is at an advanced stage. So I'll reiterate what we said earlier, we are actively reviewing our capital returns policy with a greater focus on buybacks. 
As for REALTOR, REALTOR really is at a very early stage of its exponential evolution. The growth over the past year has come despite a relative paucity of listings. And the encouraging sign is the level of listings is on the rise again, and the immutable laws of supply and demand, as always, is beginning to take effect. And it is worth reiterating that we've grown faster than Zillow and Trulia, as measured independently for 17 successive months, and in the past 8 months, that growth has exceeded 20 percentage points. And that is a profound transformation and surely indicates that the fundamentals are favorable."

We are journeying through the contours of a complex commercial landscape that has been a sterling test of the metal of companies and countries. For us,  the first quarter was the most profitable of its kind since the relaunch of News Corp",1669,"Thank you, Mike. We are journeying through the contours of a complex commercial landscape that has been a sterling test of the metal of companies and countries. For us,  the first quarter was the most profitable of its kind since the relaunch of News Corp in 2013, continuing the trends that were evident in the last financial year and building on those rapid rates of growth. 
And we continue to have much confidence in our immediate and long-term prospects. I would like to honor the work done by our employees around the world. They have coped with extraordinary exigencies and provided a profound service to their customers and to their communities. That  the company's purpose has endured and indeed thrived through such challenging times is a tribute to [ Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch ] and the culture they created and have curated. 
Revenues for the quarter were $2.5 billion, an increase of 18%, while our profitability rose 53%. I should repeat that figure for clarity. Profitability rose 53%. It is worth bearing in mind that this increase follows a 21% increase in profitability in the first quarter last year. Every one of our key operating segments posted significant revenue expansion and strong segment EBITDA growth. 
I would like to reiterate that our Board authorized a $1 billion stock repurchase program in September. As we previously indicated, we have refrained from executing on the buyback during this quiet period, but that period officially ends in coming days. It is a very different buyback to that which was approved in 2013 when we were unsure about share dislocation at the time of the separation from Fox. 
We now have confidence in our performance, our resilience, our ability to generate cash for our investors and our potential. Bolstering that confidence is the fact that our recent acquisitions are exceeding our expectations and our core segments are thriving. We now have an optionality across the businesses and significantly more flexibility in our ability to return capital to our investors. 
One noteworthy sign of that optionality is our ability to capitalize on the patent success of the Foxtel streaming strategy, which was highlighted during the Foxtel Strategy Day. We have been working through the potential permutations and we'll continue to provide updates as appropriate. In the meantime, it is worth noting that Subscription Video Services segment EBITDA rose a rather healthy 46% in the first quarter. 
As for our campaign to hold big digital accountable, clearly, there have been pronounced and profound developments in recent times. We are pleased with the agreements we have reached and the work that has progressed on revaluing content. But we have always regarded the digital ad market as a separate issue and the release of an unredacted complaint by the Texas Attorney General last month has highlighted the extent of the problem. The manipulative language was deeply concerning. We are obviously considering our position on this important matter and want to ensure that in the future, the [ Admark ] properly recognized the value of our audience and of our inventory. 
Now turning to the first quarter. Dow Jones recorded a 15% increase in revenues compared to the same quarter last year, with segment EBITDA surging 32%. That profitability was a record for the first quarter. Revenue at Risk & Compliance grew 26%, meaning that we have had 25 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. 
Overall, the Professional Information business experienced a solid 13% increase in revenues, and that should expand when we complete the acquisition of Opus, which is expected to close early next calendar year. 
The past few weeks have highlighted the importance of intelligence about energy and carbon markets, and we fully expect to become a world leader in that area. 
Advertising at Dow Jones expanded a first quarter record of 29%, with digital advertising climbing 38%. Meanwhile, subscription growth remains robust, with an 18% increase across our consumer products to approximately $4.6 million with circulation revenues rising approximately 13%. The ongoing transformation of Dow Jones continues at pace, with digital now accounting for 75% of the segment's revenues. 
Digital Real Estate Services was again a source of express growth, with Move, the operator of realtor.com, seeing revenues surge 30%. The U.S. housing market is sturdy with price rises moderating, more properties coming to the market and longer listing times, all of which work in our favor. 
As for the house flipping flip flop, by Zillow, we have always been focused on the digital market, not on bricks and mortar and certainly not on sorting out the septic tank or papering over wall cracks. We concentrated on our core competency and never took on excessive balance sheet risk or chased what appeared to us to be very low margin returns. 
It appears Zillow finally understands what we always knew to be true. That said, as an open platform, we do see opportunities to be a marketplace for the industry, including iBuyers such as Opendoor, providing them with the same kind of dependable and trusted information that agents and consumers alike have valued. 
In Australia, REA had a remarkable first quarter, with revenues burgeoning 62%. That is correct, 62%. Australia has slowly been emancipated from severe lockdowns and access to homes for sale has been limited. So we believe that positive market conditions will likely continue as the country returns to a semblance of normalcy. One harbinger is that site traffic was strong in Q1 with 129 million average visits, up 13% year-over-year. That is essentially an average of 5 visits for every person in the country. 
Our book business is thriving and even more so with the successful integration of [ HMH. ] Excluding the $50 million contribution of HMH, book sales have reset in the post-pandemic period to around 22% higher than the same period in 2019. There has been a resurgence of interest in printed books as their tactility and telematic quality is increasingly important at a time when many people have screen fatigue. 
We saw notable success in Q1 with the Bridgerton series, the Authoritarian Moment by Ben Shapiro and [ The Chalice ] by Daniel Silver. In the months ahead, we have high hopes for the Pioneer Woman Cooks Super Easy by Ree Drummond, The Storyteller by Dave Grohl, and Gangster Granny Strikes Again by David Williams. 
In Subscription Video Services, the first quarter built on the significant progress made in FY '21 in reshaping the Foxtel Group as a streaming led business with improved revenues, profitability and cash generation. For the second consecutive quarter, growth in Kayo and Binge revenues clearly offset the not unexpected modest decline in retail broadcast revenues. 
As of September 30, total subscribers were approximately $4 million, up 18% year-over-year. This includes a record 2.2 million total streaming subscribers, up 68%, thanks to Kayo and Binge. 
While there will always be a certain seasonality in sports viewing in Australia, Kayo is quickly establishing itself as a year-round provider as it now offers 50 sports in total and is furnishing and engaging off-season programming for the football tragics ahead of the new season early next year. 
Foxtel's appeal was further broadened with the launch of the flash streaming news service, featuring a non-par collection of 20 local and global news sources with content for all political persuasions. That breadth combined with a cutting-edge, world-class user interface adds to the luster of Foxtel and is indicative of its renaissance. We are now obviously in a position to be even more ambitious for Foxtel and are always seeking to maximize its undoubted potential. 
News Media was a strong contributor to News Corp profitability this quarter with segment EBITDA of $34 million in the quarter after a loss in the same period last year. That is a tribute to Rebecca Brooks, Michael Miller and Sean Giancola and their talented, committed teams. The transformation was in part due to the benefits of our deals with the major platforms, notably Google and Facebook. Together, these deals will contribute annual revenues in the 9 figures to News Corp, clearly putting our news businesses on a more profitable part. 
Despite the success of lockdowns, our Australian business is faring well, showing significant improvement in profitability, thanks to cost initiatives and rising digital advertising revenues and -- subscriptions, which improved to 850,000, up 24% year-over-year. News U.K. performed admirably, particularly in advertising, both digital and print and in subscriptions. The Times and Sunday Times contributed meaningfully to profits, and their digital paid subscriptions have now reached 380,000. 
Wireless, our radio network increased its revenue and profit contribution, with exclusive football broadcasts drawing large audiences and increased advertising -- reported record reach of 6 million unique listeners per week according to the most recent -- survey. Our broadcast expertise is assisting our other media properties in the U.K. and will complement Talk TV which is scheduled to launch in the early months of 2022, with Pierce Morgan taking a global role across our broadcast and news properties. We believe Talk TV will be contemporary, low cost and high impact. 
In the U.S., the New York Post once legendarily loss-making is now contributing to segment profitability and is an increasingly important voice in the national political debate. Its digital network reached 151 million unique users in September, almost half of the U.S. population according to Google Analytics. 
Digital advertising revenue was 28% higher compared to the same quarter last year, and print advertising increased 62%, recovering from the COVID-related lows of last year. The company built on its momentum from last fiscal in the first quarter, and we remain optimistic about growth prospects going forward. Clearly, there are macroeconomic pressures affecting certain companies, but our increasingly digital orientation has bolstered our ability to weather the pandemic and deal with the economic uncertainty in some of our markets. We are confident in our employees, confident in our businesses and very confident in our prospects. 
And now for further details and invaluable insight, I -- the floor to Susan Panuccio."
212741644,1686331573,2426223,"News Corporation, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","News Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Robert. As Robert mentioned, strong operating momentum that made last year so successful has continued into our first fiscal quarter results. Fiscal 2022 first quarter total revenues were over $2.5 billion, up 18%, marked by higher revenue grow",2113,"Thank you, Robert. As Robert mentioned, strong operating momentum that made last year so successful has continued into our first fiscal quarter results. Fiscal 2022 first quarter total revenues were over $2.5 billion, up 18%, marked by higher revenue growth across all our key segments, notably at digital real estate services. 
Total segment EBITDA was $410 million, up 53% versus the prior year, the highest quarterly growth rate since 2017 despite the challenges from the lockdowns in Australia and comparing against 21% total segment EBITDA growth in the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, currency fluctuations and other items disclosed in the release, adjusted revenues and adjusted total segment EBITDA rose 10% and 47%, respectively. 
Reported EPS was $0.33 as compared to $0.06 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.23 in the quarter compared to $0.08 in the prior year. 
Moving on to the results for the individual reporting segments, starting with Digital Real Estate Services. Segment revenues were $426 million, an increase of 47% compared to the prior year. On an adjusted basis, revenues increased 29%. Segment EBITDA rose 16% to $138 million or 21% on an adjusted basis despite the higher investment spending at Move and REA and tough comparisons against the prior year cost declines implemented to counter the impact of COVID. 
Move's revenues were $180 million, a 30% increase year-over-year with real estate revenues rising 39% and accounting for 87% of total revenues. Revenue growth was again led by the traditional lead generation business benefiting from strong agent demand and improved sell-through and yields. 
We are also seeing early success with the rollout of Market VIP, a hybrid product offered to Move top-performing agents. The referral model saw strong revenue growth and accounted for approximately 32% of revenues driven by record home values and increased transaction volume. 
Revenue growth was partially offset by the divestiture of top producer in March, negatively impacting revenues by $5 million or 4 percentage points. With home prices at record highs and supply limited, lead volumes fell approximately 18% compared to over 40% growth last year, albeit with leads still around 15% higher than pre-pandemic levels. Encouragingly, new listings are up from their recent lows, and we have seen moderation of lead volume declines in September and October. 
Pricing remains robust given strong agent demand. REA had an exceptional quarter with revenues rising 62% year-over-year to $246 million, including a $7 million or 3% positive impact from currency fluctuations.  Results benefited from $43 million of contribution from the Mortgage Choice acquisition and $8 million from the consolidation of Elara, which has been rebranded to REA India. 
The underlying performance was very encouraging with Australian residential revenue growth driven by an increase in debt penetration, price increase and favorable product mix. The revenue growth was also driven by an 11% increase in new buy listings despite lockdowns across multiple states, including restrictions on physical inspections in Melbourne. Melbourne listings rose 79%, while Sydney fell 7%. 
Financial Services also benefited from higher settlements and submissions. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call following this call for more details. 
Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $510 million, up 3% versus the prior year, benefiting from higher streaming revenues and the modest benefit from positive currency fluctuations, partially offset by lower broadcast and commercial subscription revenues. On an adjusted basis, revenues were flat. 
Total closing paid subscribers across Foxtel reached nearly $3.9 million as of quarter end, up 17% year-over-year with total subscribers, including trailers approximately $4 million. The increase was driven by continued growth in paid streaming subscribers, partially offset by a decline in broadcast subscribers and commercial subscriptions, which were exacerbated by the impact of the lockdown in Australia. 
Kayo and Binge ended the quarter with approximately 1.1 million and 885,000 total subscribers, respectively. In the aggregate, total paying streaming subscribers were up more than 69% to nearly 2.1 million and total streaming subscribers, including trialists, reached over 2.2 million. Streaming products in the aggregate reached approximately 54% of Foxtel's total paid subscriber base. 
Broadcast churn improved, declining to 14% from 14.6% last year and 17.1% in the fourth quarter. Broadcast ARPU increased 4% from the prior year to AUD 82, mitigating subscriber volume declines consistent with Foxtel's strategy of focusing on higher ARPU subscribers and fewer low-cost offers. 
Foxtel continues to see an improvement in subscriber mix as the percentage of higher valued, longer tenured subscribers continues to rise with a corresponding decline in churn rates. Net declines for residential broadcast subscribers moderated sequentially with 1.6 million broadcast subscribers at quarter end. Commercial subscribers were down over 30% from the fourth quarter to 162,000 and we do anticipate a recovery for commercial subscribers in the second half with the easing of restrictions. 
Product innovation continued with the launch of iQ5, an IP-enabled set-top box, the announcement of plans to partner with Comcast and Sky on the launch of Sky Glass and the launch of a third streaming product a dedicated live new streaming service featuring more than 20 local and global live new services. 
Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $114 million, up 46% compared to the prior year. The improvement was primarily driven by $34 million of lower sports costs benefiting from the $36 million of negative impact seen in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 related to deferred sports cost from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. 
Adjusted segment EBITDA increased 42%. Moving on to Dow Jones. Dow Jones delivered revenue of $444 million, up 15% compared to the prior year, with digital revenues accounting for 75% of total revenues this quarter, up 2 percentage points from the prior year. Adjusted revenues, which notably excludes the impact of IBD rose 9%. As Robert mentioned, both revenues and profitability were the highest first quarter results since its acquisition. 
Circulation and subscription revenues increased 12%, including 13% circulation revenue growth, primarily reflecting the acquisition of IBD and the continued strong volume gains in digital-only subscriptions. Dow Jones subscriptions to its consumer products increased to an average of approximately $4.6 million in the quarter, up 18% from the prior year. Of that, over 3.6 million were digital-only subscriptions, up 24% year-over-year. IBD accounted for 100,000 digital-only subscriptions and 128,000 in total subscriptions. 
Professional information business revenues rose 13%, accelerating from the prior quarter. Revenue growth from Risk and Compliance increased 26% driven by a higher entry rate and strong growth across the Americas, Europe and Asia. We also saw modest improvement at both Factiva and -- advertising revenues, which accounted for 20% of revenues this quarter grew 29% to $90 million, the highest first quarter growth rate since acquisition. 
Digital advertising trends remained robust up 38% on top of 14% growth in the first quarter of the prior year and accounted for 61% of total advertising revenues. All categories performed above expectations, most notably in technology and finance, and we continue to see improving yields. Print advertising revenues were robust, rising 17% year-over-year, partially benefiting from the COVID-19 comparison. 
Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter rose 32% to $95 million, with EBITDA margins improving by almost 3 percentage points to 21% despite an 11% increase in total cost which included IBD and higher employee costs. 
On an adjusted basis, segment revenues and EBITDA for the quarter rose 9% and 24%, respectively. 
At Book Publishing, HarperCollins posted 19% revenue growth to $546 million, and segment EBITDA rose 20% to $85 million adjusted revenue and EBITDA rose 7% and 10%, respectively, versus the prior year. Despite a difficult prior year comparison, book consumption levels remain elevated, overall consumption across the industry remains higher than pre-pandemic levels and materially above the historical low single-digit type revenue growth. 
This quarter benefited from a rebound in Christian Publishing, which was more exposed to the closure of retail stores in the prior year and higher sales in the U.K. General book saw healthy growth, benefiting from new releases, coupled with higher backless sales from the Bridgerton series by Julia Quinn. 
Digital sales rose 5% this quarter and accounted for 21% of consumer sales. The backlist represented 62% of revenues, up 2 percentage points from last year, underscoring the importance of this steady, high-margin revenue stream and a key factor behind the acquisition of HMH. 
HMH integration continues to progress well and is in the process of being integrated into a 4 in print structure within HarperCollins. We remain on track with our savings target of $20 million to be delivered within the first 2 years. Overall, HMH contributed $50 million in revenue and $6 million in segment EBITDA this quarter. 
Turning to News Media. Revenues for the quarter were $576 million, up 18% versus prior year, benefiting from the continued recovery in the advertising market, strong growth in circulation and subscription revenues and a $25 million or 5% positive impact from foreign currency fluctuations. 
Within the segment, revenues at News UK and News Corp Australia increased 18% and 14%, respectively. Wireless Group and the New York Post also showed strong top line growth. Adjusted revenues for the segment increased 13% compared to the prior year. 
Circulation and subscription revenues rose 16%, which included a $13 million or 5% benefit from currency fluctuations, strong digital subscriber growth, incremental revenues from our platform agreements and cover price increases. 
Advertising revenues increased $39 million or 21% compared to the prior year, benefiting from the COVID-19 comparison with particular strength in digital across all businesses. On a reported basis, advertising revenues in Australia rose 5% or 2% in local currency despite the negative impact from the lockdowns, while News U.K. advertising revenues rose 36% or 28% in local currency. 
In the U.S., the trends remained strong with the New York Post posting 32% advertising revenue growth. Segment EBITDA of $34 million increased $56 million compared to the prior year, reflecting higher revenues, cost savings at News UK and News Corp Australia and a modest positive contribution from the New York Post. Adjusted segment EBITDA increased $52 million to $30 million. 
I would now like to talk about some themes for the upcoming quarter. Notwithstanding our strong results in the prior year, we remain encouraged by overall trends. Like many companies, we are closely monitoring supply chain issues, particularly in book publishing and our mastheads as well as the impact of wage inflation on talent and retention. 
At Digital Real Estate Services, Australian residential listings for October rose 16%, and we are encouraged that restrictions on physical inspections, notably in Melbourne have eased. 
At Move, we continue to see strong yield improvement despite the near-term challenge on lead volume given the ongoing supply issues. Like the first quarter, we expect to continue to reinvest in Move as we drive the core business and expand into relevant adjacencies. The rate of cost increase year-on-year in the first quarter was exacerbated by the COVID-19 savings initiatives in the prior year across headcount and marketing. We expect more moderate year-over-year cost increases for the balance of the year. 
In Subscription Video Services, we remain pleased with the ongoing performance of Kayo and Binge and the efforts to improve broadcast ARPU and churn. We do expect seasonality in Kayo given the end of key winter codes but look forward to our summer schedule with the Ashes and the Cricket World Cup in the second quarter. Costs are expected to be higher in the second quarter, most notably for entertainment and sports rights as well as some higher marketing to support the launch of Flash, the new streaming offering. Overall, we continue to expect costs for the full year to be relatively stable in local currency. 
At Dow Jones, overall trends across the business remains strong with advertising and subscriptions growth continuing to perform well. 
In Book Publishing, overall trends remain favorable despite lapping the benefits from COVID-19. We have a strong release lineup in the second quarter, including titles from -- Mitch Albom and David Wellins. 
At News Media, we continue to expect the segment to show profit improvement, partially benefited from the recent content licensing revenues. We do expect some additional costs in the U.K. as we expand more into video content and leverage our key brands and -- heads. CapEx was modestly higher in the first quarter, and we continue to expect full year CapEx to be up $100 million versus the prior year. And finally, we remain focused on driving strong and positive free cash flow generation for the year, with the first quarter free cash flow impacted by the timing of working capital payments. 
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

And then secondly, just I know, Robert, you mentioned Zillow winding down the iBuyer model. Do you expect to see any impact on Move? I mean, could that perhaps get Zillow closer to just an agent who perhaps have been disenfranchised by a move? Any comments would be helpful."
212741644,1686331573,2426223,"News Corporation, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","News Corporation","Executives","On Foxtel, look, it's inappropriate at this moment to discuss specific to the review. But clearly, we and our partners at Telstra recognize that the prospects of Foxtel have changed fundamentally, that we have a streaming success story. Look, we have cutt",612,"On Foxtel, look, it's inappropriate at this moment to discuss specific to the review. But clearly, we and our partners at Telstra recognize that the prospects of Foxtel have changed fundamentally, that we have a streaming success story. Look, we have cutting edge, world-class tech and we have a user interface that is vastly improved, and we have a talented team led by Patrick and Chivor and that will drive further success more surely. 
Think about how the narrative has changed over the past 2 years. As you'll recall, we had been asked by the skeptics whether we would need to put more money into the company. And let's examine what happened. We took a majority stake because we believed more clarity, more responsibility, more decisiveness was necessary. We've used our media platforms to complement and promote the quality of Foxtel. Our team made some tough decisions to rationalize, made some smart decisions on streaming and systems and here we are today. So whatever we do, we will not be naive. Naivety is not in our nature. 
And as for Zillow, obviously, we had discussed ourselves getting into bricks and mortar, but we had a very clear sense of the digital priorities. Don't forget that we had revived, renovated the distinctly unfashionable realtor.com. We bought it on the cheap, net-net, about $700 million. What's it worth now? $6 billion, $7 billion, what will be worth in 5 years -- digital march continues? $15 billion, $20 billion, more. 
So we've been very focused diligently so to service for vendors, buyers and realtors. As for Zillow, look, the idea that it was simple to find a great plumber, plus or a plant, the idea that prices were not variable, subject to the -- the idea that holding inventory was not itself costly, to me, those were rather strange ideas. 
I'm not sure what impact eventually when Zillow makes up its mind what type of business it is, they will have on the market, but I can talk from a macro perspective. First of all, very confident in realtors prospects but also very confident in the U.S. real estate market generally. It's a marketing transition and the laws of supply and demand still apply. If prices are too high, two things will happen. Buyers will start hesitating more sellers will appear on the market the immutable way of the world. And I suspect we are very much in a moment of such transition, which is good for realtor. 
Of course, interest rates will be a factor. But over the foreseeable future, we're still talking about either historic lows or near historic lows. And more significantly for us, we're seeing a more enduring trend starting to take hold. There was a myth that millennials would not want to own their own home, that there would be a WeWork version of home, we home or the car sharing that we wouldn't mind sharing bathrooms and lounges. 
Well, that myth has been well and truly debunked. COVID coziness is not really a theme. Work from home implies that you have a home. And I do recommend a Sage article this week in Barrons on that subject. So some of the myths of the supposed share economy have certainly been shattered. 
So price increases are moderating. Interest rates are relatively low. In the U.S., the eviction moratorium is mostly over time and the market gradually increasing. Our massive increases in audience traffic, 30% to 40% more than pre COVID and leads 15% to 20% above pre-pandemic levels, all tell us that there is deep demand and ensure we're rather excited about realtor's prospects now and far into the future."

You're seeing a lot of hard work done by our teams in being very diligent about cost but also being focused on growth. 
Certainly, the big digital deals will make a difference to all of our publications. And frankly, all we can say, given the constraints of confidentiality is that the deals mean that comfortably over 9 figures are flowing into the news companies in return for the highest quality new services in 3 separate continents, though unfortunately, we are yet to reach agreement with Facebook or the artist formerly known as Facebook in the U.K. 
But we are watching closely the evolution of possible legislation there that channels the Australian legislation, which would be handy. With Google as well, it's not just about payments. It also means working together on new products in audio and video, and that's the content side. And those are productive discussions. 
A less ideal, and it applies to both companies, is the ad tech conundrum. We have always kept the ad tech issue to one side as I strongly believe that there were 2 components in need of resolution, the value of content and digital ad dysfunction. I was fairly confident there would be document discovery and the Texas Attorney General's complaint has revealed some of the rather disturbing details. And I have little doubt that the Department of Justice will add to that detail in coming days. Now how we resolve these issues does indeed remain to be seen."

We are journeying through the contours of a complex commercial landscape that has been a sterling test of the mettle of companies and countries. For us, the first quarter was the most profitable of its kind since the relaunch of News Corp",1662,"Thank you, Mike. We are journeying through the contours of a complex commercial landscape that has been a sterling test of the mettle of companies and countries. For us, the first quarter was the most profitable of its kind since the relaunch of News Corp in 2013, continuing the trends that were evident in the last financial year and building on those rapid rates of growth.
And we continue to have much confidence in our immediate- and long-term prospects. 
I would like to honor the work done by our employees around the world. They have coped with extraordinary exigencies and provided a profound service to their customers and to their communities. That the company's purpose has endured and indeed thrived through such challenging times is a tribute to Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch and the culture they created and have curated. 
Revenues for the quarter were $2.5 billion, an increase of 18%, while our profitability rose 53%. I should repeat that figure for clarity. Profitability rose 53%. It is worth bearing in mind that this increase follows a 21% increase in profitability in the first quarter last year. Every one of our key operating segments posted significant revenue expansion and strong segment EBITDA growth. 
I would like to reiterate that our Board authorized a $1 billion stock repurchase program in September. As we previously indicated, we have refrained from executing on the buyback during this quiet period, but that period officially ends in coming days. It is a very different buyback to that which was approved in 2013 when we were unsure about share dislocation at the time of the separation from Fox. 
We now have confidence in our performance, our resilience, our ability to generate cash for our investors and our potential. Bolstering that confidence is the fact that our recent acquisitions are exceeding our expectations, and our core segments are thriving. We now have an optionality across the businesses and significantly more flexibility in our ability to return capital to our investors. 
One noteworthy sign of that optionality is our ability to capitalize on the patent success of the Foxtel streaming strategy, which was highlighted during the Foxtel Strategy Day. We have been working through the potential permutations, and we'll continue to provide updates, as appropriate. In the meantime, it is worth noting that Subscription Video Services segment EBITDA rose a rather healthy 46% in the first quarter. 
As for our campaign to hold big digital accountable, clearly there have been pronounced and profound developments in recent times. We are pleased with the agreements we have reached and the work that has progressed on revaluing content, but we have always regarded the digital ad market as a separate issue, and the release of an unredacted complaint by the Texas Attorney General last month has highlighted the extent of the problem. The manipulative language was deeply concerning. We are obviously considering our position on this important matter and want to ensure that, in the future, the ad market properly recognize the value of our audience and of our inventory. 
Now turning to the first quarter. Dow Jones recorded a 15% increase in revenues compared to the same quarter last year with segment EBITDA surging 32%. That profitability was a record for the first quarter. Revenue at Risk and Compliance grew 26%, meaning that we have had 25 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth. 
Overall, the Professional Information Business experienced a solid 13% increase in revenues, and that should expand when we complete the acquisition of OPIS, which is expected to close early next calendar year. 
The past few weeks have highlighted the importance of intelligence, about energy and carbon markets, and we fully expect to become a world leader in that area. 
Advertising at Dow Jones expanded a first quarter record of 29% with digital advertising climbing 38%. Meanwhile, subscription growth remains robust with an 18% increase across our consumer products to approximately $4.6 million with circulation revenues rising approximately 13%. The ongoing transformation of Dow Jones continues at pace with digital now accounting for 75% of the segment's revenues. 
Digital Real Estate Services was again a source of express growth with Move, the operator of realtor.com, seeing revenues surge 30%. The U.S. housing market is sturdy with price rises moderating, more properties coming to the market and longer listing times, all of which work in our favor. 
As for the house flipping -- flip flop by Zillow, we have always been focused on the digital market, not on bricks and mortar, and certainly not on sorting out the septic tank or papering over wall cracks. We concentrated on our core competency and never took on excessive balance sheet risk or chased what appeared to us to be very low margin returns. It appears Zillow finally understands what we always knew to be true. That said, as an open platform, we do see opportunities to be a marketplace for the industry, including iBuyer, such as Opendoor, providing them with the same kind of dependable and trusted information that agents and consumers alike have valued. 
In Australia, REA had a remarkable first quarter with revenues burgeoning 62%. That is correct, 62%. Australia has slowly been emancipated from severe lockdowns, and access to homes for sale has been limited. So we believe that positive market conditions will likely continue as the country returns to a semblance of normalcy. One harbinger is that site traffic was strong in Q1 with 129 million average visits, up 13% year-over-year. That is essentially an average of 5 visits for every person in the country. 
Our book business is thriving and even more so with the successful integration of HMH. Excluding the $50 million contribution of HMH, book sales have reset in the post-pandemic period to around 22% higher than the same period in 2019. There has been a resurgence of interest in printed books as their tactility and talismanic quality is increasingly important at a time when many people have screen fatigue. We saw notable success in Q1 with the Bridgerton Series, the Authoritarian Moment by Ben Shapiro and The Cellist by Daniel Silva. In the months ahead, we have high hopes for The Pioneer Woman Cooks-Super Easy! by Ree Drummond, The Storyteller by Dave Grohl and Gangsta Granny Strikes Again! by David Williams. 
In Subscription Video Services, the first quarter built on the significant progress made in FY '21 in reshaping the Foxtel Group as a streaming-led business with improved revenues, profitability and cash generation. For the second consecutive quarter, growth in Kayo and Binge revenues clearly offset the not unexpected modest decline in retail broadcast revenues. As of September 30, total subscribers were approximately 4 million, up 18% year-over-year. This includes a record 2.2 million total streaming subscribers, up 68%, thanks to Kayo and Binge. 
While there will always be a certain seasonality in sports viewing in Australia, Kayo is quickly establishing itself as a year-round provider as it now offers 50 sports in total and is furnishing and engaging off-season programming for the football tragics ahead of the new season early next year. 
Foxtel's appeal was further broadened with the launch of the Flash streaming news service, featuring a nonpareil collection of 20 local and global news sources with content for all political persuasions. That breadth, combined with a cutting-edge, world-class user interface, adds to the luster of Foxtel and is indicative of its renaissance. We are now obviously in a position to be even more ambitious for Foxtel and are always seeking to maximize its undoubted potential. 
News Media was a strong contributor to News Corp profitability this quarter with segment EBITDA of $34 million in the quarter after a loss in the same period last year, thus is a tribute to Rebekah Brooks, Michael Miller and Sean Giancola and their talented, committed teams. The transformation was, in part, due to the benefits of our deals with the major tech platforms, notably Google and Facebook. Together, these deals will contribute annual revenues in the 9 figures to News Corp, clearly putting our news businesses on a more profitable part.
Despite the success of lockdowns, our Australian business is faring well, showing significant improvement in profitability, thanks to cost initiatives and rising digital advertising revenues and news masthead subscriptions, which improved to 850,000, up 24% year-over-year. 
News UK performed admirably, particularly in advertising, both digital and print and in subscriptions. The Times and Sunday Times contributed meaningfully to profits, and their digital paid subscriptions have now reached 380,000.
Wireless, our radio network, increased its revenue and profit contribution with exclusive football broadcasts drawing large audiences and increased advertising. Wireless reported record reach of 6 million unique listeners per week according to the most recent RAJAR survey. 
Our broadcast expertise is assisting our other media properties in the U.K. and will complement talkTV, which is scheduled to launch in the early months of 2022, with Pierce Morgan taking a global role across our broadcast and news properties. We believe talkTV will be contemporary, low cost and high impact. 
In the U.S., the New York Post, once legendarily loss making, is now contributing to segment profitability and is an increasingly important voice in the national political debate. Its digital network reached 151 million unique users in September, almost half of the U.S. population according to Google Analytics. Digital advertising revenue was 28% higher compared to the same quarter last year, and print advertising increased 62%, recovering from the COVID-related lows of last year. 
The company built on its momentum from last fiscal in the first quarter, and we remain optimistic about growth prospects going forward. Clearly, there are macroeconomic pressures affecting certain companies, but our increasingly digital orientation has bolstered our ability to weather the pandemic and deal with the economic uncertainty in some of our markets. We are confident in our employees, confident in our businesses and very confident in our prospects. 
And now for further details and invaluable insight, I yield the floor to Susan Panuccio."
212741644,1686331573,2426553,"News Corporation, Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","News Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Robert. As Robert mentioned, strong operating momentum that made last year so successful has continued into our first fiscal quarter results. Fiscal 2022 first quarter total revenues were over $2.5 billion, up 18%, marked by higher revenue grow",2111,"Thank you, Robert. As Robert mentioned, strong operating momentum that made last year so successful has continued into our first fiscal quarter results. Fiscal 2022 first quarter total revenues were over $2.5 billion, up 18%, marked by higher revenue growth across all our key segments, notably at Digital Real Estate Services. 
Total segment EBITDA was $410 million, up 53% versus the prior year, the highest quarterly growth rate since 2017 despite the challenges from the lockdowns in Australia and comparing against 21% total segment EBITDA growth in the prior year. Excluding acquisitions, currency fluctuations and other items disclosed in the release, adjusted revenues and adjusted total segment EBITDA rose 10% and 47%, respectively. 
Reported EPS was $0.33 as compared to $0.06 in the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.23 in the quarter compared to $0.08 in the prior year. 
Moving on to the results for the individual reporting segments, starting with Digital Real Estate Services. Segment revenues were $426 million, an increase of 47% compared to the prior year. On an adjusted basis, revenues increased 29%. Segment EBITDA rose 16% to $138 million or 21% on an adjusted basis despite the higher investment spending at Move and REA and tough comparisons against the prior year cost declines implemented to counter the impact of COVID. Move's revenues were $180 million, a 30% increase year-over-year with real estate revenues rising 39% and accounting for 87% of total revenues. Revenue growth was again led by the traditional lead generation business benefiting from strong agent demand and improved sell-through and yields. 
We are also seeing early success with the rollout of Market VIP, a hybrid product offered to Move's top-performing agents. The referral model saw strong revenue growth and accounted for approximately 32% of revenues driven by record home values and increased transaction volume. 
Revenue growth was partially offset by the divestiture of Top Producer in March, negatively impacting revenues by $5 million or 4 percentage points. With home prices at record highs and supply limited, lead volumes fell approximately 18% compared to over 40% growth last year, albeit with leads still around 15% higher than pre-pandemic levels. Encouragingly, new listings are up from their recent lows, and we have seen moderation of lead volume declines in September and October. Pricing remains robust given strong agent demand. 
REA had an exceptional quarter with revenues rising 62% year-over-year to $246 million, including a $7 million or 3% positive impact from currency fluctuations. Results benefited from $43 million of contribution from the Mortgage Choice acquisition and $8 million from the consolidation of Elara, which has been rebranded to REA India. 
The underlying performance was very encouraging with Australian residential revenue growth driven by an increase in debt penetration, price increase and favorable product mix. The revenue growth was also driven by an 11% increase in new buy listings despite lockdowns across multiple states, including restrictions on physical inspections in Melbourne. Melbourne listings rose 79%, while Sydney fell 7%. Financial services also benefited from higher settlements and submissions. Please refer to REA's earnings release and their conference call, following this call for more details. 
Turning to the Subscription Video Services segment. Revenues for the quarter were $510 million, up 3% versus the prior year, benefiting from higher streaming revenues and a modest benefit from positive currency fluctuations, partially offset by lower broadcast and commercial subscription revenues. On an adjusted basis, revenues were flat. 
Total closing paid subscribers across Foxtel reached nearly 3.9 million as at quarter end, up 17% year-over-year with total subscribers, including trialists, approximately 4 million. The increase was driven by continued growth in paid streaming subscribers, partially offset by a decline in broadcast subscribers and commercial subscriptions, which were exacerbated by the impact of the lockdowns in Australia. 
Kayo and Binge ended the quarter with approximately 1.1 million and 885,000 total subscribers, respectively. In the aggregate, total paying streaming subscribers were up more than 69% to nearly 2.1 million, and total streaming subscribers, including trialists, reached over 2.2 million. Streaming products in the aggregate reached approximately 54% of Foxtel's total paid subscriber base. 
Broadcast churn improved, declining to 14% from 14.6% last year and 17.1% in the fourth quarter. Broadcast ARPU increased 4% from the prior year to AUD 82, mitigating subscriber volume declines consistent with Foxtel's strategy of focusing on higher ARPU subscribers and fewer low-cost offers. 
Foxtel continues to see an improvement in subscriber mix as the percentage of higher-valued, longer-tenured subscribers continues to rise with a corresponding decline in churn rates. Net declines for residential broadcast subscribers moderated sequentially with 1.6 million broadcast subscribers at quarter end. Commercial subscribers were down over 30% from the fourth quarter to 162,000, and we do anticipate a recovery for commercial subscribers in the second half with the easing of restrictions. 
Product innovation continued with the launch of iQ5, an IP-enabled set-top box; the announcement of plans to partner with Comcast and Sky on the launch of Sky Glass and the launch of a third streaming product, Flash, a dedicated live news streaming service, featuring more than 20 local and global live news services. 
Segment EBITDA in the quarter was $114 million, up 46% compared to the prior year. The improvement was primarily driven by $34 million of lower sports costs benefiting from the $36 million of negative impact seen in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 related to deferred sports cost from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. Adjusted segment EBITDA increased 42%. 
Moving on to Dow Jones. Dow Jones delivered revenue of $444 million, up 15% compared to the prior year, with digital revenues accounting for 75% of total revenues this quarter, up 2 percentage points from the prior year. Adjusted revenues, which notably excludes the impact of IBD, rose 9%. As Robert mentioned, both revenues and profitability were the highest first quarter results since its acquisition. 
Circulation and subscription revenues increased 12%, including 13% circulation revenue growth, primarily reflecting the acquisition of IBD and the continued strong volume gains in digital-only subscriptions. Dow Jones subscriptions to its consumer products increased to an average of approximately 4.6 million in the quarter, up 18% from the prior year. Of that, over 3.6 million were digital-only subscriptions, up 24% year-over-year. IBD accounted for 100,000 digital-only subscriptions and 128,000 in total subscriptions. 
Professional Information Business revenues rose 13%, accelerating from the prior quarter. Revenue growth from Risk and Compliance increased 26% driven by a higher entry rate and strong growth across the Americas, Europe and Asia. We also saw modest improvement at both Factiva and Newswires.
Advertising revenues, which accounted for 20% of revenues this quarter grew 29% to $90 million, the highest first quarter growth rate since acquisition. Digital advertising trends remained robust, up 38% on top of 14% growth in the first quarter of the prior year, and accounted for 61% of total advertising revenues. All categories performed above expectations, most notably in technology and finance, and we continue to see improving yields. Print advertising revenues were robust, rising 17% year-over-year, partially benefiting from the COVID-19 comparison. 
Dow Jones segment EBITDA for the quarter rose 32% to $95 million, with EBITDA margins improving by almost 3 percentage points to 21% despite an 11% increase in total cost, which included IBD and higher employee costs. On an adjusted basis, segment revenues and EBITDA for the quarter rose 9% and 24%, respectively. 
At Book Publishing, HarperCollins posted 19% revenue growth to $546 million, and segment EBITDA rose 20% to $85 million. Adjusted revenue and EBITDA rose 7% and 10%, respectively, versus the prior year. Despite a difficult prior year comparison, book consumption levels remain elevated. Overall consumption across the industry remains higher than pre-pandemic levels and materially above the historical low single-digit type revenue growth. 
This quarter benefited from a rebound in Christian Publishing, which was more exposed to the closure of retail stores in the prior year and higher sales in the U.K. General book saw healthy growth, benefiting from new releases, coupled with higher backlist sales from the Bridgerton Series by Julia Quinn. 
Digital sales rose 5% this quarter and accounted for 21% of consumer sales. The backlist represented 62% of revenues, up 2 percentage points from last year, underscoring the importance of this steady, high-margin revenue stream and a key factor behind the acquisition of HMH. 
HMH integration continued to progress well and is in the process of being integrated into a 4-imprint structure within HarperCollins. We remain on track with our savings target of $20 million to be delivered within the first 2 years. Overall, HMH contributed $50 million in revenue and $6 million in segment EBITDA this quarter. 
Turning to News Media. Revenues for the quarter were $576 million, up 18% versus the prior year, benefiting from the continued recovery in the advertising market, strong growth in circulation and subscription revenues and a $25 million or 5% positive impact from foreign currency fluctuations. 
Within the segment, revenues at News UK and News Corp Australia increased 18% and 14%, respectively. Wireless Group and the New York Post also showed strong top line growth. Adjusted revenues for the segment increased 13% compared to the prior year. 
Circulation and subscription revenues rose 16%, which included a $13 million or 5% benefit from currency fluctuations, strong digital subscriber growth, incremental revenues from our platform agreements and cover price increases. 
Advertising revenues increased $39 million or 21% compared to the prior year, benefiting from the COVID-19 comparison with particular strength in digital across all businesses. On a reported basis, advertising revenues in Australia rose 5% or 2% in local currency despite the negative impact from the lockdowns, while News UK advertising revenues rose 36% or 28% in local currency. 
In the U.S., the trends remained strong with the New York Post posting 32% advertising revenue growth. Segment EBITDA of $34 million increased $56 million compared to the prior year, reflecting higher revenues, cost savings at News UK and News Corp Australia and a modest positive contribution from the New York Post. Adjusted segment EBITDA increased $52 million to $30 million. 
I would now like to talk about some themes for the upcoming quarter. Notwithstanding our strong results in the prior year, we remain encouraged by overall trends. Like many companies, we are closely monitoring supply chain issues, particularly in book publishing and our mastheads, as well as the impact of wage inflation on talent and retention. 
At Digital Real Estate Services, Australian residential listings for October rose 16%, and we are encouraged that restrictions on physical inspections, notably in Melbourne, have eased. 
At Move, we continue to see strong yield improvement despite the near-term challenge on lead volume given the ongoing supply issues. Like the first quarter, we expect to continue to reinvest in Move as we drive the core business and expand into relevant adjacencies. The rate of cost increase year-on-year in the first quarter was exacerbated by the COVID-19 savings initiatives in the prior year across headcount and marketing. We expect more moderate year-over-year cost increases for the balance of the year. 
In Subscription Video Services, we remain pleased with the ongoing performance of Kayo and Binge and the efforts to improve broadcast ARPU and churn. We do expect seasonality in Kayo given the end of key winter codes but look forward to our summer schedule with The Ashes and the Cricket World Cup in the second quarter. Costs are expected to be higher in the second quarter, most notably for entertainment and sports rights, as well as some higher marketing to support the launch of Flash, the news streaming offering. Overall, we continue to expect costs for the full year to be relatively stable in local currency. 
At Dow Jones, overall trends across the business remains strong with advertising and subscriptions growth continuing to perform well. 
In Book Publishing, overall trends remain favorable despite lapping the benefits from COVID-19. We have a strong release lineup in the second quarter, including titles from Ree Drummond, Mitch Albom and David Walliams.
At News Media, we continue to expect the segment to show profit improvement, partially benefiting from the recent content licensing revenues. We do expect some additional costs in the U.K. as we expand more into video content and leverage our key brands and mastheads. CapEx was modestly higher in the first quarter, and we continue to expect full year CapEx to be up $100 million versus the prior year. And finally, we remain focused on driving strong and positive free cash flow generation for the year with the first quarter free cash flow impacted by the timing of working capital payments. 
With that, let me hand it over to the operator for Q&A."

But clearly, we and our partners at Telstra recognize that the prospects of Foxtel have changed fundamentally and that we have a streaming success story. Look, w",621,"Entcho, on Foxtel, look, it's inappropriate at this moment to discuss specific to the review. But clearly, we and our partners at Telstra recognize that the prospects of Foxtel have changed fundamentally and that we have a streaming success story. Look, we have cutting-edge, world-class tech, and we have a user interface that is vastly improved. And we have a talented team led by Patrick and Siobhan, and that will drive further success most surely. 
Think about how the narrative has changed over the past 2 years. As you'll recall, we had been asked by the skeptics whether we would need to put more money into the company. And let's examine what happened. We took a majority stake because we believed more clarity, more responsibility, more decisiveness was necessary. We've used our media platforms to complement and promote the quality of Foxtel. Our team made some tough decisions to rationalize, made some smart decisions on streaming and systems, and here we are today. So whatever we do, we will not be naive. Naivety is not in our nature. 
And as for Zillow, obviously, we had discussed ourselves getting into bricks and mortar, but we had a very clear sense of the digital priorities. Don't forget that we had revived, renovated the distinctly unfashionable realtor.com. We bought it on the cheap, net-net, about $700 million. What's it worth now? $6 billion, $7 billion. What will it be worth in 5 years as the inevitable digital march continues? $15 billion, $20 billion, more. So we've been very focused diligently so to service for vendors, buyers and realtors. 
As for Zillow, look, the idea that it was simple to find a great plumber, plus a plant or a planter; the idea that prices were not variable, subject to vicissitudes; the idea that holding inventory was not itself costly, to me, those were rather strange ideas. 
I'm not sure what impact eventually, when Zillow makes up its mind what type of business it is, they will have on the market, but I can talk from a macro perspective. First of all, very confident in REALTOR's prospects but also very confident in the U.S. real estate market generally. It's a market in transition, and the laws of supply and demand still apply. If prices are too high, two things will happen: buyers will start hesitating, more sellers will appear on the market. It's the immutable way of the world. And I suspect we are very much in a moment of such transition, which is good for REALTOR. 
Of course, interest rates will be a factor. But over the foreseeable future, we're still talking about either historic lows or near historic lows. 
And more significantly, for us, we're seeing a more enduring trend starting to take hold. There was a myth that millennials would not want to own their own home, that there would be a WeWork version of home, WeHome; or that car sharing meant that we wouldn't mind sharing bathrooms and lounges. Well, that myth has been well and truly debunked. COVID coziness is not really a theme. Work from home implies that you have a home. And I do recommend a Sage article this week in Barron's on that subject. So some of the myths of this supposed share economy have certainly been shattered. 
So price increases are moderating. Interest rates are relatively low. In the U.S., the eviction moratorium is mostly over, time and the market gradually increasing, our massive increases in audience traffic, 30% to 40% more than pre-COVID and leads 15% to 20% above pre-pandemic levels all tell us that there is deep demand and ensure we're rather excited about REALTOR's prospects now and far into the future. Thank you, Entcho."

And frankly, all we can say, given the constraints of confidentiality, is that the deals mean that comfortably over 9 figures are flowing into the news companies in return for the highest-quality news services in 3 separate continents. Though, unfortunately, we are yet to reach agreement with Facebook or the artist formerly known as Facebook in the U.K. But we are watching closely the evolution of possible legislation there that channels the Australian legislation, which would be handy. 
With Google as well, it's not just about payments. It also means working together on new products, in audio and video. That's the content side. And those are productive discussions. 
Less ideal, and it applies to both companies, is the ad tech conundrum. We have always kept the ad tech issue to one side, as I strongly believe that there were 2 components in need of resolution: the value of content and digital ad dysfunction. I was fairly confident there would be document discovery, and the Texas Attorney General's complaint has revealed some of the rather disturbing details. And I have little doubt that the Department of Justice will add to that detail in coming days. Now how we resolve these issues does indeed remain to be seen."

And I think the Foxtel team did a great job of talking about this at the Strategy Day around the great content they have within sports, particularly the AFL, the NRL and the cricket contracts that they have. They have long-term relationships with the studios and have developed a very good working relationships with them. And they're a great aggregator of the services down there. So I think whilst there is clearly competition that is coming into that marketplace down there, they are operating very well within that current environment."

My first question, you've talked about, in relation to a question from one of the other guys on the phone, that you're -- an ongoing review of Foxtel from a strategic standpoint.

And so I'm wondering if there's any other ongoing reviews going on with the company. 
And my other just nitpick question. You usually tell us what the change is year-over-year on EBITDA at realtor.com. Can you provide that for the quarter, please?"

As you know, we've sold quite a few companies along the way. The local newspaper business at Dow Jones, which we presumed would struggle, didn't turn out to be the case; Amplify, which found a bit of home; News America Marketing, which was less meaningful to us as print sales declined somewhat; Unruly, which has found a welcome home elsewhere and with whom we still have a relationship. But ad tech, per se, is for others. 
So we will constantly be institutionally introspective, reviewing our structure, whether Foxtel or Digital Real Estate, or as we've done to designate Dow Jones as a separate segment so that you can see, not only the potential there, but also to be clear about the very positive progress that the team is making in News Media. We've made many changes. Those changes have been productive and profitable, and we will never stop questioning or challenging ourselves."

That quiet period is almost over, and you will soon hear the sound of buyback. 
The pacing depends on being rational about the trends in the market, but this is a very different buyback to that initiated at the time of the split. As you know well, at that moment, we were worried about unexpected share dislocation and wanted to provision to intervene, if and when necessary, during that unprecedented, unpredictable period. 
Now we're an entirely different epoch. The company patently has momentum. We are confident about our cash generation potential, our ability to both invest to grow and to return capital. So as I mentioned, now that the quiet period is almost over, you will soon hear the sound of buyback."
