I will walk through today's agenda in a moment. But before I do that, I want to briefly discuss the press release we issued on Monday, February 1. 
As we announced last month, we received an unsolicited and nonbinding proposal from Atos to purchase DXC. Our Board reviewed the proposal carefully with our financial and legal advisers and found it to be inadequate in lacking certainty, given the value our Board believes we can create on a stand-alone basis by executing on our transformation journey. After sharing some high-level information with Atos to help them understand why their proposal undervalued DXC, Atos and DXC agreed to discontinue further discussions. 
We are confident in our transformation journey, and our Q3 results show strong evidence that our team is executing. We are flattered that Atos saw the value we are creating and clearly has taken notice of our new leadership team and how we are delivering for our customers and winning in the market. I was pleased with how we managed the proposal as it did not linger, we stayed focused on our business and it helped highlight some areas where we can accelerate our transformation journey and create additional value. With the new leadership team in place, I'm looking forward to sharing the details of our FY '22 full year plan and longer-term expectations on our Q4 earnings call. We are also planning an Investor Day to discuss in more detail our plans and introduce you to our leadership team. 
Now let me turn to today's agenda. I will start by giving you a quick update on our strong Q3 performance. Next, I will highlight the progress we are making on our transformation journey. Our strong Q3 results were driven by executing against the 3 key areas of our transformation journey, which are focused on customers, optimize cost and seize the market. I will then hand the call over to our new CFO, Ken Sharp, to share our detailed Q3 financial results and guidance for Q4. Finally, I will make some closing remarks before opening the call up for questions. 
Regarding our Q3 performance, our revenues were $4.29 billion, approximately $90 million above the top end of our guidance. This is the second straight quarter of revenue stabilization, and we expect this trend to continue in Q4. Our sequential revenue stabilization is positive evidence that we will achieve year-on-year revenue stability. 
Concerning adjusted EBIT margin, we delivered 7%, also higher than the top end of our guidance. Like revenue, we expect margins to continue to expand in Q4. 
Book-to-bill for the quarter was 1.13, underscoring the success of bringing the new DXC, which focuses on our customers and people to the market. This is the third straight quarter that we've delivered a 1.0 or better book-to-bill, and we also expect this trend to continue in Q4. 
I'm pleased about the level of stability and momentum we are achieving. We have done well at attracting talent, improving the environment for our people, strengthening our customer relationships, taking out cost without disruption and continuing to win in the market. 
Now before I go through the progress of our transformation journey, I would like to comment on 2 recent hires that have allowed me to finalize our new leadership team. We completed our CFO search and hired Ken Sharp. Ken returns to DXC after being the CFO of Northrop Grumman's Defense Systems business. Prior to that, Ken was SVP of Finance at Orbital ATK and has over a decade of experience in our industry. Ken has a strong operational focus and has led large-scale finance transformations. These skills are important to us as we continue executing on our transformation journey. 
We also added Michael Corcoran to our team. Michael has joined us as Chief Strategy Officer and has a track record of transforming and growing businesses. Michael joins us from WPP, where he led strategy and operations. Prior to WPP, Michael was at Accenture, where he spent a number of years with me and created the strategy for Accenture operations. 
The amount of transformation and industry experience of this team is substantial, and they are the main reason for our strong execution and results. You will hear in a moment why Ken joined DXC and his comments concerning the opportunity to create value, do a really nice job capturing wide talent joins DXC. Now I will cover the good progress we are making on our transformation journey, starting with our customers. 
Our focus on customers continues to be the primary driver of revenue stabilization. As I've said time and time again, when we deliver for our customers and are seen as a trusted partner, customers are more likely to renew existing work and consider us for new work. 
Let me give you 2 good examples that have happened in Q3. Molson Coors renewed 2 pieces of work with us this quarter. The first is in application management, and the second is across multiple layers of the enterprise technology stack, including ITO, Modern Workplace, cloud and security. 
Next, our strong relationship and flexible delivery model led to an expanded agreement with Pacific Life Insurance, which includes application development and support for its retirement and life divisions, enabling them to reduce cost and improve efficiency. These are 2 perfect examples of the great job we're doing, strengthening our customer relationships and gives us confidence that we can continue to stabilize revenue. 
Now let me turn to our cost optimization program. We will achieve our goal of $550 million of cost savings this year. Our cost optimization program was responsible for our strong adjusted EBIT margin of 7% in Q3. We were able to expand margins despite a 200 basis point headwind from the sale of the U.S. State and Local Health and Human services business. We have done well optimizing our costs and continuing to deliver for our customers without disruption. 
Seize the market is the final area of our transformation journey. In this area, we are focused on cross-selling to our existing accounts and winning work with new customers. The 1.13 book-to-bill number that we delivered this quarter is consistent evidence that our plan is working. In Q3, 55% of our bookings were new work and 45% were renewals. 
Let me give you a good example of new work with a new customer. We signed a 3-year deal with Ferrari, where we will modernize their IT platforms with services, including security and Modern Workplace. Our ability to deliver a consistent book-to-bill number of over 1.0 in the first 3 quarters of FY '21 is clear evidence that our transformation journey is not only working but we can absolutely win in the IT services market. 
Turning now to our health care provider software business. We are on track to complete the sale of this business and use the roughly $450 million of net proceeds to pay down debt, further strengthening our balance sheet. 
Now before I turn the call over to Ken, I would like to thank our people customers and shareholders for supporting us throughout our transformation journey. 
Now let me turn the call over to Ken."

Let me begin by saying how excited I am to join DXC and be part of the team that Mike has assembled. Let me provide you some insight into my thought process on why I joined, which came down to 3 main factors: the team Mike assembled the transformation journey and third, the investment thesis of how DXC would create value. After spending time with Mike and the team, I'm convinced that DXC can execute on the investment thesis I was contemplating. This includes stabilizing revenue, expanding margins and delivering free cash flow. When we achieve this thesis, I believe DXC will be successful in unlocking significant value. 
Now let me talk about the team Mike assembled. Let's face it, companies with the best people win. The strength of the team delivering on the transformation journey is clearly visible in our Q3 results. 
At DXC, there are 3 main areas that our finance team will focus on. First, we will work hard to demonstrate the true earnings power of DXC. We will focus on cash flow, paying particular attention to reducing outflows. 
We intend to continue investing in our people and delivering for our customers. At the same time, we will be disciplined in reducing spend in areas such as restructuring, transaction and integration, capital expenditures, excess facilities and our outsized overhead. 
In the earnings release today, you will see that we're providing organic revenue, something that we feel will help our investors better understand the underlying performance of the business. 
We believe we will create the most value by growing the underlying business. That means organic growth and at the same time, improving cash flow. 
Second, we are committed to putting in place a disciplined capital deployment program that will maximize the value creation of our cash flow engine. Based on rigorous analysis, we will carefully evaluate the returns associated with capital deployment options. 
Now that we've strengthened our balance sheet, we are turning to solidify our cash flow. With a strong balance sheet and a cash flow outlook, we will be in a position to execute a disciplined capital allocation program. 
Third, we will improve our financial visibility. We are committed to providing annual guidance and our longer-term expectations on our next earnings call. We are also planning an Investor Day to discuss in more detail our longer term plans and introduce you to our leadership. 
Moving on to our Q3 results. In the quarter, DXC exceeded the top end of our revenue, adjusted EBIT and non-GAAP EPS guidance. GAAP revenue was $4.29 billion and $88 million better than the top of our guidance range. 
Currency was a tailwind of $58 million sequentially and $118 million year-over-year. On an organic basis, revenue increased 1.7% sequentially. Organic revenue declined 10.5% year-over-year due to previously disclosed runoffs and terminations. We expect this to be the high watermark for organic year-over-year revenue declines. 
As you will see from our Q4 guidance, we expect to continue delivering stable sequential revenue. And during FY '22, we expect this to translate into year-over-year revenue stability. 
Adjusted EBIT was $300 million. Our adjusted EBIT margin was 7%, a sequential improvement of 80 basis points despite an approximate 200 basis point a headwind from the HHS sale. 
Non-GAAP income before taxes was $246 million. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.84 due to a lower-than-expected tax rate of 10.2%. Using our guidance tax rate of 30%, non-GAAP EPS was $0.65. This was a $0.10 -- this was $0.10 higher than the top end of our guidance range. 
Our Q3 tax rate primarily benefited from the reversal of certain tax reserves related to tax audits, the expectation of higher utilization of foreign net operating losses and the ability to utilize state tax credits related to the HHS sale. 
In Q3, bookings were $4.9 billion for a book-to-bill of 1.13. Like Mike mentioned earlier, we are encouraged to see 3 consecutive quarters with a book-to-bill greater than 1.0. 
Turning now to our segment results. The GBS segment, the top of our technology stack includes analytics and engineering, applications and the horizontal BPS business. The GBS segment previously included the HHS business, which we sold on October 1 and includes the health care provider software business, which we are in the process of selling. GBS revenue was $1.92 billion or 45% of our total Q3 revenue. Organic revenues increased 2.2% sequentially, primarily reflecting the strength of our analytics and engineering business. Year-over-year, GBS revenue was down 7% on an organic basis. GBS segment profit was $273 million and profit margin was 14.2%. Margins improved 10 basis points sequentially despite a headwind of about 300 basis points from the HHS sale. GBS bookings for the quarter were $2.7 billion for a book-to-bill of 1.35. 
Now turning to our GIS segment, which consists of IT outsourcing cloud and security and the Modern Workplace layers of our enterprise technology stack. 
Revenue was $2.37 billion, up 1.3% sequentially and down 13.2% year-over-year on an organic basis. GIS segment profit was $88 million with a profit margin of 3.7%, a 210 basis points margin expansion over Q2. GIS bookings were $2.2 billion or a book-to-bill of 0.95. 
Now before I discuss the details of the enterprise technology stack on Slide 13, I wanted to point out that there is no better slide that drives home the positive impact of our transformation journey. 
The proof points on the slide include continued revenue stabilization and strengthening of our book-to-bill for each layer of our stack that has been part of the transformation journey since Q1. As you can see in Q1, all 4 layers of our stack had negative sequential growth, whereas we are now reporting sequential growth improvement for all layers in Q3. Also, it is positive to see the revenue mix beginning to change in shifting up the stack. 
Now let me drill down one level to comment on the performance of the layers of our enterprise technology stack. IT outsourcing revenue was down 1.8% sequentially, an improvement as compared to Q2 where it was down 4.7%. ITO revenues declined 17.7% year-over-year due to the previously disclosed runoffs and terminations. Book-to-bill was 0.96 in the quarter. We believe building strong relationships with our ITO customers and delivering effective solutions will improve revenue performance. 
Cloud and security revenue was up 4.7% sequentially and down 1% year-over-year. Book-to-bill was 1.0 in the quarter. 
Moving up the stack, the applications layer posted 2.6% sequential revenue growth and was down 9.3% year-over-year. Book-to-bill was 1.5. 
Analytics and engineering was up 4.6% on a sequential basis and flat compared to the prior year. Analytics and engineering book-to-bill was 1.2 in the quarter. 
The Modern Workplace and BPS businesses increased 2.6% sequentially and was down 12.6% compared to the prior year. I should note that Q3 positively benefited from increased volume of resales. As you may recall, these 2 businesses were part of the strategic alternatives initiative and are just beginning their transformation journey. As a result, you should expect some unevenness in performance. 
Moving on to cash flows on Slide 14. Our cash flow from operations totaled an outflow of $187 million, and adjusted free cash flow for the quarter came in at negative $318 million. As discussed on our prior earnings call, we had cash disbursements of $332 million that impacted free cash flow related to the HHS sale. In addition, during the quarter, we normalized payments to our suppliers and partners. Our effort to normalize our supplier and partner payments is not expected to reoccur and had an approximate a $400 million negative cash flow impact in the quarter and $500 million negative cash flow impact through the first 3 quarters of our fiscal year. We believe treating our partners appropriately will allow us to further leverage the partner ecosystem. If these 2 items had not occurred, our free cash flow would have been more than $700 million higher in the quarter. 
The company has traditionally reported adjusted free cash flow that adjusts for capital expenditures, restructuring, transaction, separation and integration costs. We are considering changing our free cash flow presentation going forward. 
On Slide 15, we detail the efforts we have undertaken to strengthen our balance sheet. As we previously disclosed, we utilized $3.5 billion of net proceeds from our HHS sale to reduce debt. Additionally, we continue to make progress on our plan to sell our health care provider software business, and we will use the proceeds to pay down debt and further strengthen our balance sheet. 
Cash at the end of the quarter was $3.9 billion. Total debt, including capitalized leases was $6.2 billion for a net debt of $2.3 billion. We expect to make tax payments of approximately $900 million in Q4 related to our divestitures. 
I would like to emphasize our commitment to an investment-grade credit rating. As you can see, our net debt to EBITDA improved more than 1 full turn from 2.4x at the end of September 2020 to 1.2x at the end of December. We fully expect our leverage ratio to continue to improve. 
Moving on to guidance on Slide 16. We are targeting Q4 revenues of $4.25 billion to $4.3 billion, adjusted EBIT margins of 7% to 7.4%, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.65 to $0.70, net interest expense of $60 million and an effective non-GAAP tax rate of about 28%. 
With that, I will now turn the call back to Mike."

And the key testament to customers getting better are the fact that they're giving us more work. So I look at that. And the reason why I wanted to show you that progress was when you looked at Q1 this year and the minus 5.7%, you'll see that all of that was negative. And what we have said on time and time again is that we're going to rebuild these relationships, and then we're going to start stabilizing the revenue. So having all 4 of the areas of the enterprise technology stack negative in Q1 and then flipping those to 3 positive with only 1 negative is huge. And that's a testament to what myself and the team are doing. I think the customer relationship area went from an area of weakness to now an area of strength. 
And then, Ashwin, just to finish that, when you look at that 1.8% negative ITO, that's probably the number I'm most positive about and proud of on that whole stack because that was the thing when I came in that everybody said that, that was the work that was moving away from us. And it's actually not moving away from us anymore. 
The last thing is this. When I look at the amount of work that we're winning, 55% new work, 45% from renewals, you can see that the renewals are usually sole sourced, and a good portion of the new work also is sole-sourced on those customer relationships."

But that focus will allow us to get to where we need to be on revenue growth because we've got too many things going on in the industry right now, and we need more focus. 
That, along with the decision that we made to keep our Modern Workplace, couldn't be more thrilled that the ecosystem has decided to partner with us, specifically Microsoft, and get into that area with us. Now having said that, we obviously want to see the mix changing, too. We've got to move from the bottom of the stack in terms of the top of the stack.

But the guys, let me ask about the elephant in the room. You apparently just told Atos that its takeover premium was so inadequate that they walked away even though it seems merging with DXC was Atos' best strategic idea. So to have so clearly pushed off Atos' takeover bid, you have to be banking on a fundamental trajectory for DXC that's more compelling, seemingly more compelling beyond your outlook for revenue stability. So here's my question. What fundamental improvement drivers are giving you such conviction to turn down the takeover premium today. And I'm not necessarily asking for fiscal '22 guidance. I suspect you're waiting until fiscal '21 is over to do that. But I would like to ask what are the fundamental drivers that are giving you such conviction today about your trajectory and your willingness to turn down the takeover bid?"

The first one is revenue stability. And again, all these things tied back to what we've been saying all along. So on revenue stability, we just delivered our second quarter of revenue stability and have guided",401,"Rod, thanks. So look, I'll cover three items. The first one is revenue stability. And again, all these things tied back to what we've been saying all along. So on revenue stability, we just delivered our second quarter of revenue stability and have guided towards the third quarter. So we believe we're headed towards revenue stability year-on-year in FY '22. And I think anybody that has followed DXC would say that's pretty strong accomplishment. Second is within revenue stability is those customer relationships. And I know you all do your customer checks and so forth, and those relationships are becoming deeper and deeper, where they're coming to us as a trusted partner for more work. 
The second thing is adjusted EBIT margin that I mentioned to Ashwin. The fact that we are expanding margin and the key thing is sustainability. And we believe that we can keep it sustainable, along with having levers like the facilities like operational automation, contractor conversion and even overhead to name a few. We think we've still got levers to pull on to continue to expand this thing, the margin going forward. 
And then, look, you can't have revenue and margin without winning in the market. And we think because of the book-to-bill of 1.0 or greater, that the pendulum swung a little bit in our favor. We're seeing the need to fix these IT environments before you can get transformed. We think CIOs are looking at us now and saying the biggest thing that will kill a transformation to anything digital is if the existing environment doesn't work. And that's why I highlighted the green 1.8 in Q3 from a growth standpoint on a sequential basis. 
The other thing is this, when you look at our existing customers, there's no doubt they're buying more. And I love the progress that we're making on the ecosystem. That's why when Ken mentioned what we did with our partners, we're now going after our partners the same way we did our customers. We're rebuilding those relationships because that ecosystem is important to us. And again, I'll highlight the fact that Microsoft was willing the team with DXC to get into Modern Workplace. That's a game changer. So that's what we were looking at, Rod. And when you put all that together and take the Board through it, you see more value than what the proposal was all about."

I took virtual clarity and I went and studied our best clients. And again, what they told me was they aspire over the next 2 years to move another 20% of the existing work I'm sitting on to the cloud. 
Now after I took them through the analysis that virtual clarity does, which is technical feasibility, risk, business case and their ability to deliver that 20% drop to 5%. Now I don't much care whether it's 20% or 5%, we need to win our fair share. But Bryan, what that means is there's still a healthy dose of this whole secular runoff. Certainly, that stuff is going to move to the cloud. 
But the other thing I would tell you is we are now into the and phase of the cloud journey. Now what is that? The ore phase was ITO for cloud, which meant that most of this work on on-prem moved to the public cloud, one or the other. When you're now in the end phase, you're dealing with critical applications, and those critical applications just don't move directly to the cloud. In fact, you're now managing workloads. Sometimes the application will move to the cloud, sometimes the data will stay there. Why am I going to this level of detail? Because the bottom line is the fact that, that's opportunity for us, meaning if clients want to move to the cloud, they need our expertise, knowing how to run what they have to move to the cloud. And then what I'm focused our team on is the existing estates. So when you talk to a number of our customers, you will see that we are building these estate maps, and these estate maps is basically a road map for us to say what else needs to be updated on those environments. And then that is the thing that's helping that green layer get back to 0. Look, I'm not trying to sell to you that the green layer is going to be some sort of growth, but I am selling the fact that, that thing can be stabilized if you take care of your customers. So Bryan, that's the answer to that question."

I will walk through today's agenda in a moment. But before I do that, I want to briefly discuss the press release we issued on Monday, February 1.
As we announced last month, we received an unsolicited and nonbinding proposal from Atos to purchase DXC. Our Board reviewed the proposal carefully with our financial and legal advisers and found it to be inadequate and lacking certainty, given the value our Board believes we can create on a stand-alone basis by executing on our transformation journey. After sharing some high-level information with Atos to help them understand why their proposal undervalue DXC, Atos and DXC agreed to discontinue further discussions. We are confident in our transformation journey, and our Q3 results show strong evidence that our team is executing. 
We are flattered that Atos saw the value we are creating and clearly has taken notice of our new leadership team and how we are delivering for our customers and winning in the market. I was pleased with how we managed the proposal. As it did not linger, we stayed focused on our business and it helped highlight some areas where we can accelerate our transformation journey and create additional value. With the new leadership team in place, I'm looking forward to sharing the details of our FY '22 full year plan and longer-term expectations on our Q4 earnings call. We're also planning an Investor Day to discuss in more detail our plans and introduce you to our leadership team.
Now let me turn to today's agenda. I will start by giving you a quick update on our strong Q3 performance. Next, I will highlight the progress we're making on our transformation journey. Our strong Q3 results were driven by executing against the 3 key areas of our transformation journey, which are focused on customers, optimize cost and seize the market. I will then hand the call over to our new CFO, Ken Sharp, to share our detailed Q3 financial results and guidance for Q4. Finally, I will make some closing remarks before opening the call up for questions.  
Regarding our Q3 performance, our revenues were $4.29 billion, approximately $90 million above the top end of our guidance. This is the second straight quarter of revenue stabilization, and we expect this trend to continue in Q4. Our sequential revenue stabilization is positive evidence that we will achieve year-on-year revenue stability. Concerning adjusted EBIT margin, we delivered 7%, also higher than the top end of our guidance. Like revenue, we expect margins to continue to expand in Q4.
Book-to-bill for the quarter was 1.13, underscoring the success of bringing the new DXC, which focuses on our customers and people to the market. This is the third straight quarter that we've delivered a 1.0 or better book-to-bill, and we also expect this trend to continue in Q4. I'm pleased about the level of stability and momentum we are achieving. We have done well attracting talent, improving the environment for our people, strengthening our customer relationships, taking out cost without disruption and continuing to win in the market.
Now before I go through the progress of our transformation journey, I would like to comment on 2 recent hires that have allowed me to finalize our new leadership team. We completed our CFO search and hired Ken Sharp. Ken returns to DXC after being the CFO of Northrop Grumman's Defense Systems business. Prior to that, Ken was SVP of Finance at Orbital ATK and has over a decade of experience in our industry. Ken has a strong operational focus and has led large-scale finance transformations. These skills are important to us as we continue executing on our transformation journey.  
We also added Michael Corocoran to our team. Michael has joined us as Chief Strategy Officer and has a track record of transforming and growing businesses. Michael joins us from WPP, where he led strategy and operations. Prior to WPP, Michael was at Accenture, where he spent a number of years with me and created the strategy for Accenture operations. The amount of transformation and industry experience of this team is substantial, and they are the main reason for our strong execution and results. You will hear in a moment why Ken joined DXC and his comments concerning the opportunity to create value do a really nice job capturing why talent joins DXC. 
Now I will cover the good progress we are making on our transformation journey, starting with our customers. Our focus on customers continues to be the primary driver of revenue stabilization. As I've said time and time again, when we deliver for our customers and are seen as a trusted partner, customers are more likely to renew existing work and consider us for new work. Let me give you 2 good examples that have happened in Q3. Molson Coors renewed 2 pieces of work with us this quarter. The first is in application management, and the second is across multiple layers of the enterprise technology stack, including ITO, Modern Workplace, cloud and security.  
Next, our strong relationship and flexible delivery model led to an expanded agreement with Pacific Life insurance, which includes application development and support for its retirement and life divisions, enabling them to reduce cost and improve efficiency. These are 2 perfect examples of the great job we're doing, strengthening our customer relationships and gives us confidence that we can continue to stabilize revenue.  
Now let me turn to our cost optimization program. We will achieve our goal of $550 million of cost savings this year. Our cost optimization program was responsible for our strong adjusted EBIT margin of 7% in Q3. We were able to expand margins despite a 200 basis point headwind from the sale of the U.S. State and Local Health and Human Services business. We have done well optimizing our costs and continuing to deliver for our customers without disruption.  
Seize the market is the final area of our transformation journey. In this area, we are focused on cross-selling to our existing accounts and winning work with new customers. The 1.13 book-to-bill number that we delivered this quarter is consistent evidence that our plan is working. In Q3, 55% of our bookings were new work and 45% were renewals.  
Let me give you a good example of new work with a new customer. We signed a 3-year deal with Ferrari, where we will modernize their IT platforms with services, including security and Modern Workplace. Our ability to deliver a consistent book-to-bill number of over 1.0 in the first 3 quarters of FY '21 is clear evidence that our transformation journey is not only working but we can absolutely win in the IT services market.  
Turning now to our healthcare provider software business. We are on track to complete the sale of this business and use the roughly $450 million of net proceeds to pay down debt, further strengthening our balance sheet. Now before I turn the call over to Ken, I would like to thank our people, customers and shareholders for supporting us throughout our transformation journey.  
Now let me turn the call over to Ken."

Let me begin by saying how excited I am to join DXC and be part of the team that Mike has assembled. Let me provide you some insight into my thought process on why I joined, which came down to 3 main factors: the team Mike assembled; the transformation journey; and third, the investment thesis of how DXC would create value. After spending time with Mike and the team, I'm convinced that DXC can execute on the investment thesis I was contemplating. This includes stabilizing revenue, expanding margins and delivering free cash flow. When we achieve this thesis, I believe DXC will be successful in unlocking significant value.  
Now let me talk about the team Mike assembled. Let's face it. Companies with the best people win. The strength of the team delivering on the transformation journey is clearly visible in our Q3 results. At DXC, there are 3 main areas that our finance team will focus on. First, we will work hard to demonstrate the true earnings power of DXC. We will focus on cash flow, paying particular attention to reducing outflows. We intend to continue investing in our people and delivering for our customers. At the same time, we will be disciplined in reducing spend in areas such as restructuring, transaction and integration, capital expenditures, excess facilities and our outsized overhead.
In the earnings release today, you will see that we're providing organic revenue, something that we feel will help our investors better understand the underlying performance of the business. We believe we will create the most value by growing the underlying business. That means organic growth and at the same time improving cash flow. Second, we are committed to putting in place a disciplined capital deployment program that will maximize the value creation of our cash flow engine. Based on rigorous analysis, we will carefully evaluate the returns associated with capital deployment options.
Now that we've strengthened our balance sheet, we are turning to solidify our cash flow. With a strong balance sheet and a cash flow outlook, we will be in a position to execute a disciplined capital allocation program. Third, we will improve our financial visibility. We are committed to providing annual guidance and our longer-term expectations on our next earnings call. We are also planning an Investor Day to discuss in more detail our longer-term plans and introduce you to our leadership.
Moving on to our Q3 results. In the quarter, DXC exceeded the top end of our revenue, adjusted EBIT and non-GAAP EPS guidance. GAAP revenue was $4.29 billion and $88 million better than the top of our guidance range. Currency was a tailwind of $58 million sequentially and $118 million year-over-year. On an organic basis, revenue increased 1.7% sequentially. Organic revenue declined 10.5% year-over-year due to previously disclosed runoffs and terminations. We expect this to be the high watermark for organic year-over-year revenue declines.
As you will see from our Q4 guidance, we expect to continue delivering stable sequential revenue. And during fiscal year '22, we expect this to translate into year-over-year revenue stability. Adjusted EBIT was $300 million. Our adjusted EBIT margin was 7%, a sequential improvement of 80 basis points despite an approximate 200 basis point headwind from the HHS sale. Non-GAAP income before taxes was $246 million. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.84 due to a lower-than-expected tax rate of 10.2%. Using our guidance tax rate of 30%, non-GAAP EPS was $0.65. This was a $0.10 -- this was $0.10 higher than the top end of our guidance range.
Our Q3 tax rate primarily benefited from the reversal of certain tax reserves related to tax audits, the expectation of higher utilization of foreign net operating losses and the ability to utilize state tax credits related to the HHS sale. In Q3, bookings were $4.9 billion for a book-to-bill of 1.13. Like Mike mentioned earlier, we are encouraged to see 3 consecutive quarters with a book-to-bill greater than 1.0.
Turning now to our segment results. The GBS segment, the top of our technology stack, includes analytics and engineering, applications and the horizontal BPS business. The GBS segment previously included the HHS business, which we sold on October 1 and includes the healthcare provider software business, which we are in the process of selling. GBS revenue was $1.92 billion or 45% of our total Q3 revenue. Organic revenues increased 2.2% sequentially, primarily reflecting the strength of our analytics and engineering business. Year-over-year, GBS revenue was down 7% on an organic basis. GBS segment profit was $273 million and profit margin was 14.2%. Margins improved 10 basis points sequentially despite a headwind of about 300 basis points from the HHS sale. GBS bookings for the quarter were $2.7 billion for a book-to-bill of 1.35.
Now turning to our GIS segment, which consists of IT outsourcing, cloud and security and the Modern Workplace layers of our enterprise technology stack. Revenue was $2.37 billion, up 1.3% sequentially and down 13.2% year-over-year on an organic basis. GIS segment profit was $88 million with a profit margin of 3.7%, a 210 basis points margin expansion over Q2. GIS bookings were $2.2 billion for a book-to-bill of 0.95.
Now before I discuss the details of the enterprise technology stack on Slide 13, I wanted to point out that there is no better slide that drives home the positive impact of our transformation journey. The proof points on the slide include continued revenue stabilization and strengthening of our book-to-bill for each layer of our stack that has been part of the transformation journey since Q1. As you can see in Q1, all 4 layers of our stack had negative sequential growth, whereas we are now reporting sequential growth improvement for all layers in Q3. Also, it is positive to see the revenue mix beginning to change in shifting up the stack.
Now let me drill down one level to comment on the performance of the layers of our enterprise technology stack. IT outsourcing revenue was down 1.8% sequentially, an improvement as compared to Q2 where it was down 4.7%. ITO revenues declined 17.7% year-over-year due to the previously disclosed runoffs and terminations. Book-to-bill was 0.96 in the quarter. We believe building strong relationships with our ITO customers and delivering effective solutions will improve revenue performance. Cloud and security revenue was up 4.7% sequentially and down 1% year-over-year. Book-to-bill was 1.0 in the quarter.
Moving up the stack, the applications layer posted 2.6% sequential revenue growth and was down 9.3% year-over-year. Book-to-bill was 1.5. Analytics and engineering was up 4.6% on a sequential basis and flat compared to the prior year. Analytics and engineering book-to-bill was 1.2 in the quarter. The Modern Workplace and BPS businesses increased 2.6% sequentially and was down 12.6% compared to the prior year. I should note that Q3 positively benefited from increased volume of resales. As you may recall, these 2 businesses were part of the strategic alternatives initiative and are just beginning their transformation journey. As a result, you should expect some unevenness in performance.
Moving on to cash flows on Slide 14. Our cash flow from operations totaled an outflow of $187 million, and adjusted free cash flow for the quarter came in at negative $318 million. As discussed on our prior earnings call, we had cash disbursements of $332 million that impacted free cash flow related to the HHS sale. In addition, during the quarter, we normalized payments to our suppliers and partners. Our effort to normalize our supplier and partner payments is not expected to reoccur and had an approximate $400 million negative cash flow impact in the quarter and $500 million negative cash flow impact through the first 3 quarters of our fiscal year. 
We believe treating our partners appropriately will allow us to further leverage the partner ecosystem. If these 2 items had not occurred, our free cash flow would have been more than $700 million higher in the quarter. The company has traditionally reported adjusted free cash flow that adjusts for capital expenditures, restructuring, transaction, separation and integration costs. We are considering changing our free cash flow presentation going forward.
On Slide 15, we detail the efforts we have undertaken to strengthen our balance sheet. As we previously disclosed, we utilized $3.5 billion of net proceeds from our HHS sale to reduce debt. Additionally, we continue to make progress on our plan to sell our healthcare provider software business, and we will use the proceeds to pay down debt and further strengthen our balance sheet. Cash at the end of the quarter was $3.9 billion. 
Total debt, including capitalized leases, was $6.2 billion for a net debt of $2.3 billion. We expect to make tax payments of approximately $900 million in Q4 related to our divestitures. I would like to emphasize our commitment to an investment-grade credit rating. As you can see, our net debt to EBITDA improved more than 1 full turn from 2.4x at the end of September 2020 to 1.2x at the end of December. We fully expect our leverage ratio to continue to improve.
Moving on to guidance on Slide 16. We are targeting Q4 revenues of $4.25 billion to $4.3 billion, adjusted EBIT margins of 7% to 7.4%, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.65 to $0.70, net interest expense of $60 million and an effective non-GAAP tax rate of about 28%.
With that, I will now turn the call back to Mike."

Second is we are on track to complete the sale of the healthcare provider software business and use the proceeds to pay down debt, further strengthening our balance sheet. Third, with the additions of Ken and Michael, we have built and finalized the new leadership team that is executing on our transformation journey and producing strong results.
In closing, I am pleased with the level of stability and momentum we are achieving. We have done well attracting talent, improving the environment for our people, strengthening our customer relationships, taking out costs without disruption and continuing to win in the market. We expect all of this positive momentum to continue in Q4.  
And with that, Greg, please open the call up for questions."

On the customer relation shifts, the key thing is -- I like Page 13 a lot. That's where we show the enterprise technology stack. And the key testament to customers getting better are the fact that they're giving us more work. So I look at that. And the reason why I wanted to show you that progress was when you look at Q1 this year and the minus 5.7%, you'll see that all of that was negative. And what we have said point time and time again is that we're going to rebuild these relationships, and then we're going to start stabilizing the revenue. So having all 4 of the areas of the enterprise technology stack negative in Q1 and then flipping those to 3 positive with only 1 negative is huge. And that's a testament to what myself and the team are doing. I think the customer relationship area went from an area of weakness to now an area of strength. 
And then, Ashwin, just to finish that. When you look at that 1.8% negative ITO, that's probably the number I'm most positive about and proud of on that whole stack because that was the thing when I came in that everybody said that, that was the work that was moving away from us. And it's actually not moving away from us anymore. The last thing is this. When I look at the amount of work that we're winning, 55% new work, 45% from renewals, you can see that the renewals are usually sole sourced, and a good portion of the new work also is sole-sourced on those customer relationships."

I have said before that when you look at the enterprise technology stack, I like the hand that we have. We've got good scope and scale across the way that our clients think about technology. So when you think about whether it's ITO, cloud security application, analytics and engineering, there's stuff that we have to do there. And look, I know that you're not thrilled about us rationalizing and then delivering. But that focus will allow us to get to where we need to be on revenue growth because we've got too many things going on in the industry right now, and we need more focus. 
That, along with the decision that we made to keep our Modern Workplace couldn't be more thrilled that the ecosystem has decided to partner with us, specifically Microsoft, and get into that area with us. Now having said that, we obviously want to see the mix changing, too. We've got to move from the bottom of the stack in terms of the top of the stack. But the other stat I will give you is we still have a customer base where they are aspiring to move roughly 20% of their work over the next 2 years to the cloud, but 80% of that work that is remaining, 60% they want to see modernized. 
So look, I like the hand that we have, James. We're going to continue to make sure we're focused on selling the stuff that we have. And then I think I will end with -- you've seen I've got a propensity to buy tactical tuck-ins. I'm not big on buying big things. I'm big on buying things that help me focus on that enterprise technology stack and then I know can scale through our best accounts.

But guys, let me ask about the elephant in the room. You apparently just told Atos that its takeover premium was so inadequate that they walked away, even though it seems merging with DXC was Atos' best strategic idea. So to have so clearly pushed off Atos' takeover bid, you have to be banking on a fundamental trajectory for DXC that's more compelling -- seemingly more compelling beyond your outlook for revenue stability. So here's my question. What fundamental improvement drivers are giving you such conviction to turn down the takeover premium today? And I'm not necessarily asking for fiscal '22 guidance. I suspect you're waiting until fiscal '21 is over to do that.

And again, all these things tie back to what we've been saying all along. So on revenue stability, we just delivered our second quarter of revenue stability and have guided towards the third quarter. So we believe we're headed towards revenue stability year-on-year in FY '22. And I think anybody that has followed DXC would say that's pretty strong accomplishment. Second is within revenue stability it's those customer relationships. And I know you all do your customer checks and so forth, and those relationships are becoming deeper and deeper, where they're coming to us as a trusted partner for more work. 
The second thing is adjusted EBIT margin that I mentioned to Ashwin. The fact that we are expanding margin and the key thing is sustainability. And we believe that we can keep it sustainable, along with having levers like the facilities, like operational automation, contractor conversion and even overhead to name a few. We think we've still got levers to pull on to continue to expand this thing -- the margin going forward. 
And then, look, you can't have revenue and margin without winning in the market. And we think because of the book-to-bill of 1.0 or greater, that the pendulum swung a little bit in our favor. We're seeing the need to fix these IT environments before you can get transformed. We think CIOs are looking at us now and saying the biggest thing that will kill a transformation to anything digital is if the existing environment doesn't work. And that's why I highlighted the green 1.8% in Q3 from a growth standpoint on a sequential basis. 
The other thing is this. When you look at our existing customers, there's no doubt they're buying more. And I love the progress that we're making on the ecosystem. That's why when Ken mentioned what we did with our partners, we're now going after our partners the same way we did our customers. We're rebuilding those relationships because that ecosystem is important to us. And again, I'll highlight the fact that Microsoft was willing the team with DXC to get into Modern Workplace. That's a game changer. So that's what we were looking at, Rod. And when you put all that together and take the Board through it, you see more value than what the proposal was all about."

And do you view this as a business that can ultimately stabilize, too, specifically the ITO layer? Or are the secular headwinds here just too challenging for such a plan?"

I took virtual clarity and I went and studied our best clients. And again, what they told me was they aspire over the next 2 years to move another 20% of the existing work I'm sitting on to the cloud. Now after I took them through the analysis that Virtual Clarity does, which is technical feasibility, risk, business case and their ability to deliver, that 20% dropped to 5%. Now I don't much care whether it's 20% or 5%. We need to win our fair share. But Bryan, what that means is there's still a healthy dose of this whole secular runoff. Certainly, that stuff is going to move to the cloud. 
But the other thing I would tell you is we are now into the and phase of the cloud journey. Now what is that? The or phase was ITO or cloud, which meant that most of this work on on-prem moved to the public cloud, one or the other. When you're now in the and phase, you're dealing with critical applications, and those critical applications just don't move directly to the cloud. In fact, you're now managing workloads. Sometimes the application will move to the cloud. Sometimes the data will stay there. Why am I going to this level of detail? Because the bottom line is the fact that, that's opportunity for us. 
Meaning if clients want to move to the cloud, they need our expertise, knowing how to run what they have to move to the cloud. And then what I'm focused our team on is the existing estates. So when you talk to a number of our customers, you will see that we are building these estate maps, and these estate maps is basically a road map for us to say what else needs to be updated on those environments. And then that is the thing that's helping that green layer get back to 0. Look, I'm not trying to sell to you that the green layer is going to be some sort of growth, but I am selling the fact that, that thing can be stabilized if you take care of your customers. So Bryan, that's the answer to that question."

I will walk through today's agenda in a moment. But before I do that, I want to briefly discuss the press release we issued on Monday, February 1.
As we announced last month, we received an unsolicited and nonbinding proposal from Atos to purchase DXC. Our Board reviewed the proposal carefully with our financial and legal advisers and found it to be inadequate and lacking certainty, given the value our Board believes we can create on a stand-alone basis by executing on our transformation journey. After sharing some high-level information with Atos to help them understand why their proposal undervalue DXC, Atos and DXC agreed to discontinue further discussions. We are confident in our transformation journey, and our Q3 results show strong evidence that our team is executing. 
We are flattered that Atos saw the value we are creating and clearly has taken notice of our new leadership team and how we are delivering for our customers and winning in the market. I was pleased with how we managed the proposal. As it did not linger, we stayed focused on our business and it helped highlight some areas where we can accelerate our transformation journey and create additional value. With the new leadership team in place, I'm looking forward to sharing the details of our FY '22 full year plan and longer-term expectations on our Q4 earnings call. We're also planning an Investor Day to discuss in more detail our plans and introduce you to our leadership team.
Now let me turn to today's agenda. I will start by giving you a quick update on our strong Q3 performance. Next, I will highlight the progress we're making on our transformation journey. Our strong Q3 results were driven by executing against the 3 key areas of our transformation journey, which are focused on customers, optimize cost and seize the market. I will then hand the call over to our new CFO, Ken Sharp, to share our detailed Q3 financial results and guidance for Q4. Finally, I will make some closing remarks before opening the call up for questions.  
Regarding our Q3 performance, our revenues were $4.29 billion, approximately $90 million above the top end of our guidance. This is the second straight quarter of revenue stabilization, and we expect this trend to continue in Q4. Our sequential revenue stabilization is positive evidence that we will achieve year-on-year revenue stability. Concerning adjusted EBIT margin, we delivered 7%, also higher than the top end of our guidance. Like revenue, we expect margins to continue to expand in Q4.
Book-to-bill for the quarter was 1.13, underscoring the success of bringing the new DXC, which focuses on our customers and people to the market. This is the third straight quarter that we've delivered a 1.0 or better book-to-bill, and we also expect this trend to continue in Q4. I'm pleased about the level of stability and momentum we are achieving. We have done well attracting talent, improving the environment for our people, strengthening our customer relationships, taking out cost without disruption and continuing to win in the market.
Now before I go through the progress of our transformation journey, I would like to comment on 2 recent hires that have allowed me to finalize our new leadership team. We completed our CFO search and hired Ken Sharp. Ken returns to DXC after being the CFO of Northrop Grumman's Defense Systems business. Prior to that, Ken was SVP of Finance at Orbital ATK and has over a decade of experience in our industry. Ken has a strong operational focus and has led large-scale finance transformations. These skills are important to us as we continue executing on our transformation journey.  
We also added Michael Corcoran to our team. Michael has joined us as Chief Strategy Officer and has a track record of transforming and growing businesses. Michael joins us from WPP, where he led strategy and operations. Prior to WPP, Michael was at Accenture, where he spent a number of years with me and created the strategy for Accenture operations. The amount of transformation and industry experience of this team is substantial, and they are the main reason for our strong execution and results. You will hear in a moment why Ken joined DXC and his comments concerning the opportunity to create value do a really nice job capturing why talent joins DXC. 
Now I will cover the good progress we are making on our transformation journey, starting with our customers. Our focus on customers continues to be the primary driver of revenue stabilization. As I've said time and time again, when we deliver for our customers and are seen as a trusted partner, customers are more likely to renew existing work and consider us for new work. Let me give you 2 good examples that have happened in Q3. Molson Coors renewed 2 pieces of work with us this quarter. The first is in application management, and the second is across multiple layers of the enterprise technology stack, including ITO, Modern Workplace, cloud and security.  
Next, our strong relationship and flexible delivery model led to an expanded agreement with Pacific Life insurance, which includes application development and support for its retirement and life divisions, enabling them to reduce cost and improve efficiency. These are 2 perfect examples of the great job we're doing, strengthening our customer relationships and gives us confidence that we can continue to stabilize revenue.  
Now let me turn to our cost optimization program. We will achieve our goal of $550 million of cost savings this year. Our cost optimization program was responsible for our strong adjusted EBIT margin of 7% in Q3. We were able to expand margins despite a 200 basis point headwind from the sale of the U.S. State and Local Health and Human Services business. We have done well optimizing our costs and continuing to deliver for our customers without disruption.  
Seize the market is the final area of our transformation journey. In this area, we are focused on cross-selling to our existing accounts and winning work with new customers. The 1.13 book-to-bill number that we delivered this quarter is consistent evidence that our plan is working. In Q3, 55% of our bookings were new work and 45% were renewals.  
Let me give you a good example of new work with a new customer. We signed a 3-year deal with Ferrari, where we will modernize their IT platforms with services, including security and Modern Workplace. Our ability to deliver a consistent book-to-bill number of over 1.0 in the first 3 quarters of FY '21 is clear evidence that our transformation journey is not only working but we can absolutely win in the IT services market.  
Turning now to our healthcare provider software business. We are on track to complete the sale of this business and use the roughly $450 million of net proceeds to pay down debt, further strengthening our balance sheet. Now before I turn the call over to Ken, I would like to thank our people, customers and shareholders for supporting us throughout our transformation journey.  
Now let me turn the call over to Ken."

Let me begin by saying how excited I am to join DXC and be part of the team that Mike has assembled. Let me provide you some insight into my thought process on why I joined, which came down to 3 main factors: the team Mike assembled; the transformation journey; and third, the investment thesis of how DXC would create value. After spending time with Mike and the team, I'm convinced that DXC can execute on the investment thesis I was contemplating. This includes stabilizing revenue, expanding margins and delivering free cash flow. When we achieve this thesis, I believe DXC will be successful in unlocking significant value.  
Now let me talk about the team Mike assembled. Let's face it. Companies with the best people win. The strength of the team delivering on the transformation journey is clearly visible in our Q3 results. At DXC, there are 3 main areas that our finance team will focus on. First, we will work hard to demonstrate the true earnings power of DXC. We will focus on cash flow, paying particular attention to reducing outflows. We intend to continue investing in our people and delivering for our customers. At the same time, we will be disciplined in reducing spend in areas such as restructuring, transaction and integration, capital expenditures, excess facilities and our outsized overhead.
In the earnings release today, you will see that we're providing organic revenue, something that we feel will help our investors better understand the underlying performance of the business. We believe we will create the most value by growing the underlying business. That means organic growth and at the same time improving cash flow. Second, we are committed to putting in place a disciplined capital deployment program that will maximize the value creation of our cash flow engine. Based on rigorous analysis, we will carefully evaluate the returns associated with capital deployment options.
Now that we've strengthened our balance sheet, we are turning to solidify our cash flow. With a strong balance sheet and a cash flow outlook, we will be in a position to execute a disciplined capital allocation program. Third, we will improve our financial visibility. We are committed to providing annual guidance and our longer-term expectations on our next earnings call. We are also planning an Investor Day to discuss in more detail our longer-term plans and introduce you to our leadership.
Moving on to our Q3 results. In the quarter, DXC exceeded the top end of our revenue, adjusted EBIT and non-GAAP EPS guidance. GAAP revenue was $4.29 billion and $88 million better than the top of our guidance range. Currency was a tailwind of $58 million sequentially and $118 million year-over-year. On an organic basis, revenue increased 1.7% sequentially. Organic revenue declined 10.5% year-over-year due to previously disclosed runoffs and terminations. We expect this to be the high watermark for organic year-over-year revenue declines.
As you will see from our Q4 guidance, we expect to continue delivering stable sequential revenue. And during fiscal year '22, we expect this to translate into year-over-year revenue stability. Adjusted EBIT was $300 million. Our adjusted EBIT margin was 7%, a sequential improvement of 80 basis points despite an approximate 200 basis point headwind from the HHS sale. Non-GAAP income before taxes was $246 million. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.84 due to a lower-than-expected tax rate of 10.2%. Using our guidance tax rate of 30%, non-GAAP EPS was $0.65. This was a $0.10 -- this was $0.10 higher than the top end of our guidance range.
Our Q3 tax rate primarily benefited from the reversal of certain tax reserves related to tax audits, the expectation of higher utilization of foreign net operating losses and the ability to utilize state tax credits related to the HHS sale. In Q3, bookings were $4.9 billion for a book-to-bill of 1.13. Like Mike mentioned earlier, we are encouraged to see 3 consecutive quarters with a book-to-bill greater than 1.0.
Turning now to our segment results. The GBS segment, the top of our technology stack, includes analytics and engineering, applications and the horizontal BPS business. The GBS segment previously included the HHS business, which we sold on October 1 and includes the healthcare provider software business, which we are in the process of selling. GBS revenue was $1.92 billion or 45% of our total Q3 revenue. Organic revenues increased 2.2% sequentially, primarily reflecting the strength of our analytics and engineering business. Year-over-year, GBS revenue was down 7% on an organic basis. GBS segment profit was $273 million and profit margin was 14.2%. Margins improved 10 basis points sequentially despite a headwind of about 300 basis points from the HHS sale. GBS bookings for the quarter were $2.7 billion for a book-to-bill of 1.35.
Now turning to our GIS segment, which consists of IT outsourcing, cloud and security and the Modern Workplace layers of our enterprise technology stack. Revenue was $2.37 billion, up 1.3% sequentially and down 13.2% year-over-year on an organic basis. GIS segment profit was $88 million with a profit margin of 3.7%, a 210 basis points margin expansion over Q2. GIS bookings were $2.2 billion for a book-to-bill of 0.95.
Now before I discuss the details of the enterprise technology stack on Slide 13, I wanted to point out that there is no better slide that drives home the positive impact of our transformation journey. The proof points on the slide include continued revenue stabilization and strengthening of our book-to-bill for each layer of our stack that has been part of the transformation journey since Q1. As you can see in Q1, all 4 layers of our stack had negative sequential growth, whereas we are now reporting sequential growth improvement for all layers in Q3. Also, it is positive to see the revenue mix beginning to change in shifting up the stack.
Now let me drill down one level to comment on the performance of the layers of our enterprise technology stack. IT outsourcing revenue was down 1.8% sequentially, an improvement as compared to Q2 where it was down 4.7%. ITO revenues declined 17.7% year-over-year due to the previously disclosed runoffs and terminations. Book-to-bill was 0.96 in the quarter. We believe building strong relationships with our ITO customers and delivering effective solutions will improve revenue performance. Cloud and security revenue was up 4.7% sequentially and down 1% year-over-year. Book-to-bill was 1.0 in the quarter.
Moving up the stack, the applications layer posted 2.6% sequential revenue growth and was down 9.3% year-over-year. Book-to-bill was 1.5. Analytics and engineering was up 4.6% on a sequential basis and flat compared to the prior year. Analytics and engineering book-to-bill was 1.2 in the quarter. The Modern Workplace and BPS businesses increased 2.6% sequentially and was down 12.6% compared to the prior year. I should note that Q3 positively benefited from increased volume of resales. As you may recall, these 2 businesses were part of the strategic alternatives initiative and are just beginning their transformation journey. As a result, you should expect some unevenness in performance.
Moving on to cash flows on Slide 14. Our cash flow from operations totaled an outflow of $187 million, and adjusted free cash flow for the quarter came in at negative $318 million. As discussed on our prior earnings call, we had cash disbursements of $332 million that impacted free cash flow related to the HHS sale. In addition, during the quarter, we normalized payments to our suppliers and partners. Our effort to normalize our supplier and partner payments is not expected to reoccur and had an approximate $400 million negative cash flow impact in the quarter and $500 million negative cash flow impact through the first 3 quarters of our fiscal year. 
We believe treating our partners appropriately will allow us to further leverage the partner ecosystem. If these 2 items had not occurred, our free cash flow would have been more than $700 million higher in the quarter. The company has traditionally reported adjusted free cash flow that adjusts for capital expenditures, restructuring, transaction, separation and integration costs. We are considering changing our free cash flow presentation going forward.
On Slide 15, we detail the efforts we have undertaken to strengthen our balance sheet. As we previously disclosed, we utilized $3.5 billion of net proceeds from our HHS sale to reduce debt. Additionally, we continue to make progress on our plan to sell our healthcare provider software business, and we will use the proceeds to pay down debt and further strengthen our balance sheet. Cash at the end of the quarter was $3.9 billion. 
Total debt, including capitalized leases, was $6.2 billion for a net debt of $2.3 billion. We expect to make tax payments of approximately $900 million in Q4 related to our divestitures. I would like to emphasize our commitment to an investment-grade credit rating. As you can see, our net debt to EBITDA improved more than 1 full turn from 2.4x at the end of September 2020 to 1.2x at the end of December. We fully expect our leverage ratio to continue to improve.
Moving on to guidance on Slide 16. We are targeting Q4 revenues of $4.25 billion to $4.3 billion, adjusted EBIT margins of 7% to 7.4%, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.65 to $0.70, net interest expense of $60 million and an effective non-GAAP tax rate of about 28%.
With that, I will now turn the call back to Mike."

On the customer relation shifts, the key thing is -- I like Page 13 a lot. That's where we show the enterprise technology stack. And the key testament to customers getting better are the fact that they're giving us more work. So I look at that. And the reason why I wanted to show you that progress was when you look at Q1 this year and the minus 5.7%, you'll see that all of that was negative. And what we have said point time and time again is that we're going to rebuild these relationships, and then we're going to start stabilizing the revenue. So having all 4 of the areas of the enterprise technology stack negative in Q1 and then flipping those to 3 positive with only 1 negative is huge. And that's a testament to what myself and the team are doing. I think the customer relationship area went from an area of weakness to now an area of strength. 
And then, Ashwin, just to finish that. When you look at that 1.8% negative ITO, that's probably the number I'm most positive about and proud of on that whole stack because that was the thing when I came in that everybody said that, that was the work that was moving away from us. And it's actually not moving away from us anymore. The last thing is this. When I look at the amount of work that we're winning, 55% new work, 45% from renewals, you can see that the renewals are usually sole sourced, and a good portion of the new work also is sole-sourced on those customer relationships."

I have said before that when you look at the enterprise technology stack, I like the hand that we have. We've got good scope and scale across the way that our clients think about technology. So when you think about whether it's ITO, cloud security application, analytics and engineering, there's stuff that we have to do there. And look, I know that you're not thrilled about us rationalizing and then delivering. But that focus will allow us to get to where we need to be on revenue growth because we've got too many things going on in the industry right now, and we need more focus. 
That, along with the decision that we made to keep our Modern Workplace couldn't be more thrilled that the ecosystem has decided to partner with us, specifically Microsoft, and get into that area with us. Now having said that, we obviously want to see the mix changing, too. We've got to move from the bottom of the stack in terms of the top of the stack. But the other stat I will give you is we still have a customer base where they are aspiring to move roughly 20% of their work over the next 2 years to the cloud, but 80% of that work that is remaining, 60% they want to see modernized. 
So look, I like the hand that we have, James. We're going to continue to make sure we're focused on selling the stuff that we have. And then I think I will end with -- you've seen I've got a propensity to buy tactical tuck-ins. I'm not big on buying big things. I'm big on buying things that help me focus on that enterprise technology stack and then I know can scale through our best accounts. So that's where I take the relationships and push it against our offerings. And marrying the two, I should be able to sell more to those best clients."

But guys, let me ask about the elephant in the room. You apparently just told Atos that its takeover premium was so inadequate that they walked away, even though it seems merging with DXC was Atos' best strategic idea. So to have so clearly pushed off Atos' takeover bid, you have to be banking on a fundamental trajectory for DXC that's more compelling -- seemingly more compelling beyond your outlook for revenue stability. So here's my question. What fundamental improvement drivers are giving you such conviction to turn down the takeover premium today? And I'm not necessarily asking for fiscal '22 guidance. I suspect you're waiting until fiscal '21 is over to do that. But I would like to ask what are the fundamental drivers that are giving you such conviction today about your trajectory and your willingness to turn down the takeover bid?"

And again, all these things tie back to what we've been saying all along. So on revenue stability, we just delivered our second quarter of revenue stability and have guided towards the third quarter. So we believe we're headed towards revenue stability year-on-year in FY '22. And I think anybody that has followed DXC would say that's pretty strong accomplishment. Second is within revenue stability it's those customer relationships. And I know you all do your customer checks and so forth, and those relationships are becoming deeper and deeper, where they're coming to us as a trusted partner for more work. 
The second thing is adjusted EBIT margin that I mentioned to Ashwin. The fact that we are expanding margin and the key thing is sustainability. And we believe that we can keep it sustainable, along with having levers like the facilities, like operational automation, contractor conversion and even overhead to name a few. We think we've still got levers to pull on to continue to expand this thing -- the margin going forward. 
And then, look, you can't have revenue and margin without winning in the market. And we think because of the book-to-bill of 1.0 or greater, that the pendulum swung a little bit in our favor. We're seeing the need to fix these IT environments before you can get transformed. We think CIOs are looking at us now and saying the biggest thing that will kill a transformation to anything digital is if the existing environment doesn't work. And that's why I highlighted the green 1.8% in Q3 from a growth standpoint on a sequential basis. 
The other thing is this. When you look at our existing customers, there's no doubt they're buying more. And I love the progress that we're making on the ecosystem. That's why when Ken mentioned what we did with our partners, we're now going after our partners the same way we did our customers. We're rebuilding those relationships because that ecosystem is important to us. And again, I'll highlight the fact that Microsoft was willing the team with DXC to get into Modern Workplace. That's a game changer. So that's what we were looking at, Rod. And when you put all that together and take the Board through it, you see more value than what the proposal was all about."

I took virtual clarity and I went and studied our best clients. And again, what they told me was they aspire over the next 2 years to move another 20% of the existing work I'm sitting on to the cloud. Now after I took them through the analysis that Virtual Clarity does, which is technical feasibility, risk, business case and their ability to deliver, that 20% dropped to 5%. Now I don't much care whether it's 20% or 5%. We need to win our fair share. But Bryan, what that means is there's still a healthy dose of this whole secular runoff. Certainly, that stuff is going to move to the cloud. 
But the other thing I would tell you is we are now into the and phase of the cloud journey. Now what is that? The or phase was ITO or cloud, which meant that most of this work on on-prem moved to the public cloud, one or the other. When you're now in the and phase, you're dealing with critical applications, and those critical applications just don't move directly to the cloud. In fact, you're now managing workloads. Sometimes the application will move to the cloud. Sometimes the data will stay there. Why am I going to this level of detail? Because the bottom line is the fact that, that's opportunity for us. 
Meaning if clients want to move to the cloud, they need our expertise, knowing how to run what they have to move to the cloud. And then what I'm focused our team on is the existing estates. So when you talk to a number of our customers, you will see that we are building these estate maps, and these estate maps is basically a road map for us to say what else needs to be updated on those environments. And then that is the thing that's helping that green layer get back to 0.

Today's agenda will start by giving you a quick update on our strong Q4 performance. Next, I will highlight the progress we are making on our transformation journey. Our strong Q4 results were driven by executing on the 3 key areas of our transformation journey, which are focused on our customers, optimize cost and seize the market. I will then hand the call over to Ken to share our detailed Q4 financial results, guidance for FY '22 and longer-term outlook. Finally, I will make some closing remarks before opening the call up for questions. 
Regarding our Q4 performance, our revenues were $4.39 billion, approximately $85 million above the top end of our guidance. This is the third straight quarter of revenue stabilization and we expect this trend to continue in FY '22. Concerning adjusted EBIT margin, we delivered 7.5%, also higher than the top end of our guidance. This, too, is the third straight quarter of sequential margin expansion and is driven by our cost optimization program. We expect margins to continue to expand in Q1 of FY '22. 
Book-to-bill for the quarter was 1.08, underscoring the success of bringing the new DXC, which focuses on our customers and colleagues to the market. This is the fourth straight quarter that we've delivered a 1.0 or better book-to-bill. We expect our success of winning in the market to continue in Q1 of FY '22. 
I am pleased with the momentum we have achieved. All the work in FY '21 to inspire our people, invest in our customers, take costs out without disruption and win in the market has positioned us very well for financial success in FY '22 and longer term. Now I will cover the good progress we are making on our transformation journey, starting with our customers. 
Our investment in our customers continues to be the primary driver of revenue stabilization. When we deliver for our customers and are seen as a trusted partner, customers are more likely to renew existing work and consider us for new work. Let me give you an example. We recently signed a 5-year expansion with Zurich Insurance Group. We'll provide IT outsourcing and security services as part of their global IT transformation, focused on improving the customer and employee experience. This is a perfect example of delivering for a customer, strengthening the relationship and then a customer wanting to work with DXC in the future. This is strong evidence that our investment in our customers is paying off, which gives us confidence that we can flatten organic revenue during FY '22. 
Now let me turn to our cost optimization program. We have achieved our goal of $550 million of cost savings in FY '21. Our cost optimization program was responsible for the strong adjusted EBIT margin of 7.5% in Q4. We have done well optimizing our costs and continuing to deliver for our customers without disruption. You will hear from Ken that we expect to continue to expand margins in FY '22. 
Seize the market is the final area of our transformation journey. In this area, we are focused on cross-selling to our existing accounts and winning new work. So the 1.08 book-to-bill that we delivered this quarter is consistent evidence that our plan is working. In Q4, 53% of our bookings were new work and 47% were renewals. 
Ahold Delhaize is a great example of an existing customer who has renewed work with DXC and given us new work. We will be providing infrastructure services, application outsourcing, cloud migration and workplace services in a hybrid cloud environment for the retail business services group, to reduce costs and support their business-critical systems that enable each of their local brands to stock their shelves. 
Our ability to deliver a consistent book-to-bill of over 1.0 in each of the 4 quarters of FY '21 is clear evidence that we can win in the IT services industry. This is translating into improving quarterly organic revenue growth, which we expect will flatten during FY '22. 
Now before I turn the call over to Ken, I would like to thank our colleagues, our customers and our shareholders for their support. As we are witnessing the ongoing impact of COVID-19, our focus continues to be on our people. Currently, we are focused on the more severely impacted areas of India and the Philippines. The dedication of our team is a source of great pride for us at DXC as our people continue to take care of themselves, their families and to deliver for our customers. Now let me turn the call over to Ken."

In the past 3 quarters, we have stabilized our revenue on a sequential basis and guided to the fourth quarter of revenue stability. This is a significant accomplishment by my DXC colleagues. It is not lost on Mike and me that investors lo",1779,"Thank you, Mike. In the past 3 quarters, we have stabilized our revenue on a sequential basis and guided to the fourth quarter of revenue stability. This is a significant accomplishment by my DXC colleagues. It is not lost on Mike and me that investors look at revenue growth on a year-over-year basis. However, when a company has a period of significant decline and change to its business, strategy and leadership, you first have to stabilize revenue sequentially. As we all know, once you achieve 4 quarters of sequential revenue stability, you achieve year-over-year revenue stability. Going forward, we will pivot our narrative accordingly. 
Turning on to our financial priorities on Slide 10. We are working to build a stronger financial foundation and drive the company in a disciplined and rigorous fashion to unleash the true earnings power. To that end, remediating our material weakness and the impact it has on our corporate governance is a key focus. 
Our second priority is to have a strong balance sheet. We paid down $6.5 billion of debt in the past 9 months and subsequent to year-end, retired an additional $500 million. We are now approaching a far more manageable $5 billion debt level. Further, we have relatively low maturities over the next 3 years. We remain committed to an investment-grade credit profile, and I believe our actions more than demonstrate our commitment. 
Third, we will focus on improving cash flow. The company previously provided an adjusted cash flow presentation that added back certain cash costs. We changed this presentation, and in our earnings release, we adopted a traditional free cash flow definition of cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. We expect this will improve our focus on our true earnings power and will allow you to better understand our performance. As part of our focus on the business and cash optimization, we will continue our portfolio-shaping efforts to increase the focus on our core business. 
Fourth, we will reduce restructuring and TSI expense to approximately $550 million in FY '22 to under $100 million in FY '24, ultimately improving cash flow. Fifth, have a thoughtful and disciplined approach to capital allocation. As we generate free cash flow, we will appropriately deploy capital to invest in our business and return capital to our shareholders, all the while staying focused on maintaining our investment-grade credit rating. 
For the quarter, DXC exceeded the top end of our revenue, adjusted EBIT margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance. GAAP revenue was $4.39 billion, $85 million higher than the top end of our guidance. On an organic basis, revenue increased 0.4% sequentially. Organic revenue declined 7% year-over-year due to the previously disclosed runoffs and terminations. As we mentioned on our third quarter earnings call, our Q3 10.5% year-over-year decline would be the high watermark. 
GAAP EBIT margins were negative 16.8% in the fourth quarter, impacted by approximately $1.1 billion of costs, including pension mark-to-market, asset impairments, restructuring TSI, loss on disposals and debt extinguishment costs. Excluding these items, adjusted EBIT margin was 7.5% in the fourth quarter, an improvement of 50 basis points from the third quarter. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.74 and was negatively impacted by $0.04 due to a higher-than-expected tax rate of 32%. In Q4, bookings were $4.7 billion for a book-to-bill of 1.08, the fourth straight quarter of a book-to-bill greater than 1. For the full year, this takes our book-to-bill to 1.12 compared to 0.9 in FY '20. 
Turning now to our segment results. The GBS segment, the top half of our technology stack, includes analytics and engineering, applications in the horizontal BPS business. GBS was $2 billion or 46% of our total Q4 revenue. Organic revenues increased 2% sequentially, primarily reflecting the strength of our applications and analytics and engineering business. 
Year-over-year, GBS revenue was down 4% on an organic basis. GBS segment profit was $315 million with a 15.8% profit rate, up 160 basis points from Q3. GBS bookings for the quarter were $2.39 billion for a book-to-bill of 1.2 and a full year book-to-bill of 1.32 compared to 0.99 in the prior year. 
Now turning to our GIS segment, which consists of IT outsourcing, cloud and security and the modern workplace. Revenue was $2.39 billion, down 0.9% sequentially and down 9.3% year-over-year on an organic basis due to the previously disclosed terminations and runoffs. Our ITO business had positive sequential revenue growth in the quarter. The ITO business benefited from approximately $100 million of resale revenue, resulting from a typical Q4 increase of customer demand due to their fiscal year-end. GIS segment profit was $98 million with a profit margin of 4.1%, a 40 basis point margin improvement over the third quarter. GIS bookings were $2.3 billion for a book-to-bill of 0.98. Book-to-bill for FY '21 was 0.94 compared to 0.83 in the prior year. 
Now turning to one of my favorite slides, our enterprise technology stack. This slide demonstrates how winning in the market for 4 consecutive quarters translates into revenue stability and the progression that our team has been able to achieve by focusing on our customers. 
Before I get into the details, I want to provide you the 3 changes to the stack you can expect for next year. First, as we think about next year, you will see our sequential quarter comparison give way to a year-over-year comparison. Second, we delivered on the sale of the healthcare provider software business. Therefore, this will no longer be included. Third, the modern workplace and horizontal BPS businesses will be integrated into the enterprise technology stack above. Once again, we had 3 layers of the stack achieve a book-to-bill greater than 1 and sequential growth. 
Now let me drill down 1 level. IT Outsourcing revenue was $1.19 billion in the quarter, up 1.4%, the first positive sequential growth since we began tracking in this manner. ITO book-to-bill was 0.98 in the quarter. Cloud and security revenue was $524 million, declined 1.6% sequentially and was down 5.7% year-over-year. The cloud and security business had a difficult compare as the third quarter grew 4.7% sequentially. Book-to-bill was 1.08 in the quarter. Moving up the stack, the applications layer posted a 1.9% sequential growth and was down 7.2% year-over-year. Book-to-bill was 1.06. 
Analytics and engineering revenues were $478 million, up 2% on a sequential basis and up 8.4% compared to prior year. Analytics and engineering book-to-bill was 1.46 in the quarter. The modern workplace and BPS revenues were $795 million, down 3.3% sequentially and down 10.5% compared to the prior year. As we previously mentioned to you, these 2 businesses just began their transformation journey so you should expect some unevenness in performance. 
Moving on to cash flows on Slide 15. Fourth quarter cash flow from operations totaled an outflow of $280 million. Free cash flow for the year was negative $652 million, impacted primarily by 4 nonrecurring items: Q4 tax payments of $531 million related to the business sale. As you may recall, we planned $900 million of tax payments so this result surpassed our expectation. As we told you before, in Q3, $832 million related to readying the U.S. state and local Health and Human Services business for sale and normalizing payables; and $200 million related to deferrals of certain tax payments due to COVID relief legislation that will be paid during FY '22. 
One of our key initiatives we are employing to drive cash flow and improve earnings power is to wind down restructuring and TSI costs. Since DXC was formed 4 years ago, we had significant cash outflows with approximately $900 million in expense per year on average. In FY '22, this will be reduced to approximately $550 million, with a larger portion being allocated to facilities restructuring efforts to improve the work experience for our people as we reshape our portfolio for our virtual model. 
We have heard from many of our analysts and investors that our cash flow is hard to understand. As we previously discussed above, we changed our free cash flow presentation. We believe this will allow investors to better understand our performance. Second, we acknowledge our cash flow conversion does not correlate well to earnings. As part of our effort to build a sustainable business, we will continue to evaluate these historical practices of using capital leases to a much greater level, long-term purchase commitments and selling our receivables. Unwinding these historical practices may have an impact on short-term cash flow. We will also focus our efforts to build the necessary rigor associated with capital budgeting to better control our outsized capital spend. 
On Slide 17, we detail our efforts we have undertaken to strengthen our balance sheet. As you can see, we have achieved a lot in this area, reducing our net debt leverage ratio by more than 1 turn from the high watermark of 2.4 to 1 at the end of March. Another goal we gave you was to improve financial visibility, and we are committed to providing annual and longer-term 3-year guidance. 
Starting with our first quarter guidance on Slide 18. Organic revenues declines are expected to moderate, down 2% to down 4% in the first quarter year-over-year. This translates into reported revenues between $4.08 billion and $4.13 billion. Our sequential revenue is lower for 2 reasons: first, previously mentioned lumpiness of resale revenue that occurs in Q4; second, our portfolio-shaping efforts reduced revenue by about $100 million. EBIT margin 7.4% to 7.8% includes 20 basis points of margin headwinds due to the sale of our healthcare provider software business. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.72 to $0.76. 
Moving on to our FY '22 guidance on Slide 19. Organic revenue growth of minus 1% to minus 2%. On a year-over-year basis, divestitures will account for $1.2 billion of the revenue decline. Our previously disclosed terminations and runoffs wind down in the first half of FY '22. We expect to see further improvement in the quarterly year-over-year organic revenue growth rates as we move through the year. This translates into revenue of $16.6 billion to $16.8 billion. EBIT margin, 8.2% to 8.7%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.45 to $3.65, an increase of 42% to 50% year-over-year. Free cash flow of $500 million. 
Now moving on to our longer-term expectations on Slide 20. Organic revenue growth of 1% to 3%; adjusted EBIT margin of approximately 10% to 11%; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $5 to $5.25; free cash flow of approximately $1.5 billion. I should note our guidance does not anticipate additional portfolio shaping. With that, I will now turn the call back to Mike for his closing remarks."

First, as I reflect on FY '21, we delivered on our commitments and here's how. With regard to our people, we moved from a workforce that was not engaged to one that is now engaged and inspired. 
Concerning our customers, we went from challenged accounts to building a level of customer intimacy where we are delivering, building strong partnerships and being proactive with our customers. Customers are clearly seeing the new DXC. We changed the direction of our revenues and margin from declining to improving. In the market, we went from losing to winning, and we repaid over $6 billion in debt, taking our balance sheet from highly leveraged to strengthened. 
The next key takeaway is that FY '22 will be the year we build the foundation for growth. What that means is we will retain and continue to attract talent, we will build off our customer intimacy to deliver revenue stability and continue to win in the market all while we expand margins and deliver increased free cash flow. Finally, we expect to deliver positive organic revenue growth longer term. 
In closing, we are confident that the momentum we created in FY '21 will continue in FY '22. We hope that you will join us on June 17 for our Analyst Day as we're excited to showcase the strength and depth of our new leadership team and discuss our business in more detail. With that, operator, please open the call up for questions."

That along with what I said at the end around we got to deliver, we continue to improve those partnerships. And then now we're being proactive. 
Hence, the reason why we're starting to bring ideas around the blue, the analytics and also how to do application rationalization and so forth.

Now when I look at India, India is -- that's where roughly India and the Philippines is about 1/3 of our population. What's going on? I think we've done a fantastic job actually being very proactive with how to deal with that situation as we immediately went and doubled our benefits, we secured beds and supplies for our folks over there. We gave additional financial support for our families. And then now we're working on getting vaccines for our colleagues.

Hence, the reason why we continue to look at some of the cost savings and the cost savings initiatives. 
As it relates to employees though, I always go back to employee morale. That's employee engagement. You all can see a lot of the numbers, like I said, on Glassdoor and Comparably. What I can tell you is our employee engagement has significantly increased over the last 12 months. It's not only increased by what our folks are saying about what's going on but also how many people actually take the survey, which is huge because if you can't even get people to engage in taking the survey, then it's a little hard for us to understand what we need to do to inspire them. So that's the way I would say that. 
On top of that, the other nugget I will give you is we've gone from having to proactively reach out to go get talent to now our folks are getting proactive calls to want to join the journey.

One of the things that we have is we've got a couple of things that we've never talked about before. I look at the analytics and engineering piece, and over half of that business is something that the market doesn't talk much about and that's called data cleansing. 
A lot of people want to talk about AI and machine learning and data analytics and so forth. But where those projects, Darrin, get curtailed is you can't scale a lot of that stuff because the data is not clean. And what we can do with the data cleansing efforts that we have is pretty impressive and we do it for some of the biggest names in the industry.

I had a follow-on question on bookings and the relation -- how we should think about the relationship between book-to-bill and revenue growth, just noting that trailing 12-month book-to-bill now is 1.12x, as you called out, but then you're still guiding for the upcoming fiscal year to, obviously, a major improvement but still year-on-year declines in revenue. So how do we think about that relationship? I guess, that means that there's like a backlog in there that kind of needs to be refilled? What's sort of the lag time? Or can you give some color on sort of the relationship between book-to-bill and revenue growth?"

Second thing is when I think about book-to-bill, it's split into 2 ways, and that's why I specifically call out 53% is new work. That's work we've never seen before, and 47% is renewals. 
My focus with our leadership team is to show the market that this revenue is not going away from us anymore, and that we are closing that gap that I called out in FY '21 in terms of the lost revenue. And I think we're doing a very, very good job doing that, as you can see that the trajectory is pretty significant, calling out minus 9.6% to minus 1% to minus 2%."

So back to your specific question, when I think about what we're doing with our talent, now what we're doing is filling in the next layer underneath the direct reports of my management team. And that's where I mentioned to Darrin to say what's pretty neat is to see that people want to join us now. One of the things, I think, early on that I discussed on this call was, ""Hey, Mike, can you really attract talent to DXC?"" And we've done that. And now the momentum in the market that we're showing, people want to join something that's got positive momentum. So I look forward to seeing the new talent that's going to come our way in fiscal year '22."

The second one is customers. We've talked a lot about that. We began the year talking about challenged accounts, and here we are, we're finishing the year talking about customer intimacy. And on June 17, you all won't have to listen to me anymore. We're stacking up clients' videos to talk about the transformations that we're doing for them, meaning moving up the stack.

I'd be remiss if I didn't talk about revenue and margin. The trajectory there is going in the right direction. The fourth one is winning in the marketplace, going from losing to winning.

Today's agenda will start by giving you a quick update on our strong Q4 performance. Next, I will highlight the progress we are making on our transformation journey. Our strong Q4 results were driven by executing on the 3 key areas of our transformation journey, which are focused on our customers, optimize cost and seize the market. I will then hand the call over to Ken to share our detailed Q4 financial results, guidance for FY '22 and longer-term outlook. Finally, I will make some closing remarks before opening the call up for questions. 
Regarding our Q4 performance, our revenues were $4.39 billion, approximately $85 million above the top end of our guidance. This is the third straight quarter of revenue stabilization and we expect this trend to continue in FY '22. Concerning adjusted EBIT margin, we delivered 7.5%, also higher than the top end of our guidance. This, too, is the third straight quarter of sequential margin expansion and is driven by our cost optimization program. We expect margins to continue to expand in Q1 of FY '22. 
Book-to-bill for the quarter was 1.08, underscoring the success of bringing the new DXC, which focuses on our customers and colleagues to the market. This is the fourth straight quarter that we've delivered a 1.0 or better book-to-bill. We expect our success of winning in the market to continue in Q1 of FY '22. 
I am pleased with the momentum we have achieved. All the work in FY '21 to inspire our people, invest in our customers, take costs out without disruption and win in the market has positioned us very well for financial success in FY '22 and longer term. Now I will cover the good progress we are making on our transformation journey, starting with our customers. 
Our investment in our customers continues to be the primary driver of revenue stabilization. When we deliver for our customers and are seen as a trusted partner, customers are more likely to renew existing work and consider us for new work. Let me give you an example. We recently signed a 5-year expansion with Zurich Insurance Group. We'll provide IT outsourcing and security services as part of their global IT transformation, focused on improving the customer and employee experience. This is a perfect example of delivering for a customer, strengthening the relationship and then a customer wanting to work with DXC in the future. This is strong evidence that our investment in our customers is paying off, which gives us confidence that we can flatten organic revenue during FY '22. 
Now let me turn to our cost optimization program. We have achieved our goal of $550 million of cost savings in FY '21. Our cost optimization program was responsible for the strong adjusted EBIT margin of 7.5% in Q4. We have done well optimizing our costs and continuing to deliver for our customers without disruption. You will hear from Ken that we expect to continue to expand margins in FY '22. 
Seize the market is the final area of our transformation journey. In this area, we are focused on cross-selling to our existing accounts and winning new work. So the 1.08 book-to-bill that we delivered this quarter is consistent evidence that our plan is working. In Q4, 53% of our bookings were new work and 47% were renewals. 
Ahold Delhaize is a great example of an existing customer who has renewed work with DXC and given us new work. We will be providing infrastructure services, application outsourcing, cloud migration and workplace services in a hybrid cloud environment for the retail business services group, to reduce costs and support their business-critical systems that enable each of their local brands to stock their shelves. 
Our ability to deliver a consistent book-to-bill of over 1.0 in each of the 4 quarters of FY '21 is clear evidence that we can win in the IT services industry. This is translating into improving quarterly organic revenue growth, which we expect will flatten during FY '22. 
Now before I turn the call over to Ken, I would like to thank our colleagues, our customers and our shareholders for their support. As we are witnessing the ongoing impact of COVID-19, our focus continues to be on our people. Currently, we are focused on the more severely impacted areas of India and the Philippines. The dedication of our team is a source of great pride for us at DXC as our people continue to take care of themselves, their families and to deliver for our customers. Now let me turn the call over to Ken."
263093,714625177,2301303,"DXC Technology Company, Q4 2021 Earnings Call, May 26, 2021",2021-05-26,"Earnings Calls","DXC Technology Company","Executives","Thank you, Mike. In the past 3 quarters, we have stabilized our revenue on a sequential basis and guided to the fourth quarter of revenue stability. This is a significant accomplishment by my DXC colleagues. It is not lost on Mike and me that investors lo",1779,"Thank you, Mike. In the past 3 quarters, we have stabilized our revenue on a sequential basis and guided to the fourth quarter of revenue stability. This is a significant accomplishment by my DXC colleagues. It is not lost on Mike and me that investors look at revenue growth on a year-over-year basis. However, when a company has a period of significant decline and change to its business, strategy and leadership, you first have to stabilize revenue sequentially. As we all know, once you achieve 4 quarters of sequential revenue stability, you achieve year-over-year revenue stability. Going forward, we will pivot our narrative accordingly. 
Turning on to our financial priorities on Slide 10. We are working to build a stronger financial foundation and drive the company in a disciplined and rigorous fashion to unleash the true earnings power. To that end, remediating our material weakness and the impact it has on our corporate governance is a key focus. 
Our second priority is to have a strong balance sheet. We paid down $6.5 billion of debt in the past 9 months and subsequent to year-end, retired an additional $500 million. We are now approaching a far more manageable $5 billion debt level. Further, we have relatively low maturities over the next 3 years. We remain committed to an investment-grade credit profile, and I believe our actions more than demonstrate our commitment. 
Third, we will focus on improving cash flow. The company previously provided an adjusted cash flow presentation that added back certain cash costs. We changed this presentation, and in our earnings release, we adopted a traditional free cash flow definition of cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. We expect this will improve our focus on our true earnings power and will allow you to better understand our performance. As part of our focus on the business and cash optimization, we will continue our portfolio-shaping efforts to increase the focus on our core business. 
Fourth, we will reduce restructuring and TSI expense to approximately $550 million in FY '22 to under $100 million in FY '24, ultimately improving cash flow. Fifth, have a thoughtful and disciplined approach to capital allocation. As we generate free cash flow, we will appropriately deploy capital to invest in our business and return capital to our shareholders, all the while staying focused on maintaining our investment-grade credit rating. 
For the quarter, DXC exceeded the top end of our revenue, adjusted EBIT margin and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance. GAAP revenue was $4.39 billion, $85 million higher than the top end of our guidance. On an organic basis, revenue increased 0.4% sequentially. Organic revenue declined 7% year-over-year due to the previously disclosed runoffs and terminations. As we mentioned on our third quarter earnings call, our Q3 10.5% year-over-year decline would be the high watermark. 
GAAP EBIT margins were negative 16.8% in the fourth quarter, impacted by approximately $1.1 billion of costs, including pension mark-to-market, asset impairments, restructuring TSI, loss on disposals and debt extinguishment costs. Excluding these items, adjusted EBIT margin was 7.5% in the fourth quarter, an improvement of 50 basis points from the third quarter. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.74 and was negatively impacted by $0.04 due to a higher-than-expected tax rate of 32%. In Q4, bookings were $4.7 billion for a book-to-bill of 1.08, the fourth straight quarter of a book-to-bill greater than 1. For the full year, this takes our book-to-bill to 1.12 compared to 0.9 in FY '20. 
Turning now to our segment results. The GBS segment, the top half of our technology stack, includes analytics and engineering, applications in the horizontal BPS business. GBS was $2 billion or 46% of our total Q4 revenue. Organic revenues increased 2% sequentially, primarily reflecting the strength of our applications and analytics and engineering business. 
Year-over-year, GBS revenue was down 4% on an organic basis. GBS segment profit was $315 million with a 15.8% profit rate, up 160 basis points from Q3. GBS bookings for the quarter were $2.39 billion for a book-to-bill of 1.2 and a full year book-to-bill of 1.32 compared to 0.99 in the prior year. 
Now turning to our GIS segment, which consists of IT outsourcing, cloud and security and the modern workplace. Revenue was $2.39 billion, down 0.9% sequentially and down 9.3% year-over-year on an organic basis due to the previously disclosed terminations and runoffs. Our ITO business had positive sequential revenue growth in the quarter. The ITO business benefited from approximately $100 million of resale revenue, resulting from a typical Q4 increase of customer demand due to their fiscal year-end. GIS segment profit was $98 million with a profit margin of 4.1%, a 40 basis point margin improvement over the third quarter. GIS bookings were $2.3 billion for a book-to-bill of 0.98. Book-to-bill for FY '21 was 0.94 compared to 0.83 in the prior year. 
Now turning to one of my favorite slides, our enterprise technology stack. This slide demonstrates how winning in the market for 4 consecutive quarters translates into revenue stability and the progression that our team has been able to achieve by focusing on our customers. 
Before I get into the details, I want to provide you the 3 changes to the stack you can expect for next year. First, as we think about next year, you will see our sequential quarter comparison give way to a year-over-year comparison. Second, we delivered on the sale of the healthcare provider software business. Therefore, this will no longer be included. Third, the modern workplace and horizontal BPS businesses will be integrated into the enterprise technology stack above. Once again, we had 3 layers of the stack achieve a book-to-bill greater than 1 and sequential growth. 
Now let me drill down 1 level. IT Outsourcing revenue was $1.19 billion in the quarter, up 1.4%, the first positive sequential growth since we began tracking in this manner. ITO book-to-bill was 0.98 in the quarter. Cloud and security revenue was $524 million, declined 1.6% sequentially and was down 5.7% year-over-year. The cloud and security business had a difficult compare as the third quarter grew 4.7% sequentially. Book-to-bill was 1.08 in the quarter. Moving up the stack, the applications layer posted a 1.9% sequential growth and was down 7.2% year-over-year. Book-to-bill was 1.06. 
Analytics and engineering revenues were $478 million, up 2% on a sequential basis and up 8.4% compared to prior year. Analytics and engineering book-to-bill was 1.46 in the quarter. The modern workplace and BPS revenues were $795 million, down 3.3% sequentially and down 10.5% compared to the prior year. As we previously mentioned to you, these 2 businesses just began their transformation journey so you should expect some unevenness in performance. 
Moving on to cash flows on Slide 15. Fourth quarter cash flow from operations totaled an outflow of $280 million. Free cash flow for the year was negative $652 million, impacted primarily by 4 nonrecurring items: Q4 tax payments of $531 million related to the business sale. As you may recall, we planned $900 million of tax payments so this result surpassed our expectation. As we told you before, in Q3, $832 million related to readying the U.S. state and local Health and Human Services business for sale and normalizing payables; and $200 million related to deferrals of certain tax payments due to COVID relief legislation that will be paid during FY '22. 
One of our key initiatives we are employing to drive cash flow and improve earnings power is to wind down restructuring and TSI costs. Since DXC was formed 4 years ago, we had significant cash outflows with approximately $900 million in expense per year on average. In FY '22, this will be reduced to approximately $550 million, with a larger portion being allocated to facilities restructuring efforts to improve the work experience for our people as we reshape our portfolio for our virtual model. 
We have heard from many of our analysts and investors that our cash flow is hard to understand. As we previously discussed above, we changed our free cash flow presentation. We believe this will allow investors to better understand our performance. Second, we acknowledge our cash flow conversion does not correlate well to earnings. As part of our effort to build a sustainable business, we will continue to evaluate these historical practices of using capital leases to a much greater level, long-term purchase commitments and selling our receivables. Unwinding these historical practices may have an impact on short-term cash flow. We will also focus our efforts to build the necessary rigor associated with capital budgeting to better control our outsized capital spend. 
On Slide 17, we detail our efforts we have undertaken to strengthen our balance sheet. As you can see, we have achieved a lot in this area, reducing our net debt leverage ratio by more than 1 turn from the high watermark of 2.4 to 1 at the end of March. Another goal we gave you was to improve financial visibility, and we are committed to providing annual and longer-term 3-year guidance. 
Starting with our first quarter guidance on Slide 18. Organic revenues declines are expected to moderate, down 2% to down 4% in the first quarter year-over-year. This translates into reported revenues between $4.08 billion and $4.13 billion. Our sequential revenue is lower for 2 reasons: first, previously mentioned lumpiness of resale revenue that occurs in Q4; second, our portfolio-shaping efforts reduced revenue by about $100 million. EBIT margin 7.4% to 7.8% includes 20 basis points of margin headwinds due to the sale of our healthcare provider software business. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.72 to $0.76. 
Moving on to our FY '22 guidance on Slide 19. Organic revenue growth of minus 1% to minus 2%. On a year-over-year basis, divestitures will account for $1.2 billion of the revenue decline. Our previously disclosed terminations and runoffs wind down in the first half of FY '22. We expect to see further improvement in the quarterly year-over-year organic revenue growth rates as we move through the year. This translates into revenue of $16.6 billion to $16.8 billion. EBIT margin, 8.2% to 8.7%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.45 to $3.65, an increase of 42% to 50% year-over-year. Free cash flow of $500 million. 
Now moving on to our longer-term expectations on Slide 20. Organic revenue growth of 1% to 3%; adjusted EBIT margin of approximately 10% to 11%; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $5 to $5.25; free cash flow of approximately $1.5 billion. I should note our guidance does not anticipate additional portfolio shaping. With that, I will now turn the call back to Mike for his closing remarks."

First, as I reflect on FY '21, we delivered on our commitments and here's how. With regard to our people, we moved from a workforce that was not engaged to one that is now engaged and inspired. 
Concerning our customers, we went from challenged accounts to building a level of customer intimacy where we are delivering, building strong partnerships and being proactive with our customers. Customers are clearly seeing the new DXC. We changed the direction of our revenues and margin from declining to improving. In the market, we went from losing to winning, and we repaid over $6 billion in debt, taking our balance sheet from highly leveraged to strengthened. 
The next key takeaway is that FY '22 will be the year we build the foundation for growth. What that means is we will retain and continue to attract talent, we will build off our customer intimacy to deliver revenue stability and continue to win in the market all while we expand margins and deliver increased free cash flow. Finally, we expect to deliver positive organic revenue growth longer term. 
In closing, we are confident that the momentum we created in FY '21 will continue in FY '22. We hope that you will join us on June 17 for our Analyst Day as we're excited to showcase the strength and depth of our new leadership team and discuss our business in more detail.

We also just delivered 6.2% adjusted EBIT margin for FY '21, and I'm guiding now towards 8.2% to 8.7%. So then I sit there and I look at it and go, all right, EPS, same drill, $2.43. I'm guiding to $3.45 to $3.65. And then if that's not enough, then I sit there and go, all right, now we're delivering on the restructuring and TSI commitment we said, which we are going to go after reducing that $900 million to $550 million and also paying down debt.

Now when I look at India, India is -- that's where roughly India and the Philippines is about 1/3 of our population. What's going on? I think we've done a fantastic job actually being very proactive with how to deal with that situation as we immediately went and doubled our benefits, we secured beds and supplies for our folks over there.

Hence, the reason why we continue to look at some of the cost savings and the cost savings initiatives. 
As it relates to employees, though, I always go back to employee morale. That's employee engagement. You all can see a lot of the numbers, like I said, on Glassdoor and Comparably. What I can tell you is our employee engagement has significantly increased over the last 12 months. It's not only increased by what our folks are saying about what's going on but also how many people actually take the survey, which is huge because if you can't even get people to engage in taking the survey, then it's a little hard for us to understand what we need to do to inspire them. So that's the way I would say that. 
On top of that, the other nugget I will give you is we've gone from having to proactively reach out to go get talent to now our folks are getting proactive calls to want to join the journey. And there's nothing more inspiring for a management team when you have good talent reaching out to say, ""Hey, I want to be a part of this."""

A lot of people want to talk about AI and machine learning and data analytics and so forth. But where those projects, Darrin, get curtailed is you can't scale a lot of that stuff because the data is not clean.

So back to your specific question, when I think about what we're doing with our talent, now what we're doing is filling in the next layer underneath the direct reports of my management team. And that's where I mentioned to Darrin to say what's pretty neat is to see that people want to join us now. 
One of the things, I think, early on that I discussed on this call was, ""Hey, Mike, can you really attract talent to DXC?"" And we've done that. And now the momentum in the market that we're showing, people want to join something that's got positive momentum. So I look forward to seeing the new talent that's going to come our way in fiscal year '22."

And then the fourth one, Bryan, is around what the node refers to as AI operations. So that's the automation of what we do in our facilities. So we totally delivered on the $550 million and what I'll do is call out, again, we just delivered 6.2%. So when we guide to 8.2% to 8.7%, that says we should be doing just as much next year.

The second one is customers. We've talked a lot about that. We began the year talking about challenged accounts, and here we are, we're finishing the year talking about customer intimacy. And on June 17, you all won't have to listen to me anymore. We're stacking up clients' videos to talk about the transformations that we're doing for them, meaning moving up the stack. So when I talk about we've delivered for clients, when I've talked about we're building strong relationships, that's pretty remarkable in terms of what we've turned around over the last 12 months. 
I'd be remiss if I didn't talk about revenue and margin. The trajectory there is going in the right direction. The fourth one is winning in the marketplace, going from losing to winning. And then cleaning up that balance sheet, Rod, was huge. And even with Ken coming aboard and just the stuff we did within the last quarter, just continues to position us for stronger strength moving forward.

Today's agenda will begin with a quick update on our solid Q1 performance, which continues to show that revenue, adjusted EBIT margin, book-to-bill and non-GAAP EPS all have a positive trajectory compared to past quarters. 
During our Investor Day in June, we gave you additional insights into the steps of our transformation journey. And those steps are inspire and take care of our colleagues, focus on our customers, optimize costs, seize the market and build a strong financial foundation. I will give updates on each step and then hand the call over to Ken to share our Q1 financial results, guidance and more details on how we are building a strong financial foundation. Finally, I will make some closing remarks before opening the call up for questions. 
Regarding our Q1 performance, our revenues were $4.14 billion, and our adjusted EBIT margin was 8%. This represents the fourth straight quarter of both revenue stabilization and sequential margin expansion, and we expect both trends to continue in Q2. Book-to-bill for the quarter was 1.12. This is the fifth straight quarter [indiscernible] better book-to-bill [indiscernible] some markets to continue in Q2. Our non-GAAP EPS was $0.84 in the quarter, which is up 300% as compared to $0.21 that we delivered in Q1 of FY '21. The positive trajectory of all 4 of these numbers gives us confidence that our playbook is working. 
As a refresher, our playbook has 3 phases. The stabilization phase was completed in FY '21. This phase enabled us to make great progress with our colleagues, customers, on revenue, margin, book-to-bill and reducing our debt. We are now focused on the foundation phase. This phase focuses on the steps that will allow us to deliver growth. The goals of this phase are: first, continue to increase our employee engagement, all while we attract and retain highly talented colleagues; second, stabilized year-on-year organic revenue; third, expand adjusted EBIT margins; fourth, consistently deliver a book-to-bill number of 1.0 or greater, with a nice mix of new work and renewals; and finally, under Ken's leadership, deliver a financial foundation that increases discipline and improves our cash flow and earnings power. 
Now I will discuss the good progress we are making on each step of our transformation journey, beginning with inspire and take care of our colleagues. We are executing a people first strategy. Attracting and retaining talent is fundamental to enable our growth. Our refreshed leadership team has deep industry experience and is delivering. Brenda, who is our Chief Marketing Officer, is our newest addition. Brenda is a strategic results-oriented leader who brings deep marketing experience to DXC. 75% of our leadership team is now new to DXC and bringing in talent based on their personal credibility as talent follows talent. What the team is finding is that the new DXC story is resonating in the market, and new hires are wanting to join DXC because they see the opportunity to progress their careers with a company that's on the right trajectory. 
We mentioned during our investor call that nearly 50% of our vice presidents across the company are new to DXC within the last 22 months. Also, we are investing in our people. This quarter, we rewarded high performance by paying annual bonuses that benefited roughly 45,000 of our colleagues. In Q2, we are planning merit increases that will benefit roughly 77,000 of our colleagues. In addition to these investments, we are doing a great job of taking care of our colleagues and their families during the pandemic. This focus on our colleagues is unique and builds trust with them, increases employee engagement, allows us to compete for talent and enables us to deliver for our customers. 
Focus on our customers is the second step of our transformation journey. Our investment in our customers is the primary driver of revenue stabilization. During the Investor Day presentation, I couldn't be more proud to have you hear from American Airlines, FedEx, P&G, Lloyd's, Brighthouse, Deutsche Bank, Campbell's and Microsoft. And I want to thank them again for their support and partnership. 
It was clear from their comments that the new DXC story is resonating with them because we are delivering. These are all large global companies, and they are saying that their IT estates are important. In fact, they use the word critical. Our strategy of delivering ITO services builds customer intimacy and develops trust that when our customers want to further transform their business, they turn to us, and allows us to move them up the enterprise technology stack. 
Additional evidence that our strategy is working is the nice progress we have made on our GBS business, along with the cloud and security layer of our GIS business. All of this gives us confidence that we will deliver on our financial commitments. 
Now let me turn to our cost optimization program. We continue to do well, optimizing our costs and delivering for our customers without disruption. We are focused on 4 cost levers, which are contractor conversion, real estate, scaling our GIDCs and automation through Platform X. These levers have helped us expand our margin going from 7.5% last quarter to 8% this quarter. You will hear from Ken that we expect to continue to expand margins in Q2. 
Next, [indiscernible] the market is where we are focused on cross-selling to our existing customers and winning new work. The 1.12 book-to-bill that we delivered this quarter is [indiscernible] that our plan is working. In Q1, 57% of our bookings were new work and 43% were renewals. You will see that we are running specific sales campaigns. An example of these campaigns is ITO modernization, which is focused on improving the performance of our customers' IT estates. Another example is our campaign to show our customers how to think about cloud, which combines on-prem, private cloud and public cloud technology. Our ability to deliver a consistent book-to-bill of 1.0 in each of the last 5 quarters is evidence that these sales campaigns are working and that we can win in the IT services industry. This momentum and success in the market gives us confidence that we will deliver another book-to-bill of 1.0 or greater in Q2. 
Now let me turn the call over to Ken."

For the quarter, DXC exceeded the top end of our revenue, margin and earnings guidance, and continue to deliver a strong book-to-bill. GAAP revenue was $4.14 billion, $10 million higher than the top end of our guidance range. Adjusted EBIT margin was 8% in the quarter, an improvement of 380 basis points as compared to the prior quarter. In Q1, bookings were $4.6 billion for a book-to-bill of 1.12, the fifth straight quarter of a book-to-bill greater than 1. 
Moving on to Slide 13. Our Q1 non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.84 or $0.08 higher than the top end of our guidance, benefiting $0.05 from a lower tax rate. Restructuring and TSI expenses were $76 million, down 58% from prior year. 
Free cash flow was a use of cash of $304 million as compared to a use of cash of $106 million in the prior year. We expect free cash flow to improve significantly as the year progresses. 
As the next slide shows, our Q1 FY '22 performance continues our trajectory as we deliver on our transformation journey. Starting with organic growth progression, we went from approximately 10% decline in the first 3 quarters of FY '21 to down 6.5% in the fourth quarter and now down to a decline of 3.7%. This is a 40% improvement from the prior quarter. 
Let me highlight our organic revenue growth calculation and our prior year earnings releases was structured to provide the year-over-year deconstruction of revenue changes into FX, acquisitions, dispositions and organic compared to prior period GAAP revenue. 
Our previous organic revenue growth calculation was not performed in this manner. As a result, we have revised the organic growth rates for the prior year periods in our earnings deck and have further supplemented our organic calculation to include all the information to support the calculation, providing you complete transparency. This change does not yield a meaningful difference to our historically reported organic revenue growth rates, trajectory or guidance. 
Adjusted EBIT margin expanded 380 basis points. Excluding the impact of dispositions, margin expanded almost 600 basis points. We continue to market with consecutive quarters of a book-to-bill greater than 1. And lastly, non-GAAP earnings per share quadrupled. 
Now moving to our GBS business, composed of analytics and engineering, applications and business process services. Revenue was $1.9 billion in the quarter. Organic revenue growth was positive 2% as compared to prior year. In terms of quarterly progression, organic revenues declined about 6% to 7% in the first 3 quarters of FY '21, declined 3.4% in the fourth quarter and turned to positive 2% this quarter. GBS segment profit was $272 million with a 14.4% profit rate, up 450 basis points from the prior year. GBS bookings for the quarter were $2.4 billion for a book-to-bill of 1.29. 
As you have seen for a number of quarters, the demand for our GBS offerings, the top half of our technology stack have been quite robust and now yielding positive organic revenue growth. 
Turning to our GIS segment, consisting of IT outsourcing, cloud and security, and modern workplace. Revenue was $2.3 billion, down 9.1% year-over-year on an organic basis. We are seeing the rate of decline moderate this quarter despite the headwinds from our modern workplace [indiscernible]. GIS segment profit was [indiscernible] with a profit margin of 5.8%, a 480 basis point margin improvement over the prior year quarter. GIS bookings were $2.2 billion for a book-to-bill of 0.97 compared to 0.77 in the prior year. 
It is safe to say revenues continue to stabilize and demonstrate that with improved customer intimacy and delivery, our revenue is not running away, allowing us to build our growth foundation. 
Now I will break down our segment results, GBS and GIS, into the layers of our enterprise technology stack, starting with GBS. Analytics and engineering revenues were $482 million, up 12.9% as compared to prior year. We continue to see high demand for our offerings with a book-to-bill of 1.32 in the quarter. Applications also continue to demonstrate solid progress with revenue of $1.246 billion, growing organically almost 1%. Applications also continues its strong book-to-bill at 1.32. 
Business process services revenues were $118 million, down 13% compared to the prior year quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.13. Cloud and security revenue was $549 million, up 4.9% as compared to the prior year. The cloud business is benefiting from increased demand of [indiscernible] offerings. Book-to-bill was [indiscernible] in the quarter. 
IT outsourcing revenue was $1.13 billion, down 9% as compared to prior year. To put this decline in perspective, last year, this business declined almost 20% year-over-year. We expect this momentum to continue in organic declines to further abate as the year progresses. 
Modern workplace revenues were $577 million, down 19.7% as compared to prior year. Book-to-bill was 1.0 in the quarter. As you may recall, modern workplace was part of our strategic alternatives and was not part of our transformation journey until recently. As a result, we previously disclosed that the performance would be uneven as we invest in the business, enhancing our offerings and innovating the end-user experience. As our transformation journey takes hold, we expect modern workplace performance to improve similar to the trend we have seen with our IPO business. 
One of our key initiatives to drive cash flow and improve earnings power is to wind down restructuring and TSI costs. We expect to reduce this from an average of $900 million per year over the last 4 years to $550 million in FY '22 and about $100 million in FY '24. 
On Slide 19, we detail our efforts to strengthen our balance sheet. We are proud of what we achieved [indiscernible] front, reducing our debt by [indiscernible], improving our net debt leverage ratio to 0.9x. Further, we have reached our targeted debt level of $5 billion with relatively low maturities through FY '24. 
From our improved balance sheet, let's move to cash flow for the quarter. First quarter cash flow from operations totaled an outflow of $29 million. Free cash flow for the quarter was negative $304 million. As you likely realize, with Mike's leadership, we will continue to make decisions to better position the company for the longer term, creating a sustainable business. Certain of these decisions impacted cash flow this quarter. As our guidance anticipated, we plan to take certain actions that impacted the Q1 cash flow. We remain on track to deliver our full year free cash flow guidance of $500 million. 
Let's now turn to our financial priorities on Slide 21. We are working to build a stronger financial foundation and use that base to drive the company forward in a disciplined and rigorous fashion, unleashing DXC's true earnings power. Our second priority is to have a strong balance sheet. We achieved our targeted debt level. We are encouraged by our almost 50% year-over-year interest expense reduction. We continue to focus on reducing interest expense and are evaluating refinancing options given the advantageous interest rate environment. 
Third, we will focus on improving cash flow. During the quarter, we paid $88 million to draw to conclusion a long-standing $3 billion take-or-pay contract for IT hardware. These types of contracts are not efficient, and we are reducing our exposure. Additionally, we paid down $300 million of capital leases and asset financing in order to allow us to dispose of IP hardware purchased under the previously mentioned take-or-pay arrangement and realizing tax deduction once we dispose of the unutilized assets. 
Given our relatively low borrowing cost, it makes less sense to enter into capital leases as the borrowing costs are higher and creates other complexities. We continue to reduce capital lease and asset financing origination from approximately $1.1 billion in FY '20 to $450 million in FY '21 and believe that we will remain at that level or lower for FY '22. 
As we continue to curtail capital lease origination, our average quarterly lease payment will reduce from about $230 million a quarter in FY '21 to about $170 million near term. Our efforts to limit capital leases does create upward pressure on capital expenditures. Though, on balance, we expect to reduce cash outflows for both capital leases and capital expenditures over time. 
Lastly, we terminated our German AR securitization program, negatively impacting cash flow by $114 million [indiscernible]. Going forward, this [indiscernible] interest savings [indiscernible] our balance sheet, but more importantly, it will bring us closer to our customers as cash collections is tied to their success. 
Fourth, we will reduce restructuring and TSI expense improving our cash flow. 
Fifth, as we generate free cash flow, we will appropriately deploy capital to invest in our business and return capital to our shareholders, all the while continuing to maintain our investment-grade credit profile. During the quarter, we executed $67 million of stock buybacks to offset dilution, taking advantage of what we believe was an attractive valuation in the market. 
I should note, we continue to make progress with our efforts to optimize our portfolio, unlocking value as we divest noncore assets, including both businesses and facilities. We expect to continue these efforts. Our results today include the benefit from the sale of assets, partially offset by other discrete items, and the headwind of 30 basis points of margin associated with the disposition of our health care provider software business. 
Moving on to second quarter guidance on Slide 22. Revenues between $4.08 billion and $4.13 billion. This translates into organic revenue declines of down 1% to down 3%. Adjusted EBIT margins of 8% to 8.4%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.80 to $0.84. 
As we look forward to the [indiscernible], I would note that we expect [indiscernible] of tax payments in Q2 related to the gains on dispositions. We also updated our FY '22 interest guidance to approximately $180 million, a $20 million improvement, and reduced our full year non-GAAP tax rate by 200 basis points to 26%. 
As noted on Slides 23 and 24, we are reaffirming our FY '22 and longer-term guidance. Lastly, we expect to see further improvement in the quarterly year-over-year organic revenue growth rates as we move through the year. 
With that, I will now turn the call back to Mike for his closing remarks."

And that's because, look, we're focused on taking care of our customers' IT estates, which they think are incredibly important. When we do that, I've been very consistent that we'll build customer intimacy. When we build that customer intimacy, they will turn to us for new work. That's why the book-to-bill continues to be over 1.0. So what we're seeing in that space is we're seeing the need in the IT estates to do the maintenance. And then, like I said, we're running sales campaigns to move them to the cloud. 
If you go back to our Investor Day, both American Airlines, for example, along with FedEx, talked about us moving them to the cloud. When we think cloud, it will be a combination of on-prem, private and public. Those are the 3 technologies we'll put together. 
So when I think GIS, those businesses are going well. What we have there is we have to continue to turn around modern workplace, and that's going to be on the same path that the ITO business was. That's why I like when Ken was saying that a year ago, ITO was roughly [indiscernible] negative 20% and now it's minus [indiscernible] expect workplace to do something similar. 
Now when we talk about moving off the stack, you can see our numbers in GBS. Analytics and engineering outstanding, right? That growth there not only is good, but we expect it to continue with the book-to-bill at 1.32. And then same with applications, applications should continue to get better. 
So Bryan, look, that's the way we're looking at the business. The focus is continue to move our clients up to stack. And the biggest thing there is making sure that we take care of not only what they have today, but also where they want to go tomorrow."

Real estate, we will [indiscernible] one of our strategies is to implement a workforce. That's one of the things that we like about our modern workplace solution. We're implementing our own modern workplace solution on ourselves. And therefore, we're allowed under Ken's leadership to drive down our real estate cost. So that will also continue. 
Now the last 2 are the keys because as you stabilize all these customers and you don't have service delivery issues anymore, in fact, our customers say, our delivery is silent now, which means we're performing, that's when you can take the next 2 clicks at the operations. And the first one is you got to scale your centers. And in the past, we had not done that. So what you're seeing is we've got roughly around 20 key global information -- or innovation delivery centers. That's what we're scaling. And then on top of that, Platform X is where we're automating a lot of that manual work away.

So think about it, ITO last year, minus -- roughly minus 20. Now it's minus 9 and continue trending in the right direction, and it hovered in sort of the mid-teens -- negative mid-teens last year. That's what I see modern workplace doing throughout this year and then turning.

Today's agenda will begin with a quick update on our solid Q1 performance, which continues to show that revenue, adjusted EBIT margin, book-to-bill and non-GAAP EPS all have a positive trajectory compared to past quarters. 
During our Investor Day in June, we gave you additional insights into the steps of our transformation journey. And those steps are inspire and take care of our colleagues, focus on our customers, optimize costs, seize the market and build a strong financial foundation. I will give updates on each step and then hand the call over to Ken to share our Q1 financial results, guidance and more details on how we are building a strong financial foundation. Finally, I will make some closing remarks before opening the call up for questions. 
Regarding our Q1 performance, our revenues were $4.14 billion, and our adjusted EBIT margin was 8%. This represents the fourth straight quarter of both revenue stabilization and sequential margin expansion, and we expect both trends to continue in Q2. Book-to-bill for the quarter was 1.12. This is the fifth straight quarter that we have delivered a 1.0 or better book-to-bill, and we expect  our success on winning in the market to continue in Q2. Our non-GAAP EPS was $0.84 in the quarter, which is up 300% as compared to $0.21 that we delivered in Q1 of FY '21. The positive trajectory of all 4 of these numbers gives us confidence that our playbook is working. 
As a refresher, our playbook has 3 phases. The stabilization phase was completed in FY '21. This phase enabled us to make great progress with our colleagues, customers, on revenue, margin, book-to-bill and reducing our debt. We are now focused on the foundation phase. This phase focuses on the steps that will allow us to deliver growth. The goals of this phase are: first, continue to increase our employee engagement, all while we attract and retain highly talented colleagues; second, stabilized year-on-year organic revenue; third, expand adjusted EBIT margins; fourth, consistently deliver a book-to-bill number of 1.0 or greater, with a nice mix of new work and renewals; and finally, under Ken's leadership, deliver a financial foundation that increases discipline and improves our cash flow and earnings power. 
Now I will discuss the good progress we are making on each step of our transformation journey, beginning with inspire and take care of our colleagues. We are executing a people first strategy. Attracting and retaining talent is fundamental to enable our growth. Our refreshed leadership team has deep industry experience and is delivering. Brenda, who is our Chief Marketing Officer, is our newest addition. Brenda is a strategic results-oriented leader who brings deep marketing experience to DXC. 75% of our leadership team is now new to DXC and bringing in talent based on their personal credibility as talent follows talent. What the team is finding is that the new DXC story is resonating in the market, and new hires are wanting to join DXC because they see the opportunity to progress their careers with a company that's on the right trajectory. 
We mentioned during our investor call that nearly 50% of our vice presidents across the company are new to DXC within the last 22 months. Also, we are investing in our people. This quarter, we rewarded high performance by paying annual bonuses that benefited roughly 45,000 of our colleagues. In Q2, we are planning merit increases that will benefit roughly 77,000 of our colleagues. In addition to these investments, we are doing a great job of taking care of our colleagues and their families during the pandemic. This focus on our colleagues is unique and builds trust with them, increases employee engagement, allows us to compete for talent and enables us to deliver for our customers. 
Focus on our customers is the second step of our transformation journey. Our investment in our customers is the primary driver of revenue stabilization. During the Investor Day presentation, I couldn't be more proud to have you hear from American Airlines, FedEx, P&G, Lloyd's, Brighthouse, Deutsche Bank, Campbell's and Microsoft. And I want to thank them again for their support and partnership. 
It was clear from their comments that the new DXC story is resonating with them because we are delivering. These are all large global companies, and they are saying that their IT estates are important. In fact, they use the word critical. Our strategy of delivering ITO services builds customer intimacy and develops trust that when our customers want to further transform their business, they turn to us, and allows us to move them up the enterprise technology stack. 
Additional evidence that our strategy is working is the nice progress we have made on our GBS business, along with the cloud and security layer of our GIS business. All of this gives us confidence that we will deliver on our financial commitments. 
Now let me turn to our cost optimization program. We continue to do well, optimizing our costs and delivering for our customers without disruption. We are focused on 4 cost levers, which are contractor conversion, real estate, scaling our GIDCs and automation through Platform X. These levers have helped us expand our margin going from 7.5% last quarter to 8% this quarter. You will hear from Ken that we expect to continue to expand margins in Q2. 
Next, [indiscernible] the market is where we are focused on cross-selling to our existing customers and winning new work. The 1.12 book-to-bill that we delivered this quarter is evidence that our plan is working. In Q1, 57% of our bookings were new work and 43% were renewals. You will see that we are running specific sales campaigns. An example of these campaigns is ITO modernization, which is focused on improving the performance of our customers' IT estates. Another example is our campaign to show our customers how to think about cloud, which combines on-prem, private cloud and public cloud technology. Our ability to deliver a consistent book-to-bill of 1.0 in each of the last 5 quarters is evidence that these sales campaigns are working and that we can win in the IT services industry. This momentum and success in the market gives us confidence that we will deliver another book-to-bill of 1.0 or greater in Q2. 
Now let me turn the call over to Ken."

For the quarter, DXC exceeded the top end of our revenue, margin and earnings guidance, and continue to deliver a strong book-to-bill. GAAP revenue was $4.14 billion, $10 million higher than the top end of our guidance range. Adjusted EBIT margin was 8% in the quarter, an improvement of 380 basis points as compared to the prior quarter. In Q1, bookings were $4.6 billion for a book-to-bill of 1.12, the fifth straight quarter of a book-to-bill greater than 1. 
Moving on to Slide 13. Our Q1 non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.84 or $0.08 higher than the top end of our guidance, benefiting $0.05 from a lower tax rate. Restructuring and TSI expenses were $76 million, down 58% from prior year. 
Free cash flow was a use of cash of $304 million as compared to a use of cash of $106 million in the prior year. We expect free cash flow to improve significantly as the year progresses. 
As the next slide shows, our Q1 FY '22 performance continues our trajectory as we deliver on our transformation journey. Starting with organic growth progression, we went from approximately 10% decline in the first 3 quarters of FY '21 to down 6.5% in the fourth quarter and now down to a decline of 3.7%. This is a 40% improvement from the prior quarter. 
Let me highlight our organic revenue growth calculation and our prior year earnings releases was structured to provide the year-over-year deconstruction of revenue changes into FX, acquisitions, dispositions and organic compared to prior period GAAP revenue. 
Our previous organic revenue growth calculation was not performed in this manner. As a result, we have revised the organic growth rates for the prior year periods in our earnings deck and have further supplemented our organic calculation to include all the information to support the calculation, providing you complete transparency. This change does not yield a meaningful difference to our historically reported organic revenue growth rates, trajectory or guidance. 
Adjusted EBIT margin expanded 380 basis points. Excluding the impact of dispositions, margin expanded almost 600 basis points. We continue to market with consecutive quarters of a book-to-bill greater than 1. And lastly, non-GAAP earnings per share quadrupled. 
Now moving to our GBS business, composed of analytics and engineering, applications and business process services. Revenue was $1.9 billion in the quarter. Organic revenue growth was positive 2% as compared to prior year. In terms of quarterly progression, organic revenues declined about 6% to 7% in the first 3 quarters of FY '21, declined 3.4% in the fourth quarter and turned to positive 2% this quarter. GBS segment profit was $272 million with a 14.4% profit rate, up 450 basis points from the prior year. GBS bookings for the quarter were $2.4 billion for a book-to-bill of 1.29. 
As you have seen for a number of quarters, the demand for our GBS offerings, the top half of our technology stack have been quite robust and now yielding positive organic revenue growth. 
Turning to our GIS segment, consisting of IT outsourcing, cloud and security, and modern workplace. Revenue was $2.3 billion, down 9.1% year-over-year on an organic basis. We are seeing the rate of decline moderate this quarter despite the headwinds from our modern workplace business. GIS segment profit was $131 million with a profit margin of 5.8%, a 480 basis point margin improvement over the prior year quarter. GIS bookings were $2.2 billion for a book-to-bill of 0.97 compared to 0.77 in the prior year. 
It is safe to say revenues continue to stabilize and demonstrate that with improved customer intimacy and delivery, our revenue is not running away, allowing us to build our growth foundation. 
Now I will break down our segment results, GBS and GIS, into the layers of our enterprise technology stack, starting with GBS. Analytics and engineering revenues were $482 million, up 12.9% as compared to prior year. We continue to see high demand for our offerings with a book-to-bill of 1.32 in the quarter. Applications also continue to demonstrate solid progress with revenue of $1.246 billion, growing organically almost 1%. Applications also continues its strong book-to-bill at 1.32. 
Business process services revenues were $118 million, down 13% compared to the prior year quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.13. Cloud and security revenue was $549 million, up 4.9% as compared to the prior year. The cloud business is benefiting from increased demand associated with our hybrid cloud offerings. Book-to-bill was 0.85 in the quarter. 
IT outsourcing revenue was $1.13 billion, down 9% as compared to prior year. To put this decline in perspective, last year, this business declined almost 20% year-over-year. We expect this momentum to continue in organic declines to further abate as the year progresses. 
Modern workplace revenues were $577 million, down 19.7% as compared to prior year. Book-to-bill was 1.0 in the quarter. As you may recall, modern workplace was part of our strategic alternatives and was not part of our transformation journey until recently. As a result, we previously disclosed that the performance would be uneven as we invest in the business, enhancing our offerings and innovating the end-user experience. As our transformation journey takes hold, we expect modern workplace performance to improve similar to the trend we have seen with our IPO business. 
One of our key initiatives to drive cash flow and improve earnings power is to wind down restructuring and TSI costs. We expect to reduce this from an average of $900 million per year over the last 4 years to $550 million in FY '22 and about $100 million in FY '24. 
On Slide 19, we detail our efforts to strengthen our balance sheet. We are proud of what we achieved on this front, reducing our debt by $7 billion while improving our net debt leverage ratio to 0.9x. Further, we have reached our targeted debt level of $5 billion with relatively low maturities through FY '24. 
From our improved balance sheet, let's move to cash flow for the quarter. First quarter cash flow from operations totaled an outflow of $29 million. Free cash flow for the quarter was negative $304 million. As you likely realize, with Mike's leadership, we will continue to make decisions to better position the company for the longer term, creating a sustainable business. Certain of these decisions impacted cash flow this quarter. As our guidance anticipated, we plan to take certain actions that impacted the Q1 cash flow. We remain on track to deliver our full year free cash flow guidance of $500 million. 
Let's now turn to our financial priorities on Slide 21. We are working to build a stronger financial foundation and use that base to drive the company forward in a disciplined and rigorous fashion, unleashing DXC's true earnings power. Our second priority is to have a strong balance sheet. We achieved our targeted debt level. We are encouraged by our almost 50% year-over-year interest expense reduction. We continue to focus on reducing interest expense and are evaluating refinancing options given the advantageous interest rate environment. 
Third, we will focus on improving cash flow. During the quarter, we paid $88 million to draw to conclusion a long-standing $3 billion take-or-pay contract for IT hardware. These types of contracts are not efficient, and we are reducing our exposure. Additionally, we paid down $300 million of capital leases and asset financing in order to allow us to dispose of IP hardware purchased under the previously mentioned take-or-pay arrangement and realizing tax deduction once we dispose of the unutilized assets. 
Given our relatively low borrowing cost, it makes less sense to enter into capital leases as the borrowing costs are higher and creates other complexities. We continue to reduce capital lease and asset financing origination from approximately $1.1 billion in FY '20 to $450 million in FY '21 and believe that we will remain at that level or lower for FY '22. 
As we continue to curtail capital lease origination, our average quarterly lease payment will reduce from about $230 million a quarter in FY '21 to about $170 million near term. Our efforts to limit capital leases does create upward pressure on capital expenditures. Though, on balance, we expect to reduce cash outflows for both capital leases and capital expenditures over time. 
Lastly, we terminated our German AR securitization program, negatively impacting cash flow by $114 million for the quarter. Going forward, this result in interest savings, strengthen our balance sheet, but more importantly, it will bring us closer to our customers as cash collections is tied to their success.
Fourth, we will reduce restructuring and TSI expense improving our cash flow. 
Fifth, as we generate free cash flow, we will appropriately deploy capital to invest in our business and return capital to our shareholders, all the while continuing to maintain our investment-grade credit profile. During the quarter, we executed $67 million of stock buybacks to offset dilution, taking advantage of what we believe was an attractive valuation in the market. 
I should note, we continue to make progress with our efforts to optimize our portfolio, unlocking value as we divest noncore assets, including both businesses and facilities. We expect to continue these efforts. Our results today include the benefit from the sale of assets, partially offset by other discrete items, and the headwind of 30 basis points of margin associated with the disposition of our health care provider software business. 
Moving on to second quarter guidance on Slide 22. Revenues between $4.08 billion and $4.13 billion. This translates into organic revenue declines of down 1% to down 3%. Adjusted EBIT margins of 8% to 8.4%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.80 to $0.84. 
As we look forward to the rest of the year, I would note that we expect $175 million of tax payments in Q2 related to the gains on dispositions. We also updated our FY '22 interest guidance to approximately $180 million, a $20 million improvement, and reduced our full year non-GAAP tax rate by 200 basis points to 26%. 
As noted on Slides 23 and 24, we are reaffirming our FY '22 and longer-term guidance. Lastly, we expect to see further improvement in the quarterly year-over-year organic revenue growth rates as we move through the year. 
With that, I will now turn the call back to Mike for his closing remarks."

So when you look at the stack, let's just take GIS and GBS, the drivers that you'll see is, in GIS, ITO, like Ken said, is not only stabilizing, but it's going to get better throughout the year.

So when you look at the stack, let's just take GIS and GBS, the drivers that you'll see is, in GIS, ITO, like Ken said, is not only stabilizing, but it's going to get better throughout the year. And that's because, look, we're focused on taking care of our customers' IT estates, which they think are incredibly important. When we do that, I've been very consistent that we'll build customer intimacy. When we build that customer intimacy, they will turn to us for new work. That's why the book-to-bill continues to be over 1.0. So what we're seeing in that space is we're seeing the need in the IT estates to do the maintenance. And then, like I said, we're running sales campaigns to move them to the cloud. 
If you go back to our Investor Day, both American Airlines, for example, along with FedEx, talked about us moving them to the cloud. When we think cloud, it will be a combination of on-prem, private and public. Those are the 3 technologies we'll put together. 
So when I think GIS, those businesses are going well. What we have there is we have to continue to turn around modern workplace, and that's going to be on the same path that the ITO business was. That's why I like when Ken was saying that a year ago, ITO was roughly 20 -- negative 20, and now it's minus 9. We expect workplace to do something similar. 
Now when we talk about moving off the stack, you can see our numbers in GBS. Analytics and engineering outstanding, right? That growth there not only is good, but we expect it to continue with the book-to-bill at 1.32. And then same with applications, applications should continue to get better. 
So Bryan, look, that's the way we're looking at the business. The focus is continue to move our clients up to stack. And the biggest thing there is making sure that we take care of not only what they have today, but also where they want to go tomorrow."

What was never done with this business is, first of all, we're very focused on making sure that we replace contractors with our own people. And we think we've got a substantial chunk that we've taken out of that, and there's more to go. 
Real estate, we will continue to look at. One of our strategies is to implement a workforce. That's one of the things that we like about our modern workplace solution. We're implementing our own modern workplace solution on ourselves. And therefore, we're allowed under Ken's leadership to drive down our real estate cost. So that will also continue. 
Now the last 2 are the keys because as you stabilize all these customers and you don't have service delivery issues anymore, in fact, our customers say, our delivery is silent now, which means we're performing, that's when you can take the next 2 clicks at the operations. And the first one is you got to scale your centers. And in the past, we had not done that. So what you're seeing is we've got roughly around 20 key global information -- or innovation delivery centers. That's what we're scaling. And then on top of that, Platform X is where we're automating a lot of that manual work away.

And the key thing now is we fully expect that, that will follow the same similar path as ITO. 
So think about it, ITO last year, minus -- roughly minus 20. Now it's minus 9 and continue trending in the right direction, and it hovered in sort of the mid-teens -- negative mid-teens last year. That's what I see modern workplace doing throughout this year and then turning. 
Now the key shoots are these. The Microsoft relationship is important to us, and we also are seeing good traction in the marketplace in terms of our pipeline. The 1.0 that we showed here is good. I expect that to continue. Second is the solution, I think, is second to none. That's why I'm implementing it for our own people. And then third, going back to the cost levers, the main cost levers there is that we've already replaced the leadership. The second thing is, again, we're focused on the contractor conversions and then scaling our delivery. And look, that playbook has worked across this entire business. I don't know why it wouldn't work on modern workplace. So I have the confidence that we will definitely turn that around."

One of the things I continue to highlight is us implementing our people first strategy, which is unique in this industry. You hear me talk about our colleagues all the time because we believe talent wins in the market, and retaining our best people is incredibly important. 
So if you think about the environment that we're in. First of all, the new DXC, not only story, but culture is resonating in the market. You think about I've replaced 75% of our leadership team. And again, talent follows talent, along with 50% of our VPs across the company, are new since I joined. So just that alone is bringing in a lot of good talent that we need to run the business. 
Now when I look at -- as we move up the stack, look, we are seeing competition for analytical skills, for application skills and for cloud skills just like everybody else, but we are definitely getting our fair share of those to support our clients. So I still feel very confident looking at our talent across the board that we will compete very well in this space for talent."

So when I think about the key thing that we're doing in the market is we've embraced ITO, right? There's a lot of people that haven't embraced ITO. We've embraced that because that is critical and important to our clients. So if it's important to them, it's important to us, and we're delivering. 
I also talked on Investor Day and continue to talk about customer intimacy. Showing up and listening to these customers resonates in the market, and that's what I keep talking about in terms of the new DXC. Now that gives us a chance to do cloud, to do locations work, do the analytics work. And look, I'm very proud about not only stabilizing the GIS business when you look quarter-to-quarter, minus 9.3% to minus 9.1%. But the key thing is look at GBS, minus 3.4% last quarter, positive 2% this quarter, and we expect that's going to continue. So the strategy that we've put in place is absolutely working and gives us real confidence to not only deliver for Q2 but also our short- and long-term plans."

Today's agenda will begin with a quick update on our solid Q1 performance, which continues to show that revenue, adjusted EBIT margin, book-to-bill and non-GAAP EPS all have a positive trajectory compared to past quarters. 
During our Investor Day in June, we gave you additional insights into the steps of our transformation journey, and those steps are: inspire and take care of our colleagues, focus on our customers, optimize costs, seize the market and build a strong financial foundation. I will give updates on each step, and then hand the call over to Ken to share our Q1 financial results, guidance and more details on how we are building a strong financial foundation. Finally, I will make some closing remarks before opening the call up for questions. 
Regarding our Q1 performance, our revenues were $4.14 billion, and our adjusted EBIT margin was 8%. This represents the fourth straight quarter of both revenue stabilization and sequential margin expansion, and we expect both trends to continue in Q2. Book-to-bill for the quarter was 1.12. This is the fifth straight quarter that we delivered a 1 point over better book-to-bill, and we expect our success of winning in the market to continue in Q2. Our non-GAAP EPS was $0.84 in the quarter, which is up 300% as compared to $0.21 that we delivered in Q1 of FY '21. The positive trajectory of all 4 of these numbers gives us confidence that our playbook is working. 
As a refresher, our playbook has 3 phases. The stabilization phase was completed in FY '21. This phase enabled us to make great progress with our colleagues, customers, on revenue, margin, book-to-bill and reducing our debt. We are now focused on the foundation phase. This phase focuses on the steps that will allow us to deliver growth. 
The goals of this phase are: first, continue to increase our employee engagement, all while we attract and retain highly talented colleagues; second, stabilize year-on-year organic revenue; third, expand adjusted EBIT margins; fourth, consistently deliver a book-to-bill number of 1.0 or greater, with a nice mix of new work and renewals; and finally, under Ken's leadership, deliver a financial foundation that increases discipline and improves our cash flow and earnings power. 
Now I will discuss the good progress we are making on each step of our transformation journey, beginning with inspire and take care of our colleagues. We are executing a people-first strategy. Attracting and retaining talent is fundamental to enable our growth. Our refreshed leadership team has deep industry experience and is delivering. Brenda, who is our Chief Marketing Officer, is our newest addition. Brenda is a strategic results-oriented leader who brings deep marketing experience to DXC. 
75% of our leadership team is now new to DXC and bringing in talent based on their personal credibility as talent follows talent. What the team is finding is that the new DXC story is resonating in the market, and new-hires are wanting to join DXC because they see the opportunity to progress their careers with a company that's on the right trajectory. We mentioned during our investor call that nearly 50% of our vice presidents across the company are new to DXC within the last 22 months. 
Also, we are investing in our people. This quarter, we rewarded high performance by paying annual bonuses that benefited roughly 45,000 of our colleagues. In Q2, we are planning merit increases that will benefit roughly 77,000 of our colleagues. In addition to these investments, we are doing a great job of taking care of our colleagues and their families during the pandemic. This focus on our colleagues is unique and builds trust with them, increases employee engagement, allows us to compete for talent and enables us to deliver for our customers. 
Focus on our customers is the second step of our transformation journey. Our investment in our customers is the primary driver of revenue stabilization. During the Investor Day presentation, I couldn't be more proud to have you hear from American Airlines, FedEx, P&G, Lloyd's, Brighthouse, Deutsche Bank, Campbell's and Microsoft. And I want to thank them again for their support and partnership. 
It was clear from their comments that the new DXC story is resonating with them because we are delivering. These are all large global companies, and they are saying that their IT estates are important. In fact, they use the word critical. Our strategy of delivering ITO services builds customer intimacy and develops trust that when our customers want to further transform their business, they turn to us, and allows us to move them up the enterprise technology stack. 
Additional evidence that our strategy is working is the nice progress we have made on our GBS business, along with the cloud and security layer of our GIS business. All of this gives us confidence that we will deliver on our financial commitments. 
Now let me turn to our cost optimization program. We continue to do well, optimizing our costs and delivering for our customers without disruption. We are focused on 4 cost levers, which are contractor conversion, real estate, scaling our GIDCs and automation through Platform X. These levers have helped us expand our margin going from 7.5% last quarter to 8% this quarter. You will hear from Ken that we expect to continue to expand margins in Q2. 
Next, seize the market is where we are focused on cross-selling to our existing customers and winning new work. The 1.12 book-to-bill that we delivered this quarter is evidence that our plan is working. In Q1, 57% of our bookings were new work and 43% were renewals. 
You will see that we are running specific sales campaigns. An example of these campaigns is ITO modernization, which is focused on improving the performance of our customers' IT estates. Another example is our campaign to show our customers how to think about cloud, which combines on-prem, private cloud and public cloud technology. Our ability to deliver a consistent book-to-bill of 1.0 in each of the last 5 quarters is evidence that these sales campaigns are working and that we can win in the IT services industry. This momentum and success in the market gives us confidence that we will deliver another book-to-bill of 1.0 or greater in Q2. 
Now let me turn the call over to Ken."

Turning to our financial performance on Slide 12. For the quarter, DXC exceeded the top end of our revenue, margin and earnings guidance, and continued to deliver a strong book-to-bill. GAAP revenue was $4.14 billion, $10 million higher",1735,"Thank you, Mike. Turning to our financial performance on Slide 12. 
For the quarter, DXC exceeded the top end of our revenue, margin and earnings guidance, and continued to deliver a strong book-to-bill. GAAP revenue was $4.14 billion, $10 million higher than the top end of our guidance range. Adjusted EBIT margin was 8% in the quarter, an improvement of 380 basis points as compared to the prior quarter. In Q1, bookings were $4.6 billion for a book-to-bill of 1.12, the fifth straight quarter of a book-to-bill greater than 1. 
Moving on to Slide 13. Our Q1 non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.84 or $0.08 higher than the top end of our guidance, benefiting $0.05 from a lower tax rate. Restructuring and TSI expenses were $76 million, down 58% from prior year. 
Free cash flow was a use of cash of $304 million as compared to a use of cash of $106 million in the prior year. We expect free cash flow to improve significantly as the year progresses. 
As the next slide shows, our Q1 FY '22 performance continues our trajectory as we deliver on our transformation journey. Starting with organic growth progression, we went from approximately 10% decline in the first 3 quarters of FY '21 to down 6.5% in the fourth quarter and now down to a decline of 3.7%. This is a 40% improvement from the prior quarter. 
Let me highlight our organic revenue growth calculation, and our prior year earnings releases was structured to provide the year-over-year deconstruction of revenue changes into FX, acquisitions, dispositions and organic compared to prior period GAAP revenue. 
Our previous organic revenue growth calculation was not performed in this manner. As a result, we have revised the organic growth rates for the prior year periods in our earnings deck and have further supplemented our organic calculation to include all the information to support the calculation, providing you complete transparency. This change does not yield a meaningful difference to our historically reported organic revenue growth rates, trajectory or guidance. 
Adjusted EBIT margin expanded 380 basis points. Excluding the impact of dispositions, margin expanded almost 600 basis points. We continue to market with 5 consecutive quarters of a book-to-bill greater than 1, and lastly, non-GAAP earnings per share quadrupled. 
Now moving to our GBS business, composed of analytics and engineering, applications and business process services. Revenue was $1.9 billion in the quarter. Organic revenue growth was positive 2% as compared to prior year. In terms of quarterly progression, organic revenues declined about 6% to 7% in the first 3 quarters of FY '21, declined 3.4% in the fourth quarter and turned to positive 2% this quarter. GBS segment profit was $272 million with a 14.4% profit rate, up 450 basis points from the prior year. GBS bookings for the quarter were $2.4 billion for a book-to-bill of 1.29. 
As you have seen for a number of quarters, the demand for our GBS offerings, the top half of our technology stack have been quite robust and now yielding positive organic revenue growth. 
Turning to our GIS segment, consisting of IT outsourcing, cloud and security, and modern workplace. Revenue was $2.3 billion, down 9.1% year-over-year on an organic basis. We are seeing the rate of decline moderate this quarter despite the headwinds from our modern workplace business. GIS segment profit was $131 million with a profit margin of 5.8%, a 480 basis point margin improvement over the prior year quarter. GIS bookings were $2.2 billion for a book-to-bill of 0.97 compared to 0.77 in the prior year. 
It is safe to say revenues continue to stabilize and demonstrate that with improved customer intimacy and delivery, our revenue is not running away, allowing us to build our growth foundation. 
Now I will break down our segment results, GBS and GIS, into the layers of our enterprise technology stack, starting with GBS. Analytics and engineering revenues were $482 million, up 12.9% as compared to prior year. We continue to see high demand for our offerings with a book-to-bill of 1.32 in the quarter. Applications also continued to demonstrate solid progress with revenue of $1.246 billion, growing organically almost 1%. Applications also continues its strong book-to-bill at 1.32. 
Business process services revenues were $118 million, down 13% compared to the prior year quarter with a book-to-bill of 1.13. Cloud and security revenue was $549 million, up 4.9% as compared to the prior year. The cloud business is benefiting from increased demand associated with our hybrid cloud offerings. Book-to-bill was 0.85 the quarter. 
IT outsourcing revenue was $1.13 billion, down 9% as compared to prior year. To put this decline in perspective, last year, this business declined almost 20% year-over-year. We expect this momentum to continue and organic declines to further abate as the year progresses. 
Modern workplace revenues were $577 million, down 19.7% as compared to prior year. Book-to-bill was 1.0 in the quarter. As you may recall, modern workplace was part of our strategic alternatives and was not part of our transformation journey until recently. As a result, we previously disclosed that the performance would be uneven as we invest in the business, enhancing our offerings and innovating the end-user experience. As our transformation journey takes hold, we expect modern workplace performance to improve similar to the trend we have seen with our ITO business. 
One of our key initiatives to drive cash flow and improve earnings power is to wind down restructuring in TSI costs. We expect to reduce this from an average of $900 million per year over the last 4 years to $550 million in FY '22 and about $100 million in FY '24. 
On Slide 19, we detail our efforts to strengthen our balance sheet. We are proud of what we achieved on this front, reducing our debt by $7 billion, while improving our net debt leverage ratio to 0.9x. Further, we have reached our targeted debt level of $5 billion with relatively low maturities through FY '24. 
From our improved balance sheet, let's move to cash flow for the quarter. First quarter cash flow from operations totaled an outflow of $29 million. Free cash flow for the quarter was negative $304 million. As you likely realize, with Mike's leadership, we will continue to make decisions to better position the company for the longer term, creating a sustainable business. Certain of these decisions impacted cash flow this quarter. As our guidance anticipated, we plan to take certain actions that impacted the Q1 cash flow. We remain on track to deliver our full year free cash flow guidance of $500 million. 
Let's now turn to our financial priorities on Slide 21. We are working to build a stronger financial foundation and use that base to drive the company forward in a disciplined and rigorous fashion, unleashing DXC's true earnings power. 
Our second priority is to have a strong balance sheet. We achieved our targeted debt level. We are encouraged by our almost 50% year-over-year interest expense reduction. We continue to focus on reducing interest expense and are evaluating refinancing options given the advantageous interest rate environment. 
Third, we will focus on improving cash flow. During the quarter, we paid $88 million to draw to conclusion a long-standing $3 billion take-or-pay contract for IT hardware. These types of contracts are not efficient, and we are reducing our exposure. Additionally, we paid down $300 million of capital leases and asset financing in order to allow us to dispose of IP hardware purchased under the previously mentioned take-or-pay arrangement and realizing tax deduction once we dispose of the unutilized assets. 
Given our relatively low borrowing cost, it makes less sense to enter into capital leases as the borrowing costs are higher and creates other complexities. We continue to reduce capital lease and asset financing origination from approximately $1.1 billion in FY '20 to $450 million in FY '21 and believe that we will remain at that level or lower for FY '22. 
As we continue to curtail capital lease origination, our average quarterly lease payment will reduce from about $230 million a quarter in FY '21 to about $170 million near term. Our efforts to limit capital leases does create upward pressure on capital expenditures. Though, on balance, we expect to reduce cash outflows for both capital leases and capital expenditures over time. 
Lastly, we terminated our German AR securitization program, negatively impacting cash flow by $114 million for the quarter. Going forward, this will result in interest savings, strengthen our balance sheet, but more importantly, it will bring us closer to our customers as cash collections is tied to their success. 
Fourth, we will reduce restructuring and TSI expense, improving our cash flow. 
Fifth, as we generate free cash flow, we will appropriately deploy capital to invest in our business and return capital to our shareholders, all the while continuing to maintain our investment-grade credit profile. During the quarter, we executed $67 million of stock buybacks to offset dilution, taking advantage of what we believe was an attractive valuation in the market. 
I should note, we continue to make progress with our efforts to optimize our portfolio, unlocking value as we divest noncore assets, including both businesses and facilities. We expect to continue these efforts. Our results today include the benefit from the sale of assets, partially offset by other discrete items, and the headwind of 30 basis points of margin associated with the disposition of our health care provider software business. 
Moving on to second quarter guidance on Slide 22. Revenues between $4.08 billion and $4.13 billion. This translates into organic revenue declines of down 1% to down 3%. Adjusted EBIT margins of 8% to 8.4%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $0.80 to $0.84. 
As we look forward to the rest of the year, I would note that we expect $175 million of tax payments in Q2 related to the gains on dispositions. We also updated our FY '22 interest guidance to approximately $180 million, a $20 million improvement; and reduced our full year non-GAAP tax rate by 200 basis points to 26%. 
As noted on Slides 23 and 24, we are reaffirming our FY '22 and longer-term guidance. Lastly, we expect to see further improvement in the quarterly year-over-year organic revenue growth rates as we move through the year. 
With that, I will now turn the call back to Mike for his closing remarks."

So when you look at the stack, let's just take GIS and GBS, the drivers that you'll see is, in GIS, ITO, like Ken said, is not only stabilizing, but it's going to get better throughout the year. And that's because, look, we're focused on ta",346,"Thanks, Bryan. So when you look at the stack, let's just take GIS and GBS, the drivers that you'll see is, in GIS, ITO, like Ken said, is not only stabilizing, but it's going to get better throughout the year. And that's because, look, we're focused on taking care of our customers' IT estates, which they think are incredibly important. When we do that, I've been very consistent that we'll build customer intimacy. When we build that customer intimacy, they will turn to us for new work. That's why the book-to-bill continues to be over 1.0. 
So what we're seeing in that space is we're seeing the need in the IT estates to do the maintenance, and then, like I said, we're running sales campaigns to move them to the cloud. If you go back to our Investor Day, both American Airlines, for example, along with FedEx, talked about us moving them to the cloud, and when we think cloud, it will be a combination of on-prem, private and public. Those are the 3 technologies we'll put together. 
So when I think GIS, those businesses are going well. What we have there is we have to continue to turn around modern workplace, and that's going to be on the same path that the ITO business was. That's why I liked when Ken was saying that a year ago, ITO was roughly 20 -- negative 20%, and now, it's minus 9%. We expect workplace to do something similar. 
Now when we talk about moving off the stack, you can see our numbers in GBS. Analytics and engineering, outstanding, right? That growth there, not only is good, but we expect it to continue with the book-to-bill at 1.32. And then same with applications, applications should continue to get better. 
So Bryan, look, that's the way we're looking at the business. The focus is continue to move our clients up to stack. And the biggest thing there is making sure that we take care of not only what they have today, but also where they want to go tomorrow."

What was never done with this business is, first of all, we're very focused on making sure that we replace contractors with our own people. And we think we've got a substantial chunk that we've taken out of that, and there's more to go. 
Real estate, we will continue to look at. And one of our strategies is to implement a distributed workforce. That's one of the things that we like about our modern workplace solution. We're implementing our own modern workplace solution on ourselves and, therefore, we're allowed, under Ken's leadership to drive down our real estate cost. So that will also continue. 
Now the last 2 are the keys because as you stabilize all these customers and you don't have service delivery issues anymore, in fact, our customers say, our delivery is silent now, which means we're performing, that's when you can take the next 2 clicks at the operations. And the first one is you got to scale your centers. And in the past, we had not done that. So what you're seeing is we've got roughly around 20 key global information -- or innovation delivery centers. That's what we're scaling. And then on top of that, Platform X is where we're automating a lot of that manual work away. 
So when I look at those 4 levers, those are the 4 levers that will drive us towards not only delivering on our '22 commitments, but also on our '24 commitments."

And the key thing now is we fully expect that, that will follow the same similar path as ITO. 
So think about it, ITO last year, minus -- roughly minus 20. Now it's minus 9 and continue trending in the right direction, and it hovered in sort of the mid-teens -- negative mid-teens last year. That's what I see modern workplace doing throughout this year and then turning. 
Now the key shoots are these. The Microsoft relationship is important to us, and we also are seeing good traction in the marketplace in terms of our pipeline. The 1.0 that we showed here is good. I expect that to continue. Second is the solution, I think, is second to none. That's why I'm implementing it for our own people. And then third, going back to the cost levers, the main cost levers there is that we've already replaced the leadership.

Showing up and listening to these customers resonates in the market, and that's what I keep talking about in terms of the new DXC.

Today's agenda will begin with an update on our Q2 performance, which shows hard evidence that we are delivering on our transformation journey and building the foundation to make DXC operationally efficient, sustainable and ultimately grow. Next, I will provide you with additional insights as to the operational work we are performing as we execute our transformation journey. Then I will hand the call over to Ken to share our Q2 financials, guidance and more details of the financial results driven by our strong operational execution. Finally, I will make some closing remarks before opening the call up for questions. 
Regarding our Q2 performance, our revenues were $4.03 billion. Our organic revenue growth continued to show progress as we improved from minus 3.7% in Q1 to minus 2.4% in Q2. Also, I was very pleased to see that the GBS business segment grew for the second quarter in a row from positive 2% in Q1 to positive 3.4% in Q2. We also continue to improve the organic revenue of the GIS business segment from minus 9.1% in Q1 to minus 8% in Q2. Now all of these results show our organic revenue is on the right trajectory. 
Our adjusted EBIT margin was 8.6% and was driven by the operational work that we are doing to optimize our business. This is the third straight quarter of both improving organic revenue growth and sequential margin expansion, and we expect both trends to continue in Q3. Book-to-bill for the quarter was 0.91, which came in below our goal of 1 due to the timing of a couple of deals. I'm happy to report that both deals are hybrid cloud/ITO deals and are now closed. We continue to track to a book-to-bill over 1 year-to-date, and we expect to be back above [ 1 0 ] in Q3. 
Our non-GAAP EPS was $0.90 in the quarter, which is up $0.41 as compared to $0.64 a year ago. Finally, we are encouraged by the strength of our Q2 free cash flow, which moved us into positive territory. On a year-to-date basis, we have now produced roughly $100 million in cash. 
Now let me turn to the progress we are making on our transformation journey. The first step is inspire and take care of our colleagues. We are executing a people-first strategy and attracting and retaining talent is fundamental to enable our growth. 
We know our strategy is working. We saw a higher percentage of our employees complete our September employee engagement survey, and we are showing improved and stable engagement scores. These engagement scores give us confidence that we have a motivated workforce, and we will be able to manage attrition, which we've seen an uptick. 
To offset this increase in attrition and demand, we hired and onboarded more colleagues than any other quarter since I became CEO. Key advantage to our hiring efforts is that we have implemented and are running a virtual-first model. Hiring has been a focus for us and will continue. While hiring improved, we left some open demand and project were unconverted and we are focused on capturing this moving forward. 
Focus on the customers is the second step of our transformation journey and continues to be the primary driver of our success in improving our organic revenue growth, a key metric that we measure is our Net Promoter Score, and we are seeing continued improvement. The last time we gave you our NPS score was during the Investor Day in June, and it was 18, almost within the industry best practice range of 20 to 30. Currently, our 12-month rolling NPS score is at the midpoint of the best practice range. This is the most positive our customers have been since I arrived. This improvement is due to our strong service delivery and gives us the ability to sell up the enterprise technology stack from our GIS business to our GBS business. 
Now let me remind you that the way we will get to grow is to deliver the GIS services that are critical for our customers and build trusted relationships. Once these trusted relationships are built, we can move our customers up the enterprise technology stack towards the services of our GBS business. This is exactly what we are doing. And the organic revenue trajectory of GIS, GBS and the overall business is great evidence that this strategy is working. 
Now let me turn to our cost optimization program. We continue to make progress in optimizing our cost and delivering for our customers without disruption. I mentioned at the beginning of this call that we are doing the operational work to make DXC efficient, sustainable and ultimately grow. I've already commented on some of the operational work we are doing like motivating our colleagues, hiring new talent and implementing a virtual-first model. In addition to this work, we are also improving the efficiency of our service delivery, implementing better IT tools and actively managing our real estate footprint. 
Let me provide you with some additional color considering the operational work we are doing with real estate. This quarter, we closed our Tysons facility and are moving to a much smaller footprint in the D.C. area, where our colleagues that need to come into a facility will share a space versus having dedicated space. This work emphasizes our commitment to a virtual-first model, reduce our carbon footprint and represents our desire to maintain a much smaller real estate footprint. Jim will detail out the financial results of all of these operational work that, simply put, this work is allowing us to improve margins from 8% in Q1 to 8.6% in Q2 and gives us the confidence to increase our margin and EPS guidance for FY '22. 
Next, the market is where we are focused on cross-selling for our existing customers and winning new work. As I previously mentioned, we had 2 significant deals slip into Q3 and are now signed. The great news about these deals is they were both hybrid cloud/ITO deals with long-standing customers. Specifically, we are helping these customers modernize their existing IP estate and building new private cloud capability to run their mission-critical applications. 
In Q2, 59% of our bookings were new work and 41% were renewals. The new work continues to increase due to the focus on another piece of our strategy, which is our platinum customer channel. Taking our offerings through this channel is another key foundation piece for growth. We are now starting to see evidence that we are being successful in taking [ Microsoft ], which drives our analytics and engineering services through our platinum customer channel. The evidence is that analytics and engineering grew 17.3% in Q2, which is clearly helping us create growth in our GBS business segment. 
Now let me give you an example of what the Platinum customer of the future looks like at DXC. We have a 14-year relationship with one of the world's largest specialty retailers. Now before I arrived and implemented the strategy, our revenues were roughly $80 million per year, split 1/3 GBS and 2/3 GIS. By continuing to deliver our GIS services for this customer, we are offering the opportunity to sell our GBS services. The result is we have increased the total revenue on this account by 13%, and the mix between GBS and GIS is now split 50-50 as we are now providing them analytics and engineering services. We're in the early innings of this strategy, but we feel confident that we can implement this approach to our other Platinum customers, successfully delivering GIS services and growing GBS services to have a same or more revenue at better margins. 
Now let me turn the call over to Ken."
263093,1685063230,2423772,"DXC Technology Company, Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2021",2021-11-03,"Earnings Calls","DXC Technology Company","Executives","Thank you, Mike. Turning to our quarterly financial performance on Slide 11. As you can see, our progress continues. Our organic revenue improved to a decline of 2.4% or a 130 basis point improvement from Q1. This represents our third consecutive quarterl",2079,"Thank you, Mike. Turning to our quarterly financial performance on Slide 11. As you can see, our progress continues. Our organic revenue improved to a decline of 2.4% or a 130 basis point improvement from Q1. This represents our third consecutive quarterly improvement. As you can see, we have come a long way from double-digit organic revenue declines in Q1 FY '21 to low single-digit declines in FY '22. 
Our adjusted EBIT margin continues to improve as well, delivering 8.6% in Q2, up 60 basis points as compared to the first quarter. Year-over-year, our adjusted EBIT margins have expanded 240 basis points or 460 basis points, excluding the disposed businesses. 
Our book-to-bill for Q2 was 0.91, below our goal of 1 due to timing and remains over 1 year-to-date. Further, we expect to deliver a book-to-bill of over 1 for Q3 and for the full year. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.90, up $0.06 from Q1 and a healthy 41% increase as compared to the prior year. Our earnings per share expanded due to increased margins, lower interest expense and a lower tax rate. 
Moving to our segment results on Slide 12. Our GBS segment continued its strong growth performance, posting its second quarter of positive organic revenue growth of 3.4%, an improvement from 2% in the first quarter. The GBS growth is a positive sign as we continue to deliver higher value for our customers. Our GBS business has higher margins and lower capital intensity. So as we grow this business, it has a more positive impact on margins and cash flow. Our GBS margin was 15.9%, up 150 basis points compared to the first quarter and up 180 basis points compared to prior year. 
Our GIS segment organic revenue declined 8%, a full 110 basis point improvement compared to the first quarter and improved 380 basis points compared to the decline from prior year. GIS margins were 5.5%, an improvement of 390 basis points compared to prior year. 
Turning to the enterprise technology stack. Analytics and Engineering revenue was $520 million, up 17.3%. Analytics and Engineering book-to-bill was 0.95 and 1.13 year-to-date. We continue to see high demand in this area. The applications layer was up 1.5%, book-to-bill was 0.94 and 1.13 year-to-date.  [ GBS ], our smallest layer of the enterprise technology stack, at $118 million of revenue, was down 13.7%. Book-to-bill was 0.69 and 0.91 year-to-date. Cloud and security revenue was $521 million, down 1.5%. Book-to-bill was at 0.8 in the quarter and 0.82 year-to-date. IT outsourcing revenue was $1.05 billion, down 9.6%. ITO book-to-bill was 0.81 and 0.92 year-to-date. We expect our ITO decline to continue to gradually moderate as we move through FY '22. 
The 2 deals Mike mentioned earlier that slipped out of Q2 that were subsequently closed were in the ITO and cloud and security layers of our technology stack and would have boosted our GIS book-to-bill for the quarter to over 1.1. Lastly, modern workplace revenues were $581 million, down 10.9% as compared to prior year. This is an improvement from last quarter when modern workplace was down 19.7% year-over-year. Book-to-bill was 1.2 and 1.1 year-to-date. 
Next up, let me touch on our efforts to build our financial foundation. This quarter, we made particularly strong progress on strengthening our balance sheet and solidifying our financial position, cash generation and reducing restructuring and TSI expense. 
As Mike pointed out earlier, we've made measurable improvements driving our business to improve our financial foundation that will ultimately allow us to increase our deployable cash affording us more opportunities to create value. We reduced our debt from $12 billion to $5.1 billion. The refinancing of all of our high rate bonds during the quarter culminates our collective efforts to transform the business, improve its trajectory and strengthen our balance sheet. 
There is no similar and clear way of seeing the impact that Mike and his team have made improving the operations of the business than what was accomplished with our debt over the last year. Net interest expense has been reduced from $83 million in the first quarter of FY '21 to $45 million this quarter. With the full benefit of our refinancing, we anticipate interest expense to be reduced to approximately $33 million in Q3. We also continue to deliver on reducing restructuring and TSI expense while increasing our margins. This not only improves our cash flow, it also narrows the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP earnings. 
Finally, capital lease and asset financing is an area that was overused. In the last year or so, we've significantly curtailed new capital lease originations from $1.1 billion in FY '20 and are on track to reduce originations to approximately $500 million this year. These efforts to better manage this form of financing allowed us to reduce our debt and ultimately our capital lease cash outflows from $245 million in Q1 FY '21 to $177 million this quarter. We expect further reductions in our quarterly cash outflows to around $150 million per quarter at the end of FY '22 and further below that level going forward. We delivered these reductions while also better managing capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures were reduced from $225 million in Q1 FY '21 to $159 million Q2 FY '22. 
Based on our reductions to capital lease originations, a more meaningful metric to demonstrate our progress is CapEx spend and capital lease originations as a percent of revenue. CapEx and capital lease originations as a percent of revenue were 10.2% for FY '20, 8% for FY '21 and now down to 5.3% for Q2 FY '22. Delivering 5.3% is a good step forward related to better managing our capital spend as it gets us in the peer range, albeit at the top end and is a proof point of our improved operational rigor. 
Returning to our debt on Slide 16, I want to spend a minute on our recent refinancing. This chart shows how the refinancing further solidifies our financial position. By extending maturities, we now have no bond maturities before FY '26, lowering maturity towers and reducing annual interest expense and cash outflows by about $50 million a year. 
From our improved balance sheet, let's move to cash flow. Cash flow from operations totaled an inflow of $563 million. Free cash flow for the quarter was $404 million, up 33% compared to prior year and moves us to positive free cash flow for the first half of FY '22 of $100 million. The second quarter was impacted by previously disclosed cash tax payments related to business disposals, accelerated interest payments due to our refinancing and a payment related to restructuring a vendor relationship to take greater control over our delivery. Further, as part of our strategy to focus on customers, we were able to better manage working capital in the quarter. As we look to the second half, we expect the fourth quarter free cash flow to be stronger. Our third quarter has 2 discrete nonrecurring cash payments, including a $60 million payment associated with a legacy vendor that has a take-or-pay agreement and a $90 million payment associated with COVID relief legislation where we deferred certain tax payments and now have opted to accelerate the tax payments to utilize the tax deduction. 
Slide 18 shows our trended free cash flow profile. The negative cash flow over the last 3 quarters was due in large part to absorbing a number of nonrecurring cash outflows of over $1.7 billion to put the business on a better trajectory, building our foundation. These cash outflows include $700 million tax payment associated with taxable gains on our divestitures, $500 million to normalize vendor payments, $332 million related to [ readying ] the U.S. state local health and human services business for sale, $114 million to end an AR securitization program, $88 million to end a value-destructive take-or-pay agreement. The $1.7 billion headwinds put into perspective the $749 million trailing 4 quarters negative free cash flow. 
A key driver of improving cash flow is to continue to reduce our restructuring and TSI spend. Our restructuring and TSI efforts are highly focused, and we believe are a prudent investment in the business addressing our outsized cost structure in certain countries and to reduce our facilities footprint to align to our virtual model. We remain on track to reduce restructuring in TSI from an average of $900 million per year over the last 4 years to $550 million in FY '22 and about $100 million in FY '24. 
I would like to take a moment to update our capital deployment expectations from Investor Day. The Investor Day chart called for 55% of our free cash flow to be used to pay debt and capital lease obligations. As a result of our progress, our cash outflows for debt and capital lease financing are now expected to be about 20% of our free cash flow. That leaves 80% of our expected free cash flow to invest in our business and/or repurchase our stock. I should note, we like the business we have and believe that we have the right level of investment in GBS and GIS. We believe our technology stack has critical mass and capability at each layer. We believe we will create more value by continuing to focus on driving the transformation journey across our business improving the fundamentals and continuing to build organic growth up the stack, ultimately delivering 1% to 3% organic growth in FY '24. 
Related to acquisitions, our focus is to ensure our platinum channel strategy will be fully vetted and proven out. So eventually, when we are acquisitive with tuck-in sized acquisitions, we will have a clear path to deliver value. 
Related to our debt, we have a clear line of sight to achieving our targeted debt level of $5 billion near term as we have scheduled debt repayments via our capital lease financing and commercial paper. Our preference is to maintain approximately $2.5 billion of cash on hand to fund an appropriate level of working capital. When we have cash in excess of $2.5 billion, we will determine how best to deploy the cash as we do not expect to leave significant levels of excess cash, generating no meaningful returns on our balance sheet for an extended period of time. 
At this point in our journey, we favor share repurchases as our valuation is attractive. In Q2, we repurchased $83 million of our common stock, bringing the FY '22 year-to-date repurchases to $150 million or 3.9 million shares. Our share repurchases are a disciplined approach to capital allocation and are expected to be self-funding using a rather simple formulaic approach of deploying cash in excess of $2.5 billion when we are at our target debt level of approximately $5 billion. We remain very focused on our investment-grade credit profile. 
Turning to our third quarter guidance. We expect revenue between $4.08 billion and $4.13 billion. If the exchange rates were at the same level as when we gave guidance last quarter, our third quarter revenue guidance range would be $90 million higher. Organic revenue decline improved to down 1% to down 2.5%; adjusted EBIT margin of 8.6% to 8.9%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.88 to $0.93 per share. 
We are pleased by our progress as we look to the second half of FY '22. I would like to update our current fiscal year guidance. Based on the strengthening U.S. dollar, our revenues are expected to be negatively impacted by approximately $200 million, which has been reflected in our revised guidance range of $16.4 billion to $16.6 billion, reaffirming organic revenue growth at down 1% to down 2%, increasing adjusted EBIT to a range of 8.5% to 8.9%, increasing non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to $3.62 to $3.72 per share and reaffirming free cash flow guidance of $500 million. We are reaffirming our guidance for FY '24, and  this reflects our strong execution in driving forward on our transformation journey. 
Before I turn the call back to Mike, I want to reflect a moment as I'm closing out on my first year at DXC. We are clear-eyed on the value we are driving with the transformation journey. We feel strongly there is more opportunity in front of us to continue to improve the business and the underlying economics. 
With that, I will now turn the call back over to Mike for his closing remarks."

We are building the foundation to make DXC operationally efficient, sustainable and ultimately grow. By focusing on the operational work of motivating our colleges and hiring new talent, moving to a virtual-first model, making service delivery more efficient and implementing better IT tools and reducing real estate, we're able to deliver better for our customers and gives us the ability to sell up the enterprise technology stack to GBS. 
The good news is the financial results that Ken just took us through reduced debt, shrinking restructuring and TSI costs, increased margin and EPS and stronger free cash flow are all sustainable and a result of the operational work we are doing. This gives us confidence that we will achieve our FY '24 double-digit margin guidance. 
On growth, Q2 confirms that we're on the right trajectory for growth. Our focus on delivering and fixing the GIS business develop trusted relationships with our Platinum customers we're then taking our GBS offerings to our Platinum customers, selling up the enterprise technology stack. The evidence that this is working is in our organic revenue results of GIS, GBS and the overall company. This also gives us confidence that we will achieve our FY '24 guidance of 1% to 3% growth. 
In closing, I'm confident that by staying focused on our transformation journey of building the foundation, we will continue to deliver in the short term and ultimately deliver our long-term financial targets of margin, growth and free cash flow.

And in my mind, we are in the early innings for both, all right, organic revenue and also margin. So let's tackle the margin first because the margin is -- the progression is clear that we're delivering. Remember the cost levers that we're dealing with, and they're mostly all related to our people. So the first one is we have a bias towards making sure that our own people do the work for our clients and customers and set a contractor. So we're very focused on contractor conversion. Second is we want to get the right people in the right location. That's why I mentioned the footprint. So that's scaling our GIDCs. Third is the virtual-first model. So that's why I continue to talk about real estate. We should be minimizing or definitely taking down our real estate footprint. And then the last thing is, let's not have our folks do stuff that we can automate. So when I look at those 4 levers of cost, I would say we're definitely in the early innings because there's still much more to do. That's what gives us confidence that we can reach the double digits in FY '24. Quite frankly, that's also what gives us confidence to raise the guidance in terms of the margin and EPS for FY '22. 
Now look, on revenue, what I would tell you there is the payoff is going to occur over time, but we're seeing a lot of good things happening. So when I talk about green shoots, green shoot #1 is NPS is up, that means customers are happy with our delivery. Second is we're definitely getting to see more of bats. Those at bats are coming, both in terms of the GIS business, but we're now seeing all those at bats happening in GBS. But what will happen is those will convert over time. And the best proof of those that, that's converting is the fact that we are growing analytics and engineering, we're also growing applications. So look, when I say the early innings, I would also say that the margin is a little bit ahead of the revenue. But the revenues there. I think over time, you're going to continue to see that the strategy we laid out to deliver the GIS business and to continue to try to grow up the stack, the GBS is one that will serve us incredibly well."

Today's agenda will begin with an update on our Q2 performance, which shows hard evidence that we are delivering on our transformation journey and building the foundation to make DXC operationally efficient, sustainable and ultimately grow. Next, I will provide you with additional insights as to the operational work we are performing as we execute our transformation journey. Then I will hand the call over to Ken to share our Q2 financials, guidance and more details of the financial results driven by our strong operational execution. Finally, I will make some closing remarks before opening the call up for questions.  
Regarding our Q2 performance, our revenues were $4.03 billion. Our organic revenue growth continued to show progress as we improved from minus 3.7% in Q1 to minus 2.4% in Q2. Also, I was very pleased to see that the GBS business segment grew for the second quarter in a row from positive 2% in Q1 to positive 3.4% in Q2. We also continue to improve the organic revenue of the GIS business segment from minus 9.1% in Q1 to minus 8% in Q2. Now all of these results show our organic revenue is on the right trajectory.  
Our adjusted EBIT margin was 8.6% and was driven by the operational work that we are doing to optimize our business. This is the third straight quarter of both improving organic revenue growth and sequential margin expansion, and we expect both trends to continue in Q3. Book-to-bill for the quarter was 0.91, which came in below our goal of 1 due to the timing of a couple of deals. I'm happy to report that both deals are hybrid cloud/ITO deals and are now closed. We continue to track to a book-to-bill over 1 year-to-date, and we expect to be back above 1.0 in Q3. 
Our non-GAAP EPS was $0.90 in the quarter, which is up $0.41 as compared to $0.64 a year ago. Finally, we are encouraged by the strength of our Q2 free cash flow, which moved us into positive territory. On a year-to-date basis, we have now produced roughly $100 million in cash. 
Now let me turn to the progress we are making on our transformation journey. The first step is inspire and take care of our colleagues. We are executing a people-first strategy, and attracting and retaining talent is fundamental to enable our growth. We know our strategy is working. We saw a higher percentage of our employees complete our September employee engagement survey, and we are showing improved and stable engagement scores. These engagement scores give us confidence that we have a motivated workforce, and we will be able to manage attrition, which we've seen an uptick. 
To offset this increase in attrition and demand, we hired and onboarded more colleagues than any other quarter since I became CEO. Key advantage to our hiring efforts is that we have implemented and are running a virtual-first model. Hiring has been a focus for us and will continue. While hiring improved, we left some open demand and project work unconverted. And we are focused on capturing this moving forward. 
Focus on the customers is the second step of our transformation journey and continues to be the primary driver of our success in improving our organic revenue growth. A key metric that we measure is our Net Promoter Score, and we are seeing continued improvement. The last time we gave you our NPS score was during the Investor Day in June, and it was 18, almost within the industry best practice range of 20 to 30. Currently, our 12-month rolling NPS score is at the midpoint of the best practice range. This is the most positive our customers have been since I arrived. This improvement is due to our strong service delivery and gives us the ability to sell up the enterprise technology stack from our GIS business to our GBS business. 
Now let me remind you that the way we will get to grow is to deliver the GIS services that are critical for our customers and build trusted relationships. Once these trusted relationships are built, we can move our customers up the enterprise technology stack towards the services of our GBS business. This is exactly what we are doing. And the organic revenue trajectory of GIS, GBS and the overall business is great evidence that this strategy is working. 
Now let me turn to our cost optimization program. We continue to make progress in optimizing our cost and delivering for our customers without disruption. I mentioned at the beginning of this call that we are doing the operational work to make DXC efficient, sustainable and ultimately grow. I've already commented on some of the operational work we are doing like motivating our colleagues, hiring new talent and implementing a virtual-first model. In addition to this work, we are also improving the efficiency of our service delivery, implementing better IT tools and actively managing our real estate footprint. 
Let me provide you with some additional color considering the operational work we are doing with real estate. This quarter, we closed our Tysons facility and are moving to a much smaller footprint in the D.C. area, where our colleagues that need to come into a facility will share a space versus having dedicated space. This work emphasizes our commitment to a virtual-first model, reduce our carbon footprint and represents our desire to maintain a much smaller real estate footprint. Jim will detail out the financial results of all of these operational work that, simply put, this work is allowing us to improve margins from 8% in Q1 to 8.6% in Q2 and gives us the confidence to increase our margin and EPS guidance for FY '22. 
Next, seize the market is where we are focused on cross-selling for our existing customers and winning new work. As I previously mentioned, we had 2 significant deals slip into Q3 and are now signed. The great news about these deals is they were both hybrid cloud/ITO deals with long-standing customers. Specifically, we are helping these customers modernize their existing IP estate and building new private cloud capability to run their mission-critical applications. 
In Q2, 59% of our bookings were new work and 41% were renewals. The new work continues to increase due to the focus on another piece of our strategy, which is our platinum customer channel. Taking our offerings through this channel is another key foundation piece for growth. We are now starting to see evidence that we are being successful taking Luxoft, which drives our Analytics and Engineering services through our platinum customer channel. The evidence is that Analytics and Engineering grew 17.3% in Q2, which is clearly helping us create growth in our GBS business segment. 
Now let me give you an example of what the Platinum customer of the future looks like at DXC. We have a 14-year relationship with one of the world's largest specialty retailers. Now before I arrived and implemented the strategy, our revenues were roughly $80 million per year, split 1/3 GBS and 2/3 GIS. By continuing to deliver our GIS services for this customer, we are offering the opportunity to sell our GBS services. The result is we have increased the total revenue on this account by 13%, and the mix between GBS and GIS is now split 50-50 as we are now providing them Analytics and Engineering services. We're in the early innings of this strategy, but we feel confident that we can implement this approach to our other Platinum customers, successfully delivering GIS services and growing GBS services to have the same or more revenue at better margins. 
Now let me turn the call over to Ken."
263093,1685063230,2423980,"DXC Technology Company, Q2 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2021",2021-11-03,"Earnings Calls","DXC Technology Company","Executives","Thank you, Mike. Turning to our quarterly financial performance on Slide 11. As you can see, our progress continues. Our organic revenue improved to a decline of 2.4% or a 130 basis point improvement from Q1. This represents our third consecutive quarterl",2074,"Thank you, Mike. Turning to our quarterly financial performance on Slide 11. As you can see, our progress continues. Our organic revenue improved to a decline of 2.4% or a 130 basis point improvement from Q1. This represents our third consecutive quarterly improvement. As you can see, we have come a long way from double-digit organic revenue declines in Q1 FY '21 to low single-digit declines in FY '22. 
Our adjusted EBIT margin continues to improve as well, delivering 8.6% in Q2, up 60 basis points as compared to the first quarter. Year-over-year, our adjusted EBIT margins have expanded 240 basis points or 460 basis points, excluding the disposed businesses. 
Our book-to-bill for Q2 was 0.91, below our goal of 1 due to timing and remains over 1 year-to-date. Further, we expect to deliver a book-to-bill of over 1 for Q3 and for the full year. 
Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.90, up $0.06 from Q1 and a healthy 41% increase as compared to the prior year. Our earnings per share expanded due to increased margins, lower interest expense and a lower tax rate. 
Moving to our segment results on Slide 12. Our GBS segment continued its strong growth performance, posting its second quarter of positive organic revenue growth of 3.4%, an improvement from 2% in the first quarter. The GBS growth is a positive sign as we continue to deliver higher value for our customers. Our GBS business has higher margins and lower capital intensity. So as we grow this business, it has a more positive impact on margins and cash flow. Our GBS margin was 15.9%, up 150 basis points compared to the first quarter and up 180 basis points compared to prior year. 
Our GIS segment organic revenue declined 8%, a full 110 basis point improvement compared to the first quarter and improved 380 basis points compared to the decline from prior year. GIS margins were 5.5%, an improvement of 390 basis points compared to prior year. 
Turning to the enterprise technology stack. Analytics and Engineering revenue was $520 million, up 17.3%. Analytics and Engineering book-to-bill was 0.95 and 1.13 year-to-date. We continue to see high demand in this area. The Applications layer was up 1.5%, book-to-bill was 0.94 and 1.13 year-to-date.  BPS, our smallest layer of the enterprise technology stack, at $118 million of revenue, was down 13.7%. Book-to-bill was 0.69 and 0.91 year-to-date. Cloud and security revenue was $521 million, down 1.5%. Book-to-bill was at 0.8 in the quarter and 0.82 year-to-date. IT Outsourcing revenue was $1.05 billion, down 9.6%. ITO book-to-bill was 0.81 and 0.92 year-to-date. We expect our ITO decline to continue to gradually moderate as we move through FY '22. 
The 2 deals Mike mentioned earlier that slipped out of Q2 that were subsequently closed were in the ITO and Cloud and Security layers of our technology stack and would have boosted our GIS book-to-bill for the quarter to over 1.1. Lastly, Modern Workplace revenues were $581 million, down 10.9% as compared to prior year. This is an improvement from last quarter when Modern Workplace was down 19.7% year-over-year. Book-to-bill was 1.2 and 1.1 year-to-date. 
Next up, let me touch on our efforts to build our financial foundation. This quarter, we made particularly strong progress on strengthening our balance sheet and solidifying our financial position, cash generation and reducing restructuring and TSI expense. 
As Mike pointed out earlier, we've made measurable improvements driving our business to improve our financial foundation that will ultimately allow us to increase our deployable cash affording us more opportunities to create value. We reduced our debt from $12 billion to $5.1 billion. The refinancing of all of our high rate bonds during the quarter culminates our collective efforts to transform the business, improve its trajectory and strengthen our balance sheet. 
There is no similar and clear way of seeing the impact that Mike and his team have made improving the operations of the business than what was accomplished with our debt over the last year. Net interest expense has been reduced from $83 million in the first quarter of FY '21 to $45 million this quarter. With the full benefit of our refinancing, we anticipate interest expense to be reduced to approximately $33 million in Q3. We also continue to deliver on reducing restructuring and TSI expense while increasing our margins. This not only improves our cash flow, it also narrows the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP earnings. 
Finally, capital lease and asset financing is an area that was overused. In the last year or so, we've significantly curtailed new capital lease originations from $1.1 billion in FY '20 and are on track to reduce originations to approximately $500 million this year. These efforts to better manage this form of financing allowed us to reduce our debt and ultimately our capital lease cash outflows from $245 million in Q1 FY '21 to $177 million this quarter. We expect further reductions in our quarterly cash outflows to around $150 million per quarter at the end of FY '22 and further below that level going forward. We delivered these reductions while also better managing capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures were reduced from $225 million in Q1 FY '21 to $159 million Q2 FY '22. 
Based on our reductions to capital lease originations, a more meaningful metric to demonstrate our progress is CapEx spend and capital lease originations as a percent of revenue. CapEx and capital lease originations as a percent of revenue were 10.2% for FY '20, 8% for FY '21 and now down to 5.3% for Q2 FY '22. Delivering 5.3% is a good step forward related to better managing our capital spend as it gets us in the peer range, albeit at the top end and is a proof point of our improved operational rigor. 
Returning to our debt on Slide 16, I want to spend a minute on our recent refinancing. This chart shows how the refinancing further solidifies our financial position. By extending maturities, we now have no bond maturities before FY '26, lowering maturity towers and reducing annual interest expense and cash outflows by about $50 million a year. 
From our improved balance sheet, let's move to cash flow. Cash flow from operations totaled an inflow of $563 million. Free cash flow for the quarter was $404 million, up 33% compared to prior year and moves us to positive free cash flow for the first half of FY '22 of $100 million. The second quarter was impacted by previously disclosed cash tax payments related to business disposals, accelerated interest payments due to our refinancing and a payment related to restructuring a vendor relationship to take greater control over our delivery. 
Further, as part of our strategy to focus on customers, we were able to better manage working capital in the quarter. As we look to the second half, we expect the fourth quarter free cash flow to be stronger. Our third quarter has 2 discrete nonrecurring cash payments, including a $60 million payment associated with a legacy vendor that has a take-or-pay agreement and a $90 million payment associated with COVID relief legislation where we deferred certain tax payments and now have opted to accelerate the tax payments to utilize the tax deduction. 
Slide 18 shows our trended free cash flow profile. The negative cash flow over the last 3 quarters was due in large part to absorbing a number of nonrecurring cash outflows of over $1.7 billion to put the business on a better trajectory, building our foundation. These cash outflows include: $700 million tax payment associated with taxable gains on our divestitures; $500 million to normalize vendor payments; $332 million related to readying the U.S. state and local health and human services business for sale; $114 million to end an AR securitization program; $88 million to end a value-destructive take-or-pay agreement; the $1.7 billion headwinds put into perspective; the $749 million trailing 4 quarters negative free cash flow. 
A key driver of improving cash flow is to continue to reduce our restructuring and TSI spend. Our restructuring and TSI efforts are highly focused, and we believe are a prudent investment in the business addressing our outsized cost structure in certain countries and to reduce our facilities footprint to align to our virtual model. We remain on track to reduce restructuring in TSI from an average of $900 million per year over the last 4 years to $550 million in FY '22 and about $100 million in FY '24. 
I would like to take a moment to update our capital deployment expectations from Investor Day. The Investor Day chart called for 55% of our free cash flow to be used to pay debt and capital lease obligations. As a result of our progress, our cash outflows for debt and capital lease financing are now expected to be about 20% of our free cash flow. That leaves 80% of our expected free cash flow to invest in our business and/or repurchase our stock. I should note, we like the business we have and believe that we have the right level of investment in GBS and GIS. We believe our technology stack has critical mass and capability at each layer. We believe we will create more value by continuing to focus on driving the transformation journey across our business, improving the fundamentals and continuing to build organic growth up the stack, ultimately delivering 1% to 3% organic growth in FY '24. 
Related to acquisitions, our focus is to ensure our platinum channel strategy will be fully vetted and proven out. So eventually, when we are acquisitive with tuck-in sized acquisitions, we will have a clear path to deliver value. 
Related to our debt, we have a clear line of sight to achieving our targeted debt level of $5 billion near term as we have scheduled debt repayments via our capital lease financing and commercial paper. Our preference is to maintain approximately $2.5 billion of cash on hand to fund an appropriate level of working capital. When we have cash in excess of $2.5 billion, we will determine how best to deploy the cash as we do not expect to leave significant levels of excess cash, generating no meaningful returns on our balance sheet for an extended period of time. 
At this point in our journey, we favor share repurchases as our valuation is attractive. In Q2, we repurchased $83 million of our common stock, bringing the FY '22 year-to-date repurchases to $150 million or 3.9 million shares. Our share repurchases are a disciplined approach to capital allocation and are expected to be self-funding using a rather simple formulaic approach of deploying cash in excess of $2.5 billion when we are at our target debt level of approximately $5 billion. We remain very focused on our investment-grade credit profile. 
Turning to our third quarter guidance. We expect revenue between $4.08 billion and $4.13 billion. If exchange rates were at the same level as when we gave guidance last quarter, our third quarter revenue guidance range would be $90 million higher. Organic revenue decline improved to down 1% to down 2.5%; adjusted EBIT margin of 8.6% to 8.9%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.88 to $0.93 per share. 
We are pleased by our progress as we look to the second half of FY '22. I would like to update our current fiscal year guidance. Based on the strengthening U.S. dollar, our revenues are expected to be negatively impacted by approximately $200 million, which has been reflected in our revised guidance range of $16.4 billion to $16.6 billion; reaffirming organic revenue growth at down 1% to down 2%; increasing adjusted EBIT to a range of 8.5% to 8.9%; increasing non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to $3.52 to $3.72 per share; and reaffirming free cash flow guidance of $500 million. We are reaffirming our guidance for FY '24. This reflects our strong execution in driving forward on our transformation journey. 
Before I turn the call back to Mike, I want to reflect a moment as I'm closing out on my first year at DXC. We are clear-eyed on the value we are driving with the transformation journey. We feel strongly there is more opportunity in front of us to continue to improve the business and the underlying economics. 
With that, I will now turn the call back over to Mike for his closing remarks."

We are building the foundation to make DXC operationally efficient, sustainable and ultimately grow. By focusing on the operational work of motivating our colleagues and hiring new talent, moving to a virtual-first model, making service delivery more efficient and implementing better IT tools and reducing real estate, we're able to deliver better for our customers and gives us the ability to sell up the enterprise technology stack to GBS. 
The good news is the financial results that Ken just took us through reduced debt, shrinking restructuring and TSI costs, increased margin and EPS and stronger free cash flow are all sustainable and a result of the operational work we are doing. This gives us confidence that we will achieve our FY '24 double-digit margin guidance. 
On growth, Q2 confirms that we're on the right trajectory for growth. Our focus on delivering and fixing the GIS business develop trusted relationships with our Platinum customers. We're then taking our GBS offerings to our Platinum customers, selling up the enterprise technology stack. The evidence that this is working is in our organic revenue results of GIS, GBS and the overall company. This also gives us confidence that we will achieve our FY '24 guidance of 1% to 3% growth. 
In closing, I'm confident that by staying focused on our transformation journey of building the foundation, we will continue to deliver in the short term and ultimately deliver our long-term financial targets of margin, growth and free cash flow.

And in my mind, we are in the early innings for both, all right, organic revenue and also margin. So let's tackle the margin first because the margin is -- the progression is clear that we're delivering. Remember the cost levers that we're dealing with, and they're mostly all related to our people. So the first one is we have a bias towards making sure that our own people do the work for our clients and customers and set a contractor. So we're very focused on contractor conversion. 
Second is we want to get the right people in the right location. That's why I mentioned the footprint. So that's scaling our GIDCs. Third is the virtual-first model. So that's why I continue to talk about real estate. We should be minimizing or definitely taking down our real estate footprint. And then the last thing is, let's not have our folks do stuff that we can automate. 
So when I look at those 4 levers of cost, I would say we're definitely in the early innings because there's still much more to do. That's what gives us confidence that we can reach the double digits in FY '24. Quite frankly, that's also what gives us confidence to raise the guidance in terms of the margin and EPS for FY '22. 
Now look, on revenue, what I would tell you there is the payoff is going to occur over time, but we're seeing a lot of good things happening. So when I talk about green shoots, green shoot #1 is NPS is up, that means customers are happy with our delivery. Second is we're definitely getting to see more at-bats. Those at-bats are coming, both in terms of the GIS business, but we're now seeing all those at-bats happening in GBS. But what will happen is those will convert over time. And the best proof of those at-bats converting is the fact that we are growing analytics and engineering, we're also growing applications. So look, when I say the early innings, I would also say that the margin is a little bit ahead of the revenue. But the revenue is there. I think over time, you're going to continue to see that the strategy we laid out to deliver the GIS business and to continue to try to grow up the stack, the GBS, is one that will serve us incredibly well."

Third step one then was to start talking to them and being proactive and innovative with them. And that's not just one conversation. And the reason I gave you that example is that, that's the way these things can look. They take time. That's why I answered Rod's question the way I did in terms of early innings.

And I was just -- wanted to tease that out a little bit, and particularly as you're on your journey here to try to get the positive growth rate, why not tilt a little bit more to selective M&A to try to accelerate that form of growth. And I'm not saying use M&A to get growth, but once you buy some companies, it helps you as you even anniversary, get in new areas like Luxoft. But why the emphasis on buybacks over a little bit of M&A?"

And what we got to do is kind of continue to execute what we have, all right? So think about the strategies we're putting in place for growth, all right? Deliver and fix GIS and continue to make sure that we're selling the offerings that we have in Applications and Analytics and Engineering. That's piece 1. Piece 2 is the Platinum customer channel and being able to take new things like Luxoft through that channel. So my point right now is we've got more than enough to get us to where we need to be for FY '24. 
Now having said that, you should have also heard that if something falls in our lap, we will absolutely do it, all right, and look at it, we got the money. And don't take Ken's comments as etched totally in stone. I mean we can pivot one way or the other. But we definitely think we're undervalued right now. So therefore, we think a good use of the cash is to buy our stock. 
The last thing I will tell you is we continue to go through this business and do the hard work around making sure that we don't have any distractions from the enterprise technology stack. So we continue to divest a small piece of those businesses that, quite frankly, we are not 100% focused on our enterprise technology stack. 
So Keith, I look at that work and I look at how we're undervalued, and I say, okay, best use of the cash right now in the short term, buyback, all right? All while we continue to balance that investment grade profile, okay? So I think that balance is important."
