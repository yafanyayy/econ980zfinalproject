318505463,701330531,2192680,"Fortive Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2021",2021-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Fortive Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Griffin, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we are pleased to announce our fourth quarter 2020 results, which reflect a strong finish to the year. For the quarter, we delivered adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $0.70, an increase of 19%",2805,"Thanks, Griffin, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we are pleased to announce our fourth quarter 2020 results, which reflect a strong finish to the year. For the quarter, we delivered adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $0.70, an increase of 19% year-over-year as well as total revenue growth of 4.9%, which exceeded the high end of our guidance and included a return to positive core growth. The quarter underline the increased resilience of our portfolio and represented a continuation of the sequential improvement in top line performance that we have seen since late in Q2. Despite the continued challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, our disciplined application of the Fortive business system helped drive more than 100 basis points of core operating margin expansion and a 39% increase in free cash flow. 
The better top line performance in Q4 reflected a combination of durability across the recurring revenue portions of our portfolio and clear improvement at Fluke and Tektronix. The strength of our recurring revenue, which now accounts for approximately 39% of our total revenue, provided an important source of stability throughout 2020. In Q4, this was most notable among our SaaS offerings, which generated low teens growth. The application of FBS customer success tools also continued to deliver improvements in net revenue retention, which climbed greater than 101% for the full year. Our SaaS performance helped offset the challenges the software businesses are having with customer site access for the provision of services as well as extended time lines for contract renewals. The fourth quarter also saw Fluke and Tektronix return to positive growth. Both have seen steady improvements since the middle of Q2, driven by better point-of-sale trends across major geographies and continued successful new product launches. 
On January 19, we disposed of our remaining 19.9% ownership stake in Vontier through a tax-efficient debt for equity exchange. This transaction represents the final step in the Vontier separation. With a combination of the Vontier spin proceeds, the debt for equity exchange and our continued strong free cash flow, we have reduced our net debt by approximately $3 billion since the beginning of Q4, with a net leverage ratio currently at approximately 1.3x, we have significant capacity to pursue key capital allocation priorities. 
With that, let's turn to the details of the quarter on Slide 4. Adjusted net earnings were $252.9 million, up 19.3% from the prior year, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $0.70. Total sales increased 4.9% to $1.3 billion, with core revenue up 0.7%, reflecting continued sequential improvement from the prior quarter. Acquisitions contributed 260 basis points of growth and favorable foreign exchange rates increased growth by 160 basis points. We are particularly pleased to deliver adjusted gross margins of 58.5%, representing a new high for Fortive, which highlights the significant portfolio transformation accomplished over the last few years. Gross margins also benefited from our ongoing investment in innovation, continued application of FBS growth tools and another quarter of strong pricing. 
Adjusted operating profit margin was 23.2% for the quarter. This reflected 130 basis points of core margin -- operating margin expansion, including positive core OMX for each of the segments. This was the second consecutive quarter with greater than 100 basis points of core OMX. The Q4 margin performance also contributed to 50 basis points of positive core OMX for the full year 2020. During the fourth quarter, we generated $313 million of free cash flow representing conversion of 124% of adjusted net earnings and an increase of 39% year-over-year. Including this fourth quarter contribution, our full year 2020 free cash flow was $902 million, representing conversion of 120% of adjusted net earnings and an increase of 44% year-over-year. 
Our 2020 free cash flow performance, in particular, showed the resilience of our portfolio and the power of the Fortive business system to drive consistent, strong increases in free cash flow. 
On Slide 6 of today's presentation, we show the region-by-region breakdown for the fourth quarter, in which we continue to see sequential improvement across our major regions. In Asia, core revenue increased by low single digits, highlighted by high single-digit growth in China and mid-single-digit growth in India. Continued strength in China was broad-based, led by mid-20% growth in sensing, mid-teens growth at Fluke and high-teens growth at advanced sterilization products. This strength in China and India was offset by declines in most of the rest of Asia. 
Western Europe, core revenue increased by high single digits in the fourth quarter with high-teens growth at Fluke Health Solutions, high single-digit growth at Tektronix and mid-single-digit growth in ASP. 
North America core revenue was down slightly in the fourth quarter as low teens growth in Tektronix and high single-digit growth in census was primarily offset by declines in ASP and industrial scientific. Fluke improved to flat core growth in North America, driven by strong performance in Fluke calibration and a return to growth at Fluke Industrial. 
Turning to our segments. Intelligent operating solutions posted a total revenue increase of 3.2% despite a 0.3% decline in core revenue. Acquisitions increased growth by 170 basis points, while favorable foreign exchange rates increased growth by 180 basis points. Core operating margin increased 280 basis points as price realization, improved mix and higher volumes of Fluke resulted in segment level adjusted operating margin of 28.7%. Fluke's core revenue returned to positive growth in the fourth quarter, increasing by low single digits. Fluke's another quarter of strong growth in China, which increased by mid-teens in addition to seeing continued improvements in North America and Western Europe, which were flat and down low single digits, respectively. Point of sales showed improvement with North America still negative, but better sequentially. Western Europe turning positive and China continuing at a positive high single-digit rate. Fluke saw strong performance in Fluke Calibration and Fluke digital as well as solid growth at Fluke Industrial. Fluke digital was led by another strong quarter from emaint, including low double-digit SaaS growth. Fluke continues to see momentum from recent product launches, including its II910 Sonic Imager, which was launched in November. 
Industrial scientific core revenue declined by mid-single digits in the fourth quarter. Inek continued to see good growth, which is more than offset by continued oil and gas-related pressure at ISC's instrumentation and rental businesses. Separately, Intelex continued to perform well, with revenues increasing by low double digits. The fourth quarter also represented a record bookings quarter for Intelex, which has seen strong traction and its expansion into Western Europe. Intelex is benefiting from the implementation of FBS, which contributed to the successful rollout of enhanced sales funnel management and digital marketing lead generation tools. In November, Intelex also completed the acquisition of EHS AI, a leading provider of artificial intelligence and machine learning for the automation of permitting and regulatory compliance management. The addition of EHS AI significantly enhances Intelex's ability to deliver applied intelligence and advanced analytics to a broad range of customers. 
At Accruent, we also saw significant sequential improvement, driven primarily by strong growth in its SaaS offerings. While Accruent declined by low single digits for the quarter, its SaaS business increased by mid-teens. Accruent also continued to apply FBS to drive improvement in churn in the quarter, bringing net retention for the year to greater than 100%. Despite some continued pressure from customer site access issues, Accruent is seeing good bookings for its Meridian, engineering and information management offering as we partner with customers on their digital transformations in highly regulated markets such as life science and pharma. We also continue to bring new offerings to market to address return to work requirements, including a recent win for occurrence EMS space management software product for Cushman & Wakefield. 
Gordian declined by high single digits due to headwinds associated with budget challenges and uncertainty across state and local government and higher education customers as well as continued site access issues. Gordian's RS means business grew low single digits, driven by mid-teens growth for its SaaS offering, supported by the successful implementation of virtual platforms for training and on-boarding. Gordian also saw signs of improvement in project activity in its job order contracting business towards the end of the quarter. 
Turning to our Precision Technology segment. We posted a total revenue increase of 2.3% with a 0.7% increase in core revenue. Favorable foreign exchange rates increased growth by 160 basis points. Core operating margin increased 30 basis points, resulting in segment level adjusted operating margin of 22.2%. 
Tektronix delivered mid single-digit core growth in the quarter with low teens growth in North America and high single-digit growth in Western Europe. Tektronix continue to benefit from better point-of-sale trends in both regions with significant improvement from Q3. China saw a low single-digit decline due primarily to the negative impact of the expansion of trade restrictions, partially offset by good year-over-year point-of-sale growth and momentum from small and medium enterprise customers. Looking across the product line, the improved top line performance in Q4 was driven by low double-digit growth in both Keithley and the mainstream mix scope -- mixed-signal siliscopes platforms. Growth in mainstream siliscopes continues to be led by the 6 series line of scopes, which has seen strong demand for the new 6 and 8 channel versions since they were introduced in Q3. 
Sensing technologies declined low single digits in the fourth quarter. Sensing performed well in China with mid-20% growth, driven by gains in critical environment applications, et cetera, and increased OEM demand for Hinkle Dynapar's factory automation offerings. North America revenue increased slightly, while Western Europe declined low single digits, with both regions showing clear sequential improvement. Sensing's improved top line performance was primarily due to continued strength in medical and semiconductor end markets. Astra's recently launched airwatch negative pressure machine for isolation room applications, has performed well, generating strong initial orders since its launch early in the quarter with orders from a range of customers across medical offices, long-term care facilities and tools. 
[indiscernible] EMC declined low single digits as it continued to face COVID-19 related pressures across certain elements of its supply chain. The company did see clear sequential top line improvement versus the third quarter as well as another quarter of strong bookings. EMC entered 2021 in a strong backlog position as its leading technology and innovation capabilities continue to drive strong demand. 
Moving to Advanced health Care Solutions. Total revenue increased 12% with a 2.6% increase in core revenue. Acquisitions added 830 basis points to growth, while favorable foreign exchange rates increased growth by 110 basis points. Core operating margin increased 50 basis points, resulting in segment level adjusted operating margin of 24.1%, up significantly versus Q3 and driven by strong margin lift at ASP as we continue to exit the transition service agreements. ASP declined mid-single digits as pandemic related pressure on elective procedure volumes remained a headwind. Elective procedure volumes averaged approximately 93% of pre-COVID levels across the company's major markets, but were lower than anticipated and did not see slowing and did see slowing towards the end of the quarter. ASP continued to perform well in Western Europe with mid-single-digit growth in addition to high-teens growth in China. In the U.S., ASP declined low single digits as growth in capital placements from improved sales execution and funnel management partially offset the weakness in consumables revenue. ASP's service business continues to perform well with the ongoing deployment of FBS tools helping to drive service sales and optimize service delivery processes. With additional day 2 closings in Q4 and early 2021, approximately 99% of ASP's global revenue is now fully under our control and off of transition service agreements. Census grew by high single digits in the quarter. Site access at hospitals improved early in the quarter, only to then reverse as the quarter progressed. Sensor top line performance was led by its SaaS-based sensor track offering, which grew low double digits, driven by a combination of new customer acquisitions and successful upselling of existing customers. This growth was partially offset by high single-digit decline in professional services revenue tied directly to the ongoing challenges with customer site access. 
Health Solutions generated mid single-digit growth in Q4. FHS grew slightly in North America against a challenging comparison. This growth was led by strong performance across both Fluke biomed and the land our radiation monitoring business. FHS continues to see good initial momentum across the 2 software platforms introduced over the past 12 months. One QA, which enhances workflow efficiency and test automation for biomedical customers and optimize, which provides tracking and optimization of radiation dose management for radiology departments. Both platforms reflect FHS' focus on bringing forward software and AI-enabled revenue models to build on its strong existing recurring revenue base. 
Invatec had another strong quarter with greater than 50% growth. The company saw significant sales and order momentum throughout the year, including a strong finish in December. This growth was led by Invatec design and engineering offering, which more than doubled on a year-over-year basis in Q4. The company saw strong growth in the diagnostics market, driven by near-term projects to develop rapid testing capabilities for COVID-19 as well as strong demand from the cell therapy market tied to the production from next-generation therapeutics. 
On Slide 11, we highlight the progress made in 2020 with respect to our corporate social responsibility efforts, which is one of our key strategic initiatives. Throughout the year, we enhanced the rigor and integrity of our data collection by transitioning our EH&S, sustainability and risk assessment processes to the Intelex platform. Our enhanced data analytics improve insights to accelerate our sustainability efforts and give greater transparency to key stakeholders. To support inclusion and diversity, our employee and friends resource groups focused on improving employee connections across the organization while utilizing FBS to enhance their impact. We also expanded our commitment to the CEO in action pledge by participating in the 2021 racial equity fellowship aimed at promoting corporate best practices to address systemic racism and social injustice. We are using FBS tools to develop standard work for greenhouse gas accounting and reporting and scaling energy Kaizen efforts more broadly across the portfolio. This has resulted in making substantial progress towards our greenhouse gas reduction goals, which we expect to achieve ahead of schedule. 
Finally, Fortive employees around the world continue to support our local communities through our efforts in our annual day of caring with over 35,000 hours of service in 60 worldwide communities. We are living our values to achieve our CSR goals, and we're excited to continue driving progress in the years ahead. 
Turning to guidance on Slide 12. We're instituting formal earnings guidance for the full year and the first quarter of 2021. For the full year, we expect adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be $2.40 to $2.55, representing year-over-year growth of 15% to 22% on a continuing operations basis. The annual guidance assumes core revenue growth of 4% to 7%, and an adjusted operating profit margin of 22% to 23% and an effective tax rate of approximately 14%. We also expect free cash conversion to be approximately 105% of adjusted net income. We are also initiating our first quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance of $0.56 to $0.60, representing year-over-year growth of 22% to 30%. This includes assumptions of 5% to 8% core revenue growth and adjusted operating profit margin of 21.5% to 22.5% and an effective tax rate of 14%. We also expect free cash conversion to be approximately 75% of adjusted net income. 
Before we wrap up, I'd like to thank the Fortive team for their efforts in 2020. I'm tremendously proud of how our team rose to meet the many challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. With a focus on keeping our employees safe, helping frontline workers combat the virus and continuing to provide our customers with our essential technologies. Despite these challenges, we made substantial progress across a range of strategic imperatives over the course of the year. The focus and dedication of our team around the world enabled us to significantly transform the portfolio while transitioning to a work-from-home environment and ensuring continued execution across the portfolio to deliver strong margin performance and consistent free cash flow growth. 
As a result of that hard work and the significant progress it enabled, we're in a strong position as we turn our focus to 2021 while navigating some of the continued challenges in the near term. With the portfolio comprised of leading businesses that are well positioned in attractive markets, considerable opportunity to accelerate our growth through continued investments in organic innovation and acquisitions and the support of a strong culture rooted in the Fortive business system, we're very excited about the road ahead. 
With that, I'd like to turn it back to Griffin."

It's interesting because we don't really talk about Invatec. Now that it's in a smaller segment. Obviously, a little bit more material, but I think the more important thing is, given the strength of the business and the work they did, a little bit of an opportunity to talk about the good work they're doing. That business that we were talking about in the prepared remarks, Nigel, is really focused on really design and engineering resources for diagnostic companies as an example. So think of it as outsourced engineering capability. And as we said in the prepared remarks, a number of opportunities around testing companies that were looking at COVID-19 and also maybe more broadly and more longer-term in cell therapeutics. So a number of opportunities. The business is a little bit lumpy because of the nature of the business model. We're working to change that over time. The leadership team has done a nice job of that, but I think, first and foremost, they've done an nice job on growing the business. They were up, I think, for the year, up over 20%. So a good -- roughly, think of it as under $100 million business. So that kind of number. Relative to ASP, I think your question was around AHS and the growth rate at AHS if I had it right, but I'll talk about AHS and ASP in terms of the growth rate. We certainly have good growth. If we were to think about the guide we've got out there, AHS will probably be one of our better growers. They'll run into a couple of comp issues at FHS, an example in Invatec in the second half. But I think if we were look on a 2-year stack basis, you would see progressively better growth through the year at AHS and that's on the backs of really ASP continuing to be good. There is an assumption there that we get vaccinated here that hospitals get elective procedures back on track by the second half. I think that's a comfortable assumption at this point."

And not only did we get a moratorium on some of those taxes that we have to pay back over the next 2 years, but we also have to reinstate that. So we need to -- we're a little overstated and not overstated, 2020 came in stronger because of that, but that's about a $50 million headwind in 2021. And then the second part would be around working capital as we start to reengage and see growth here. We think it's prudent to put to say that our turns may not go down, but it will probably be a little bit of use of cash as we grow those businesses. So we've got another $50 million for that. Those are the 2 biggest things that's going on there."

You got sensing business and tack are the 2 big pieces there, Julian. I think #1 is, if you look on a 2-year stack, we'd see the business continuing to do pretty well. So some of it has a little bit just to do with the comps. The growth rates will look a little bit lower in the second half, but fundamentally, if we look over a 2-year period, we'll see those business kind of continue. I don't think we have a plan for it to jump, though, either. So I think right now, I think with the visibility, particularly on the sensing side, we're probably a little bit more prudent just to dial in what we think will happen without an extensive situation. So as I mentioned before on the question, as we look at the guide, we see AHS probably being that if we think about it on a 2-year stack basis, AHS probably being better -- iOS being better and then PT being maybe a little bit less than O2.

We're still at -- we really don't know the exact date at which COVID will open up offices and get customers back up and fully running. So I think when we look at it, continuing to get better through the year, we make a bunch of our own look like we did in 2020, where as you know, we were basically over 1% overall in the year. So I think we'll continue to make our own luck. And if things play out a little bit better economically, then certainly, fundamentally, you probably see a bigger number, but I think for now, with the level of uncertainty out there, and the trajectory that we ended on, I think this is a strong guide."

So the portfolio has really shifted in that regard.

And that I think, a number of those things are going to start to characterize themselves as we get further into the year.

The good news, as we said in the prepared remarks, is we continue to see point-of-sale in a good place, and we also saw good demand among medium -- small and medium customers.

We're going to start with a bigger installed base than we did a year ago. And obviously, that bodes well for when consumables come back. So to your specific question, it was a combination of -- it was also a big improvement in services. One of the things that we've really been doing, Deane, in China is that when we first bought the business, and we were lucky that that this was a business that we took control of early. One of the things we noticed was that the service revenue was a lower percentage of our sales in China than it was anywhere else in the world. So we applied a number of FBS tools including policy deployment to make service revenue a big push for us in the business. And we've really, really increased the percent -- the stickiness or the connection rate with our equipment and increased service contracts with current customers. So the growth was very much a story of not only electives coming back, but also equipment and the big story was service."

We -- particularly in our -- whether it's the focus more on EH&S at every company in the world, and we have an outstanding portfolio of EH&S businesses.

There's always 1 segment that leads the pack a little bit more than the others, but I think what we saw was the breadth of OMX. And I think as we sit here looking into 2021, the 50 basis points that we grew OMX despite all the issues in 2020 gives us tremendous confidence that we can continue to do that in '21."

318505463,701330531,2193260,"Fortive Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2021",2021-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Fortive Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Griffin, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we are pleased to announce our fourth quarter 2020 results, which reflect a strong finish to the year. For the quarter, we delivered adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $0.70, an increase of 19%",2813,"Thanks, Griffin, and good afternoon, everyone. Today, we are pleased to announce our fourth quarter 2020 results, which reflect a strong finish to the year. For the quarter, we delivered adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $0.70, an increase of 19% year-over-year as well as total revenue growth of 4.9%, which exceeded the high end of our guidance and included a return to positive core growth. 
The quarter underlined the increased resilience of our portfolio and represented a continuation of the sequential improvement in top line performance that we have seen since late in Q2. Despite the continued challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, our disciplined application of the Fortive Business System helped drive more than 100 basis points of core operating margin expansion and a 39% increase in free cash flow. 
The better top line performance in Q4 reflected a combination of durability across the recurring revenue portions of our portfolio and clear improvement at Fluke and Tektronix. The strength of our recurring revenue, which now accounts for approximately 39% of our total revenue, provided an important source of stability throughout 2020. In Q4, this was most notable among our SaaS offerings, which generated low teens growth. The application of FBS customer success tools also continued to deliver improvements in net revenue retention, which climbed greater than 101% for the full year. Our SaaS performance helped offset the challenges the software businesses are having with customer site access for the provision of services as well as extended time lines for contract renewals. The fourth quarter also saw Fluke and Tektronix return to positive growth. Both have seen steady improvements since the middle of Q2, driven by better point of sale trends across major geographies and continued successful new product launches. 
On January 19, we disposed of our remaining 19.9% ownership stake in Vontier through a tax-efficient debt-for-equity exchange. This transaction represents the final step in the Vontier separation. With a combination of the Vontier spin proceeds, the debt-for-equity exchange and our continued strong free cash flow, we have reduced our net debt by approximately $3 billion since the beginning of Q4. With a net leverage ratio currently at approximately 1.3x, we have significant capacity to pursue key capital allocation priorities. 
With that, let's turn to the details of the quarter on Slide 4. Adjusted net earnings were $252.9 million, up 19.3% from the prior year, and adjusted diluted net earnings per share was $0.70. Total sales increased 4.9% to $1.3 billion, with core revenue up 0.7%, reflecting continued sequential improvement from the prior quarter. Acquisitions contributed 260 basis points to growth, and favorable foreign exchange rates increased growth by 160 basis points. 
We are particularly pleased to deliver adjusted gross margins of 58.5%, representing a new high for Fortive, which highlights the significant portfolio transformation accomplished over the last few years. Gross margins also benefited from our ongoing investment in innovation, continued application of FBS growth tools and another quarter of strong pricing. 
Adjusted operating profit margin was 23.2% for the quarter. This reflected 130 basis points of core margin -- operating margin expansion, including positive core OMX for each of the segments. This was the second consecutive quarter with greater than 100 basis points of core OMX. The Q4 margin performance also contributed to 50 basis points of positive core OMX for the full year 2020. 
During the fourth quarter, we generated $313 million of free cash flow representing conversion of 124% of adjusted net earnings and an increase of 39% year-over-year. Including this fourth quarter contribution, our full year 2020 free cash flow was $902 million, representing conversion of 120% of adjusted net earnings and an increase of 44% year-over-year. Our 2020 free cash flow performance, in particular, showed the resilience of our portfolio and the power of the Fortive Business System to drive consistent, strong increases in free cash flow. 
On Slide 6 today -- of today's presentation, we show the region-by-region breakdown for the fourth quarter, in which we continue to see sequential improvement across our major regions. In Asia, core revenue increased by low single digits, highlighted by high single-digit growth in China and mid-single-digit growth in India. Continued strength in China was broad-based, led by mid-20% growth in Sensing, mid-teens growth at Fluke and high-teens growth at Advanced Sterilization Products. This strength in China and India was offset by declines in most of the rest of Asia. 
Western Europe core revenue increased by high single digits in the fourth quarter with high-teens growth at Fluke Health Solutions, high single-digit growth at Tektronix and mid-single-digit growth in ASP. 
North America core revenue was down slightly in the fourth quarter as low-teens growth in Tektronix and high single-digit growth in Censis was primarily offset by declines in ASP and Industrial Scientific. Fluke improved to flat core growth in North America driven by strong performance in Fluke Calibration and a return to growth at Fluke Industrial. 
Turning to our segments. Intelligent Operating Solutions posted a total revenue increase of 3.2% despite a 0.3% decline in core revenue. Acquisitions increased growth by 170 basis points, while favorable foreign exchange rates increased growth by 180 basis points. Core operating margin increased 280 basis points as price realization, improved mix and higher volumes of Fluke resulted in segment-level adjusted operating margin of 28.7%. 
Fluke's core revenue returned to positive growth in the fourth quarter, increasing by low single digits. Fluke saw another quarter of strong growth in China, which increased by mid-teens, in addition to seeing continued improvements in North America and Western Europe, which were flat and down low single digits, respectively. Point of sale showed improvement with North America still negative but better sequentially, Western Europe turning positive and China continuing at a positive high single-digit rate. Fluke saw strong performance in Fluke Calibration and Fluke Digital as well as solid growth at Fluke Industrial. Fluke Digital was led by another strong quarter from eMaint, including low double-digit SaaS growth. Fluke continues to see momentum from recent product launches, including its ii910 sonic imager, which was launched in November. 
Industrial Scientific core revenue declined by mid-single digits in the fourth quarter. iNet continued to see good growth, which is more than offset by continued oil and gas-related pressure at ISC's instrumentation and rental businesses. Separately, Intelex continued to perform well, with revenues increasing by low double digits. The fourth quarter also represented a record bookings quarter for Intelex, which has seen strong traction in its expansion into Western Europe. Intelex is benefiting from the implementation of FBS, which contributed to the successful rollout of enhanced sales funnel management and digital marketing lead generation tools. 
In November, Intelex also completed the acquisition of ehsAI, a leading provider of artificial intelligence and machine learning for the automation of permitting and regulatory compliance management. The addition of ehsAI significantly enhances Intelex' ability to deliver applied intelligence and advanced analytics to a broad range of customers. 
At Accruent, we also saw significant sequential improvement, driven primarily by strong growth in its SaaS offerings. While Accruent declined by low single digits for the quarter, its SaaS business increased by mid-teens. Accruent also continued to apply FBS to drive improvement in churn in the quarter, bringing net retention for the year to greater than 100%. Despite some continued pressure from customer site access issues, Accruent is seeing good bookings for its Meridian engineering and information management offering as we partner with customers on their digital transformations in highly regulated markets, such as life science and pharma. We also continue to bring new offerings to market to address work -- return to work requirements, including a recent win for Accruent's EMS space management software product for Cushman & Wakefield. 
Gordian declined by high single digits due to headwinds associated with budget challenges and uncertainty across state and local government and higher education customers as well as continued site access issues. Gordian's RSMeans business grew low single digits, driven by mid-teens growth for its SaaS offering, supported by the successful implementation of virtual platforms for training and onboarding. Gordian also saw signs of improvement in project activity in its job order contracting business towards the end of the quarter. 
Turning to our Precision Technologies segment. We posted a total revenue increase of 2.3% with a 0.7% increase in core revenue. Favorable foreign exchange rates increased growth by 160 basis points. Core operating margin increased 30 basis points, resulting in segment-level adjusted operating margin of 22.2%. 
Tektronix delivered mid single-digit core growth in the quarter with low-teens growth in North America and high single-digit growth in Western Europe. Tektronix continued to benefit from better point of sale trends in both regions with significant improvement from Q3. China saw a low single-digit decline due primarily to the negative impact of the expansion of trade restrictions, partially offset by good year-over-year point of sale growth and momentum from small and medium enterprise customers. 
Looking across the product line, the improved top line performance in Q4 was driven by low double-digit growth in both Keithley and the mainstream mixed-single oscilloscope -- mixed-signal oscilloscope platforms. Growth in mainstream oscilloscopes continues to be led by the 6 Series line of scopes, which has seen strong demand for the new 6- and 8-channel versions since they were introduced in Q3. 
Sensing Technologies declined low single digits in the fourth quarter. Sensing performed well in China with mid-20% growth driven by gains in critical environment applications, et cetera, and increased OEM demand for Hengstler, Dynapar's factory automation offerings. North America revenue increased slightly, while Western Europe declined low single digits, with both regions showing clear sequential improvement. Sensing's improved top line performance was primarily due to continued strength in medical and semiconductor end markets. Setra's recently launched AIIR Watch negative pressure machine for isolation room applications has performed well, generating strong initial orders since its launch early in the quarter with orders from a range of customers across medical offices, long-term care facilities and schools. 
PacSci EMC declined low single digits as it continued to face COVID-19-related pressures across certain elements of its supply chain. The company did see sequential -- clear sequential top line improvement versus the third quarter as well as another quarter of strong bookings. EMC entered 2021 in a strong backlog position as its leading technology and innovation capabilities continue to drive strong demand. 
Moving to Advanced Health Care Solutions. Total revenue increased 12% with a 2.6% increase in core revenue. Acquisitions added 830 basis points to growth, while favorable foreign exchange rates increased growth by 110 basis points. Core operating margin increased 50 basis points, resulting in segment-level adjusted operating margin of 24.1%, up significantly versus Q3 and driven by strong margin lift at ASP as we continue to exit the transition service agreements. 
ASP declined mid-single digits as pandemic-related pressure on elective procedure volumes remained a headwind. Elective procedure volumes averaged approximately 93% of pre-COVID levels across the company's major markets but were lower than anticipated and did not see slowing -- and did see slowing towards the end of the quarter. ASP continued to perform well in Western Europe with mid-single-digit growth in addition to high-teens growth in China. In the U.S., ASP declined low single digits as growth in capital placements from improved sales execution and funnel management partially offset the weakness in consumables revenue. ASP's service business continues to perform well with the ongoing deployment of FBS tools helping to drive service sales and optimize service delivery processes. With additional [ day 2 ] closings in Q4 and early 2021, approximately 99% of ASP's global revenue is now fully under our control and off of transition service agreements. 
Censis grew by high single digits in the quarter. Site access at hospitals improved early in the quarter, only to then reverse as the quarter progressed. Censis top line performance was led by its SaaS-based CensiTrac offering, which grew low double digits driven by a combination of new customer acquisitions and successful upselling of existing customers. This growth was partially offset by a high single-digit decline in professional services revenue tied directly to the ongoing challenges with customer site access. 
Fluke Health Solutions generated mid single-digit growth in Q4. FHS grew slightly in North America against a challenging comparison. This growth was led by strong performance across both Fluke biomed and the Landauer radiation monitoring business. FHS continues to see good initial momentum across the 2 software platforms introduced over the past 12 months. OneQA, which enhances workflow efficiency and test automation for biomedical customers; and OPTIMIZE, which provides tracking and optimization of radiation dose management for radiology departments, both platforms reflect FHS' focus on bringing forward software and AI-enabled revenue models to build on its strong existing recurring revenue base. 
Invetech had another strong quarter with greater than 50% growth. The company saw significant sales and order momentum throughout the year, including a strong finish in December. This growth was led by Invetech's design and engineering offering, which more than doubled on a year-over-year basis in Q4. The company saw strong growth in the diagnostics market driven by near-term projects to develop rapid testing capabilities for COVID-19 as well as strong demand from the cell therapy market tied to the production of next-generation therapeutics. 
On Slide 11, we highlight the progress made in 2020 with respect to our corporate social responsibility efforts, which is one of our key strategic initiatives. Throughout the year, we enhanced the rigor and integrity of our data collection by transitioning our EH&S sustainability and risk assessment processes to the Intelex platform. Our enhanced data analytics improve insights to accelerate our sustainability efforts and give greater transparency to key stakeholders. To support inclusion and diversity, our Employee & Friends Resource Group focused on improving employee connections across the organization while utilizing FBS to enhance their impact. 
We also expanded our commitment to the CEO in Action (sic) [ CEO Action ] pledge by participating in a 2021 racial equity fellowship aimed at promoting corporate best practices to address systemic racism and social injustice. We are using FBS tools to develop standard work for greenhouse gas accounting and reporting and scaling energy kaizen efforts more broadly across the portfolio. This has resulted in making substantial progress towards our greenhouse gas reduction goals, which we expect to achieve ahead of schedule. 
Finally, Fortive employees around the world continue to support our local communities through our efforts in our annual Day of Caring with over 35,000 hours of service in 60 worldwide communities. We are living our values to achieve our CRS -- CSR goals, and we're excited to continue driving progress in the years ahead. 
Turning to guidance on Slide 12. We're instituting formal earnings guidance for the full year and the first quarter of 2021. For the full year, we expect adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be $2.40 to $2.55, representing year-over-year growth of 15% to 22% on a continuing operations basis. The annual guidance assumes core revenue growth of 4% to 7%, and an adjusted operating profit margin of 22% to 23% and an effective tax rate of approximately 14%. We also expect free cash conversion to be approximately 105% of adjusted net income. We are also initiating our first quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance of $0.56 to $0.60, representing year-over-year growth of 22% to 30%. This includes assumptions of 5% to 8% core revenue growth and adjusted operating profit margin of 21.5% to 22.5% and an effective tax rate of 14%. We also expect free cash conversion to be approximately 75% of adjusted net income. 
Before we wrap up, I'd like to thank the Fortive team for their efforts in 2020. I'm tremendously proud of how our team rose to meet the many challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. With a focus on keeping our employees safe, helping frontline workers combat the virus and continuing to provide our customers with our essential technologies. Despite these challenges, we made substantial progress across a range of strategic imperatives over the course of the year. 
The focus and dedication of our team around the world enabled us to significantly transform the portfolio while transitioning to a work-from-home environment and ensuring continued execution across the portfolio to deliver strong margin performance and consistent free cash flow growth. As a result of that hard work and the significant progress it enabled, we're in a strong position as we turn our focus to 2021 while navigating some of the continued challenges in the near term. 
With a portfolio comprised of leading businesses that are well positioned in attractive markets, considerable opportunity to accelerate our growth through continued investments in organic innovation and acquisitions and the support of a strong culture rooted in the Fortive Business System, we're very excited about the road ahead. 
With that, I'd like to turn it back to Griffin."

It's interesting because we don't really talk about Invetech now that it's in a smaller segment. Obviously, a little bit more material, but I think the more important thing is, given the strength of the business and the work they did, a little bit of an opportunity to talk about the good work they're doing. That business that we were talking about in the prepared remarks, Nigel, is really focused on really design and engineering resources for diagnostic companies as an example. So just think of it as outsourced engineering capability and, as we said in the prepared remarks, a number of opportunities around testing companies that were looking at COVID-19 and also, maybe more broadly and more longer-term, in cell therapeutics. So a number of opportunities. 
The business is a little bit lumpy because of the nature of the business model. We're working to change that over time. The leadership team has done a nice job of that, but I think, first and foremost, they've done a nice job of growing the business. They were up -- I think, for the year, up over 20%. So a good -- roughly, think of it as an under-$100 million business, so that kind of number. 
Relative to ASP, I think your question was around AHS and the growth rate at AHS if I had it right. But I'll talk about AHS and ASP in terms of the growth rate. We certainly have good growth. If we were to think about the guide we've got out there, AHS will probably be one of our better growers. They'll run into a couple of comp issues at FHS, an example in Invetech in the second half. But I think if we were to look on a 2-year stack basis, you would see progressively better growth through the year at AHS, and that's on the backs of, really, ASP continuing to be good. 
There is an assumption there that we get vaccinated here, that hospitals get elective procedures back on track by the second half. I think that's a comfortable assumption at this point."

Yes, there's a couple of things I want to point out on the free cash flow. We're very proud of how we managed through the year in 2020. Going forward, though, keep in mind there's some tailwinds that came in through the year relative to the CARES Act. And not only did we get a moratorium on some of those taxes that we have to pay back over the next 2 years, but we also have to reinstate that. So we need to -- we're a little overstated in -- not overstated. 2020 came in stronger because of that, but that's about a $50 million headwind in 2021. 
And then the second part would be around working capital. As we start to reengage and see growth here, we think it's prudent to put to say that our turns may not go down, but it will probably be a little bit of use of cash as we grow those businesses. So we've got another $50 million for that. Those are the 2 biggest things that's going on there."

The year's guided mid-single digit. Second quarter should have an easy comp. So it looks like you're dialing in a fairly steep slowdown in the back half of the year.

You got Sensing business and Tek are the 2 big pieces there, Julian. I think #1 is, if you look on a 2-year stack, we'd see the business continuing to do pretty well.

The growth rates will look a little bit lower in the second half, but fundamentally, if we look over a 2-year period, we'll see those business kind of continue. I don't think we have a plan for it to jump, though, either. So I think -- right now, I think, with the visibility, particularly on the sensing side, we're probably a little bit more prudent just to dial in what we think will happen without any extensive situation. 
So as I mentioned before on the question, as we look at the guide, we see AHS probably being -- if we think about it on a 2-year stack basis, AHS probably being better -- IOS being better and then PT being maybe a little bit less than other 2. So I think that's the right way to be. But again, strength of the business, and we'll see how the remaining part of the year plays out relative to some of the economic situations that we obviously were tracking."

But on the same token, we're still in a level of uncertainty here. We're still at -- we really don't know the exact date at which COVID will open up offices and get customers back up and fully running. So I think when we look at it, continuing to get better through the year, we make a bunch of our own luck like we did in 2020 where, as you know, we were basically over 1% overall in the year. So I think we'll continue to make our own luck. And if things play out a little bit better economically, then certainly, fundamentally, you'd probably see a bigger number.

Now with 40% recurring revenue in the portfolio and most of that being software or very little material costs, we now have a big portion of our revenue profile that really isn't -- doesn't have supply chain cost inflation pressure. So the portfolio has really shifted in that regard. So while we see some of the supply chain stuff, maybe a little bit on the freight side, but I think fundamentally, we've done a great job over the years of really pushing on that and then while, at the same time, really looking for the price opportunities for what we call price realization from an FBS perspective through a combination of innovation and better commercial practices.

I mentioned the SaaS growth of double digits. That was a good sign. We won twice as many logos in Q4 as we did in Q3, so I think those are really good signs for how we enter the year. 
We do need customer access to do some things, but we do have some wonderful opportunities, as you mentioned. We talked about the EMS space planning win. We're thinking -- we have a number of applications that we'll be launching around employee experience. So a number -- as companies start to think about bringing teams back to the office for periods of time. So I think we've got a number of things that will help us make our own luck, but we do need to see some of that office access. So I think you'll see the business progressively get better through the year. 
On Gordian, Gordian has been in great shape. They were growing double-digit before COVID, really been a really strong performer for us. We have some visibility into how things are changing at this point, as I mentioned, in the prepared remarks around job order contracting. We start to see the projects get loaded even though they might not be purchasing through the system yet. So that's starting to improve. I suspect we see that improve, and as state and local budgets start to get approved into the second half of the year, we would expect to see things continuing. We know hire -- if you think about the second half of the year, it's logical to think that state and local offices are going to start to want to bring people back, and they're going to need -- they're going to need to change the workplace. 
And that's -- we're not about new buildings. We're about changing the buildings you have, changing the structures you have. And that -- I think a number of those things are going to start to characterize themselves as we get further into the year.

We're going to start with a bigger installed base than we did a year ago. And obviously, that bodes well for when consumables come back. 
So to your specific question, it was a combination of -- it was also a big improvement in services. One of the things that we've really been doing, Deane, in China was that, when we first bought the business, we were lucky that this was a business that we took control of early. One of the things we noticed was that the service revenue was a lower percentage of our sales in China than it was anywhere else in the world. So we applied a number of FBS tools, including policy deployment, to make service revenue a big push for us in the business. And we really, really increased the percent -- the stickiness or the connection rate with our equipment and increased service contracts with current customers. So the growth was very much a story of not only electives coming back but also equipment, and the big story was service."

I would expect that those would -- changes if and when they come, would be 2022, but if they do something interim, we'll, of course, react to that. So right now, we think if nothing changed, which never happens, by the way, but this would be the right rate. So we're going to watch very carefully about what gets proposed and understand the impact. Keep in mind, with the acquisitions we've done, we've got a really global footprint, which gives us maybe more opportunities for maintaining an advantage in tax going forward, but we'll have to see what they do."

Starting on Slide 3. Our first quarter performance continued to highlight the benefits of our efforts to enhance the growth and resilience of our portfolio, significantly expanding our positions in software and health care and adding substantial sources of higher growth recurring revenue. As a result, our portfolio has been well positioned to drive rapid sequential improvement over the past few quarters as markets have begun to reopen. In Q1, we continue to see significant improvement, not only across our short-cycle businesses, primarily Fluke Instruments and Tektronix, but also at many of the businesses that have faced COVID-related headwinds, such as Advanced Sterilization Products. 
Turning to the results in the quarter. We generated total revenue growth of 13.6% and core revenue growth of 9.1%, above the high end of our guidance. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.63, representing an increase of 37% year-over-year. The combined outperformance on core growth and earnings helped drive another strong quarter of free cash flow. 
Our SaaS offerings at Accruent, Intelex, Censis, eMaint and Gordian continue to perform well, generating double-digit growth in the quarter, with the current Gordian seeing better top line momentum overall. These software offerings are an important part of our strategy to leverage leading hardware positions to provide broader software-enabled solutions to address pain points in our customers' critical workflows and their ongoing digital transformation priorities. 
Despite the challenges of a COVID environment, we continue to leverage FBS tools to drive performance improvements across the portfolio. ASP is advancing the implementation of the Fortive Business System more broadly, driving strong improvements in working capital turns as well as progress accelerating commercial efforts as it delivered its fifth consecutive quarter of growth in its global installed base. Intelex also continues to see success from the application of FBS tools to improve its sales process, driving better lead generation, improved customer win rates and stronger sales pipeline creation. While these are just a couple of examples, we are highly focused on building FBS capability across our newer businesses in order to deliver accelerated growth, innovation and market share gains. 
Relative to organic growth, we continue to invest in strategic initiatives across our operating companies as well as build additional capacity to drive future innovation. With the FORT, we are continuing to scale our data analytics capabilities, providing leverage to our operating companies to pursue key AI and machine learning applications. 
In 2020, we more than doubled the number of projects conducted and expect to do the same this year, targeting more than $250 million of potential revenue opportunity. Our acquisition of ehsAI significantly expanded our machine learning expertise to help grow our position within EHS workflows as well as generate learnings that can be applied more broadly within Fortive. We've also made a number of additional investments to expand our partnership with Pioneer Square Labs with 3 start-up opportunities currently in different phases of incubation. With these investments, we are enhancing our ability to generate disruptive innovation that will deepen our competitive advantage and increase our customer value proposition. 
In terms of performance across the major geographies, core growth was led by low 20% growth in Asia. This included approximately 30% growth in China and low double-digit growth in Japan. Elsewhere, our core revenue grew by low double digits in Western Europe and by low single digits in North America. 
Taking a closer look at performance in the segments on Slide 7. Intelligent Operating Solutions posted a total revenue increase of 9.5%, with core revenue increase of 5.5%. This included high-teens growth in China, high single-digit growth in Western Europe and a flat top line in North America. Fluke's core revenue continued to improve in the first quarter, increasing by high single digits. This performance was highlighted by low double-digit growth at Fluke Industrial and high-teens growth at Fluke Calibration. Fluke's growth included the launch of the 377 and 378 Fluke Connect plant meters for noncontact voltage testing. These introductions incorporate Fluke's FieldSense technology and extend its leadership position in safer noncontact measurement tools. 
At Fluke Industrial, point-of-sale in North America turned positive in the first quarter, increasing by low single digits. Meanwhile, point-of-sale in both Western Europe and China continue to improve, rising by mid-single digits and mid teens, respectively. 
Strong performance at Fluke Digital Systems continued this quarter, increasing by mid-single digits as eMaint saw strong demand with mid-teens growth in SaaS bookings. 
Industrial Scientific declined single digits in the first quarter as a result of continued weakness in instrument sales. The company's iNet offering continued to demonstrate its resilience, increasing by low single digits. iNet also registered an 18% increase in bookings while driving a more than 500 basis point improvement in net retention. Stub's strong bookings growth in ISC's rental business provided a signal of improving stability in its end markets with customers beginning to restart maintenance project activity. At the same time, we are seeing continued success from the application of FBS growth tools at Intelex to accelerate sales pipeline creation, driving a record revenue quarter with low double-digit growth. The integration of ehsAI continues to go well. While the revenue contribution remains small, product integration is on schedule, and the Intelex team has started to accelerate new customer acquisition. 
Accruent grew by low single digits in the first quarter, highlighted by high single-digit growth in SaaS. Accruent continue to see good momentum in its Industrial and Life Science segments. This included a recent win at Biomarin, which included Accruent's Meridian solution as a critical tool for management of their pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities, including communication with contractors and support for FDA validation. Accruent is also seeing growing demand across a range of end markets for its facility planning and resource scheduling solutions with customers beginning to prepare their facilities for the future needs of their workforce as they emerged from the pandemic. Accruent's growth in the quarter was aided by the resumption of some on-site service implementation and project-related activities with further improvement expected as the year continues. 
After facing headwinds during the second half of 2020, Gordian's top line improved to flat in the first quarter. Gordian's job order contracting procurement business grew by low single digits and is expected to accelerate as the ramp up of recovery from COVID continues. The company's estimating business continued to perform well, increasing by high single digits and seeing strong renewal momentum and conversion rates for the SaaS version of its RSMeans product line. Gordian saw signs of improvement during the first quarter regarding site access issues. We expect this improvement will continue in the coming quarters. 
The Precision Technologies segment posted a total revenue increase of 14.3% with a 12.1% increase in core revenue. This included mid-30s percent growth in China, mid-teens growth in Western Europe and mid single-digit growth in North America. 
Tektronix generated high teens growth, driven by strength in its general industrial and semiconductor markets. Point-of-sale continue to accelerate, up greater than 40% in China, greater than 20% in Western Europe, while North America turned positive with a mid- single-digit increase in the quarter. Tektronix has seen strong demand in China as economic recovery continues, driven by government investment in 5G, electric vehicles and IoT solutions. Looking across the product lines at Tektronix, mainstream oscilloscope in Keithley both had an excellent first quarter. Mainstream oscilloscope posted high 30% growth, driven by strong demand trends across most of its key product segments, particularly our 6 series and 4 series scopes. Keithley grew mid-teens, while the Tektronix service business continued to show stability, reporting mid single-digit growth in the first quarter. Tektronix also saw outperformance across a range of recent new product introductions, including its new ISO view probe solution for semiconductor and automotive market applications. 
Sensing Technologies grew by low double digits, driven by broad strengthening across end markets, including industrial and electronics customers. Sensing saw accelerating demand in China as it delivered a number of key wins with strong momentum among factory automation OEM customers. Sensing also generated strong growth from its critical environment products, et cetera, with mid-30% growth for the quarter. 
Pacific Scientific EMC returned to growth, increasing by low single digits in the first quarter. The business continued to see good order trends with a book-to-bill of 1.2 over the trailing 12 months and has a strong backlog that we expect to support improving growth in the coming quarters. 
Moving to Advanced Health Care Solutions. Total revenue increased 20.3% with a 10.9% increase in core revenue. This included low 40% growth in China, low 20% growth in Western Europe and low single-digit growth in North America. 
ASP returned to growth in the first quarter, increasing by mid-single digits. Growth at ASP was driven by a greater than 40% increase in capital equipment sales as it continued to grow its global installed base. This momentum in capital sales more than offset the fact that electric procedures were 91% of pre-COVID levels globally and continue to weigh on ASP's consumable revenue. Stronger capital sales are an indication of the progress ASP is making in its FBS journey by driving better sales execution and improved funnel management at priority independent delivery network accounts. ASP continued to perform well in Western Europe with its fifth consecutive quarter of growth. ASP was also recently named the preferred supplier by the National Health Service in the U.K. and a large multiyear tender for terminal sterilization capital and services. 
Censis also had a strong first quarter, growing by low teens with low double-digit growth in its CensiTrac SaaS offering. Censis has seen improved upselling momentum across its business and is also seeing evidence of U.S. hospitals moving to post-COVID operations and faster purchasing decisions. 
Fluke Health Solutions increased by low teens in the first quarter, with broad strength across its product lines. FHS continues to have success deploying FBS to drive growth and margin improvements at Landauer, leveraging global go-to-market scale and accelerating cross-selling and products and services. Landauer is now seeing an approximate 2.5x improvement in its operating margins since acquisition. 
Finally, Invetech reported mid-40% growth as it delivers against a strong backlog of 2020 orders for its diagnostic offerings. 
With that, I'll pass it over to Chuck, who will take you through additional details on our margins and free cash flow for the quarter."

Solid execution across the portfolio enabled us to deliver strong margin performance in Q1. Adjusted gross margins were 57% in the first quarter, up 90 basis points, driven by the fall-through on the strong growth at Fluke and Tektronix as well as the year-over-year gross margin improvement at ASP coming off the transition service agreements. It also reflected solid execution with FBS throughout the portfolio, including continued price realization of 90 basis points in the quarter. 
Our Q1 adjusted operating profit margin was 22.7%, a bit higher than we had guided, helped in part by the stronger volume we saw in the quarter. We generated 40% of adjusted incremental operating margins and 240 basis points of core operating margin expansion and also generated more than 200 basis points of core operating margin expansion in each of our 3 segments. 
During the first quarter, we generated $144 million of free cash flow, representing an increase of 50% year-over-year. We continue to be pleased with the consistent growth in free cash flow and have delivered -- that we've delivered over the past year, with the first quarter taking our trailing 12 months free cash flow to $950 million. 
Along with significant growth in earnings, disciplined working capital management at ASP, Fluke and Tektronix contributed to this free cash flow performance. 
Early in Q1, we executed the tax-efficient monetization of our remaining 19.9% stake in Vontier, generating approximately $1.1 billion in proceeds which were used for debt repayment. 
On the basis of that transaction and our free cash flow from Q1, we ended up the first quarter with a net leverage ratio of 1.2x. 
Supported by our continued strong free cash flow and significant balance sheet capacity, we are well positioned to pursue our key capital allocation priorities and are maintaining an active pipeline of deal cultivation efforts. We continue to see a broad range of opportunities to deploy capital to build on our core hardware and instrumentation positions as we also leverage deep domain and workflow expertise into adjacent high-value software data-driven opportunities. 
Turning now to the guide on Slide 11. As a result of the strong first quarter performance and given some improvement in our outlook for the rest of the year, we are raising our 2021 guidance. For the full year, we now expect adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be $2.50 to $2.60, representing year-over-year growth of 20% to 24% on a continuing operations basis. This assumes total revenue growth of 10% to 13%, core revenue growth of 7% to 10%, adjusted operating profit margins of 22% to 23% and an effective tax rate of approximately 14%. It also assumes core revenue growth of 5% to 7% in the second half of 2021. We also continue to expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 105% of adjusted net income for the year. We are initiating second quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance of $0.56 to $0.60, representing year-over-year growth of 30% to 40%. This assumes total revenue growth of 20% to 23%, core revenue growth of 16% to 19%, adjusted operating profit margins of 19.5% to 20.5% and an effective tax rate of approximately 14%. For the second quarter, we expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 85% of adjusted net income. 
The full year guidance incorporates $35 million of additional investments that we are making to drive innovation and enhance our capabilities to support higher growth in the years ahead with $15 million in the second quarter. This includes funding for the FORT to expand our analytic capabilities and talent base as well as to accelerate the development of AI machine learning offerings for our customers. It also includes funding for investments in our partnership with Pioneer Square Labs, where we have seen good early progress thus far. 
With that, I'll pass it back to Jim for some closing remarks."

In Q1, we completed an updated materiality analysis, yielding valuable insights that we use to define the new pillars of our sustainability strategy which will guide our efforts going forward. We've also made significant progress implementing the Intelex sustainability performance indicators platform across the portfolio, which we used to complete the collection of 2020 emissions data with new, more aggressive carbon emissions targets. We look forward to discussing our progress and our evolving sustainability goals at our upcoming Investor Day. 
I'd also like to take a minute to thank our employees for their continued adaptability and strong FBS -- and strong execution of FBS throughout the first quarter. The results that we announced today are a testament to the depth and dedication of our teams and the relentless focus on the continuous improvement principles that power our culture. 
As we look forward, we are excited about the strength of our portfolio, the quality of the market opportunities we address and the significant organic and inorganic growth opportunities ahead of us. As macro indicators continue to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, our focus will remain on driving strong core growth, margin expansion and free cash flow generation, while investing in innovation and deploying our capital to acquisitions that accelerate our strategy and increase the value we bring to customers. 
We are also excited to share more details with you about our road ahead when we speak on May 19 at our Investor Day. In the almost 5 years since our spin, we have positioned the portfolio to be higher growth, more profitable and a more powerful generator of free cash flow. This sets us up well for accelerated compounding across our businesses, which we look forward to discussing with you.

We got good point-of-sale data at Fluke Industrial, at Tektronix, and to some extent, we get decent data on consumables in North America at ASP. So it's a decent chunk of our portfolio where we see things where we have channel partners. And I would say we're as good -- we're at reasonable inventory levels. Nothing is elevated. There's always a couple of situations. 
You saw the strong consistent improvements in POS that we highlighted in the prepared remarks. And I think we've certainly seen sequential improvement from Q1 -- from Q4 last year to Q1 in all of our regions relative to point of sale. So I think we've seen that improvement even on a 2-year stack. So we've seen an improvement in point of sale. We've not seen a big inventory lift. So we feel pretty good about where inventories are at going into the second quarter. 
And one other thing, maybe just to clean up on -- just on that margin question. Just the $15 million of organic investments in the second quarter, $35 million in the full year, the other part of maybe the margin part in the second quarter is obviously those onetime costs that come back from a year ago that we've talked about several times."

And then the other half are really commercial offerings that are going to result. So the revenue opportunity is all tied to those commercial opportunities. There are a couple of years out. So we'll start to see some of that revenue in terms of opportunity. That's the market opportunity, by the way. So we think we start to get some of that in the back half of this year. I would think, all in all, when you think more broadly about the $35 million, there's a combination of investments that are certainly multiyear. I can talk more about that. But I think when we think about some of the investments with Pioneer Square Labs, those are really -- those are early-stage innovation that are really probably 3 or 4 years out.

But hardware is still -- certainly lots of places from a hardware perspective, from an IoT standpoint that we would also take within our opportunity set. So I think it's pretty broad.

But with another quarter of seeing some trends, we feel good where the top line is at and feel like we're in an environment here where we want to make sure that we lean in to some of these opportunities. So that's number one. We've done this over time. And I think with -- with the kind of financial results we posted relative to earnings growth and what we still have, even with that spend in terms of earnings growth and cash flow, we're in a very good position in which to play significant offense in a number of our businesses. 
I would say the range of investments is really sort of 58% of it is really giving our operating companies, several of our operating companies more latitude to raise their R&D spend around the innovation ideas that they've got. And we can -- we'll certainly give you more color around that at our Investor Day as well. That's about half of the spend. 
The other half is in the FORT and in Pioneer Square Labs. So the FORT is really about expanding our data analytics capability. We talked a little bit about that a second ago in Jeff's question. Relative to Pioneer Square Labs, Andrew, we always thought that, that investment. Those investments would be -- we would do a bunch of ideas. As it turns out, the first 3 ideas we've had are actually getting accelerated funding because they've been pretty good. 
I'll give you a couple of ideas of what that means. One of them is our Team Sense investment, which is really around connected worker communications technology and how -- and really helping hourly workers be more connected in the work that they do every day. The other one is in condition-based monitoring communications. Think of it as a Nuance for the industrial market, if you know the deal that Microsoft did. So those are the kinds of investments that we're making, and we're just accelerating those investments because we're seeing the opportunity that those might play out here over time. 
As I mentioned on the answer with Jeff, these are longer-term deals, so they aren't necessarily that's going to give us a lot of revenue next year. But -- but most of those investments we've already made. So it's really about accelerating the investments for the years to come."

So we want to continue to invest in those businesses. You also heard several examples in the prepared remarks of how FBS is really generating value in those business today, I think, as well. So I think that's how we feel like the performing bookings were good as well. So we feel like we're in a very good position. 
Relative to software, in general, we're starting to see some of the remote -- some of the on-site services start to come back at a more accelerated rate, although still a long way to go. But as we said that Accruent actually grew all up in the quarter. I think that's a good showing, if you will. Gordian, flat.

So we -- we've done a nice job. I think historically, such an important part of FBS over time has been a set of supply chain tools to mitigate the kinds of issues that are out there today. They're well documented, so I won't get into them. I think there's 2 -- they come in 2 ways, though, they come in the form of supplier issues and then the other is global logistics challenges. We've mitigated those challenges for the most part in the quarter. And have continued to mitigate those and have mitigation strategies. So I think on the backs of that, we feel good about the guide. We obviously beat revenue in the quarter despite having those challenges, what I think is a great demonstration of how well we mitigated those. We continue to believe we can mitigate those through in the quarters to come. And I don't think they necessarily go away. So I think an old -- this is from an old supply chain guy from 30 years ago, but I think at the end of the day, I think they'll be there for the remainder of the year, but we feel good about the work we're doing, daily management. Chuck and I review those things every month in our operating review. So we're on top of them, and we're continuing to watch them. But I think at the end of the day, we feel good about our mitigation strategies."

You're right, comps did have something to do with it in the quarter, but we were much better even on a 2-year stack. So we feel good about the work we've done in China to build the businesses there, and we think that's -- we'll have a good growth year there. 
I think Western Europe was -- and North America will continue. North America -- Western Europe was obviously pretty good. We like the trends in POS that we talked about. And a number of our newer businesses, like Intelex and Accruent have had good European growth because they really didn't have a European business, and we really invested in that growth. So I think a lot of what you're hearing in the Western Europe growth numbers as well is really our new investments in some of the acquisitions that didn't have as much of a presence in Europe. So I think -- so I think Western Europe, hard to tell, given kind of the hotspots that are going on right now. But we still think we'll have a pretty good year in Western Europe. 
I think North America will continue to get better. It will broach our best geography probably. We saw -- we started off a little slower in North America in January, but we progressively got a little bit better each month. Some of that, I think, had to do with some of the COVID issues that existed. You heard us talk about the overall COVID number at 91. In the U.S., it was back to the 80s in January in terms of elective procedures. So that got back in the 90, over 90 in March. So I think when we look at North America, a lot of conditions for growth that really continued to progress through the quarter. We would expect North America to continue to get better for the year. 
And then relative to the hotspots, we don't have a lot of revenue in India or Latin America. But those are certainly going to be big challenges for the world for any global business, I think, particularly in the days and weeks and months to come. We don't have a lot of exposure there today. And so we'll continue to do what we can to mitigate, but I don't anticipate that has much impact to our overall business through the year."

I think the Intelex platform itself adds tremendous value. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we use it for our own sustainability assessment, and it's a wonderful tool to help us understand how to think about goal setting and how to drive action to really improve, not just -- not just report on sustainability, but more importantly, take action. So I think we feel very good about the platform. We think there's investment opportunities in the future that we can make. So I think relative specifically to your question, Intelex has been a double-digit grower for us. It's mostly been in the teens. I think as we continue to build on it, really, as we hit the accelerator with some of the machine learning opportunities that we've really got with ehsAI, we'll start to see some of those things in the back half of the year. I think we can continue to move that growth rate. I'd like to think we can go beyond that. But I think in the near term, we certainly think it's a double-digit grower for sure."

Number one, I think on our -- anywhere where we have service businesses, but let's call it, nonhealth care. We certainly -- we've gone to remote capability, but it takes longer to turn customers on and software as an example. And so I think there is some pent-up demand. But I think, to be honest with you, Deane, we've had such little access here over the last several months that it's hard to predict how quickly it will open up, particularly when you think about that on a global basis. So we certainly believe it's going to continue to improve, but I wouldn't say necessarily that we think it's going to all be better by the end of the year. We just don't have enough visibility yet to -- I think most customers aren't really opening up here until maybe the third quarter. So I think it's still a little early to predict it. But I think the predictions that we have are really based on some of the trends we've seen, which we feel good about. But I think they could get better if we could see vaccinations get more prolific here and start to see more opening up of businesses. So that's on -- that's everywhere from Gordian and Accruent to eMaint to those -- even like our Tektronix Calibration business, which some of it is on site. 
On the health care side, we certainly think that we can continue to have access. We're in hospitals today doing service for the most part, but everything is a little slower. We mentioned in the Censis prepared remarks, though, that we are starting to see purchasing decisions free up a little faster. And again, that's all built into our guide as well that we think we continue to get better. But I think at the end of the day, it is because pockets in the United States plus the nations, it's really too hard -- it's still a little difficult to necessarily predict exactly how that opens up in a sense of any of the pent-up demand, if you will."

I think on the Gordian side, we have a very under-penetrated market. Companies bring people back into the office and do that safely. So yes, I think there's a wide range of opportunities. Those are very good secular and popular -- great secular drivers and popular secular drivers. So certainly, we'll -- there's plenty of opportunities for us to do things. We'll be disciplined in that approach to do things that we really think can leverage the growth opportunities futuristically and really accelerate strategy. And I think those businesses are in a good position to do that in right now."

I think -- I mean, I think on the infrastructure side, certainly an infrastructure build that puts money into facilities and what we call general infrastructure is going to help Fluke and it's certainly going to help Accruent and Gordian business for sure. Certainly, probably, as we think about our Sensing businesses as well. So good -- as we think about investments in EV and AV, Tektronix has got a good automotive offering that will help. So we certainly think that there are opportunities. 
How quickly that occurs I think is still a question as we think about some of how the stimulus gets spent. As we often talk about the term shovel ready, how shovel ready. But certainly, a good portion of the portfolio is exposed to some of those opportunities. Nearer term, to the extent that these investments go into health care and helping hospitals deal with some of the challenges they've had, that certainly is probably a near-term opportunity for us as we continue to sell into hospitals through all of our AHS businesses. So I think in that sense, lots of opportunity for us, but obviously, it's still very early days. We'll look forward to seeing some of those things play out. But I -- and obviously, get into law and then get spent. So still early days, but we do feel the portfolio is well exposed to some of that additional spending. And I'll let Chuck comment on the tax part."

We'll give a deeper view of that as we get to the Investor Day. But I think, Joe, for sure, what we've learned is the FBS tools were, I would say, somewhat tuned to software when we bought the businesses, but what we've really adapted and really built now is a set of tools that is very specific to helping businesses drive commercial activity, drive digital engagement and improve net retention, net dollar retention, which is such an important metric within software businesses. So I think not -- we always had the tools for software R&D development. So I think those tools we could put into the business, but I think our commercial tools have just been built exceptionally well now to accelerate the capability of the organizations that come into Fortive. So that's -- I think that's what we've learned. 
I think we also understand what good looks like. Obviously, the multiples that we paid at the time, people looked at it. But I think as we now know that investments in things like property, tech and other places, EHS are -- and today, look like bargains from what we -- what we paid a few years ago compared to multiples now. So I think we were advanced in understanding that. 
But we also understand what good looks like at a deeper level, in terms of customer engagement, the kinds of metrics that you want to understand when you look at and do due diligence in the business. And I think we've just continued to improve our due diligence capability to really understand what good looks like, and I think that really helps long term in terms of getting financial returns. 
So I think a lot of learning, for sure, I wouldn't, any way, shape or form, say anything about that. But -- and I think that leads to us feeling very good about our ability to get to create value and to really get good returns from our investments as we move forward. 
And I would add that tried to also say is that we're not just talking about spending our capital here in the future around software. We continue to look for hardware and service opportunities as well where we think we can add value and accelerate our strategy."

That feels a little scary. So I think at the end of the day, we think that one of the things that I think was really stellar in the quarter was the fact that despite COVID being at 91%, and COVID, quite frankly, relative to pre-COVID levels of elective procedures, it was a decel from Q4, and yet our consumables was flat in the quarter. And that really is about our growth in installed base. 
So Chuck used the word hitting our stride. I think we've done some really good commercial work to build the installed base so that our consumables and service revenue will accelerate when we come back and get above COVID rates -- so COVID, pre-COVID rates on elective procedures. 
So we can't predict that, particularly on a global basis, where that's going to be here in the coming months. But we've been certainly building the infrastructure, building the customer base to be able to take advantage of that opportunity when things normalize within hospitals. And we really hope that, that happens quickly for all -- for reasons well beyond our financial success, but much more about the communities in which we serve and the hospitals and customers in which we work with every day. 
So I think at the end of the day, we feel very good about where that business is positioned. And we do think there'll be opportunities. And as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, along with Censis, we're seeing -- we're starting to see some things open up, but I think we're still a long way from getting to pre-COVID levels on a global basis."

Starting on Slide 3. Our first quarter performance continued to highlight the benefits of our efforts to enhance the growth and resilience of our portfolio, significantly expanding our positions in software and health care and adding substantial sources of higher growth recurring revenue. As a result, our portfolio has been well positioned to drive rapid sequential improvement over the past few quarters as markets have begun to reopen. In Q1, we continue to see significant improvement, not only across our short-cycle businesses, primarily Fluke Instruments and Tektronix, but also in many of the businesses that have faced COVID-related headwinds, such as Advanced Sterilization Products. 
Turning to the results in the quarter. We generated total revenue growth of 13.6% and core revenue growth of 9.1%, above the high end of our guidance. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.63, representing an increase of 37% year-over-year. The combined outperformance on core growth and earnings helped drive another strong quarter of free cash flow. 
Our SaaS offerings at Accruent, Intelex, Censis, eMaint and Gordian continue to perform well, generating double-digit growth in the quarter, with the current Gordian seeing better top line momentum overall. These software offerings are an important part of our strategy to leverage leading hardware positions to provide broader software-enabled solutions to address pain points in our customers' critical workflows and their ongoing digital transformation priorities. 
Despite the challenges of a COVID environment, we continue to leverage FBS tools to drive performance improvements across the portfolio. ASP is advancing the implementation of the Fortive Business System more broadly, driving strong improvements in working capital turns as well as progress accelerating commercial efforts as it delivered its fifth consecutive quarter of growth in its global installed base. Intelex also continues to see success from the application of FBS tools to improve its sales process, driving better lead generation, improved customer win rates and stronger sales pipeline creation. While these are just a couple of examples, we are highly focused on building FBS capability across our newer businesses in order to deliver accelerated growth, innovation and market share gains. 
Relative to organic growth, we continue to invest in strategic initiatives across our operating companies as well as build additional capacity to drive future innovation. With the FORT, we are continuing to scale our data analytics capabilities, providing leverage to our operating companies to pursue key AI and machine learning applications. 
In 2020, we more than doubled the number of projects conducted and expect to do the same this year, targeting more than $250 million of potential revenue opportunity. Our acquisition of ehsAI significantly expanded our machine learning expertise to help grow our position within EHS workflows as well as generate learnings that can be applied more broadly within Fortive. We've also made a number of additional investments to expand our partnership with Pioneer Square Labs with 3 start-up opportunities currently in different phases of incubation. With these investments, we are enhancing our ability to generate disruptive innovation that will deepen our competitive advantage and increase our customer value proposition. 
In terms of performance across the major geographies, core growth was led by a low 20% growth in Asia. This included approximately 30% growth in China and low double-digit growth in Japan. Elsewhere, our core revenue grew by low double digits in Western Europe and by low single digits in North America. 
Taking a closer look at performance in the segments on Slide 7. Intelligent Operating Solutions posted a total revenue increase of 9.5%, with core revenue increase of 5.5%. This included high-teens growth in China, high single-digit growth in Western Europe and a flat top line in North America. Fluke's core revenue continued to improve in the first quarter, increasing by high single digits. This performance was highlighted by low double-digit growth at Fluke Industrial and high-teens growth at Fluke Calibration. Fluke's growth included the launch of the 377 and 378 Fluke Connect clamp meters for noncontact voltage testing. These introductions incorporate Fluke's FieldSense technology and extend its leadership position in safer noncontact measurement tools. 
At Fluke Industrial, point-of-sale in North America turned positive in the first quarter, increasing by low single digits. Meanwhile, point-of-sale in both Western Europe and China continue to improve, rising by mid-single digits and mid-teens, respectively. 
Strong performance at Fluke Digital Systems continued this quarter, increasing by mid-single digits as eMaint saw strong demand with mid-teens growth in SaaS bookings. 
Industrial Scientific declined single digits in the first quarter as a result of continued weakness in instrument sales. The company's iNet offering continued to demonstrate its resilience, increasing by low single digits. iNet also registered an 18% increase in bookings while driving a more than 500 basis point improvement in net retention. Stub's strong bookings growth in ISC's rental business provided a signal of improving stability in its end markets with customers beginning to restart maintenance project activity. At the same time, we are seeing continued success from the application of FBS growth tools at Intelex to accelerate sales pipeline creation, driving a record revenue quarter with low double-digit growth. The integration of ehsAI continues to go well. While the revenue contribution remains small, product integration is on schedule, and the Intelex team has started to accelerate new customer acquisition. 
Accruent grew by low single digits in the first quarter, highlighted by high single-digit growth in SaaS. Accruent continue to see good momentum in its industrial and life science segments. This included a recent win at BioMarin, which included Accruent's Meridian solution as a critical tool for management of their pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities, including communication with contractors and support for FDA validation. Accruent is also seeing growing demand across a range of end markets for its facility planning and resource scheduling solutions with customers beginning to prepare their facilities for the future needs of their workforce as they emerged from the pandemic. Accruent's growth in the quarter was aided by the resumption of some on-site service implementation and project-related activities with further improvement expected as the year continues. 
After facing headwinds during the second half of 2020, Gordian's top line improved to flat in the first quarter. Gordian's job order contracting procurement business grew by low single digits and is expected to accelerate as the ramp of recovery from COVID continues. The company's estimating business continued to perform well, increasing by high single digits and seeing strong renewal momentum and conversion rates for the SaaS version of its RSMeans product line. Gordian saw signs of improvement during the first quarter regarding site access issues. We expect this improvement will continue in the coming quarters. 
The Precision Technologies segment posted a total revenue increase of 14.3% with a 12.1% increase in core revenue. This included mid-30s percent growth in China, mid-teens growth in Western Europe and mid-single-digit growth in North America. 
Tektronix generated high teens growth driven by strength in its general industrial and semiconductor markets. Point-of-sale continue to accelerate, up greater than 40% in China, greater than 20% in Western Europe, while North America turned positive with a mid-single-digit increase in the quarter. Tektronix has seen strong demand in China as economic recovery continues driven by government investment in 5G, electric vehicles and IoT solutions. Looking across the product lines at Tektronix, mainstream oscilloscope and Keithley both had an excellent first quarter. Mainstream oscilloscope posted high 30% growth driven by strong demand trends across most of its key product segments, particularly our 6 series and 4 series scopes. 
Keithley grew mid-teens, while the Tektronix service business continued to show stability, reporting mid-single-digit growth in the first quarter. Tektronix also saw outperformance across a range of recent new product introductions, including its new IsoVu Probe solution for semiconductor and automotive market applications. 
Sensing Technologies grew by low double digits driven by broad strengthening across end markets, including industrial and electronics customers. Sensing saw accelerating demand in China as it delivered a number of key wins with strong momentum among factory automation OEM customers. Sensing also generated strong growth from its critical environment products, et cetera, with mid-30% growth for the quarter. 
Pacific Scientific EMC returned to growth, increasing by low single digits in the first quarter. The business continued to see good order trends with a book-to-bill of 1.2 over the trailing 12 months and has a strong backlog that we expect to support improving growth in the coming quarters. 
Moving to Advanced Health Care Solutions. Total revenue increased 20.3% with a 10.9% increase in core revenue. This included low 40% growth in China, low 20% growth in Western Europe and low single-digit growth in North America. 
ASP returned to growth in the first quarter, increasing by mid-single digits. Growth at ASP was driven by a greater than 40% increase in capital equipment sales as it continued to grow its global installed base. This momentum in capital sales more than offset the fact that electric procedures were 91% of pre-COVID levels globally and continue to weigh on ASP's consumable revenue. Stronger capital sales are an indication of the progress ASP is making in its FBS journey by driving better sales execution and improved funnel management at priority independent delivery network accounts. ASP continued to perform well in Western Europe with its fifth consecutive quarter of growth. ASP was also recently named the preferred supplier by the National Health Service in the U.K. and a large multiyear tender for terminal sterilization capital and services. 
Censis also had a strong first quarter, growing by low teens with low double-digit growth in its CensiTrac SaaS offering. Censis has seen improved upselling momentum across its business and is also seeing evidence of U.S. hospitals moving to post-COVID operations and faster purchasing decisions. 
Fluke Health Solutions increased by low teens in the first quarter with broad strength across its product lines. FHS continues to have success deploying FBS to drive growth and margin improvements at Landauer, leveraging global go-to-market scale and accelerating cross-selling and products and services. Landauer is now seeing an approximate 2.5x improvement in its operating margins since acquisition. 
Finally, Invetech reported mid-40% growth as it delivers against a strong backlog of 2020 orders for its diagnostic offerings. 
With that, I'll pass it over to Chuck, who will take you through additional details on our margins and free cash flow for the quarter."

Solid execution across the portfolio enabled us to deliver strong margin performance in Q1. Adjusted gross margins were 57% in the first quarter, up 90 basis points, driven by the fall-through on the strong growth at Fluke and Tektronix as well as the year-over-year gross margin improvement at ASP coming off the transition service agreements. It also reflected solid execution with FBS throughout the portfolio, including continued price realization of 90 basis points in the quarter. 
Our Q1 adjusted operating profit margin was 22.7%, a bit higher than we had guided, helped in part by the stronger volume we saw in the quarter. We generated 40% of adjusted incremental operating margins and 240 basis points of core operating margin expansion and also generated more than 200 basis points of core operating margin expansion in each of our 3 segments. 
During the first quarter, we generated $144 million of free cash flow, representing an increase of 50% year-over-year. We continue to be pleased with the consistent growth in free cash flow and have delivered -- that we've delivered over the past year, with the first quarter taking our trailing 12 months free cash flow to $950 million. 
Along with significant growth in earnings, disciplined working capital management at ASP, Fluke and Tektronix contributed to this free cash flow performance. 
Early in Q1, we executed the tax-efficient monetization of our remaining 19.9% stake in Vontier, generating approximately $1.1 billion in proceeds which were used for debt repayment. On the basis of that transaction and our free cash flow from Q1, we ended up the first quarter with a net leverage ratio of 1.2x. 
Supported by a continued strong free cash flow and significant balance sheet capacity, we are well positioned to pursue our key capital allocation priorities and are maintaining an active pipeline of deal-cultivation efforts. We continue to see a broad range of opportunities to deploy capital to build on our core hardware and instrumentation positions as we also leverage deep domain and workflow expertise into adjacent high-value software data-driven opportunities. 
Turning now to the guide on Slide 11. As a result of the strong first quarter performance and given some improvement in our outlook for the rest of the year, we are raising our 2021 guidance. For the full year, we now expect adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be $2.50 to $2.60, representing year-over-year growth of 20% to 24% on a continuing operations basis. This assumes total revenue growth of 10% to 13%, core revenue growth of 7% to 10%, adjusted operating profit margins of 22% to 23% and an effective tax rate of approximately 14%. It also assumes core revenue growth of 5% to 7% in the second half of 2021. We also continue to expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 105% of adjusted net income for the year. 
We are initiating second quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance of $0.56 to $0.60, representing year-over-year growth of 30% to 40%. This assumes total revenue growth of 20% to 23%, core revenue growth of 16% to 19%, adjusted operating profit margins of 19.5% to 20.5% and an effective tax rate of approximately 14%. For the second quarter, we expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 85% of adjusted net income. 
The full year guidance incorporates $35 million of additional investments that we are making to drive innovation and enhance our capabilities to support higher growth in the years ahead with $15 million in the second quarter. This includes funding for the FORT to expand our analytic capabilities and talent base as well as to accelerate the development of AI machine learning offerings for our customers.

Before we move to questions on Slide 13, I wanted to highlight the continued progress we're making with respect to our key sustainability goals. In Q1, we completed an updated materiality analysis, yielding valuable insights that we use to define the new pillars of our sustainability strategy which will guide our efforts going forward. We've also made significant progress implementing the Intelex sustainability performance indicators platform across the portfolio, which we used to complete the collection of 2020 emissions data with new, more aggressive carbon emissions targets. We look forward to discussing our progress and our evolving sustainability goals at our upcoming Investor Day. 
I'd also like to take a minute to thank our employees for their continued adaptability and strong FBS -- and strong execution of FBS throughout the first quarter. The results that we announced today are a testament to the depth and dedication of our teams and the relentless focus on the continuous improvement principles that power our culture. 
As we look forward, we are excited about the strength of our portfolio, the quality of the market opportunities we address and the significant organic and inorganic growth opportunities ahead of us. As macro indicators continue to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, our focus will remain on driving strong core growth, margin expansion and free cash flow generation, while investing in innovation and deploying our capital to acquisitions that accelerate our strategy and increase the value we bring to customers. 
We are also excited to share more details with you about our road ahead when we speak on May 19 at our Investor Day. In the almost 5 years since our spin, we have positioned the portfolio to be higher growth, more profitable and a more powerful generator of free cash flow. This sets us up well for accelerated compounding across our businesses, which we look forward to discussing with you. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Griffin."

I think number one, I would say, we feel pretty good about where inventories are at. We get good point-of-sale data at Fluke Industrial, at Tektronix, and to some extent, we get decent data on consumables in North America at ASP. So it's a decent chunk of our portfolio where we see things where we have channel partners. And I would say we're as good -- we're at reasonable inventory levels. Nothing is elevated. There's always a couple of situations. 
You saw the strong consistent improvements in POS that we highlighted in the prepared remarks. And I think we've certainly seen sequential improvement from Q1 -- from Q4 last year to Q1 in all of our regions relative to point of sale. So I think we've seen that improving even on a 2-year stack. So we've seen an improvement in point of sale. We've not seen a big inventory lift. So we feel pretty good about where inventories are at going into the second quarter. 
And one other thing, maybe just to clean up on -- just on that margin question. Just the $15 million of organic investments in the second quarter, $35 million in the full year, the other part of maybe the margin part in the second quarter is obviously those onetime costs that come back from a year ago that we've talked about several times."

If we think about really specific to the FORT, Jeff, when we think about the FORT, we're really talking about a combination of projects that I would say are more about 50-50 right now, but moving more to customer focus, but about 50 of internal productivity projects that are really driving better -- better digital transformation within our own operations. And then the other half are really commercial offerings that are going to result. So the revenue opportunity is all tied to those commercial opportunities. There are a couple of years out. So we'll start to see some of that revenue in terms of opportunity. That's the market opportunity, by the way. So we think we start to get some of that in the back half of this year. 
I would think, all in all, when you think more broadly about the $35 million, there's a combination of investments that are certainly multiyear. I can talk more about that. But I think when we think about some of the investments with Pioneer Square Labs, those are really -- those are early-stage innovation that are really probably 3 or 4 years out. So the 4 investments are a little bit more near term, next year or 2, maybe 3. PSL investments maybe 3, 4 years out, where they make a meaningful impact."

So I think we love the ehsAI deal that we did. 
We mentioned it in the prepared remarks, while it's small, it's really given us great machine learning capability. You certainly could see more of those kinds of things to really extend ourselves from a feature perspective within our software and data analytics portfolio. But hardware is still -- certainly lots of places are from a hardware perspective, from an IoT standpoint that we would also take within our opportunity set. So I think it's pretty broad.

But with another quarter of seeing some trends, we feel good where the top line is at and feel like we're in an environment here where we want to make sure that we lean in to some of these opportunities. So that's number one. We've done this over time. And I think with, with the kind of financial results we posted relative to earnings growth and what we still have, even with that spend in terms of earnings growth and cash flow, we're in a very good position in which to play significant offense in a number of our businesses. 
I would say the range of investments is really sort of 58% of it is really giving our operating companies, several of our operating companies, more latitude to raise their R&D spend around the innovation ideas that they've got. And we can -- we'll certainly give you more color around that at our Investor Day as well. That's about half of the spend. 
The other half is in the FORT and in Pioneer Square Labs. So the FORT is really about expanding our data analytics capability. We talked a little bit about that a second ago in Jeff's question. Relative to Pioneer Square Labs, Andrew, we always thought that, that investment -- those investments would be -- we would do a bunch of ideas. As it turns out, the first 3 ideas we've had are actually getting accelerated funding because they've been pretty good. 
I'll give you a couple of ideas of what that means. One of them is our TeamSense investment, which is really around connected worker communications technology and how -- and really helping hourly workers be more connected in the work that they do every day. The other one is in condition-based monitoring communications. Think of it as a Nuance for the industrial market, if you know the deal that Microsoft did. So those are the kinds of investments that we're making, and we're just accelerating those investments because we're seeing the opportunity that those might play out here over time. 
As I mentioned on the answer with Jeff, these are longer-term deals, so they aren't necessarily that's going to give us a lot of revenue next year. But -- but most of those investments we've already made. So it's really about accelerating the investments for the years to come."

So I think that's how we feel like the performing bookings were good as well. So we feel like we're in a very good position. 
Relative to software, in general, we're starting to see some of the remote -- some of the on-site services start to come back at a more accelerated rate, although still a long way to go. But as we said that Accruent actually grew all up in the quarter. I think that's a good showing, if you will. Gordian, flat. Both of those on the back of service getting better, still not great, but we like the trend. So I think overall, we're in a very good position across the board.

We've mitigated those challenges for the most part in the quarter and have continued to mitigate those and have mitigation strategies. So I think on the backs of that, we feel good about the guide. 
We obviously beat revenue in the quarter despite having those challenges, what I think is a great demonstration of how well we mitigated those. We continue to believe we can mitigate those through in the quarters to come. And I don't think they necessarily go away. So I think an old -- this is from an old supply chain guy from 30 years ago, but I think at the end of the day, I think they'll be there for the remainder of the year, but we feel good about the work we're doing.

So we feel good about the work we've done in China to build the businesses there, and we think that's -- we'll have a good growth year there. 
I think Western Europe was -- and North America will continue. North America -- Western Europe was obviously pretty good. We like the trends in POS that we talked about. And a number of our newer businesses, like Intelex and Accruent have had good European growth because they really didn't have a European business, and we really invested in that growth. So I think a lot of what you're hearing in the Western Europe are good numbers as well as really our new investments in some of the acquisitions that didn't have as much of a presence in Europe. So I think -- so I think Western Europe, hard to tell, given kind of the hotspots that are going on right now. But we still think we'll have a pretty good year in Western Europe. 
I think North America will continue to get better. It will broach our best geography probably. We saw -- we started off a little slower in North America in January, but we progressively got a little bit better each month. Some of that, I think, had to do with some of the COVID issues that existed. You heard us talk about the overall COVID number at 91. In the U.S., it was back to the 80s in January in terms of elective procedures. So that got back in the 90, over 90 in March. So I think when we look at North America, a lot of conditions for growth really continued to progress through the quarter. We would expect North America to continue to get better for the year. 
And then relative to the hotspots, we don't have a lot of revenue in India or Latin America. But those are certainly going to be big challenges for the world for any global business, I think, particularly in the days and weeks and months to come. We don't have a lot of exposure there today. And so we'll continue to do what we can to mitigate, but I don't anticipate that has much impact to our overall business through the year."

I think the Intelex platform itself adds tremendous value. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we use it for our own sustainability assessment, and it's a wonderful tool to help us understand how to think about goal setting and how to drive action to really improve, not just -- not just report on sustainability, but more importantly, take action. 
So I think we feel very good about the platform. We think there's investment opportunities in the future that we can make. So I think relative specifically to your question, Intelex has been a double-digit grower for us. It's mostly been in the teens. I think as we continue to build on it, really, as we hit the accelerator with some of the machine learning opportunities that we've really got with ehsAI, we'll start to see some of those things in the back half of the year.

Number one, I think on our -- anywhere where we have service businesses, but let's call it, nonhealth care. We certainly -- we've gone remote capability, but it takes longer to turn customers on and software as an example. And so I think there is some pent-up demand. But I think, to be honest with you, Deane, we've had such little access here over the last several months that it's hard to predict how quickly it will open up, particularly when you think about that on a global basis. So we certainly believe it's going to continue to improve, but I wouldn't say necessarily that we think it's going to all be better by the end of the year. We just don't have enough visibility yet to -- I think most customers aren't really opening up here until maybe the third quarter. 
So I think it's still a little early to predict it. But I think the predictions that we have are really based on some of the trends we've seen, which we feel good about. But I think they could get better if we could see vaccinations get more prolific here and start to see more opening up of businesses. So that's on -- that's everywhere from Gordian and Accruent to eMaint to those -- even like our Tektronix Calibration business, which some of it is on site. 
On the health care side, we certainly think that we can continue to have access. We're in hospitals today doing service for the most part, but everything is a little slower. We mentioned in the Censis prepared remarks, though, that we are starting to see purchasing decisions free up a little faster. And again, that's all built into our guide as well that we think we continue to get better. But I think at the end of the day, it is because pockets in the United States plus the nations, it's really too hard -- it's still a little difficult to necessarily predict exactly how that opens up in a sense of any of the pent-up demand, if you will."

As consumables come back, that's a margin, as Chuck articulated a few questions ago, that's a good thing for AHS. So I think on balance, if I were to take the corporation as a whole, getting on site is probably a margin enhancer.

But we're proud of where we are today. And I think we're certainly always active in looking for things that can accelerate. 
I think on the Gordian side, we have a very under-penetrated market. Real opportunity to continue to really live -- do that, accelerate our data. We have a great data business there. Globalizing Gordian, great opportunities. It's almost exclusively a North American business. So on the current side, there's a breadth of products within occurrence of a broader portfolio given the way it was built by private equity. So a variety of different areas from CMMS to facilities management to asset management to -- as people come back to the workplace, tools and technologies to help companies bring people back into the office and do that safely. So yes, I think there's a wide range of opportunities. Those are very good secular and popular -- great secular drivers and popular secular drivers. So certainly, we'll -- there's plenty of opportunities for us to do things.

So we certainly think that there are opportunities. 
How quickly that occurs? I think is still a question as we think about some of -- how the stimulus gets spent. As we often talk about the term shovel-ready and how shovel-ready. But certainly, a good portion of the portfolio is exposed to some of those opportunities. Nearer term, to the extent that these investments go into health care and helping hospitals deal with some of the challenges they've had, that certainly is probably a near-term opportunity for us as we continue to sell into hospitals through all of our AHS businesses. So I think in that sense, lots of opportunity for us, but obviously, it's still very early days. We'll look forward to seeing some of those things play out. But I -- and obviously, get into law and then get spent. So still early days, but we do feel the portfolio is well exposed to some of that additional spending.

We'll give a deeper view of that as we get to the Investor Day. But I think, Joe, for sure, what we've learned is the FBS tools were, I would say, somewhat tuned to software when we bought the businesses, but what we've really adapted and really built now is a set of tools that is very specific to helping businesses drive commercial activity, drive digital engagement and improve net retention, net dollar retention, which is such an important metric within software businesses. So I think not -- we always had the tools for software R&D development. So I think those tools we could put into the business, but I think our commercial tools have just been built exceptionally well now to accelerate the capability of the organizations that come into Fortive. So that's -- I think that's what we've learned. 
I think we also understand what good looks like. Obviously, the multiples that we paid at the time, people looked at it. But I think as we now know that investments in things like property, tech and other places, EHS are -- and today, look like bargains from what we -- what we paid a few years ago compared to multiples now. So I think we were advanced in understanding that. But we also understand what good looks like at a deeper level, in terms of customer engagement, the kinds of metrics that you want to understand when you look at and do due diligence in the business. And I think we've just then continued to improve our due diligence capability to really understand what good looks like, and I think that really helps long term in terms of getting financial returns. 
So I think a lot of learning, for sure, I wouldn't, any way, shape or form, say anything about that. But -- and I think that leads to us feeling very good about our ability to get to create value and to really get good returns from our investments as we move forward. And I would add that -- try to also say is that we're not just talking about spending our capital here in the future around software. We continue to look for hardware and service opportunities as well where we think we can add value and accelerate our strategy."

So I think at the end of the day, we think that one of the things that I think was really stellar in the quarter was the fact that despite COVID being at 91%, and COVID, quite frankly, relative to pre-COVID levels of elective procedures, it was a decel from Q4, and yet our consumables was flat in the quarter. And that really is about our growth in installed base. 
So Chuck used the word hitting our stride. I think we've done some really good commercial work to build the installed base so that our consumables and service revenue will accelerate when we come back and get above COVID rates -- so COVID, pre-COVID rates on elective procedures. 
So we can't predict that that -- particularly on a global basis, where that's going to be here in the coming months, but we've been certainly building the infrastructure, building the customer base to be able to take advantage of that opportunity when things normalize within hospitals. And we really hope that, that happens quickly for all -- for reasons well beyond our financial success, but much more about the communities in which we serve and the hospitals and customers in which we work with every day. 
So I think at the end of the day, we feel very good about where that business is positioned. And we do think there'll be opportunities. And as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, along with Censis, we're seeing -- we're starting to see some things open up, but I think we're still a long way from getting to pre-COVID levels on a global basis."

We were very pleased with our second quarter results. As you can see on Slide 3, our performance once again highlighted the benefits of our strategy to provide differentiated connected workflow solutions for our customers, creating a portfolio with enhanced resilience and long-term earnings power. 
During the quarter, we capitalized on accelerating point-of-sale trends across a number of our larger businesses, continued growth from our software offerings and improving conditions across our key end markets. Against this backdrop, we delivered core revenue growth and adjusted operating profit margins that exceeded the high end of our guidance, driving exceptional earnings growth and free cash flow conversion. 
As we highlighted at our Investor Day on May 19, we are building on the foundation of our advantaged hardware positions and expanding our software capabilities to address our customers' critical workflow needs and accelerate their ongoing digital transformation. In the second quarter, our SaaS offerings delivered low double-digit growth, and we also drove significant improvement across our professional services offerings. We continue to see strong momentum at eMaint, including increasing demand from its expansion into the food and beverage, pharmaceutical and health care verticals. Gordian and Accruent both had strong quarters as they executed on opportunities provided by increasing demand from facility owner operators and improvements in access to customer sites. Both companies are well positioned to capitalize as customers focused on post-COVID return to work challenges and digital transformation priorities. Sensus also performed very well in the quarter as access to hospital customers improved, executing on strong demand for its SaaS offerings among existing and new independent delivery network customers. 
Looking across the portfolio, we continue to be excited about our expanding offering of EHS workflow solutions, which are well positioned to meet the significant long-term sustainability requirements of our customers. ISC and Intellect performed well, capitalizing on strong broad-based growth across end markets and key geographies. At the same time, we are excited with the early progress at ehasAI where the company closed its largest deal to date in its first joint marketing campaign with Intelex and generated strong growth in its sales pipeline. Throughout the second quarter, we continue to apply the Fortive Business System across the portfolio to drive innovation, growth and share gains. Deployment of our lean portfolio management tool set, which significantly accelerates the efficiency and impact of R&D investments achieved a greater than 40% increase in our on-time program delivery. The application of FBS and digital analytics and search optimization generated 25% growth in digital traffic from pre-pandemic levels across the portfolio. Meanwhile, the use of FBS growth tools has accelerated innovation at Fluke Health Solutions over the past 18 months and continues to drive excellent top line performance. 
We have created good early momentum in our partnership with Pioneer Square Labs including the recent spin-in of TeamSense, a provider of innovative workflow solutions to streamline communications with hourly workers. This marks the first business incubated at Pioneer Square Labs to be integrated into the Fortive portfolio. While still very early, we are pleased with the progress thus far at TeamSense and are excited to develop additional technologies that accelerate safety and productivity solutions for customers within our core markets. 
In early July, we announced the acquisition of service channel. The transaction brings a differentiated high-growth software business with an integrated service provider network and significant proprietary data assets to the portfolio, enhancing our ability to meet the evolving needs of facility owners around the world. Following the expected closing of the acquisition in Q3, we will have significant balance sheet capacity supported by our strong and resilient free cash flow generation. As we highlighted at our Investor Day, we see substantial runway across our $40 billion served market for disciplined capital allocation to accelerate our strategy. 
Turning to a quick summary of the results in the quarter on Slide 4. We generated year-over-year total revenue growth of 26.7% as revenue strength exceeded the high end of our guidance. Adjusted operating margin was 22.2%, while adjusted earnings per share was $0.66, representing a year-over-year increase of 53.5%. 
Given the outperformance for both top line and our adjusted operating margin we delivered $282 million of free cash flow, which represented 118% conversion of adjusted net income. 
On Slide 5, we take a closer look at the Intelligent Operating Solutions segment. iOS posted total revenue growth of 31.2% in the second quarter. This included mid-20% core growth in North America, low 30% core growth in Western Europe and low 20% core growth in China. Fluke's core revenue increased in the mid-30% range. Fluke also grew by mid-single digits on a sequential basis as we continue to see robust demand across its businesses, highlighted by growth at Fluke Industrial. Fluke Industrial generated share gains across a range of key channel partners and retail accounts as point-of-sale accelerated through the quarter. Fluke's broader II900 acoustic imaging product line also continues to perform very well as revenue approximately doubled in the quarter on strong growth across both Western Europe and North America. Fluke Networks also performed well, driven by the recent launch of its Link IQ product line which continues to exceed initial expectations tied to office reopenings and network modifications. In Fluke reliability, our efforts to accelerate performance of proved Technic are gaining traction as we took advantage of increasing demand for alignment and other services, while eMaint also delivered another strong quarter. 
With the accelerated pace of orders at Fluke, we did see some backlog build due to supply chain responsiveness. Industrial Scientific increased by mid-teens, driven by strong execution in instruments and rental as demand from oil and gas markets rebounded and the business continued its expansion into new end markets. The company's iNET offering remained resilient, increasing by mid-single digits with net retention solidly above 100%. Intelex grew by high single digits in Q2, reporting a record revenue quarter. Intelex continues to leverage FBS and has driven improvements in lead generation and funnel conversion. Also in the second quarter, Intelex disclosed multiple telfer its enhanced ESG platform to help customers launch, scale and optimize their sustainability programs and meet increasing demand for transparency on a growing set of critical nonfinancial reporting metrics. 
Accruent grew by mid-single digits in the second quarter with low double-digit growth in its SaaS business. Accruent generated strong sales and bookings for its Meridian solution for engineering document management and its maintenance connection, CMMS offerings. The business also capitalized on the strong demand for its EMS event, workspace and resource scheduling offerings as companies plan and execute their return-to-work strategies. The company continues to generate new customer logo wins and improving growth in recurring bookings. 
Importantly, Accruent also delivered improved performance in its professional service business, which generated mid-single-digit growth as customer site access continue to improve. 
Gordian increased by mid-teens, driven by low 20% growth in the procurement business and high teens growth in estimating. Gordian generated a record month for procurement revenue in June with accelerating time lines for key projects across a number of large customers. This included increased project spend by the New York City Department of Education and School Construction Authority. 
Moving to Slide 6. Precision Technology segment posted a total revenue increase of 25.1% in the second quarter. This included low 20% growth in North America, mid-20% growth in Western Europe and mid-teens growth in China. Tektronix increased by approximately 30%, with another quarter of strong demand across its product businesses, including accelerating point-of-sale trends in each of its major regions. Both mainstream and performance of siloscopes had a strong quarter with high demand for semiconductor, industrial manufacturing and communications applications. Tektronix service business again showed its stability and resilience increasing by low teens. Tektronix continues to benefit from the accelerated focus on driving innovation with Q2 new product introductions performing very well, including its family of automated test solutions for high-speed data transfer. 
In the second quarter, Tektronix held 6 regional innovation form events, which stimulated the adoption of its tech scope platform, resulting in accelerated funnel creation for the company's broader hardware and software offerings. Sensing Technologies increased by low teens in the second quarter with growth driven by continuation of the broad market recovery. Sensing performed very well in China with another quarter of mid-teens growth, driven by demand for factory automation solutions. Elsewhere, Anderson-Negele continues to make progress with its approval of its paperless process recorder IoT solution aimed at the dairy industry with broader commercial rollout expected in the second half of the year. Sensing also continues to drive market share gains elsewhere across its portfolio, particularly et cetera, led by its differentiated critical environment solution and strong demand across its HVAC customers. 
PacSci EMC grew in the low 20% range, with the business seeing some alleviation of the COVID-related shutdowns and approval delays that impacted shipments in previous quarters. PacSci EMC continues to see good growth in the commercial space market with the resumption of launches by OneWeb providing recurring revenue for smart controllers and initiators. Also on July 20, we were excited to watch the company's mission-critical technology, ensure safe and reliable separation of Blue Origin's new Shepherd capsule from its booster during its maiden voyage. 
Moving to Advanced Healthcare Solutions on Slide 7. Total revenue increased 21.8%, including 11% core growth. This included high single-digit core growth in each of North America, Western Europe and China markets. ASP grew by high single digits in the second quarter, led by strong growth in Western Europe and China. ASP also realized improved growth in North America, highlighted by high single-digit growth in the U.S. Overall, ASP grew its consumable revenue high teens as the rate of elective procedures across most geographies continue to improve. While elective procedure volumes increased on a year-over-year basis, Q2 volumes came in a bit lower than expected at approximately 93% of pre-COVID levels, which was consistent with the Q1 exit rate. 
ASP also continued to expand its global installed base of terminal sterilization capital equipment, which grew at a 3.5% annualized rate in Q2. We expect this continued installed base expansion to provide an additional tailwind to consumable revenue as procedure volumes normalize going forward. 
Censis increased in the mid-20% range with mid-teens growth in its CensiTrac SaaS offering as well as strong growth in its professional services business. Many hospital customers are now allowing access to vendors which resulted in a significant increase in activity in the second quarter, particularly with integrated delivery networks. Fluke Health Solutions increased by low double digits even as it lapped a sizable COVID-related revenue tailwind in the prior year. FHS saw high-teens growth from its Optimize and OneQA software solutions, which benefited from accelerated growth investments over the last 18 months. With that, I'll pass it over to Chuck, who will take you through some additional details on our margins, free cash flow and balance sheet."

We delivered solid margin performance in Q2 and driven primarily by strong fall-through on our revenue outperformance. Adjusted gross margins were 57.3%, up 100 basis points on a year-over-year basis. This increase reflected 130 basis points of price realization as we delivered another quarter of solid performance managing price cost across the portfolio. Q2 adjusted operating profit margin was 22.2%, 170 basis points above the high end of our guidance, also driven by stronger volume and high associated fall-through. We reported 240 basis points of core operating margin expansion, including 570 basis points of core OMX at the iOS segment. 
Both Fluke and Tektronix delivered strong core operating margin expansion through disciplined option of FBS to drive sales conversion as demand accelerated across their end markets. At the same time, strong contributions from some of the acquired pieces of our portfolio, including ISC, Gordian, Censis and Landauer also contributed to the margin outperformance across the segments. 
On Slide 8, you can see that in the second quarter, we generated $282 million of free cash flow, representing a 118% conversion of adjusted net income. Free cash flow over the trailing 12 months increased 15% to $943 million. Today, our net leverage is approximately 1x, and we expect net leverage to be around 1.2x at year-end, including the funding of the acquisition of the service channel, but excluding any additional M&A. This gives us significant capacity to continue to deploy towards our key capital allocation priorities. 
Turning now to the guide on Slide 9. Given the strong performance in the second quarter and the improvement in our outlook for the rest of the year, we are once again raising our 2021 guidance. For the full year, we now expect adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be $2.65 to $2.75, representing a year-over-year growth of 27% to 32% on a continuing operations basis. This assumes total revenue growth of 13.5% to 15%, adjusted operating profit margins of 22.5% to 23.5%, and an effective tax rate of 14% to 14.5%. It also assumes total revenue growth of 8.5% to 11% in the second half of 2021. We continue to expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 105% of adjusted net income for the full year. 
We are initiating third quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance of $0.62 to $0.66, representing year-over-year growth of 24% to 32%. This assumes total revenue growth of 11.5% to 14.5%, adjusted operating profit margin of 21.5% to 22.5% and an effective tax rate of 14% to 14.5%. 
For the third quarter, we expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 105% of adjusted net income. With that, I'll pass it back to Jim for some closing remarks."

Before I move to questions, I want to provide a quick update on our sustainability and inclusion and diversity efforts, which is shown on Slide 11. 
During our Investor Day program on May 19, we introduced an accelerated greenhouse gas reduction goal, which now targets a reduction of 50% in greenhouse gas intensity for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2025 relative to our 2017 base year. During the second quarter, we also issued our 2021 sustainability report, which included Fortive's second annual GRI index, first annual SASB index and the 2017 to 2020 greenhouse gas emissions profile. During the quarter, we also became a signatory to the UN Global Compact, committed to alignment with the task force and climate-related financial disclosure by 2022 and announced our 2025 aspirational inclusion and diversity goals. We continue to make significant strides and are highly committed to accelerating our sustainability and inclusion and diversity progress in the coming years. I'd also like to take the opportunity to thank our team and all of our stakeholders for your support over the first 5 years of our journey as an independent company. 
Across all 3 of our strategic segments, we are expanding on strong established positions with offerings that address the critical workflow needs of our customers and markets with attractive long-term growth drivers. Our strong earnings and free cash flow performance in the first half of this year clearly demonstrated the benefits of this strategic focus and the momentum building in our portfolio. As we look ahead, we will continue to invest and expanding the capabilities of the Fortive Business System as we accelerate operating improvements and innovation to increase the value we offer to our customers. With strong free cash flow and significant M&A capacity we are well positioned to pursue the key organic and inorganic growth initiatives that will drive consistent double-digit earnings and free cash flow growth in the years to come. With that, I'll turn it back to Griffin."

So I don't think we've necessarily move the needle as a percent of sales. But on a total basis in terms of total dollars, we're certainly up. 
And as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, the advent of tech scope which is sort of a software offering is also, I think, helps users connect multiple scopes and multiple channels and really bring more data together is also accelerated in some new verticals as well.

We're starting to see customers start to really make decisions here at an accelerated rate. Talk a little bit about that in the prepared remarks amongst all those software businesses. So yes, I think you'd say the second half, we're in a much better place relative to services. And that's not just on-site services, it's also getting customers to accept remote services. So it's a combination of the good work the team has done to be able to deliver things more remotely as well as customer site access."

I think in some cases, given the revenue numbers, both what we delivered in the quarter, over delivered in the quarter, plus raising the guide for the full year. You'd say, well, we're definitely seeing better demand. And in the back -- against that backdrop, we're not seeing an increase in channel inventories nor would we see an increase in channel inventories, at least in the next 90 days through delivering the revenue that we have relative to the POS numbers we're seeing. So I think we feel good about end user demand, and we feel good about the fact that we're not building inventory in some sort of oversaturation situation. So I think there's real demand out there, and I think we're fulfilling it. 
Nigel, we're not oblivious in any way, shape or form, like our peers and other companies. Pretty much all the companies in the world relative to supply chain constraints. We've seen those for sure. I think the fact that we've been building great lean manufacturing capability over decades in our businesses, our ability to respond to those things relative to the FBS tools like daily management and problem solving means we're fighting every day to secure material. And our ability to beat the revenue in the second quarter is a good demonstration of our success in that way. But I would also say we continue to see those challenges every day, and I would expect to see those challenges probably through the year at least. So I think we're in a -- we've been very successful thus far, but it is a daily battle. But given the work we've done over decades to build the kind of capability within our factories, I like our chances and continuing to be successful."

So it's -- we really weren't lighter than what we expected. We're over the high end of our guide for Q2 on AHS margins, but I think you're looking at the comparison to last year And so there's a couple of things going on there. One, as we have been building out our supply chain coming off the TSAs, that's incrementally put in starting last year at this time, more cost. So when you come back to the margins, that gives us a headwind on year-over-year margins. With that, there's a little bit higher freight as well. But there's more revenue to go along with it. So we're still driving OP. 
Also, we had a one-timer last year that inflated margins out at doesn't repeat this year related to just the transition of the TSAs. But again, I think that we're right where we expected to be in Q2. And going forward, we're going to see us start expanding again double -- like 200 basis points from Q2 to Q3. And then Q3 to Q4, maybe even a little bit more than that. So consistent margin expansion. And yes, the consumables have very high margins. And so as recovery that really helps part of that story for sure."

But I think we're just trying to be a little bit more consistent with what we've seen here recently relative to elective procedures.

The II900 that we called out at Fluke and the OneQA at Fluke Health, those are both examples of investments that we did 18 months ago that are now really paying off. So I think it's a good example of, hey, we give the operating companies money to accelerate product development for accelerated growth. And that's a good example we're seeing the payback of some of those investments that we did roughly 1.5 years ago. 
Relative to Pioneer Square Labs, as we said in the Q2 call, about half of that $15 million and half of that $35 million would be at the Fort and at PSL. We mentioned the spin in of TeamSense in the quarter or in early July. That's part of that investment is to fund TeamSense here as we spin that into the business. We're really excited about that opportunity. And then obviously, the FORT investments, which we said were probably more like 3 or 4 year -- 2 or 3 years out, relative to payback and return and is just to bring those numbers back, we thought it was about a $250 million growth opportunity for all of that work, and we still believe that that's true. 
We're probably hopefully planning to get 30 to 50 of that. And as we continue to build out the product lines and build out some of the ideas, we'll have greater granularity to that.

And then there are situations where we maybe wouldn't go forward. 
Right now, we have 3 that we're funding, the 1 that we spun in TeamSense, we have 2 others. We'll make some decisions here based -- and those decision criteria are individual to the businesses based on what they're trying to accomplish strategically, generally has the number of end customers, they have to solidify, there are certain goals around what they're doing with those customers from a product perspective is the product ready.

So maybe the comps don't tell a lot here, but where do you think there's still room for, I guess, sequential growth that sort of ignores the comps, obviously, as we're still coming off the bottom. It sounds like maybe ASP is one of those given that it's still kind of lifting off the bottom and maybe 2Q, those electric procedures didn't show as much progress as you hope. But is there anything else where we should still kind of keep an eye on sequential progression maybe relative to comps or seasonality?"

So we -- I think in that sense, we'll still -- what we have implied in the guide is those businesses getting better over a 2-year basis. So I think we feel good. Sensing is maybe in that same boat. So I think we still see some good progress here in a number of places. And as you mentioned, we see -- we'll see ASP get a little bit better. 
Our SaaS business is -- with 40% recurring revenue, we have a large part of the portfolio that did exceptionally well through 2020 and has continued to do well, and we called that out mostly the SaaS businesses that we have. But obviously, we continue to build our ARR portfolio. That continues to grow well. We'll have double-digit ARR growth at the end of the year for the full year. 
So I think we're accelerating the businesses that have been stable. And I think what you're starting to see is some of the businesses have a little bit more cyclicality still have some room with them.

I would have never thought we could have done those at the level of quality that we're doing them today. So I think kudos to our FBS team that virtualized all of our tools. And I think that's certainly a great example of probably my own learning that these things can be virtualized and we've seen some great efforts here over the last year or so, 1.5 years in that regard. 
Relative to SaaS, I think there's really a couple of things. You know this better than anyone. Problem-solving is problem-solving, value stream mapping, it's value stream mapping. Every SaaS business has processes that are inefficient, sometimes their customer success, sometimes their customer, sometimes their product development. But I think fundamentally, we find that those processes can be improved. And I think in a SaaS business is no different than any other business in terms of a culture of continuous improvement on everything you do is a winning culture. So I think those are -- those are certainly things that we're seeing. And obviously, our -- what we're trying to show in our Investor Day is so many examples of where that's really playing out thus far."

It's a very small part of service channel today, but we think it can be a real important part not only the revenue stream but of the customer capture and the ability to accelerate the network flywheel that we talk about between enterprise customers and the service network. 
Relative to algorithms, the answer is yes. One of the principal roles of the FORT is actually to retask algorithms is to create algorithms that we can apply to the same business problems or the same growth opportunities within the business. Probably the place we're doing that the most is in our software businesses around customer churn predictive models. Once we get those models up and running, we can apply them to different customer sets within different different operating businesses. So we absolutely recast those algorithms, and that's a big part of the FORT's job is to maintain those algorithms and to continue to make them better as we get more and more data running through them."

We were very pleased with our second quarter results. As you can see on Slide 3, our performance once again highlighted the benefits of our strategy to provide differentiated connected workflow solutions for our customers, creating a portfolio with enhanced resilience and long-term earnings power. 
During the quarter, we capitalized on accelerating point-of-sale trends across a number of our larger businesses, continued growth from our software offerings and improving conditions across our key end markets. Against this backdrop, we delivered core revenue growth and adjusted operating profit margins that exceeded the high end of our guidance, driving exceptional earnings growth and free cash flow conversion. 
As we highlighted at our Investor Day on May 19, we are building on the foundation of our advantaged hardware positions and expanding our software capabilities to address our customers' critical workflow needs and accelerate their ongoing digital transformation. 
In the second quarter, our SaaS offerings delivered low double-digit growth, and we also drove significant improvement across our professional services offerings. We continue to see strong momentum at eMaint, including increasing demand from its expansion into the food and beverage, pharmaceutical and health care verticals. Gordian and Accruent both had strong quarters as they executed on opportunities provided by increasing demand from facility owner operators and improvements in access to customer sites. 
Both companies are well positioned to capitalize as customers focused on post-COVID return to work challenges and digital transformation priorities. Censis also performed very well in the quarter as access to hospital customers improved, executing on strong demand for its SaaS offerings among existing and new independent delivery network customers. 
Looking across the portfolio, we continue to be excited about our expanding offering of EHS workflow solutions, which are well positioned to meet the significant long-term sustainability requirements of our customers. ISC and Intelex performed well, capitalizing on strong broad-based growth across end markets in key geographies. 
At the same time, we are excited with the early progress at ehsAI where the company closed its largest deal to date in its first joint marketing campaign with Intelex and generated strong growth in its sales pipeline. Throughout the second quarter, we continue to apply the Fortive Business System across the portfolio to drive innovation, growth and share gains. 
Deployment of our lean portfolio management tool set, which significantly accelerates the efficiency and impact of R&D investments achieved a greater than 40% increase in our on-time program delivery. The application of FBS and digital analytics and search optimization generated 25% growth in digital traffic from pre-pandemic levels across the portfolio. Meanwhile, the use of FBS growth tools has accelerated innovation at Fluke Health Solutions over the past 18 months and continues to drive excellent top line performance. 
We have created good early momentum in our partnership with Pioneer Square Labs including the recent spin-in of TeamSense, a provider of innovative workflow solutions to streamline communications with hourly workers. This marks the first business incubated at Pioneer Square Labs to be integrated into the Fortive portfolio. 
While still very early, we are pleased with the progress thus far at TeamSense and are excited to develop additional technologies that accelerate safety and productivity solutions for customers within our core markets. 
In early July, we announced the acquisition of ServiceChannel. The transaction brings a differentiated high-growth software business with an integrated service provider network and significant proprietary data assets to the portfolio, enhancing our ability to meet the evolving needs of facility owners around the world. 
Following the expected closing of the acquisition in Q3, we will have significant balance sheet capacity supported by our strong and resilient free cash flow generation. As we highlighted at our Investor Day, we see substantial runway across our $40 billion served market for disciplined capital allocation to accelerate our strategy. 
Turning to a quick summary of the results in the quarter on Slide 4. We generated year-over-year total revenue growth of 26.7% as revenue strength exceeded the high end of our guidance. Adjusted operating margin was 22.2%, while adjusted earnings per share was $0.66, representing a year-over-year increase of 53.5%. Given the outperformance for both top line and our adjusted operating margin we delivered $282 million of free cash flow, which represented 118% conversion of adjusted net income. 
On Slide 5, we take a closer look at the Intelligent Operating Solutions segment. iOS posted total revenue growth of 31.2% in the second quarter. This included mid-20% core growth in North America, low 30% core growth in Western Europe and low 20% core growth in China. 
Fluke's core revenue increased in the mid-30% range. Fluke also grew by mid-single digits on a sequential basis as I continue to see robust demand across its businesses, highlighted by growth at Fluke Industrial. Fluke Industrial generated share gains across a range of key channel partners and retail accounts as point-of-sale accelerated through the quarter. 
Fluke's broader II900 acoustic imaging product line also continues to perform very well as revenue approximately doubled in the quarter on strong growth across both Western Europe and North America. 
Fluke Networks also performed well, driven by the recent launch of its LinkIQ product line which continues to exceed initial expectations tied to office reopenings and network modifications. 
In Fluke Reliability, our efforts to accelerate performance at Pruftechnik are gaining traction as we took advantage of increasing demand for alignment and other services, while eMaint also delivered another strong quarter. With the accelerated pace of orders at Fluke, we did see some backlog build due to supply chain responsiveness. 
Industrial Scientific increased by mid-teens, driven by strong execution in instruments and rental as demand from oil and gas markets rebounded and the business continued its expansion into new end markets. The company's iNet offering remained resilient, increasing by mid-single digits with net retention solidly above 100%. 
Intelex grew by high single digits in Q2, reporting a record revenue quarter. Intelex continues to leverage FBS and has driven improvements in lead generation and funnel conversion. Also in the second quarter, Intelex closed multiple deals for its enhanced ESG platform to help customers launch, scale and optimize their sustainability programs and meet increasing demand for transparency on a growing set of critical nonfinancial reporting metrics. 
Accruent grew by mid-single digits in the second quarter with low double-digit growth in its SaaS business. Accruent generated strong sales and bookings for its Meridian solution for engineering document management and its maintenance connection, CMMS offerings. The business also capitalized on the strong demand for its EMS event, workspace and resource scheduling offerings as companies plan and execute their return-to-work strategies. 
The company continues to generate new customer logo wins and improving growth in recurring bookings. Importantly, Accruent also delivered improved performance in its professional service business, which generated mid-single-digit growth as customer site access continued to improve. 
Gordian increased by mid-teens, driven by low 20% growth in the procurement business and high teens growth in estimating. Gordian generated a record month for procurement revenue in June with accelerating time lines for key projects across a number of large customers. This included increased project spend by the New York City Department of Education and School Construction Authority. 
Moving to Slide 6. Precision Technologies segment posted a total revenue increase of 25.1% in the second quarter. This included low 20% growth in North America, mid-20% growth in Western Europe and mid-teens growth in China. 
Tektronix increased by approximately 30%, with another quarter of strong demand across its product businesses, including accelerating point-of-sale trends in each of its major regions. Both mainstream and performance oscilloscopes had a strong quarter with high demand for semiconductor, industrial manufacturing and communications applications. 
Tektronix service business again showed its stability and resilience increasing by low teens. Tektronix continues to benefit from the accelerated focus on driving innovation with Q2 new product introductions performing very well, including its family of automated test solutions for high-speed data transfer.
In the second quarter, Tektronix held 6 regional innovation form events, which stimulated the adoption of its TekScope platform, resulting in accelerated funnel creation for the company's broader hardware and software offerings. 
Sensing Technologies increased by low teens in the second quarter with growth driven by continuation of the broad market recovery. Sensing performed very well in China with another quarter of mid-teens growth, driven by demand for factory automation solutions. 
Hengstler, Anderson-Negele continues to make progress with its approval of its paperless process recorder IoT solution aimed at the dairy industry with broader commercial rollout expected in the second half of the year. Sensing also continues to drive market share gains -- Hengstler across its portfolio, particularly at Setra, led by its differentiated critical environment solution and strong demand across its HVAC customers. 
PacSci EMC grew in the low 20% range, with the business seeing some alleviation of the COVID-related shutdowns and approval delays that impacted shipments in previous quarters. PacSci EMC continues to see good growth in the commercial space market with the resumption of launches by OneWeb providing recurring revenue for smart controllers and initiators. 
Also on July 20, we were excited to watch the company's mission-critical technology, ensure safe and reliable separation of Blue Origin's New Shepherd capsule from its booster during its maiden voyage. 
Moving to Advanced Healthcare Solutions on Slide 7. Total revenue increased 21.8%, including 11% core growth. This included high single-digit core growth in each of North America, Western Europe and China markets. ASP grew by high single digits in the second quarter, led by strong growth in Western Europe and China. ASP also realized improved growth in North America, highlighted by high single-digit growth in the U.S. 
Overall, ASP grew its consumable revenue high teens as the rate of elective procedures across most geographies continue to improve. While elective procedure volumes increased on a year-over-year basis, Q2 volumes came in a bit lower than expected at approximately 93% of pre-COVID levels, which was consistent with the Q1 exit rate. 
ASP also continued to expand its global installed base of terminal sterilization capital equipment, which grew at a 3.5% annualized rate in Q2. We expect this continued installed base expansion to provide an additional tailwind to consumable revenue as procedure volumes normalize going forward. 
Censis increased in the mid-20% range with mid-teens growth in its CensiTrac SaaS offering as well as strong growth in its professional services business. Many hospital customers are now allowing access to vendors which resulted in a significant increase in activity in the second quarter, particularly with integrated delivery networks. 
Fluke Health Solutions increased by low double digits even as it lapped a sizable COVID-related revenue tailwind in the prior year. FHS saw high-teens growth from its OPTIMIZE and OneQA software solutions, which benefited from accelerated growth investments over the last 18 months. 
With that, I'll pass it over to Chuck, who will take you through some additional details on our margins, free cash flow and balance sheet."

We delivered solid margin performance in Q2 and driven primarily by strong fall-through and our revenue out-performance. Adjusted gross margins were 57.3%, up 100 basis points on a year-over-year basis. This incr",456,"Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered solid margin performance in Q2 and driven primarily by strong fall-through and our revenue out-performance. Adjusted gross margins were 57.3%, up 100 basis points on a year-over-year basis. This increase reflected 130 basis points of price realization as we delivered another quarter of solid performance managing price cost across the portfolio. 
Q2 adjusted operating profit margin was 22.2%, 170 basis points above the high end of our guidance, also driven by stronger volume and high associated fall-through. We reported 240 basis points of core operating margin expansion, including 570 basis points of core OMX at the iOS segment. 
Both Fluke and Tektronix delivered strong core operating margin expansion through disciplined option of FBS to drive sales conversion as demand accelerated across their end markets. At the same time, strong contributions from some of the acquired pieces of our portfolio, including ISC, Gordian, Censis and Landauer also contributed to the margin outperformance across the segments. 
On Slide 8, you can see that in the second quarter, we generated $282 million of free cash flow, representing a 118% conversion of adjusted net income. Free cash flow over the trailing 12 months increased 15% to $943 million. 
Today, our net leverage is approximately 1x, and we expect net leverage to be around 1.2x at year-end, including the funding of the acquisition of ServiceChannel, but excluding any additional M&A. This gives us significant capacity to continue to deploy towards our key capital allocation priorities. 
Turning now to the guide on Slide 9. Given the strong performance in the second quarter and the improvement in our outlook for the rest of the year, we are once again raising our 2021 guidance. 
For the full year, we now expect adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be $2.65 to $2.75, representing a year-over-year growth of 27% to 32% on a continuing operations basis. This assumes total revenue growth of 13.5% to 15%, adjusted operating profit margins of 22.5% to 23.5%, and an effective tax rate of 14% to 14.5%. It also assumes total revenue growth of 8.5% to 11% in the second half of 2021. 
We continue to expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 105% of adjusted net income for the full year. We are initiating third quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance of $0.62 to $0.66, representing year-over-year growth of 24% to 32%. This assumes total revenue growth of 11.5% to 14.5%, adjusted operating profit margin of 21.5% to 22.5% and an effective tax rate of 14% to 14.5%. 
For the third quarter, we expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 105% of adjusted net income. 
With that, I'll pass it back to Jim for some closing remarks."

Before I move to questions, I want to provide a quick update on our sustainability and inclusion and diversity efforts, which is shown on Slide 11. 
During our Investor Day program on May 19, we introduced an accelerated greenhouse gas reduction goal, which now targets a reduction of 50% in greenhouse gas intensity for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2025 relative to our 2017 base year. 
During the second quarter, we also issued our 2021 Sustainability Report, which included Fortive's second annual GRI index, first annual SASB index and the 2017 to 2020 greenhouse gas emissions profile. 
During the quarter, we also became a signatory to the UN Global Compact, committed to alignment with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure by 2022 and announced our 2025 aspirational inclusion and diversity goals. We continue to make significant strides and are highly committed to accelerating our sustainability and inclusion and diversity progress in the coming years. 
I'd also like to take the opportunity to thank our team and all of our stakeholders for your support over the first 5 years of our journey as an independent company. Across all 3 of our strategic segments, we are expanding on strong established positions with offerings that address the critical workflow needs of our customers and markets with attractive long-term growth drivers. 
Our strong earnings and free cash flow performance in the first half of this year clearly demonstrated the benefits of this strategic focus and the momentum building in our portfolio. As we look ahead, we will continue to invest and expanding the capabilities of the Fortive Business System as we accelerate operating improvements and innovation to increase the value we offer to our customers. 
With strong free cash flow and significant M&A capacity we are well positioned to pursue the key organic and inorganic growth initiatives that will drive consistent double-digit earnings and free cash flow growth in the years to come. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Griffin."

Obviously, a little bit of an easier comp in the quarter, but both at Fluke and at Tek, we saw -- as an example in POS in the Americas, we saw in the 30% range. So better than our -- even than our sales -- total sales in some cases. So a very good position.

And as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, the advent of TekScope which is sort of a software offering is also, I think, helps users connect multiple scopes and multiple channels and really bring more data together is also accelerated in some new verticals as well.

So it's a combination of the good work the team has done to be able to deliver things more remotely as well as customer site access."

I think in some cases, given the revenue numbers, both what we delivered in the quarter, over delivered in the quarter, plus raising the guides for the full year. You'd say, well, we're definitely seeing better demand. And in the back -- against that backdrop, we're not seeing increase in channel inventories nor would we see an increase in channel inventories, at least in the next 90 days through delivering the revenue that we have relative to the POS numbers we're seeing. 
So I think we feel good about end user demand, and we feel good about the fact that we're not building inventory in some sort of oversaturation situation. So I think there's real demand out there, and I think we're fulfilling it. 
Nigel, we're not oblivious in any way, shape or form, like our peers and other companies -- pretty much all the companies in the world relative to supply chain constraints, we've seen those for sure. I think the fact that we've been building great lean manufacturing capability over decades in our businesses, our ability to respond to those things relative to the FBS tools like daily management and problem solving means we're fighting every day to secure material. 
And our ability to beat the revenue in the second quarter is a good demonstration of our success in that way. But I would also say we continue to see those challenges every day, and I would expect to see those challenges probably through the year at least. So I think we're in a -- we've been very successful thus far, but it is a daily battle. But given the work we've done over decades to build the kind of capability within our factories, I like our chances and continuing to be successful."

So it's -- we really weren't lighter than what we expected. We're over the high end of our guide for Q2 on AHS margins, but I think you're looking at the comparison to last year And so there's a couple of things going on there. One, as we have been building out our supply chain coming off the TSAs, that's incrementally put in starting last year at this time, more cost. So when you come back to the margins, that gives us a headwind on year-over-year margins. With that, there's a little bit higher freight as well. But there's more revenue to go along with it. So we're still driving OP. 
Also, we had a one-timer last year that inflated margins, that doesn't repeat this year, related to just the transition of the TSAs. But again, I think that we're right where we expected to be in Q2. And going forward, you're going to see us start expanding again double -- like 200 basis points from Q2 to Q3. And then Q3 to Q4, maybe even a little bit more than that. So consistent margin expansion. And yes, the consumables have very high margins. And so as recovery that really helps part of that story for sure."

So there's a little bit of an assumption that we'll probably not get to 100% by the end of the year, that has a little bit of impact. 
But I think we come back to the fact that we're taking share. And if things come back, we certainly would see and associated improvement. But I think we're just trying to be a little bit more consistent with what we've seen here recently relative to elective procedures. 
And so there's a little bit of a change. Obviously, we took the guide up and total up for the overall company, but a little bit -- maybe a little bit more conservative relative to where we think elective procedures might come in.

Our SaaS business is -- with 40% recurring revenue, we have a large part of the portfolio that did exceptionally well through 2020 and has continued to do well, and we called that out mostly the SaaS businesses that we have. But obviously, we continue to build our ARR portfolio. That continues to grow well. We'll have double-digit ARR growth at the end of the year for the full year.

So I think kudos to our FBS team that virtualized all of our tools. And I think that's certainly a great example of probably my own learning that these things can be virtualized and we've seen some great efforts here over the last year or so, 1.5 years in that regard. 
Relative to SaaS, I think there's really a couple of things. You know this better than anyone. Problem-solving is problem-solving, value stream mapping, it's value stream mapping. Every SaaS business has processes that are inefficient, sometimes they're customer success, sometimes they're customer -- sometimes they're product development. But I think fundamentally, we find that those processes can be improved. And I think in a SaaS business is no different than any other business in terms of a culture of continuous improvement on everything you do is a winning culture.

It's a very small part of ServiceChannel today, but we think it can be a real important part not only the revenue stream but of the customer capture and the ability to accelerate the network flywheel that we talk about between enterprise customers and the service network. 
Relative to algorithms, the answer is yes. One of the principal roles of the FORT is actually to re-task algorithms is to create algorithms that we can apply to the same business problems or the same growth opportunities within the business. Probably the place we're doing that the most is in our software businesses around customer churn predictive models. 
Once we get those models up and running, we can apply them to different customer sets within different  operating businesses.

Early in the third quarter, Fortive has celebrated its fifth anniversary as an independent public company. This quarter, we continue to demonstrate the success of the strategy we outlined in 2016 to enhance growth and margins across our businesses through the successful execution of the Fortive Business System, the acceleration of innovation and the impact of disciplined capital allocation. Our third quarter results were highlighted by 32% growth in adjusted earnings per share. We continue to generate significant revenue momentum throughout the quarter, realizing 9.1% core revenue growth an order growth of just over 20% against the backdrop of strong broad-based demand. Strong execution and application of FBS helped to generate 325 basis points of core operating margin expansion, along with very strong free cash flow despite widespread supply chain disruption. In the third quarter, our software businesses grew by low double digits, supported by strong demand and improving net dollar retention. In total, we now have almost $750 million of annualized software revenue across the portfolio with double-digit organic growth profile as well as a high share of recurring revenue and high operating margins. [Audio Gap] to see traction from its efforts to expand in data centers and other related wired communications applications, delivering a number of key customer wins, including Lenovo and Ericsson. 
Throughout the third quarter, Tektronix did an excellent job deploying FBS countermeasures to navigate sustained supply chain challenges while also delivering significant price realization. Even with the strong execution, given the continued robust pace of demand from its customers, Tektronix increased its backlog by more than 70% versus a year ago. Sensing Technologies increased by low double digits in the third quarter. Sensing reported strong growth across each of its major regions with robust order momentum across its key end markets. Setra registered additional market share gains with its HVAC offerings in Q3 and continues to generate strong growth across a range of critical environment applications, including hospital isolation rooms and pharmaceutical manufacturing. 
Thanks to Dynapar had a very strong quarter by utilizing the FBS tool set to improve lead times and on-time delivery to drive share gains with key OEM customers. Pacific Scientific EMC grew by mid-single digits, including improved momentum across its commercial customer base. [indiscernible] continues to see significant growth opportunities in its aircraft and space end markets with strong momentum across its critical safety technology offerings. Moving to Advanced Healthcare Solutions on Slide 8. Total revenue increased 9.3%, while core revenue increased 4.7%. This included mid-single-digit growth in North America and low single-digit growth in China. 
Western Europe saw high teens decline based on a difficult prior year comp at Invetec, partially offset by strong growth at ASP and Fluke Health. ASP grew by low single digits in the third quarter, highlighted by a strong capital equipment performance, including low double-digit growth in terminal sterilization capital. ASP continues to benefit from the solid sales execution driving the consistent expansion of its global installed base. 
Consumables revenue grew by low single digits, led by high single-digit increase across all geographies outside of the United States. In the U.S., the spike in COVID-related hospitalizations led to a notable decline in elective procedure volumes toward the end of the quarter, resulting in global electric procedures at approximately 88% of pre-COVID levels for the period. While we expect only nominal improvement in electric procedure volume in Q4, longer term, we expect ASP's consumable revenue will benefit from procedure volume normalization and growth in its global installed base. 
Censis increased in the low 40% range, highlighted by very strong growth in professional services and related hardware. It CensiTrac SaaS offering, grew mid-teens as it continued to benefit from new customer additions as well as good momentum with upselling and cross-selling to existing customers. Censis continues to have open access to customer sites and saw strong sustained order growth throughout the quarter. 
Fluke Health Solutions increased by high single digits with continued strength in North America and Western Europe tied to market share gains with OEM customers through the continued deployment of FBS growth tools. FHS executed very well throughout the quarter, driving significant price realization and managing through supply chain constraints to open new market opportunities. FHS continues to benefit from partnership efforts with the Ford, driving lower customer churn at Landauer using the Ford's predictive modeling tools. The company continues to see good early traction from software innovation efforts with 30% growth year-over-year in Q3.
Invetech declined by mid-single digits, which was better than expected against the tough prior year comp that included significant COVID-related tailwinds. The company continues to see strong demand across the diagnostics and life science verticals and expect to end the year with significant order momentum and a healthy backlog to carry into 2022. With that, I'll pass it over to Chuck, who will take you through some additional details on our margins, free cash flow and balance sheet."

We delivered another quarter of strong margin performance in Q3, using FBS tools to deliver strong pricing and successful value engineering to implement component substitutions across a variety of hardware businesses. This FBS execution and the continued strength of our software businesses helped deliver adjusted gross margins of 57.3% in Q3. 
This reflects 90 basis points of expansion on a year-over-year basis as we accelerated to 220 basis points of total price realization. Q3 adjusted operating profit was 22.8%, reflecting solid execution across the portfolio, including counter measures enacted in the face of ongoing supply chain challenges. We had strong margin performance across all of our segments, resulting in 325 basis points of core operating margin expansion. 
On Slide 9, you can see that in the third quarter, we generated $252 million of free cash flow, representing a 105% conversion of adjusted net income. Free cash flow over the trailing 12 months increased 22% to $991 million. Our current net leverage is approximately 1.6x and we expect net leverage to be around 1.3x at year-end, excluding any additional M&A. 
Turning now to the guide on Slide 10. We are raising the low end of our full year 2021 adjusted diluted net EPS guidance to $2.70, resulting in a range of $2.70 to $2.75 for the year. This represents a year-over-year growth of 29% to 32% on a continuing operation basis. This assumes that total revenue growth of 14% to 14.5%, adjusted operating profit margins of 23% to 23.5% and an effective tax rate of approximately 14%. 
We continue to expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 105% of adjusted net income for the full year. We are also initiating fourth quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance of $0.74 to $0.79 representing year-over-year growth of 6% to 13%. This assumes total revenue growth of 6.5% to 8.5%, adjusted operating profit margin of 23.5% to 24.5% and an effective tax rate of approximately 15%. 
The adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance also excludes approximately $12 million of anticipated investments in strategic productivity initiatives that we expect to execute before the end of the year. For the fourth quarter, we expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 125% of adjusted net income. With that, I'll pass it back to Jim for some closing."

So yes -- and we'll see improvement from there in the fourth quarter. So yes, so we're in good shape. You'll see the price in the software business is in the net dollar retention. And so net dollar retention at 102 or so with some of our businesses even higher means we're also -- we're getting that price in a number of the software businesses.

So I think we're set up well for mid-single digit in 2022. But you're right, we had a onetime hit revenue that occurred in the quarter, a couple other things -- a couple of little churn events or many churn events that we didn't anticipate. So certainly slowed down a little bit in the quarter. But we think we're -- because of the order strength, particularly around new logos, we're in a good position for next year.
Relative to the 102, we're always going to have some businesses up and down relative to where that number is at service channel and email would be our best performers on that metric as an example. Intellect would be pretty high. But we -- I would suspect we'll get to sort of thinking about budgets as we go through the business.

Well, I can take you through a lot of detail because I think I've been more involved in these kinds of things over the last 60 days than I typically would, takes me back to some routes, I guess. Josh, I would say a couple of things. One, certainly in our businesses, think of it as the more electronic content, the more likely to have a challenge.
So you can think about a circuit board at Tektronix, which is incredibly complicated, has multiple semiconductors on it, has multiple -- all kinds of chip technology on a board like that. You're going to just have higher variability because of that. Fluke will be as true as well and then Sensing a little bit less. So from a -- just how that goes, that's how it would be.
We are seeing mostly electronic shortages. And as I said in the previous comment, mostly around availability. We're paying a little bit more to get things. So there's some premium freight involved in inflation, not a lot of labor. We have pretty low labor content in the company, simply because of our decades of productivity initiatives, so we're seeing some labor inflation, but at the end of the day, doesn't move the needle as much.
It's really about the material availability first and foremost. And given our gross margins on those products, it makes sense to -- even if we spend a few pennies more to get something in faster, given the high demand we have right now and just given the momentum in orders right now, it makes sense to sometimes pay those things because ultimately, the margins it just makes sense to do that.
And obviously, our first and foremost, we're taking care of customers. So hopefully, that gives you a window. Every day, we're well set up to deal with this because we have daily management, what we call visual management. You've seen it in our factories during tours. Our businesses manage every cell and every factory by the hour. And so we're well set up to just sort of put that on steroids a little bit in order to amplify the challenges and just get after it. And so it doesn't mean we don't have issues. It's how well we countermeasure that really makes the difference here."

But we're not calling that all coming back at once in 2022. It will probably ramp it's over some period of time. And I think Markus is one thing we know to be true over the last -- certainly over the last 2 years, but certainly in the last 6 months, is that something has occurred every 3 months relative to electives that's caused it to go a little bit sideways. So I think it's premature to call next year, but it's safe to say that when we get to a more normalized sort of event in our hospitals, will be in -- that business is certainly laying the groundwork, laying the foundation for good growth. I was with a major hospital network about a month ago in their facility.
They're placing equipment, and they're looking forward to adding more elective procedures as they get forward. And maybe just one other comment on elect is, it's not only COVID, it's also particularly in the United States, it is also the nursing shortage.

We've got some software offerings there that we started with. We mentioned that in the prepared remarks. So we're building a more durable revenue stream. While at the same time, as you mentioned, we've taken advantage of a number of real opportunities relative to what I would call higher growth situations. And quite frankly, when we think about going forward, obviously, the semiconductor cycle is going to extend as people continue to invest in the kinds of things that we've talked about, but also the supply chain issues and constraints fundamentally require a lot of folks who have electronics in their products to redesign those products for different chips or different components. 
And quite frankly, one of the things they need to do that is in a siloscope. So we think there's also not only the sort of long-term secular trends that the business has been going after, but also some shorter-term opportunities is as people start to continue to have to deal with some of these supply chain challenges. And fundamentally, that can often end up in a redesign. And certainly, we have the products and solutions to help people do that.
So we're very bullish on the business. Obviously, it still has a component of volatility to it. But we -- I think the team has done a nice job of continuing to drive technology and innovation towards higher growth, more durable revenue streams. SP15"

Justin and Bill both came to us with acquisitions, just in with bill with Gordian.

Early in the third quarter, Fortive  celebrated its fifth anniversary as an independent public company. This quarter, we continue to demonstrate the success of the strategy we outlined in 2016 to enhance grow",1808,"Thanks, Griffin, and good afternoon, everyone. Early in the third quarter, Fortive  celebrated its fifth anniversary as an independent public company. This quarter, we continue to demonstrate the success of the strategy we outlined in 2016 to enhance growth and margins across our businesses through the successful execution of the Fortive Business System, the acceleration of innovation and the impact of disciplined capital allocation.
Our third quarter results were highlighted by 32% growth in adjusted earnings per share. We continue to generate significant revenue momentum throughout the quarter, realizing 9.1% core revenue growth, an order growth of just over 20% against the backdrop of strong broad-based demand. Strong execution and application of FBS helped to generate 325 basis points of core operating margin expansion, along with very strong free cash flow despite widespread supply chain disruption. 
In the third quarter, our software businesses grew by low double digits, supported by strong demand and improving net dollar retention. In total, we now have almost $750 million of annualized software revenue across the portfolio with double-digit organic growth profile as well as a high share of recurring revenue and high operating margins. 
In August, we closed the acquisition of ServiceChannel, adding another differentiated high-growth software asset to our Intelligent Operating Solutions segment. The ServiceChannel acquisition significantly enhances our strategic position in the facility and asset life cycle market, extending our leading suite of offerings for facility owners and operators and providing a variety of potential avenues to deliver unique value-added solutions in combination with Gordian and Accruent. 
As you can see on Slide 4, across Fortive, we continue to invest in product development to drive organic growth and enhance our competitive position. Many of our investments in organic innovation are focused on enabling digital transformation across our customer base. This includes vertically tailored software offerings at Tektronix and Fluke Health, emerging IoT solutions in Sensing as well as early progress with new tools for improved workforce management at TeamSense. 
In addition, our investments in The Fort continue to drive data analytics and machine learning opportunities across all of our businesses. Our success in accelerating the pace of innovation across our portfolio is demonstrated by examples, such as the Fluke II900, a groundbreaking product, which was recently recognized as Test Measurement and Inspection, ""Product of the Year,"" at the 2021 Electronics Industry Awards. 
We continue to build the strength of our talent base to accelerate progress across Fortive. This quarter, we announced a number of important additions and promotions to the senior leadership team, including the appointment of Olumide Soroye as President and CEO of Intelligent Operating Solutions; the promotion of Tami Newcombe, the President and CEO of Precision Technologies; and the promotions of Justin McElhattan and Bill Pollak to Group President roles within IOS. 
These moves highlight how we are building leadership capacity through a combination of internal development and external hires aimed at adding differentiated skill sets and experiences to our senior team. With Olumide and Tami as well as Pat Murphy, now leading Advanced Healthcare Solutions, we have significantly increased the depth of our leadership within all 3 of our segments.
Turning to a quick summary of the results in the quarter on Slide 5. We generated year-over-year total revenue growth of 12%, core growth of 9.1% and orders growth of just over 20%, with backlog increasing by 40% year-over-year. Adjusted operating margin was 22.8%, while adjusted earnings per share was $0.66, representing a year-over-year increase of 32%. 
The strong adjusted operating margin performance helped us to deliver $252 million of free cash flow, which represented 105% -- 106% in the third quarter, with core growth of 13.1%. This included low teens growth in North America, high-teens growth in Western Europe and mid-single-digit growth in China. 
Industrial Imaging business continues to perform well, paced by momentum from innovation across its acoustic imaging product line, which doubled year-over-year in the third quarter. Fluke Networks had a very strong quarter, driven by innovations such as its LinkIQ product line. Fluke's efforts to expand its recurring revenue base saw further progress in Q3, including strong performance across both of its service offerings and in eMaint, which generated high-teens growth in revenue and SaaS bookings for the quarter. 
The combination of robust order growth and supply chain constraints in Q3 led to strong backlog that we're carrying into the fourth quarter and 2022. Industrial Scientific revenue increased by mid-teens as its instruments and rental business continued their strong recoveries. The ISC team has done an excellent job using FBS tools to accelerate product redesign initiatives, which have helped alleviate component supply challenges and limit impact on delivery times to customers.
Intelex grew by mid-teens and posted another record revenue quarter. Intelex is seeing solid FBS driven improvements in its upsell process to support higher net dollar retention. Also in Q3, Intelex signed an exclusive partnership deal with Datamaran, which enables Intelex customers to manage their full life cycle of their ESG strategy, including materiality analysis and risk identification. 
Accruent grew by low single digits in the third quarter while seeing strong bookings greater than 20%. This booking strength was paced by continued demand for Accruent's Meridian engineering document management and maintenance connection CMMS offerings. Accruent also continues to see strong demand for its EMS event workspace and resource scheduling solution to support emerging hybrid office models as customers execute their return to work plans. 
Among the notable new customer wins for the EMS solution in Q3 were several leading global financial services providers. Accruent also continued to see improved performance in its professional services business, which generated low double-digit growth. 
Gordian increased by mid-teens, with strong growth in procurement and in estimating. In the third quarter, Gordian continued to see increasing project volume as well as higher average dollars per project. Gordian is also seeing success from its expansion into health care with significant demand for its facility solutions from hospital customers. 
After completing the acquisition of ServiceChannel at the end of August, we are obviously early in our ownership, but we're very pleased with what we've seen thus far and are excited to have them join Fortive. Specifically, ServiceChannel continues to demonstrate strong momentum in its large enterprise retail business with several large customer wins in Q3, including Walgreens, which will roll out automation software across their more than 10,000 locations and the third largest mobile carrier in North America as they transform their facility management program.
Moving to Slide 7. The Precision Technologies segment posted a total revenue increase of 8.9% in the third quarter, with core growth of 7.7%. This included high single-digit growth in North America and high-teens growth in Western Europe. China grew low single digits, but saw strong continued momentum in demand with double-digit order growth in the quarter. 
Tektronix grew high single digits with strong demand trends across its product portfolio and double-digit order growth. Growth was led by the performance of its mainstream as oscilloscopes with a greater than 30% increase supported by new extensions to the 6 Series MSO product line. Tektronix continue to see traction from its efforts to expand in data centers and other related wired communications applications, delivering a number of key customer wins, including Lenovo and Ericsson. 
Throughout the third quarter, Tektronix did an excellent job deploying FBS countermeasures to navigate sustained supply chain challenges while also delivering significant price realization. Even with the strong execution, given the continued robust pace of demand from its customers, Tektronix increased its backlog by more than 70% versus a year ago. 
Sensing Technologies increased by low double digits in the third quarter. Sensing reported strong growth across each of its major regions with robust order momentum across its key end markets. 
Setra registered additional market share gains with its HVAC offerings in Q3 and continues to generate strong growth across a range of critical environment applications, including hospital isolation rooms and pharmaceutical manufacturing. 
Hengstler Dynapar had a very strong quarter by utilizing the FBS tool set to improve lead times and on-time delivery to drive share gains with key OEM customers. 
Pacific Scientific EMC grew by mid-single digits, including improved momentum across its commercial customer base. PacSci continues to see significant growth opportunities in its aircraft and space end markets with strong momentum across its critical safety technology offerings. 
Moving to Advanced Healthcare Solutions on Slide 8. Total revenue increased 9.3%, while core revenue increased 4.7%. This included mid-single-digit growth in North America and low single-digit growth in China. 
Western Europe saw high teens decline based on a difficult prior year comp at Invetech, partially offset by strong growth at ASP and Fluke Health.
ASP grew by low single digits in the third quarter, highlighted by a strong capital equipment performance, including low double-digit growth in terminal sterilization capital. ASP continues to benefit from the solid sales execution, driving the consistent expansion of its global installed base. 
Consumables revenue grew by low single digits, led by high single-digit increase across all geographies outside of the United States. In the U.S., the spike in COVID-related hospitalizations led to a notable decline in elective procedure volumes toward the end of the quarter, resulting in global elective procedures at approximately 88% of pre-COVID levels for the period. While we expect only nominal improvement in elective procedure volume in Q4, longer term, we expect ASP's consumable revenue will benefit from procedure volume normalization and growth in its global installed base. 
Censis increased in the low 40% range, highlighted by very strong growth in professional services and related hardware. It CensiTrac SaaS offering, grew mid-teens as it continue to benefit from new customer additions as well as good momentum with upselling and cross-selling to existing customers. Censis continues to have open access to customer sites and saw strong sustained order growth throughout the quarter. 
Fluke Health Solutions increased by high single digits with continued strength in North America and Western Europe tied to market share gains with OEM customers through the continued deployment of FBS growth tools. FHS executed very well throughout the quarter, driving significant price realization and managing through supply chain constraints to open new market opportunities. FHS continues to benefit from partnership efforts with The Fort, driving lower customer churn at Landauer using The Fort's predictive modeling tools. The company continues to see good early traction from software innovation efforts with 30% growth year-over-year in Q3.
Invetech declined by mid-single digits, which was better than expected against the tough prior year comp that included significant COVID-related tailwinds. The company continues to see strong demand across the diagnostics and life science verticals and expect to end the year with significant order momentum and a healthy backlog to carry into 2022. 
With that, I'll pass it over to Chuck, who will take you through some additional details on our margins, free cash flow and balance sheet."
318505463,1684666196,2417148,"Fortive Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Fortive Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered another quarter of strong margin performance in Q3, using FBS tools to deliver strong pricing and successful value engineering to implement component substitutions across a variety of hardware busine",391,"Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. We delivered another quarter of strong margin performance in Q3, using FBS tools to deliver strong pricing and successful value engineering to implement component substitutions across a variety of hardware businesses. This FBS execution and the continued strength of our software businesses helped deliver adjusted gross margins of 57.3% in Q3. 
This reflects 90 basis points of expansion on a year-over-year basis as we accelerated to 220 basis points of total price realization. Q3 adjusted operating profit was 22.8%, reflecting solid execution across the portfolio, including counter measures enacted in the face of ongoing supply chain challenges. We had strong margin performance across all of our segments, resulting in 325 basis points of core operating margin expansion. 
On Slide 9, you can see that in the third quarter, we generated $252 million of free cash flow, representing a 105% conversion of adjusted net income. Free cash flow over the trailing 12 months increased 22% to $991 million. Our current net leverage is approximately 1.6x and we expect net leverage to be around 1.3x at year-end, excluding any additional M&A. 
Turning now to the guide on Slide 10. We are raising the low end of our full year 2021 adjusted diluted net EPS guidance to $2.70, resulting in a range of $2.70 to $2.75 for the year. This represents a year-over-year growth of 29% to 32% on a continuing operation basis. This assumes that total revenue growth of 14% to 14.5%, adjusted operating profit margins of 23% to 23.5% and an effective tax rate of approximately 14%. 
We continue to expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 105% of adjusted net income for the full year. We are also initiating fourth quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance of $0.74 to $0.79 representing year-over-year growth of 6% to 13%. This assumes total revenue growth of 6.5% to 8.5%, adjusted operating profit margin of 23.5% to 24.5% and an effective tax rate of approximately 15%. 
The adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance also excludes approximately $12 million of anticipated investments in strategic productivity initiatives that we expect to execute before the end of the year. For the fourth quarter, we expect free cash flow conversion to be approximately 125% of adjusted net income. 
With that, I'll pass it back to Jim for some closing."

I think one of the things about price is when you think about it, we really think about it in the big hardware businesses as Fluke, tech and Sensing. And in that -- those businesses, we were over 300 basis points.  So yes and we'll see improvement from there in the fourth quarter. So yes, so we're in good shape. 
You'll see the price in the software businesses in the net dollar retention. And so net dollar retention at 102 or so with some of our businesses even higher means we're also -- we're getting that price in a number of the software businesses. It just doesn't show up in the metric the way you'd like it.

We called those out in the prepared remarks but really strong bookings relative to the performance in those businesses.
So I think we're set up well for mid-single digit in 2022. But you're right, we had a onetime hit on revenue that occurred in the quarter, a couple other things -- a couple of little churn events or many churn events that we didn't anticipate. So certainly slowed it down a little bit in the quarter. But we think we're -- because of the order strength, particularly around new logos, we are -- we're in a good position for next year.
Relative to the 102, we're always going to have some businesses up and down relative to where that number's at. ServiceChannel and eMaint would be our best performers on that metric as an example. Intelex would be pretty high. But we -- I would suspect we'll get to sort of thinking about budgets as we go through the business. But I would suspect that you'd expect 100 basis points of improvement, 100 to 200 basis points of improvement somewhere in that range each year, at least for the next few years as we continue to -- while these businesses are still new to Fortive."

Well, I can take you through a lot of detail because I think I've been more involved in these kinds of things over the last 60 days than I typically would, takes me back to some routes, I guess. Josh, I would say a couple of things. One, certainly in our businesses, think of it as the more electronic content, the more likely to have a challenge.
So you can think about a circuit board at Tektronix, which is incredibly complicated, has multiple semiconductors on it, has multiple -- all kinds of chip technology on a board like that. You're going to just have higher variability because of that. Fluke will be as true as well and then Sensing a little bit less. So from a -- just how that goes, that's how it would be.
We are seeing mostly electronic shortages. And as I said in the previous comment, mostly around availability. We're paying a little bit more to get things. So there's some premium freight involved in inflation, very -- not a lot of labor. We have pretty low labor content in the company, simply because of our decades of productivity initiatives, so we're seeing some labor inflation, but at the end of the day, doesn't move the needle as much.
It's really about the material availability first and foremost. And given our gross margins on those products, it makes sense to -- even if we spend a few pennies more to get something in faster, given the high demand we have right now and just given the momentum in orders right now, it makes sense to sometimes pay those things, because ultimately, the margins. It just makes sense to do that.  And obviously, our first and foremost, we're taking care of customers. So hopefully, that gives you a window. 
Every day, we're well set up to deal with this because we have daily management, what we call visual management. You've seen it in our factories during tours. Our businesses manage every cell and every factory by the hour. And so we're well set up to just sort of put that on steroids a little bit in order to amplify the challenges and just get after it. And so it doesn't mean we don't have issues. It's how well we countermeasure that really makes the difference here."

We're certainly going to lean in on recurring revenue. We think that's a good way to -- we really think that's a strategy towards building a more durable, resilient Fortive over time.
And so I would say we're certainly leaning towards those kinds of opportunities.

We've got some software offerings there that we started with. We mentioned that in the prepared remarks. So we're building a more durable revenue stream. While at the same time, as you mentioned, we've taken advantage of a number of real opportunities relative to what I would call higher growth situations. And quite frankly, when we think about going forward, obviously, the semiconductor cycle is going to extend as people continue to invest in the kinds of things that we've talked about, but also these supply chain issues and constraints fundamentally require a lot of folks who have electronics in their products to redesign those products for different chips or different components. 
And quite frankly, one of the things they need to do that is in oscilloscope. So we think there's also, not only the sort of long-term secular trends that the business has been going after, but also some shorter-term opportunities is as people start to continue to have to deal with some of these supply chain challenges. And fundamentally, that can often end up in a redesign. And certainly, we have the products and solutions to help people do that.
So we're very bullish on the business. Obviously, it still has a component of volatility to it. But we -- I think the team has done a nice job of continuing to drive technology and innovation towards higher growth, more durable revenue streams."

Obviously, Tami's promotion is a great view on our internal development capability in a window on how we develop internal talent. So we're in a very good place with her promotion. 
Relative to the next layer down, we announced 2 internal promotions, both of whom came with acquisitions.  Justin and Bill both came to us with acquisitions, Justin with ISC, Bill with Gordian. And so the promotions that we announced in the prepared remarks is a good example of how we continue to retain folks from acquisitions and how they are additive to our leadership capabilities.

But as Chuck just said, relative to how AHS is setting up, we certainly talk about the software businesses, even where we had a little bit less growth at the current, we had good orders. So we think we can continue to build on our net retention. So I think we're certainly setting up for some good things, but let's get through this quarter. 
I'm pretty focused on the things we got to do right now to deliver October. So -- but we'll get there pretty soon. And obviously, I think if it plays out the way we think, we'll certainly have -- we'll be in our best backlog position that we've ever been in."
