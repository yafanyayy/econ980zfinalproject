526573,701865325,2191557,"Tapestry, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Feb 04, 2021",2021-02-04,"Earnings Calls","Tapestry, Inc.","Executives","Good morning. Thank you, Christina, and welcome, everyone. As you read in our press release, Tapestry's second quarter results significantly outpaced our expectations, driven by the successful execution of our acceleration program. Our sharpened focus o",3653,"Good morning. Thank you, Christina, and welcome, everyone. As you read in our press release, Tapestry's second quarter results significantly outpaced our expectations, driven by the successful execution of our acceleration program. 
Our sharpened focus on the consumer fueled new customer acquisition across all brands, supporting notable sales gains in digital and China. For the second consecutive quarter, we generated strong operating income growth, both compared to prior year and to fiscal year '19, supported by a reduction in promotional activity and higher AUR as well as disciplined inventory and expense management. I'm particularly proud that we delivered this profit growth in the face of unprecedented COVID-related external headwinds, including pressured bricks-and-mortar traffic, store closures and capacity limits as well as higher freight costs and shipping constraints. This success clearly underscores the talent and resilience of our teams around the world. It also reinforces the power of our brands and the competitive advantages of Tapestry's enabling platform. 
Importantly, our outperformance in the quarter also highlights the progress we've made under our acceleration program. First, we continue to drive our global digital business, which reached $1.3 billion in revenue on a trailing 12-month basis, more than doubling in size from a year ago. During the quarter, we once again generated triple-digit e-commerce growth, bringing digital sales to approximately 1/3 of total revenue as compared to a low-teens percentage last year. And in North America, as expected, the penetration was even higher, with e-commerce representing nearly half of our sales in the holiday quarter, up from a high-teens percentage last year. This outcome is a testament to our company-wide focus on leading with a digital-first mindset and our success in creating immersive customer experiences across our e-commerce and social channels. 
To deliver these outsized gains, we leveraged Tapestry's scale and agility to support increased digital demand. Specifically, we moved quickly to add fulfillment capacity, including expanding distribution centers by nearly 350,000 square feet heading into holiday. In addition, anticipating outbound shipping challenges in the U.S., we were able to successfully diversify our parcel carrier partnerships, increasing flexibility and enabling us to avoid bottlenecks and limit disruption as much as possible. These were critical elements of our holiday preparedness strategy. 
Importantly, our online growth was led by the recruitment of over 1.5 million new customers across brands in North America, where we're continuing to capture a growing number of millennial and Gen Z customers online. Overall, we're incredibly excited by the traction we're seeing in digital as our focus on this channel touches several of our key strategic priorities, including increased customer centricity, better use of data and evolving the way we work to address the rapidly changing environment. We see tremendous opportunity to drive continued customer recruitment and engagement online, supporting not only revenue growth, but profit growth as well as our digital sales channels carry higher operating margins than our respective brick-and-mortar counterparts. Therefore, digital growth is a key enabler as we transition from a period of efficiency led [indiscernible] gains to a sustainable demand-driven flywheel. 
Second, our ongoing efforts to sharpen our focus on the Chinese consumer once again led to meaningful growth in China, with benefits from innovative product assortments, enhanced marketing and expanded reach across both direct channels and third-party online distribution. To this end, we achieved record sales during 11/11 on Tmall's Luxury Pavilion, with Coach as the #1 ranked brand in the handbag, luggage and leather goods category; and Stuart Weitzman as the #1 ranked footwear brand. 
Over the holiday period, our brands offered exclusive products, virtual store pop-ups and live streaming events with influencers such as [ Austin Lee ], elevating the customer experience to meet the needs of the highly digitally and fashion-engaged Chinese consumer. In fact, the strength of our results in Mainland China more than offset continued pressure from lower Chinese tourist spend, with our sales to Chinese consumers globally increasing for the quarter. 
Third, as we've shared, we're committed to building industry-leading data and analytics capabilities at Tapestry, enabling each brand to leverage the shared resource to drive more effective decision-making. In the quarter, we deployed new data and analytics tools to optimize marketing messaging, assortment planning and promotional levels. This is helping to improve AUR and conversion and support the strong gross margin expansion we achieved in the quarter. In addition, we rolled out a new data platform to support our loyalty and acquisition programs. This is creating a foundation for ongoing customer recruitment and retention. 
Fourth, we leveraged the power of our leaner and more responsive operating model. A critical element of these changes is cultural and centers on empowering our teams to allow for faster decision-making. Our organization was nimble, sharing best practices across brands to develop and execute a highly effective holiday strategy. We put the customer first and adopted strategies to elongate the shopping period and utilize new innovative approaches to safely connect with customers, including virtual appointments and line queues. We also continue to drive efficiencies through the optimization of our global fleet. Our focus is to improve profitability across our store network, while delivering a consistent brand experience for our increasingly omnichannel consumer. 
Overall, I'm very pleased with the headway we're making on our acceleration program, which is defined by sharpening our focus on the consumer, leveraging data leading with digital and transforming into a leaner and more responsive organization. We are listening closely to consumers and responding to changes in their values, shopping behaviors and brand engagement. We're leaning into the competitive advantages of our platform, bringing innovation to both product and how we connect with customers. As a result, we're driving demand and desire for our categories and stretching what's possible for our brands. 
Now let me touch on our results and strategies for Coach, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman. Starting with Coach. Revenue exceeded our expectations, with sales down only 4% versus prior year, reflecting a significant sequential improvement. We also continue to expand gross margin while leveraging SG&A, generating a 400 basis point increase in operating margin to 34%. The brand's profit growth was impressive, particularly in light of the current backdrop. 
There are many highlights from the second quarter guided by our strategic priorities, which drove our positive results. First, we delivered compelling products, innovating across style, silhouettes and price points. In retail, we continue to fuel signature and proprietary brand codes through a variety of new iterations, with notable success in our Horse and Carriage platform. We also introduced the [ Beat ] family, which features exceptional functionality and beautiful hardware detail across a range of silhouettes. The [ Beat ] collection resonated particularly well with our Chinese customers. In outlet, we offered newness throughout the season, beginning with our successful Marvel collaboration. Our recent introductions, the [ Georgie ] and [indiscernible]  families were also top-selling collections in the quarter. And in both retail and outlet, we had compelling gifting options throughout the extended holiday season. 
As anticipated, we significantly reduced the number of SKUs in our offering across channels, providing more focused impactful assortments and clearer messages to consumers. 
Importantly, we also continue to be disciplined in our approach to promotions. Consistent with our strategy, we're shifting the customer's focus to the value, attributes and quality of the Coach product. In fact, our handbag AUR rose approximately 15%, both globally and in North America during this traditionally promotional season. 
Taken together, these actions supported the strong gross margin expansion we achieved in the quarter. 
Turning to marketing. Our holiday campaigns featuring Coach's global brand ambassadors, Jennifer Lopez, Michael B. Jordan, Kico Mizuhara, Yangzi and Jeremy Lynn resonated with consumers and reinforced the brand's authentic and inclusive positioning. In the digital channel, Coach again realized triple-digit revenue growth. We recruited roughly 1 million new customers through our North America digital channels, representing a significant increase compared to last year. These new customers who are increasingly younger are helping to fuel the strong growth we're delivering online. 
Moving to China. Revenue rose approximately 35% on the mainland. In addition, we recaptured tourist demand through the China duty-free channel as consumers increasingly shift to domestic travel. As mentioned, a highlight of the quarter was the brand's outperformance on Tmall's Luxury Pavilion during the 11/11 shopping festival. This was particularly exciting, given the brand only officially launched on the site about a year ago. 
Another key milestone was the multi-platform live streaming of our 400 drone, 15-minute performance on the [indiscernible] in Shanghai. We were the first fashion brand to utilize this format and it highlights how we're driving brand heat through interactive digital experiences and finding innovative ways to engage with Chinese consumers. We were also excited for the opening of Coach's first fully immersive digital store in Shanghai's premier IAPM Mall in December. The store has floor to ceiling video walls that feature bespoke digital art, combining some of our favorite Coach mascots with archival images to create a unique experience for consumers. Controlled by gaming technology, consumers can interact and play with the digital art to curate their own experience. 
In January, we were thrilled to be the first luxury brand to launch e-commerce on [ Valun ], the TikTok of China, as we continue to expand our reach, particularly with millennial and Gen Z consumers by offering immersive omnichannel experiences across e-commerce and social platforms. 
Now looking ahead to spring. We are sharpening our merchandising strategy, delivering innovative and emotionally compelling product to excite the consumer. In retail, we will build out the Beat family through new introductions, while evolving core bags such as the Tabby, which will feature a new lightweight fabrication. We're also expanding our [ Jacard ] signature offering to include a variety of colorways. In addition, we've launched new collaborations, including Disney by [ Keith Herring ], which is driving strong customer engagement and our outerwear anchored Coach by Champion collection, which dropped just this week. 
In outlet, we're launching a Coach original capsule and a Kate collaboration, both of which are at [indiscernible] of successful retail assortments from previous seasons. At the same time, we will continue to create exceptional value for our customers, while reducing promotional activity. 
Touching on marketing. You will see purpose-led messaging that connects community, fashion and heritage. Our Coach's forward campaign features our global brand ambassador sharing personal messages, which focus on the power of positivity, collective action and the importance of everyday recognition for the people in our lives who help move our world forward. To bring the campaign to life, the [indiscernible] will call on all viewers to Coach it Forward and leave messages of gratitude for loved ones, creating a ripple effect of optimism around the world. We also just launched Coach Conversations, a monthly YouTube series designed to create a 2-way dialogue about culture, community and creativity among global thought leaders. The debut episode kicked off with Jennifer Lopez and [ Jay Sheddy ], a former monk turned purpose coach and has already received over 700,000 views since launching in late January. 
In summary, we are extremely pleased with the brand's continued momentum and solid financial results as we grow our customer base, while driving increasing profitability. This year, we are celebrating Coach's 80th anniversary. As we look back on our history, we are proud of the brand's rich heritage as America's original house of leather goods. And just as importantly, as we look forward, we're confident in our future. 
Now moving to Kate Spade. We are very pleased with the brand's outperformance compared to our expectations from both the top and bottom line perspective, highlighting our team's excellent execution in a challenging environment. Revenue improved sequentially, declining 13% year-over-year, which included a 4-point impact from the strategic pullback of the low-margin wholesale disposition business. We delivered gross margin expansion of 110 basis points, while outpacing our internal projections, while also reducing SG&A. Taken together, Kate Spade delivered operating margin growth versus last year. 
We achieved several key strategic milestones during the quarter as we leaned into the fundamental elements of the brand that we know our customers value. Starting with product. In retail, we remain focused on rebuilding our core collection, while bringing newness to the assortment. Margo remained the top-selling handbag group, while newness, notably the all-day tote, performed well in the quarter. Our customer also responded to novelty elements integrated within our assortment, including products featuring our well-loved cat and handbags, adorned with faux fur, both of which were showcased in our holiday campaign. 
In outlet, we increased the breadth and depth of our box gift sets, which were top sellers over the holiday season. We also added to our core handbag collection through the introductions of key shoulder bag families, Natalia and Marty. 
Importantly, we were disciplined in our promotions, specifically in our value channels, driving global handbag AUR growth versus last year. 
Outside of handbags, we saw relative strength in jewelry and footwear across channels. In tech accessories, where Kate Spade has a leadership position among fashion brands, the glitter Air Pods case significantly outperformed expectations. In addition, I'm excited to announce our new fragrance collection, which launched in January, has seen overwhelmingly positive results in both our own channels as well as in department stores. These categories, which are foundational to the brand's unique lifestyle positioning, are also important for customer recruitment and cross-selling. 
During the holiday season, we highlighted Kate Spade as a destination for gifting, joy and celebration. An example of the brand's innovative approach to social selling was its collaboration with Starbucks in Asia. This partnership initiated by their APAC division, drove tremendous traffic to the Starbucks site. And it was so successful that the product sold out in just days in Japan. This example underscores the consumers' desire for Kate Spade and its relevance as a lifestyle brand. 
Turning to digital. Kate Spade has a well-established e-commerce business with the highest digital sales penetration within our house of brands. During the quarter, we continued to drive momentum online, achieving strong double-digit revenue growth through a combination of engagement with existing customers and the recruitment of new consumers. In fact, we attracted approximately 500,000 new consumers to the brand through our e-commerce channels in North America, a meaningful increase compared to last year. Importantly, these customers are entering the brand for the first time and purchasing at higher AUR compared to the balance, highlighting that when we meet customers where they want to shop with emotional and compelling product, innovation supersedes price. Additionally, we reactivated over 200,000 customers through our digital channel, an increase of approximately 40% compared to last year. This is an important greenshoot that demonstrates the traction we're making and strengthening our relationships with our core customer base. 
Turning to Kate Spade priorities for spring. In specialty, we're continuing to reenergize the leather goods offering with the launch of knot satchel. In addition, we will expand our signature platform, the Spade flower, with new color introductions in the well-received [ Jacar ] fabric. 
In outlet, we will launch [ Lela ], a core pebbled leather group. We will also offer newness in backpacks and cross bodies in keeping with the consumers' desire for hands-free styles. Across channels, we will continue to integrate novelty into our assortment with a playful nodical themes focused for the spring season. 
In marketing, our campaigns are joyful and colorful, grounded in our brand purpose and understanding of the customer. Our approach is multidimensional, utilizing a wide range of digital platforms and influencers to amplify our brand and product stories to engage with consumers and our community. In fact, last month, our peak Love Shack heart cross body went viral on TikTok. The excitement to begin was an enthusiastic customer who shared a post about her recent purchase of the bag. This quickly gained further momentum after one of our store associates created a video on response, which informed the community that the bag was now sold out across the United States. Taken together, these posts garnered over 1 million views. As a result, we worked quickly partnering with these micro influencers to create new marketing content to announce the product's restock. This is one of my favorite examples of how the brand's emotional connection to its customers has the potential to drive organic engagement within its loyal and passionate following. This has also been a key learning for our teams who are exploring new opportunities to harness the power of the Kate Spade community. 
In closing, I'm encouraged with the progress we're making and the increasing number of greenshoots we're seeing that highlight the strength of the brand. I remain optimistic about the potential for Kate Spade. It is a unique lifestyle brand with meaningful runway to accelerate revenue and profit growth, long term. 
Turning now to Stuart Weitzman. The brand demonstrated continued progress this holiday season. Sales sequentially improved from the previous quarter and exceeded our expectations as a result of the momentum in the direct business, led by China and e-commerce as well as wholesale. In addition, as previously announced, these revenue results include the impact from exiting unprofitable markets, which represented a 9-point headwind in the quarter. Importantly, our focused strategic actions resulted in significant operating margin expansion for the brand. 
During the quarter, we delivered compelling products with a focus on key categories of boots and booties. We grew our core classifications, while balancing by now, wear now styles with transitional products. In keeping with the market shift to casualization and building upon the strong performance of the [indiscernible] sold 50-50 list in the first quarter, we expanded our assortment of boots and booties featuring this on-trend soul, including the top-selling [ Coldie Bootie ]. 
Importantly, our icons continue to resonate with customers, specifically our 50-50 and [ Land ] families. 
In digital, we realized a double-digit increase in revenue compared to prior year. This performance was led by new customer recruitment, which includes a growing number of Gen Z and millennials entering the brand. Notably, we also drove roughly 30% increase in reactivated customers in the quarter as we sharpened our focus on creating relevant assortments to engage with our core consumers. 
In China, as mentioned, Stuart Weitzman was the #1 footwear brand on Tmall's Luxury Pavilion on 11/11, a key indicator of the brand's strength and momentum in this important market. During the quarter, we also introduced [ Lan Zhang ] as our brand ambassador, which helps to further solidify our luxury positioning in the market. In addition to our brand campaigns, we are continuing a key strategy of live streaming, featuring local influencers. For the 12/12 holiday, we partnered with Austin Lee, which drove significant engagement. 
Touching on marketing. Our winter Be In Your Element campaign, which featured our global brand ambassadors, Serena Williams, strengthened our positioning in boots and occasion wear. This campaign culminated with a billboard in Time's Square featured prominently during the televise year's celebration, which reached an estimated 1 billion viewers globally. 
In wholesale, we continued to strengthen our partnerships with key accounts, supported by consistent execution and on-time deliveries. We're pleased with our continued progress and the positive reactions we received coming out of our recent market week. 
Looking ahead to spring. In product, we're continuing to innovate by infusing our elevated take on casualization across the assortment. We're launching the [ Golbey ] family, which features pearl embellished styles across sneakers, flats and sandals, combining casual silhouettes with a brand signature of polished sophistication and comfort. In January, we introduced limited edition collections, including the Lunar New Year Capsule and Valentine's Day Edit. These collections feature our new Ali and Demi sneakers, which have been strong performers since the launch. 
Importantly, as vaccine distribution increases in 2021, we expect continued improvement in demand for key categories, particularly occasionwear and bridal. As a result, we will rebalance our assortment to include sandals and pumps for when our customer's ready to go out and celebrate, while continuing to focus on elevated casual styles. 
In marketing, for our spring 2021 campaign, we are very excited to once again feature Serena Williams, this time with a very special guest who will be announced in the coming weeks. We are also finding new ways to engage our customers based on direct feedback we have received from them. A great example of this is our launch of the 2021 Edit on Instagram and our website, which utilizes a range of diverse influencers, including our own associates to highlight ways our shoes can be styled to drive conversion. 
Overall, Stuart Weitzman's first half results were stronger-than-expected as we continue to make steady progress towards our goal of restoring the brand's profitability over our planning horizon. 
In closing, as we enter the second half of our fiscal year, while we do expect COVID-related headwinds to persist in the near term, our first half performance proves the resilience and agility of our team and the strength of our portfolio of brands. The consumer is changing rapidly in their value, shopping behaviors and connection to brands, and these changes have highlighted opportunities for our brands and our business. We've taken the opportunity to crystallize the unique purpose of our brands and company. And we fully embrace the opportunity to innovate the ways we engage with our customers and evolve how we operate as an organization. It also reinforced the opportunity to leverage Tapestry's enabling platform and competitive advantages to stretch what's possible for our brands. These changes are foundational to our success, both today and in the future. 
Importantly, I'm confident that Tapestry will emerge from the pandemic stronger, well positioned to capture market share at higher levels of profitability, creating opportunities for reinvestment in the business and, in turn, unlocking the flywheel of sustainable growth. 
With that, I will turn it over to Andrea for a detailed discussion of our financial results and outlook. Andrea?"

Before I begin, please keep in mind that my comments are based on non-GAAP results. Corresponding GAAP results and the related reconciliation can be found in the earnings release posted on our website today. 
As Joanne mentioned, our holiday quarter results were well ahead of our expectations as we continue to drive operating income growth in an unprecedented environment. Total sales declined 7% from prior year, representing a significant sequential improvement across all brands. Importantly, we successfully implemented our strategy to elongate the holiday shopping period, pulling forward demand ahead of the peak Thanksgiving week to allow the customer to start their shopping experience earlier. 
By region, North America, though still pressured versus last year, led the sequential improvement driven by better in-store trends and a higher penetration of the fast-growing digital business. In Asia, growth remained positive, aided by 30% plus revenue gains in Mainland China, along with a return to year-over-year growth in Korea. Across the balance of Asia, sales remained below last year, specifically in Japan and Malaysia as lockdown measures were reinstated. Europe, though a small portion of our total sales, experienced a material slowdown in the business, given a significant increase in lockdown accordance with local government restrictions. 
By channel, as Joanne noted, performance was driven by another quarter of triple-digit growth in digital as we leaned into the opportunity to meet the customer where they want to shop. In our global bricks-and-mortar channel, revenue continued to decline due to materially lower traffic compared to last year, partially offset by increases in AUR and conversion. In wholesale, while the channel remained below prior year, trends improved, reflecting, in part, the significant growth in our duty-free business in China's Hainan province. Importantly, top line trends in the month of January met our internal projections, reflecting a further sequential improvement from Q2 as we remain on track for sales to reflect in the third quarter. 
Moving down the P&L. We realized another quarter of excellent gross margin expansion compared to prior year, with all brands exceeding our expectations. Tapestry's gross margin rose 290 basis points year-over-year as we successfully executed our strategy to maintain price discipline and leverage data analytics to tailor our product assortment and marketing messaging to the consumer. 
Coach drove the increase in the quarter with gross margin expanding 340 basis points compared to last year, driven by lower levels of promotion, resulting in higher AUR, along with the reduction in SKU counts as planned. 
At Kate Spade, gross margin increased 110 basis points, which included a benefit from channel mix, reflecting a strategic pullback and lower margin disposition sales. This was partially offset by the final quarter of negative impact related to bringing the brand's footwear business in-house. Kate Spade gross margin was significantly ahead of expectations due to lower levels of promotional activity in the North America value channels. In addition, SKU count began to decline. 
For Stuart Weitzman, the brand's gross margin rose 40 basis points due to a benefit from FX. 
SG&A declined 9% year-over-year, primarily reflecting effective expense management and the previously announced actions to transform the company's operating model. In addition, and as projected, SG&A in the quarter benefited from wage subsidies, risk concessions and a gain associated with the deferred purchase price of the Kate Spade China joint venture. These items were partially offset by reinvestments in the business, notably higher marketing spend and an increase in accrued annual incentive plan expense, given our outperformance year-to-date. 
Overall, we drove strong operating income and margin expansion compared to both FY '20 and FY '19 for the second consecutive quarter. We're extremely proud of the standout results, which we delivered in the phase of unprecedented COVID-related external headwinds. As you will recall, we anticipated FY '21 would be a year of efficiency led profit growth and that our ability to drive increases in gross margin and reductions in SG&A would be the initial indicators of progress along our multiyear growth journey. Further, as expected, the outperformance of our margin-accretive businesses, notably digital, across brands and China are supporting our significant margin expansion. 
The strength of the first half is a clear indication that our foundational changes and the strategies of our acceleration program are taking hold, reflecting the potential to fully unlock the flywheel and drive sustainable long-term growth. 
Earnings per diluted share for the quarter was $1.15 as compared to $1.10 a year ago, representing an increase of 5%. As anticipated, these results included a negative impact from a higher tax rate compared to last year due to the geographic mix of earnings, along with an increase in interest expense, primarily associated with the drawdown on our revolver. 
Now moving to distribution. For Tapestry, we closed a net of 18 locations globally in the first half, including 3 net closures in Q2, representing a net of 84 closures as compared to the prior year as we continue to optimize our global fleet. 
Turning to a discussion of our balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter in a strong position with $1.6 billion in cash and equivalents and total borrowings of $1.8 billion. Consistent with our stated near-term priorities, we utilized free cash flow to pay down $500 million of the $700 million revolver drawdown during the quarter, with a $200 million balance paid down just last week. Therefore, at this time, there are no longer any borrowings under our revolver. 
Total inventory ended the quarter 16% below last year, reflecting in part deliberate actions to reduce SKU counts and prioritize inventory turns. The ending inventory balance was below our expectations due to our sales outperformance in the quarter. 
Today, like many others across all industries, we are experiencing some distribution network disruptions related to COVID-19, resulting in shipping capacity constraints and port congestion globally. As a result, we anticipate longer lead times, which will delay the timing of receipts and limit our ability to chase higher levels of demand should it materialize. In addition, we expect the Kate Spade business to be affected by the widely reported [ Naris Essen and One APIs ] cargo ship incidents, which will impact the brand's spring delivery. These factors have been contemplated in our outlook, which I will address shortly. 
CapEx for the quarter was $24 million, a decline of 52% versus prior year. We continue to prioritize investments in high-return projects, notably in digital, while tightly controlling overall spend and reducing our outlay for new stores. We now expect CapEx to be in the area of $135 million for FY '21 based on our favorable first half actualization. 
Free cash flow for the quarter was an inflow of $633 million as opposed to $506 million last year. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow was an inflow of $697 million. Our strong cash flow generation underscores the resilience and effective management of our brands and business. 
Now touching on our capital allocation priorities. As noted, the strength of our business and resulting free cash flow generation positioned us to fully pay down our revolver as of January. In the near term, we will continue to preserve our cash on hand while reinvesting in the business. Longer term, our objectives remain unchanged. Our strategic intent is to return to sustainable top and bottom line growth, driving continued strong free cash flow generation, which will enable us to pay down debt as well as return capital to shareholders. 
Turning to our outlook. As noted in our release, we are not providing detailed guidance for the fiscal year at this time due to lack of visibility. However, given our strong performance in the first half and assuming a continuation of the recovery from the pandemic in the second half, we are now projecting revenue to increase at a high single-digit rate on a 52-week basis and in the area of 10% on a 53-week basis for the fiscal year. We continue to expect revenue to inflect in the second half as we begin to anniversary the meaningful headwinds associated with the start of the global pandemic last year. This includes the expectation for sales to increase at a low double-digit rate in the third quarter. We are planning realistically as we continue to monitor the external environment in light of the recent resurgence of cases across the globe and the noted supply chain and logistics challenges impacting receipts. 
We remain focused on controlling the controllables and are building a strong foundation for profitable expansion over the planning horizon. This includes continuing to take deliberate actions to lower promotional activity, increase AURs across brands, as demonstrated in the first half and to drive gross margin expansion for the fiscal year. 
As previously announced, we're taking steps to aggressively control our SG&A spend to implement structural changes to drive increased efficiency. Through these initiatives, we continue to estimate that we'll realize approximately $300 million in gross run rate expense savings, including approximately $200 million in gross savings in FY '21 alone. However, with a higher level of variable costs associated with the higher sales forecast and reinvestments in our business, we would naturally expect our net savings dollars to be somewhat lower than originally anticipated. 
Looking ahead, we believe that we are creating a virtuous cycle of flywheel that should, as revenues inflect, drive bottom line growth, well in excess of top line gains over our planning horizon. 
In closing, we're very pleased with our strong half results, which demonstrate the bold actions we are taking under our acceleration program, the strength of our iconic brands and the resilience of our teams around the world and Tapestry's long-term potential to create value for all stakeholders. Looking ahead, we will continue to focus on those factors within our control as we navigate the uncertain environment in the near term. Importantly, our view of the long-term opportunities for Coach, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman is unchanged. Our brands continue to get benefit from Tapestry's enabling platform with the potential to achieve greater size and share than they could on their own. We remain steadfast in our strategic intent to drive organic growth and profitability and look forward to keeping you posted on our progress.

I'll take those one at a time. 2 great questions. First, on the sustainability of the results. When we developed our acceleration program, it was with an eye on foundational changes that we needed to make to be ready for what we were calling at the time, the new world of retailing. And the trends that we saw over a year ago have only accelerated through COVID, as you know, and that's given us stronger conviction to move quickly. These are foundational changes. They're embedded in our business. Some of those changes include having a sharper focus on the customer. We're using more consumer data and research to inform our plans and our execution. We're leaning into digital, really leveraging the Tapestry platform to engage customers in a different way. We're making real headway here with triple-digit growth in digital over the past 2 quarters. We're maximizing the opportunity with the Chinese consumer, as evidenced by the 30% growth we showed in Mainland China this past quarter. And we're leveraging data for decision-making. And that means really embedding these tools in our decision-making framework and our processes, which is supporting our approach to things like disciplined promotions, our SKU reductions, inventory control. And we're also delivering gross SG&A savings, as Andrea mentioned, which is about streamlining our operating model. It's about taking layers out and empowering our teams so that we can drive agility and speed. And at the same time, we're investing in capabilities to reach customers in new ways. And I would say, finally, we're focused on driving more productivity and profitability from our fleet. I mean, these are sustainable actions, and they're embedded in our operating model as we move forward, and we expect to drive accelerated revenue and profit growth across brands. I think year-to-date, our performance shows the actions are taking hold. We achieved strong operating income growth and operating margin expansion despite the pressured revenue year-to-date. 
To the second part of your question. With our first half outperformance, our fiscal year '21 outlook implies a return to high teens operating margin despite the external environment. And it also implies that in this fiscal year, we'll be approaching pre-COVID earnings on a 52-week basis despite the lower sales. So it really speaks to the success of our acceleration program and honestly, the strength of our team's execution."

So we're monitoring the trends. But as I said, things appear to be getting better. And we recognize that this is a near-term dynamic.

It's more than double where we were a year ago at this time. We ramped up quite quickly. And we're getting much better at engaging consumers on these platforms through e-commerce and social platforms. In fact, our digital business has been a great source of recruitment. We recruited over 1.5 million new customers in North America through digital channels, just this last quarter alone, across all of our brands. It is an important channel. We do see it continuing to grow. These digital shopping behaviors, we think, will be sticky, and we're well positioned to continue to invest in and engage consumers here. 
And to your point, our digital margins are accretive versus their brick-and-mortar counterpart. So as we grow this and continue to grow this channel and meet our customers where they want to shop, it also is a tailwind from an operating margin perspective as we move forward."

Our digital margins are well higher than those of the B&M channel, brick-and-mortar channel.

We've added a lot of customers to our brands. When I talk about recruiting 1.5 million new customers, these are customers who are new to the brand overall. So these are not customers who are just migrating from brick-and-mortar into digital. We are seeing some of that behavior naturally with the lower traffic to our stores. But these are new-to-brand customers. 
And as you mentioned, they're increasingly younger. We're acquiring younger customers at an increasing rate as we engage in e-commerce channels and digital channels and through social media, which is great for the long-term health of our brands.

I would say we're still early days in terms of the actions we're taking to restore the brand, to help and drive the brand to its fullest potential. And we are really encouraged by the greenshoots that the team is taking. We're seeing operating margin expansion, improvement in the top line, and that's being driven by our focus on our assortment and the product is resonating with our consumer. We've talked about our handbag assortment and stabilizing and reenergizing our core handbag assortment. We're seeing traction behind key elements of that assortment and talk about the Spade flower and the all-day tote that we released in last quarter, all performing. So that's a greenshoot. We're recruiting new customers, which is important to the brand, so that we can continue to expand the Kate Spade community. But we're also increasingly reactivating lapsed customers, which says that as we get back to the fundamental elements of the brand, we're resonating with our core customer base. So that was another greenshoot in the quarter. 
And I would say, finally, our global handbag AUR grew in the quarter, which is -- has been really nice progress, and I think speaks to the relevance of the product as we're delivering it. So we feel really good about the progress we're making in the Kate Spade brand. 
As it relates to Dispo, obviously -- maybe not obviously, that is a channel that we're trying to minimize, and we've made tremendous progress on that over the past few quarters. So we continue to focus on driving our business through our value channels, to our consumers as well as through specialty. And we're making, as I said, really good progress.

And so all 3 of those areas are focused areas of ours. 
As it relates to our people goals, it's about having more representation across our organization and in leadership and we continue to hold our teams accountable for progress. There's definitely more work we need to do there, but we remain very focused on it. 
And as it relates to communities, it's about how we impact our communities as a company. And that's through our foundation and the work our foundations do, but also through volunteering efforts from our teams. 
And I would say, lastly, on the environment, we're very focused on our carbon footprint and the impact and traceability of our supply chain. 
So those are some of the areas of focus. It is a very important element of our strategies going forward, and we're holding ourselves accountable to making progress on our goals."

And then Todd and Andrea can talk about the sustainability of our margins. 
But as we think about the category, this -- we have that small leather has been a strong category, pre-COVID. For years leading into the pandemic, the category was growing mid- to high single digits. We've been incredibly pleased with the level of engagement that customers have had with the category as we move through the pandemic. That's evidenced by our digital business, but also in areas in China, where the recovery is further along, we're seeing strong growth. So continue to see consumers engage with the category, and we continue to hear that handbags, these categories are emotional categories that consumers love and they continue to purchase to treat themselves. They consider the purchase a treat. 
And so we've also done some research in the middle of COVID about purchase intent going forward. And what we've heard from consumers is that there continues to be strong purchase intent for our categories. It ranks one of the highest categories for purchase intent in the coming 12 months. So we're pleased with the engagement in the category during the pandemic. We expect the category to continue to grow post pandemic. And as I think about it, as the vaccine rolls out and the world opens up again and people begin to connect in the physical world, we expect people to be going to events again and going out to eat, and we are very excited to be able to continue to grow our business as we outfit our consumers as their habits change going forward. So we see a lot of growth ahead as well. 
And Todd -- in terms of sustainability margins, I addressed that a little bit in our -- my first -- the first question today, but our -- the changes we're making in our organization are embedded in the organization. And we do think they're sustainable. But I'll pass it to Todd to take these."

And as Joanne mentioned, it does imply that EPS will hit or approach, I should say, pre-COVID FY '19 type of level. 
But importantly, we see continued opportunity from here, supported by continued revenue growth and operating expansion across brands. I think we have significant opportunity at both Kate Spade and at Stuart Weitzman to improve their gross margins. And obviously, we'll see the flow-through on the higher level of revenues. And if you look in the next a couple of quarters, obviously, third quarter, we'll still see a very good increase in gross margin, led by Coach. Fourth quarter will be slightly pressured in terms of gross margin. And then in terms of SG&A, we would expect SG&A dollar growth to be down in the third quarter slightly, even though we'll have that nice gain, low double-digit in sales. And then in the fourth quarter, we would expect SG&A dollar growth to be up significantly on a year-over-year basis as -- given last year's closures, et cetera, et cetera.

As you read in our press release, Tapestry's second quarter results significantly outpaced our expectations, driven by the successful execution of our Acceleration Program.  Our sharpened focus",3621,"Good morning. Thank you, Christina, and welcome, everyone. As you read in our press release, Tapestry's second quarter results significantly outpaced our expectations, driven by the successful execution of our Acceleration Program.  
Our sharpened focus on the consumer fueled new customer acquisition across all brands, supporting notable sales gains in digital in China. For the second consecutive quarter, we generated strong operating income growth, both compared to prior year and to fiscal year '19, supported by a reduction in promotional activity and higher AUR as well as disciplined inventory and expense management. I'm particularly proud that we delivered this profit growth in the face of unprecedented COVID-related external headwinds, including pressured bricks-and-mortar traffic, store closures and capacity limits as well as higher freight costs and shipping constraints. This success clearly underscores the talent and resilience of our teams around the world. It also reinforces the power of our brands and the competitive advantages of Tapestry's enabling platform.  
Importantly, our outperformance in the quarter also highlights the progress we've made under our Acceleration Program. First, we continue to drive our global digital business, which reached $1.3 billion in revenue on a trailing 12-month basis, more than doubling in size from a year ago. During the quarter, we once again generated triple-digit e-commerce growth, bringing digital sales to approximately 1/3 of total revenue as compared to a low-teens percentage last year. And in North America, as expected, the penetration was even higher, with e-commerce representing nearly half of our sales in the holiday quarter, up from a high-teens percentage last year. This outcome is a testament to our company-wide focus on leading with a digital-first mindset and our success in creating immersive customer experiences across our e-commerce and social channels.  
To deliver these outsized gains, we leveraged Tapestry's scale and agility to support increased digital demand. Specifically, we moved quickly to add fulfillment capacity, including expanding distribution centers by nearly 350,000 square feet heading into holiday. In addition, anticipating outbound shipping challenges in the U.S., we were able to successfully diversify our parcel carrier partnerships, increasing flexibility and enabling us to avoid bottlenecks and limit disruption as much as possible. These were critical elements of our holiday preparedness strategy.  
Importantly, our online growth was led by the recruitment of over 1.5 million new customers across brands in North America, where we're continuing to capture a growing number of millennial and Gen Z customers online. Overall, we're incredibly excited by the traction we're seeing in digital as our focus on this channel touches several of our key strategic priorities, including increased customer centricity, better use of data and evolving the way we work to address the rapidly changing environment. We see tremendous opportunity to drive continued customer recruitment and engagement online, supporting not only revenue growth, but profit growth as well as our digital sales channels carry higher operating margins than their respective brick-and-mortar counterparts. Therefore, digital growth is a key enabler as we transition from a period of efficiency-led profit gains to a sustainable demand-driven flywheel.  
Second, our ongoing efforts to sharpen our focus on the Chinese consumer once again led to meaningful growth in China, with benefits from innovative product assortments, enhanced marketing and expanded reach across both direct channels and third-party online distribution. To this end, we achieved record sales during 11/11 on Tmall's Luxury Pavilion, with Coach as the #1 ranked brand in the handbags, luggage and leather goods category; and Stuart Weitzman as the #1 ranked footwear brand.  
Over the holiday period, our brands offered exclusive products, virtual store pop-ups and live streaming events with influencers such as Austin Lee, elevating the customer experience to meet the needs of the highly digitally and fashion-engaged Chinese consumer. In fact, the strength of our results in Mainland China more than offset continued pressure from lower Chinese tourist spend, with our sales to Chinese consumers globally increasing for the quarter.  
Third, as we've shared, we're committed to building industry-leading data and analytics capabilities at Tapestry, enabling each brand to leverage the shared resource to drive more effective decision-making. In the quarter, we deployed new data and analytics tools to optimize marketing messaging, assortment planning and promotional levels. This is helping to improve AUR and conversion and support the strong gross margin expansion we achieved in the quarter. In addition, we rolled out a new data platform to support our loyalty and acquisition programs. This is creating a foundation for ongoing customer recruitment and retention.  
Fourth, we leveraged the power of our leaner and more responsive operating model. A critical element of these changes is cultural and centers on empowering our teams to allow for faster decision-making. Our organization was nimble, sharing best practices across brands to develop and execute a highly effective holiday strategy. We put the customer first and adopted strategies to elongate the shopping period and utilize new innovative approaches to safely connect with customers, including virtual appointments and line queues. We also continue to drive efficiencies through the optimization of our global fleet. Our focus is to improve profitability across our store network, while delivering a consistent brand experience for our increasingly omnichannel consumer.  
Overall, I'm very pleased with the headway we're making on our Acceleration Program, which is defined by sharpening our focus on the consumer, leveraging data, leading with digital and transforming into a leaner and more responsive organization. We are listening closely to consumers and responding to changes in their values, shopping behaviors and brand engagement. We're leaning into the competitive advantages of our platform, bringing innovation to both product and how we connect with customers. As a result, we're driving demand and desire for our categories and stretching what's possible for our brands.  
Now let me touch on our results and strategies for Coach, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman. Starting with Coach. Revenue exceeded our expectations, with sales down only 4% versus prior year, reflecting a significant sequential improvement. We also continue to expand gross margin while leveraging SG&A, generating a 400 basis point increase in operating margin to 34%. The brand's profit growth was impressive, particularly in light of the current backdrop. 
There are many highlights from the second quarter guided by our strategic priorities, which drove our positive results. First, we delivered compelling products, innovating across styles, silhouettes and price points. In retail, we continued to fuel signature and proprietary brand codes through a variety of new iterations, with notable success in our Horse & Carriage platform. We also introduced the Beat family, which features exceptional functionality and beautiful hardware detail across a range of silhouettes. The Beat Collection resonated particularly well with our Chinese customers. 
In outlet, we offered newness throughout the season, beginning with our successful Marvel collaboration. Our recent introductions, the Georgie and Dempsey families were also top-selling collections in the quarter. And in both retail and outlet, we had compelling gifting options throughout the extended holiday season.  
As anticipated, we significantly reduced the number of SKUs in our offering across channels, providing more focused impactful assortments and clearer messages to consumers. Importantly, we also continue to be disciplined in our approach to promotions. Consistent with our strategy, we're shifting the customer's focus to the value, attributes and quality of the Coach product. In fact, our handbag AUR rose approximately 15%, both globally and in North America during this traditionally promotional season. Taken together, these actions supported the strong gross margin expansion we achieved in the quarter.  
Turning to marketing. Our holiday campaigns featuring Coach's global brand ambassadors, Jennifer Lopez, Michael B. Jordan, Kiko Mizuhara, Yang Zi and Jeremy Lin resonated with consumers and reinforced the brand's authentic and inclusive positioning. In the digital channel, Coach again realized triple-digit revenue growth. We recruited roughly 1 million new customers through our North America digital channels, representing a significant increase compared to last year. These new customers who are increasingly younger are helping to fuel the strong growth we're delivering online.  
Moving to China. Revenue rose approximately 35% on the Mainland. In addition, we recaptured tourist demand through the China Duty Free channel as consumers increasingly shift to domestic travel. As mentioned, a highlight of the quarter was the brand's outperformance on Tmall's Luxury Pavilion during the 11/11 shopping festival. This was particularly exciting, given the brand only officially launched on the site about a year ago.  
Another key milestone was the multi-platform live streaming of our 400-drone, 15-minute performance on The Bund in Shanghai. We were the first fashion brand to utilize this format and it highlights how we're driving brand heat through interactive digital experiences and finding innovative ways to engage with Chinese consumers. 
We were also excited for the opening of Coach's first fully immersive digital store in Shanghai's premier IAPM Mall in December. The store has floor to ceiling video walls that feature bespoke digital art, combining some of our favorite Coach mascots with archival images to create a unique experience for consumers. Controlled by gaming technology, consumers can interact and play with the digital art to curate their own experience.  
In January, we were thrilled to be the first luxury brand to launch e-commerce on Douyin, the TikTok of China, as we continue to expand our reach, particularly with millennial and Gen Z consumers by offering immersive omnichannel experiences across e-commerce and social platforms.  
Now looking ahead to spring. We are sharpening our merchandising strategy, delivering innovative and emotionally compelling product to excite the consumer. In retail, we will build out the Beat family through new introductions, while evolving core bags such as the Tabby, which will feature a new lightweight fabrication. We're also expanding our jacquard signature offering to include a variety of colorways. In addition, we've launched new collaborations, including Disney by Keith Haring, which is driving strong customer engagement and our outerwear anchored Coach by Champion collection, which dropped just this week.  
In outlet, we're launching a Coach original capsule and a case collaboration, both of which are adaptations of successful retail assortments from previous seasons. At the same time, we will continue to create exceptional value for our customers, while reducing promotional activity.  
Touching on marketing. You will see purpose-led messaging that connects community, fashion and heritage. Our Coach It Forward campaign features our global brand ambassador sharing personal messages, which focus on the power of positivity, collective action and the importance of everyday recognition for the people in our lives who help move our world forward. To bring the campaign to life, the cast will call on all viewers to Coach it Forward and leave messages of gratitude for loved ones, creating a ripple effect of optimism around the world. We also just launched Coach Conversations, a monthly YouTube series designed to create a 2-way dialogue about culture, community and creativity among global thought leaders. The debut episode kicked off with Jennifer Lopez and Jay Shetty, a former monk turned purpose coach and has already received over 700,000 views since launching in late January.  
In summary, we are extremely pleased with the brand's continued momentum and solid financial results as we grow our customer base, while driving increasing profitability. This year, we are celebrating Coach's 80th anniversary. As we look back on our history, we are proud of the brand's rich heritage as America's original house of leather goods. And just as importantly, as we look forward, we're confident in our future.  
Now moving to Kate Spade. We are very pleased with the brand's outperformance compared to our expectations from both the top and bottom line perspective, highlighting our team's excellent execution in a challenging environment. Revenue improved sequentially, declining 13% year-over-year, which included a 4-point impact from the strategic pullback of the low-margin wholesale disposition business. We delivered gross margin expansion of 110 basis points, while outpacing our internal projections, while also reducing SG&A. Taken together, Kate Spade delivered operating margin growth versus last year.  
We achieved several key strategic milestones during the quarter as we leaned into the fundamental elements of the brand that we know our customers value. 
Starting with product. In retail, we remained focused on rebuilding our core collection, while bringing newness to the assortment. Margaux remained the top-selling handbag group, while newness, notably the all-day tote, performed well in the quarter. Our customer also responded to novelty elements integrated within our assortment, including products featuring our well-loved cat and handbags adorned with faux fur, both of which were showcased in our holiday campaign.  
In outlet, we increased the breadth and depth of our box gift sets, which were top sellers over the holiday season. We also added to our core handbag collection through the introductions of key shoulder bag families, Natalia and Marti. Importantly, we were disciplined in our promotions, specifically in our value channels, driving global handbag AUR growth versus last year.  
Outside of handbags, we saw relative strength in jewelry and footwear across channels. In tech accessories, where Kate Spade has a leadership position among fashion brands, the glitter AirPods case significantly outperformed expectations. 
In addition, I'm excited to announce our new fragrance collection, which launched in January, has seen overwhelmingly positive results in both our own channels as well as in department stores. These categories, which are foundational to the brand's unique lifestyle positioning, are also important for customer recruitment and cross-selling.  
During the holiday season, we highlighted Kate Spade as a destination for gifting, joy and celebration. An example of the brand's innovative approach to social selling was its collaboration with Starbucks in Asia. This partnership, initiated by their APAC division, drove tremendous traffic to the Starbucks site. And it was so successful that the products sold-out in just days in Japan. This example underscores the consumers' desire for Kate Spade and its relevance as a lifestyle brand.  
Turning to digital. Kate Spade has a well-established e-commerce business with the highest digital sales penetration within our house of brands. During the quarter, we continued to drive momentum online, achieving strong double-digit revenue growth through a combination of engagement with existing customers and the recruitment of new consumers. In fact, we attracted approximately 500,000 new consumers to the brand through our e-commerce channels in North America, a meaningful increase compared to last year. Importantly, these customers are entering the brand for the first time and purchasing at a higher AUR compared to the balance, highlighting that when we meet customers where they want to shop with emotional and compelling product, innovation supersedes price. 
Additionally, we reactivated over 200,000 customers through our digital channel, an increase of approximately 40% compared to last year. This is an important green shoot that demonstrates the traction we're making in strengthening our relationships with our core customer base.  
Turning to Kate Spade's priorities for spring. In specialty, we're continuing to reenergize the leather goods offering with the launch of Knott Satchel. In addition, we will expand our signature platform, the spade flower, with new color introductions in the well-received jacquard fabric.  
In outlet, we will launch Lyla, a core pebble leather group. We will also offer newness in backpacks and crossbodies in keeping with the consumers' desire for hands-free styles. Across channels, we will continue to integrate novelty into our assortment with a playful nautical themes focus for the spring season. 
In marketing, our campaigns are joyful and colorful, grounded in our brand purpose and understanding of the customer. Our approach is multidimensional, utilizing a wide range of digital platforms and influencers to amplify our brand and product stories to engage with consumers and our community. In fact, last month, our pink Love Shack heart crossbody went viral on TikTok. The excitement began with an enthusiastic customer who shared a post about her recent purchase of the bag. This quickly gained further momentum after one of our store associates created a video in response, which informed the community that the bag was now sold out across the United States. Taken together, these posts garnered over 1 million views. As a result, we worked quickly partnering with these micro influencers to create new marketing content to announce the product's restock. This is one of my favorite examples of how the brand's emotional connection to its customers has the potential to drive organic engagement within its loyal and passionate following. This has also been a key learning for our teams who are exploring new opportunities to harness the power of the Kate Spade community. 
In closing, I'm encouraged with the progress we're making and the increasing number of green shoots we're seeing that highlight the strength of the brand. I remain optimistic about the potential for Kate Spade. It is a unique lifestyle brand with meaningful runway to accelerate revenue and profit growth long term. 
Turning now to Stuart Weitzman. The brand demonstrated continued progress this holiday season. Sales sequentially improved from the previous quarter and exceeded our expectations as a result of the momentum in the direct business led by China and e-commerce as well as wholesale. In addition, as previously announced, these revenue results include the impact from exiting unprofitable markets, which represented a 9-point headwind in the quarter. Importantly, our focused strategic actions resulted in significant operating margin expansion for the brand. 
During the quarter, we delivered compelling products with a focus on key categories of boots and booties. We grew our core classifications, while balancing buy now, wear now styles with transitional product. In keeping with the market shift to casualization and building upon the strong performance of the lug sole 5050 LIFT in the first quarter, we expanded our assortment of boots and booties featuring this on-trend soul, including the top-selling Kolbie bootie. Importantly, our icons continue to resonate with customers, specifically our 5050 and LAND families. 
In digital, we realized a double-digit increase in revenue compared to prior year. This performance was led by new customer recruitment, which includes a growing number of Gen Z and millennials entering the brand. Notably, we also drove roughly 30% increase in reactivated customers in the quarter as we sharpened our focus on creating relevant assortments to engage with our core consumers. 
In China, as mentioned, Stuart Weitzman was the #1 footwear brand on Tmall's Luxury Pavilion on 11/11, a key indicator of the brand's strength and momentum in this important market. During the quarter, we also introduced Elaine Zhong as our brand ambassador, which helped to further solidify our luxury positioning in the market. In addition to our brand campaigns, we are continuing a key strategy of live streaming, featuring local influencers. For the 12/12 holiday, we partnered with Austin Lee, which drove significant engagement. 
Touching on marketing. Our winter Be In Your Element campaign, which featured our global brand ambassadors, Serena Williams, strengthened our positioning in boots and occasionwear. This campaign culminated with a billboard in Times Square featured prominently during the televised year's celebration, which reached an estimated 1 billion viewers globally. 
In wholesale, we continued to strengthen our partnerships with key accounts, supported by consistent execution and on-time deliveries. We're pleased with our continued progress and the positive reactions we received coming out of our recent market week. 
Looking ahead to spring. In product, we're continuing to innovate by infusing our elevated take on casualization across the assortment. We're launching the GOLDIE family, which features pearl-embellished styles across sneakers, flats and sandals, combining casual silhouettes with a brand signature of polished sophistication and comfort. 
In January, we introduced limited edition collections, including the Lunar New Year Capsule and Valentine's Day Edit. These collections feature our new OLLIE and DEMY sneakers, which have been strong performers since the launch. 
Importantly, as vaccine distribution increases in 2021, we expect continued improvement in demand for key categories, particularly occasionwear and bridal. As a result, we will rebalance our assortment to include sandals and pumps for when our customer's ready to go out and celebrate, while continuing to focus on elevated casual styles. 
In marketing, for our spring 2021 campaign, we are very excited to once again feature Serena Williams, this time with a very special guest who will be announced in the coming weeks. We are also finding new ways to engage our customers based on direct feedback we have received from them. A great example of this is our launch of the 2021 Edit on Instagram and our website, which utilizes a range of diverse influencers, including our own associates to highlight ways our shoes can be styled to drive conversion. 
Overall, Stuart Weitzman's first half results were stronger-than-expected as we continue to make steady progress towards our goal of restoring the brand's profitability over our planning horizon. 
In closing, as we enter the second half of our fiscal year, while we do expect COVID-related headwinds to persist in the near term, our first half performance proves the resilience and agility of our team and the strength of our portfolio of brands. The consumer is changing rapidly in their values, shopping behaviors and connection to brands, and these changes have highlighted opportunities for our brands and our business. We've taken the opportunity to crystallize the unique purpose of our brands and company. And we fully embrace the opportunity to innovate the ways we engage with our customers and evolve how we operate as an organization. It also reinforced the opportunity to leverage Tapestry's enabling platform and competitive advantages to stretch what's possible for our brands. These changes are foundational to our success, both today and in the future. 
Importantly, I'm confident that Tapestry will emerge from the pandemic stronger, well positioned to capture market share at higher levels of profitability, creating opportunities for reinvestment in the business and, in turn, unlocking the flywheel of sustainable growth. 
With that, I will turn it over to Andrea for a detailed discussion of our financial results and outlook. Andrea?"

Corresponding GAAP results and the related reconciliation can be found in the earnings release posted on our website today. 
As Joanne mentioned, our holiday quarter results were well ahead of our expectations as we continue to drive operating income growth in an unprecedented environment. Total sales declined 7% from prior year, representing a significant sequential improvement across all brands. Importantly, we successfully implemented our strategy to elongate the holiday shopping period, pulling forward demand ahead of the peak Thanksgiving week to allow the customer to start their shopping experience earlier. 
By region, North America, though still pressured versus last year, led the sequential improvement driven by better in-store trends and a higher penetration of the fast-growing digital business. In Asia, growth remained positive, aided by 30% plus revenue gains in Mainland China, along with a return to year-over-year growth in Korea. Across the balance of Asia, sales remained below last year, specifically in Japan and Malaysia as lockdown measures were reinstated. Europe, though a small portion of our total sales, experienced a material slowdown in the business, given a significant increase in lockdown accordance with local government restrictions. 
By channel, as Joanne noted, performance was driven by another quarter of triple-digit growth in digital as we leaned into the opportunity to meet the customer where they want to shop. In our global bricks-and-mortar channel, revenue continued to decline due to materially lower traffic compared to last year, partially offset by increases in AUR and conversion. In wholesale, while the channel remained below prior year, trends improved, reflecting, in part, the significant growth in our duty-free business in China's Hainan province. Importantly, top line trends in the month of January met our internal projections, reflecting a further sequential improvement from Q2 as we remain on track for sales to inflect in the third quarter. 
Moving down the P&L, we realized another quarter of excellent gross margin expansion compared to prior year with all brands exceeding our expectations. Tapestry's gross margin rose 290 basis points year-over-year as we successfully executed our strategy to maintain price discipline and leverage data analytics to tailor our product assortment and marketing messaging to the consumer. 
Coach drove the increase in the quarter with gross margin expanding 340 basis points compared to last year, driven by lower levels of promotion, resulting in higher AUR, along with the reduction in SKU counts, as planned. 
At Kate Spade, gross margin increased 110 basis points, which included a benefit from channel mix, reflecting a strategic pullback and lower margin disposition sales. This was partially offset by the final quarter of negative impact related to bringing the brand's footwear business in-house. Kate Spade's gross margin was significantly ahead of expectations due to lower levels of promotional activity in the North America value channels. In addition, SKU count began to decline. 
For Stuart Weitzman, the brand's gross margin rose 40 basis points due to a benefit from FX. 
SG&A declined 9% year-over-year, primarily reflecting effective expense management and the previously announced actions to transform the company's operating model. In addition, and as projected, SG&A in the quarter benefited from wage subsidies, rent concessions and a gain associated with the deferred purchase price of the Kate Spade China joint venture. These items were partially offset by reinvestments in the business, notably higher marketing spend and an increase in accrued annual incentive plan expense, given our outperformance year-to-date. 
Overall, we drove strong operating income and margin expansion compared to both FY '20 and FY '19 for the second consecutive quarter. We're extremely proud of these standout results, which we delivered in the face of unprecedented COVID-related external headwinds. As you will recall, we anticipated FY '21 would be a year of efficiency-led profit growth and that our ability to drive increases in gross margin and reductions in SG&A would be the initial indicators of progress along our multiyear growth journey. Further, as expected, the outperformance of our margin-accretive businesses, notably digital, across brands and China are supporting our significant margin expansion. 
The strength of the first half is a clear indication that our foundational changes and the strategies of our Acceleration Program are taking hold, reflecting the potential to fully unlock the flywheel and drive sustainable long-term growth. 
Earnings per diluted share for the quarter was $1.15 as compared to $1.10 a year ago, representing an increase of 5%. As anticipated, these results included a negative impact from a higher tax rate compared to last year due to the geographic mix of earnings, along with an increase in interest expense, primarily associated with the drawdown on our revolver. 
Now moving to distribution. For Tapestry, we closed a net of 18 locations globally in the first half, including 3 net closures in Q2, representing a net of 84 closures as compared to the prior year as we continue to optimize our global fleet. 
Turning to a discussion of our balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter in a strong position with $1.6 billion in cash and equivalents and total borrowings of $1.8 billion. Consistent with our stated near-term priorities, we utilized free cash flow to pay down $500 million of the $700 million revolver drawdown during the quarter, with a $200 million balance paid down just last week. Therefore, at this time, there are no longer any borrowings under our revolver. 
Total inventory ended the quarter 16% below last year, reflecting in part deliberate actions to reduce SKU counts and prioritize inventory turns. The ending inventory balance was below our expectations due to our sales outperformance in the quarter. 
Today, like many others across all industries, we are experiencing some distribution network disruptions related to COVID-19, resulting in shipping capacity constraints and port congestion globally. As a result, we anticipate longer lead times, which will delay the timing of receipts and limit our ability to chase higher levels of demand, should it materialize. In addition, we expect the Kate Spade business to be affected by the widely reported Maersk Essen and ONE Apus cargo ship incidents, which will impact the brand's spring deliveries. These factors have been contemplated in our outlook, which I will address shortly. 
CapEx for the quarter was $24 million, a decline of 52% versus prior year as we continue to prioritize investments in high-return projects, notably in digital, while tightly controlling overall spend and reducing our outlay for new stores. We now expect CapEx to be in the area of $135 million for FY '21 based on our favorable first half actualization. 
Free cash flow for the quarter was an inflow of $633 million as opposed to $506 million last year. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow was an inflow of $697 million. Our strong cash flow generation underscores the resilience and effective management of our brands and business. 
Now touching on our capital allocation priorities. As noted, the strength of our business and resulting free cash flow generation positioned us to fully pay down our revolver as of January. In the near term, we will continue to preserve our cash on hand while reinvesting in the business. Longer term, our objectives remain unchanged. Our strategic intent is to return to sustainable top and bottom line growth, driving continued strong free cash flow generation, which will enable us to pay down debt as well as return capital to shareholders. 
Turning to our outlook. As noted in our release, we are not providing detailed guidance for the fiscal year at this time due to lack of visibility. However, given our strong performance in the first half and assuming a continuation of the recovery from the pandemic in the second half, we are now projecting revenue to increase at a high single-digit rate on a 52-week basis and in the area of 10% on a 53-week basis for the fiscal year. We continue to expect revenue to inflect in the second half as we begin to anniversary the meaningful headwinds associated with the start of the global pandemic last year. This includes the expectation for sales to increase at a low double-digit rate in the third quarter. 
We are planning realistically as we continue to monitor the external environment in light of the recent resurgence of cases across the globe and the noted supply chain and logistics challenges impacting receipts. We remain focused on controlling the controllable and are building a strong foundation for profitable expansion over the planning horizon. This includes continuing to take deliberate actions to lower promotional activity and increase AURs across brands, as demonstrated in the first half and to drive gross margin expansion for the fiscal year. 
As previously announced, we're taking steps to aggressively control our SG&A spend to implement structural changes to drive increased efficiency. Through these initiatives, we continue to estimate that we'll realize approximately $300 million in gross run rate expense savings, including approximately $200 million in gross savings in FY '21 alone. However, with a higher level of variable costs associated with the higher sales forecast and reinvestments in our business, we would naturally expect our net savings dollars to be somewhat lower than originally anticipated. 
Looking ahead, we believe that we are creating a virtuous cycle or flywheel that should, as revenues inflect, drive bottom line growth well in excess of top line gains over our planning horizon. 
In closing, we're very pleased with our strong half results, which demonstrate the bold actions we are taking under our Acceleration Program, the strength of our iconic brands and the resilience of our teams around the world and Tapestry's long-term potential to create value for all stakeholders. Looking ahead, we will continue to focus on those factors within our control as we navigate the uncertain environment in the near term. 
Importantly, our view of the long-term opportunities for Coach, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman is unchanged. Our brands continue to get benefit from Tapestry's enabling platform with the potential to achieve greater size and share than they could on their own. We remain steadfast in our strategic intent to drive organic growth and profitability and look forward to keeping you posted on our progress. 
I'd now like to open it up to Q&A."

Two great questions. First, on the sustainability of the results. When we developed our Acceleration Program, it was with an eye on foundational changes that we needed to make to be ready for what we were calling at the time, the new world of retailing. And the trends that we saw over a year ago have only accelerated through COVID, as you know, and that's given us stronger conviction to move quickly. These are foundational changes. They're embedded in our business. Some of those changes include having a sharper focus on the customer. We're using more consumer data and research to inform our plans and our execution. We're leaning into digital, really leveraging the Tapestry platform to engage customers in a different way. We're making real headway here with triple-digit growth in digital over the past 2 quarters. We're maximizing the opportunity with the Chinese consumer, as evidenced by the 30% growth we showed in Mainland China this past quarter. 
And we're leveraging data for decision-making. And that means really embedding these tools in our decision-making framework and our processes, which is supporting our approach to things like disciplined promotions, our SKU reductions, inventory control. And we're also delivering gross SG&A savings, as Andrea mentioned, which is about streamlining our operating model. It's about taking layers out and empowering our teams so that we can drive agility and speed. 
And at the same time, we're investing in capabilities to reach customers in new ways. And I would say, finally, we're focused on driving more productivity and profitability from our fleet. I mean these are sustainable actions, and they're embedded in our operating model as we move forward, and we expect to drive accelerated revenue and profit growth across brands. 
I think year-to-date, our performance shows the actions are taking hold. We achieved strong operating income growth and operating margin expansion despite the pressured revenue year-to-date. 
To the second part of your question, with our first half outperformance, our fiscal year '21 outlook implies a return to high teens operating margin despite the external environment. And it also implies that in this fiscal year, we'll be approaching pre-COVID earnings on a 52-week basis despite the lower sales. So it really speaks to the success of our Acceleration Program and, honestly, the strength of our team's execution."

It's more than double where we were a year ago at this time. We ramped up quite quickly. And we're getting much better at engaging consumers on these platforms through e-commerce and social platforms. 
In fact, our digital business has been a great source of recruitment. We recruited over 1.5 million new customers in North America through digital channels just this last quarter alone across all of our brands. It is an important channel. We do see it continuing to grow. These digital shopping behaviors, we think, will be sticky, and we're well positioned to continue to invest in and engage consumers here. 
And to your point, our digital margins are accretive versus their brick-and-mortar counterpart. So as we grow this and continue to grow this channel and meet our customers where they want to shop, it also is a tailwind from an operating margin perspective as we move forward."

Our digital margins are well higher than those of the B&M channel, brick-and-mortar channel.

And then it's separate, but also related to Kate. You called out a reduction in wholesale disposition as a headwind there. Maybe just where are you in terms of your level of exposure to that channel versus where you plan to be on a go-forward basis?"

And we have a number of promising green shoots. 
I would say we're still early days in terms of the actions we're taking to restore the brand to help and drive the brand to its fullest potential. And we are really encouraged by the green shoots that the team is taking. We're seeing operating margin expansion, improvement in the top line, and that's being driven by our focus on our assortments and the product is resonating with our consumer. We've talked about our handbag assortment and stabilizing and reenergizing our core handbag assortment. We're seeing traction behind key elements of that assortment and talk about the spade flower and the all-day tote that we released in last quarter, all performing. So that's a green shoot. 
We're recruiting new customers, which is important to the brand, so that we can continue to expand the Kate Spade community. But we're also increasingly reactivating lapsed customers, which says that as we get back to the fundamental elements of the brand, we're resonating with our core customer base. So that was another green shoot in the quarter. 
And I would say, finally, our global handbag AUR grew in the quarter, which is -- has been really nice progress, and I think speaks to the relevance of the products as we're delivering it. So we feel really good about the progress we're making in the Kate Spade brand. 
As it relates to dispo, obviously -- or maybe not obviously, that is a channel that we're trying to minimize, and we've made tremendous progress on that over the past few quarters. So we continue to focus on driving our business through our value channels to our consumers as well as through specialty. And we're making, as I said, really good progress. And really, the great news for us is that we're only just beginning. We see a tremendous amount of potential for the Kate Spade brand as we move forward."

Yes, the shift in digital has been rapid, and we've seen that more than doubled in the last 12 months. Our total digital, I mentioned earlier, about $1.3 billion now business has reached sizable scale as well. And we have reacted quite quickly to support that business. We've added distribution square footage, we've added carrier partnerships and we continue to make the investments required to support that business on the distribution and fulfillment side as well as investing in the platform and the data and technology and the tools that we need to manage that business. 
The teams have done a great job moving inventory around the world to ensure we're supporting demand where we see it. So we feel great about our position, our Tapestry platform and the scale that we bring to our digital business. 
And as it relates to the fleet, our first focus is to sharp -- is on the customer, right? We want to follow where the customer is, we want to meet the customer where they are. And our shift into digital this year has really been to serve our customer where they and how they want to be served. 
And as we think about the fleet, we think about it through that same lens. We've talked about over the last couple of quarters, raising the thresholds of profitability and our expectations for the productivity and profitability for our fleet, and we continue to manage our fleet with those expectations, higher expectations for productivity and higher expectations for those -- our brick-and-mortar stores to be profitable. 
Having said that, we also believe that there is a need for physical touch point of the brand, stores matter. And we're investing in and ensuring that, that physical touch point is the right experience for our consumer. And a great example of that is the store that we opened up in Shanghai in the IAPM Mall. It's a fully immersive digital store with floor-to-ceiling video walls that engage our consumer and let them engage with the video on the wall. So it's about the experience, but our -- from a financial perspective and how we manage our business and our fleet is with an eye on productivity and profitability."

And then Todd and Andrea can talk about the sustainability of our margins. 
But as we think about the category, this handbag and small leather business has been a strong category pre-COVID. For years leading into the pandemic, the category was growing mid- to high single digits. We've been incredibly pleased with the level of engagement the customers have had with the category as we move through the pandemic. That's evidenced by our digital business, but also in areas in China, where the recovery is further along and we're seeing strong growth. So continue to see consumers engage with the category, and we continue to hear that handbags, these categories are emotional categories that consumers love and they continue to purchase to treat themselves. They consider the purchase a treat. 
And so we've also done some research in the middle of COVID about purchase intent going forward. And what we've heard from consumers is that there continues to be strong purchase intent for our categories. It ranks one of the highest categories for purchase intent in the coming 12 months. 
So we're pleased with the engagement in the category during the pandemic. We expect the category to continue to grow post pandemic. And as I think about it, as the vaccine rolls out and the world opens up again and people begin to connect in the physical world, we expect people to be going to events again and going out to eat, and we are very excited to be able to continue to grow our business as we outfit our consumers as their habits change going forward. So we see a lot of growth ahead as well. 
And Todd, in terms of sustainability of margins, I addressed that a little bit in our -- my first -- in the first question today, but our -- the changes we're making in our organization are embedded in the organization. And we do think they're sustainable. But I'll pass it to Todd to take these."

I think we have significant opportunity at both Kate Spade and at Stuart Weitzman to improve their gross margins. And obviously, we'll see the flow-through on the higher level of revenues. 
And if you look in the next couple of quarters, obviously, third quarter, we'll still see a very good increase in gross margin led by Coach. Fourth quarter will be slightly pressured in terms of gross margin. And then in terms of SG&A, we would expect the SG&A dollar growth to be down in the third quarter slightly, even though we'll have that nice gain, low double-digit in sales.

Thank you, Christina, and welcome, everyone. 
As you read in our press release, Tapestry reported a standout quarter, which once again outpaced expectations, reflecting the successful execution of our acceleration program and the power brands. Our sharpened focus on the consumer fueled new customer acquisition at Coach, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman, contributing to a continued sequential improvement in overall top line trends. Revenue growth in the quarter was led by robust increases in digital and China, 2 areas of meaningful long-term opportunity. In addition, for the third consecutive quarter, we achieved operating income and EPS gains, both compared to prior year and to pre-pandemic fiscal year '19, supported by a reduction in promotional activity and higher AUR as well as disciplined expense management. We also generated significant free cash flow in the quarter, demonstrating our financial strength and flexibility. 
This performance is a testament to our talented teams around the world. Their creativity, agility and resilience have enabled us to effectively navigate a challenging backdrop and deliver for our customers, while positioning Tapestry to emerge from the pandemic stronger and build on our recent momentum to drive sustainable growth. 
Before turning to a discussion of our strategic pillars, I want to touch on the leadership changes we've announced in recent weeks. I'm delighted with the team that we brought together, which combines deep knowledge of our company with fresh perspectives as we position Tapestry to win in the dynamic retail and consumer environment. Todd Kahn, who was appointed Coach CEO, has a unique balance of brand stewardship and commercial capabilities and has done a tremendous job leading Coach and delivering exceptional results. Andrea Resnick is a proven leader who ensured that we successfully executed on our acceleration program as interim CFO, and we're excited that she will now assume a new role as Chief Communications Officer, where we know she'll continue to make important contributions to our company. As such, Christina Colone, who has tremendous credibility and experience with the investment community has been promoted to Global Head of Investor Relations. Finally, I'm thrilled to have Scott Roe join us in June as Chief Financial Officer and Head of Strategy. With his extensive experience in consumer, retail and apparel businesses, as well as his deep expertise developing best-in-class global multi-brand platforms, I'm confident he is the right strategic business partner to further enhance our strategy and financial performance. 
With this strong leadership team now in place, we are galvanized around our shared commitment to fully realized Tapestry's growth potential across brands as well as our passion for building a purpose-led organization with empowered inclusive and highly collaborative teams. 
Now I'll discuss the important progress we've made advancing our acceleration program during the third quarter. First, we continue to create immersive customer experiences across our e-commerce and social channels, driving our global digital business to over $1.5 billion in revenue on a trailing 12-month basis, more than doubling in size from a year ago. During the quarter, we generated triple-digit e-commerce growth, bringing digital sales to approximately 30% of total revenue as compared to a mid-teens percentage last year. This growth was led by the recruitment of approximately 700,000 new customers across brands through our e-commerce channels in North America, where we're continuing to capture a growing number of millennial and Gen Z customers. And not only did we successfully recruit new customers, we also drove a higher purchase frequency versus prior year across brands. We also continued to reactivate lapsed customers across the portfolio. This reflects the work we've done to crystallize the unique positioning of our brands while strengthening our platform to better utilize data to support more targeted marketing campaigns. Overall, we remain incredibly excited by the digital opportunity and the scalable Tapestry omnichannel platform we're building. Digital is a key competitive advantage and a growth enabler for us long term, supporting both revenue growth and profit gains, particularly given that our digital business is accretive to our operating margin. 
Second, our ongoing efforts to sharpen our focus on the Chinese consumer led to significant growth in China as compared to both prior year and prepandemic levels. In fact, the strength of our results in Mainland China more than offset continued pressure from lower Chinese tourist spend with our sales-to-Chinese consumers globally increasing at a high single-digit rate compared to pre-pandemic levels. These results benefited from the integrated, comprehensive brand-building strategies, which drove innovative products, marketing and experiences. 
Third, we're strengthening our platform and changing the way we work to increase our agility and responsiveness. A key element of the strategy is embedding data across the organization, allowing each brand to leverage the shared resource to drive more effective decision-making. 
In the quarter, we utilized these capabilities to deepen our understanding of customer preferences and behaviors. This enhanced our processes, ultimately driving significant gross margin expansion and higher AUR, specifically by supporting optimized assortment planning, which helped to affect a 30% to 50% reduction in SKU counts across brands, resulting in higher productivity per SKU, driving inventory turn and providing clearer messaging to the consumer. And we leverage data analytics to drive more dynamic and informed pricing decisions, supporting lower levels of promotional activity. Overall, we believe the use of data is powering a shift in our culture, creating a robust test-and-learn environment that empowers our teams to move quickly to respond to changes in consumer preferences and demand. 
Fourth, we continue to drive operational efficiencies in our business. We further enhanced the flexibility of our operating model through the optimization of our global fleet. As you know, our focus is to improve profitability across our store network. We've made substantial progress. And in fact, the operating margin for our global bricks-and-mortar business exceeded pre-pandemic fiscal year '19 levels despite the challenging backdrop. We see further opportunity going forward as we remain focused on delivering compelling omnichannel experiences with both digital and stores contributing to our success. This is clearly evidenced by the ongoing strength we're seeing in our digital channels even as our brick-and-mortar business improves. 
Overall, I'm very pleased with the continued improvements we've realized under our acceleration program. Based on our results to date and assuming a continued recovery emerging from the pandemic, we now expect to exceed pre-pandemic levels of operating income and EPS for the fiscal year, far surpassing our original expectations provided in August. Importantly, the changes we have made are foundational. As we embed a consumer-centric approach into our organization, unlock new ways of working and distort our focus to high-return initiatives, we're establishing sustainable growth drivers for Tapestry and our brands. 
Now let me touch on our results and strategies for Coach, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman. Starting with Coach, where results were once again impressive. Revenue exceeded our expectations with sales improving sequentially, increasing 25% as compared to last year and returning to pre-pandemic levels, an important milestone for the brand. In addition, we continued to significantly expand gross margin and leverage SG&A, resulting in strong operating margin expansion and substantial profit gains. 
There were many highlights from the third quarter guided by our strategic priorities, which drove our positive results. First, we delivered compelling and innovative products with a focus on reinvigorating key families that are foundational to the brand. In retail, we successfully built on our core icons, infusing newness that is resonating with consumers. We introduced Pillow Tabby, a fresh take on a bestselling family, which was very well received, particularly with new younger customers. We also launched extensions within the BEAT and Willow families, which outperformed plan. In outlet, we expanded the top-selling Georgi and Dense families to include new styles and fabrics, which performed well at higher AURs. Overall, we are building enduring icons, which respond to the emotional and functional needs of our target consumer and help to create a strong foundation for our product pipeline in future seasons. 
We also continued to deliver strong gross margin expansion through deliberate actions. As anticipated, we significantly reduced the number of SKUs in our offering across channels providing more focused, impactful assortments and clearer messages to consumers. Importantly, we also continue to be disciplined in our approach to promotions. Consistent with our strategy, we're shifting the customer's focus to the value, attributes and quality of the Coach product. In fact, our handbag AUR rose over 25%, both globally and in North America. 
These results are not possible without great product. I want to take a minute to recognize our talented design and merchandising teams who, under Steward Weber's creative direction, continue to deliver product innovation with a focus on quality that has infused energy and excitement into our assortments and delivered exceptional value to customers across all channels. 
Turning to marketing. We continue to build deeper customer relationships, leaning into our values of inclusivity and authenticity through our campaigns and digital content, which are driving increased engagement, recruitment and reactivation. 2 key examples are Coach It Forward, which featured our global ambassador, sharing personal messages of gratitude and our YouTube series, Coach Conversations, which provided a forum to discuss culture, community and creativity and engage audiences through authentic dialogue. These campaigns increased engagement, creating buzz across social media platforms. 
In digital, Coach again realized triple-digit revenue growth. We recruited roughly 400,000 new customers through our North America digital channels, representing a significant increase compared to last year. These new customers who are increasingly younger are helping to fuel the strong growth we're delivering online. In addition to customer acquisition, we also focus on driving retention and lifetime value through a number of actions, including the recent launch of the Coach outlet loyalty program. Overall, we see significant runway to realize continued digital growth while improving our brick-and-mortar productivity. This is reinforced by the trends we're seeing in the business as stores have reopened. Specifically, in the U.S., we've seen continued strong demand online even amid easing restrictions and improving brick-and-mortar traffic. 
Moving on to China. Revenue on the Mainland rose significantly compared to last year and approximately 40% compared to pre-pandemic levels. In addition, we recaptured tourist demand through the China duty free channel as consumers increasingly shift to domestic travel. To celebrate the Chinese New Year, we featured a playful ox across our limited edition collection, which drove e-commerce growth, including on Tmall. As we previously shared, in February, we were the first luxury brand to launch an e-commerce platform on Dalian, the TikTok of China. Our results thus far, have well outpaced our expectations with the majority of customers transacting with us entering the brand for the first time. 
Now looking ahead to summer. We are building on our momentum into the fourth quarter with key product launches, while continuing to sharpen our merchandising strategy to deliver innovative and emotionally compelling collections. In retail, we are expanding our signature offering into new and bright color ways of jacquard to infuse optimism into the assortment. We're also excited for a new combination of our Signature C and horse and carriage logos, bringing together 2 icons on our best-selling beat and field families. In addition, to capitalize on trends in the market, we are introducing our Coach Originals in a new quilted version, named Coach Quilties, which will be offered in seasonal colors. Separately, following the success of our Pillow Tabby, we recently introduced a mini version, which is already off to a promising start. In fact, over the last 3 months, we've seen an increase in viral user-generated content on TikTok featuring the Pillow Tabby. In outlet, we launched a Disney Princesses collaboration in April, which is outperforming our expectations. And for Mother's Day, we plan to deliver a floral-focused collection for the important holiday. 
Turning to marketing. We are excited to host a Winter '21 collection runway show in Shanghai in June. We believe this will support our growth ambitions both in China and globally by driving desire for the Coach brand and broadening our reach through partnerships with a diversified group of ambassadors, celebrities and key opinion leaders. The collection will feature exclusive products for the Chinese market, and we'll amplify the show through integrated guest experiences, including live streaming. 
In summary, we believe Coach's return to prepandemic levels of sales and significant profit growth is a standout achievement, particularly given the challenging backdrop. We are building on this momentum and the foundational changes we've made this year as we head into the fourth quarter and beyond. We're proud to celebrate the brand's 80th anniversary this year and are confident in the future. 
Now moving to Kate Spade. The brand again, outperformed expectations in the quarter from both a top and bottom line perspective, highlighting the progress we've made through strong execution. Revenue improved sequentially, increasing 1% compared to fiscal year '20, which included a 6-point impact from the wholesale business, inclusive of the strategic pullback in the disposition channel. We delivered gross margin expansion of 150 basis points, well ahead of our projections, while also reducing SG&A, resulting in operating income growth and operating margin expansion versus last year. 
There are many key strategic milestones of the quarter, highlighting the traction we're making as we continue to fulfill the brand's promise and build stronger connections with consumers, starting with product. In retail, we made further progress on rebuilding our core as exemplified through the strength of our recently launched families. The Knot Collection, which featured new colorways was particularly well received by our younger customer. We also expanded our signature platform, the Spade Flower, with the jacquard fabric continuing to outperform expectations. The success of these introductions supports our momentum and reinforces our ability to sustain higher AURs by offering differentiated, innovative designs. Additionally, our novelty assortment, which reflects a return to our roots, continue to resonate with our customers, notably our mailbox, crab and strawberry milk carton bags. In outlet, we saw continued traction in safiano leather styles. We also brought in new crossbody options in keeping with the hands-free trend. Importantly, we leveraged data to inform our assortment breadth and pricing strategies, reducing our SKU counts by over 40% and remaining disciplined in our promotions, which drove an increase in global handbag AUR in both our specialty and outlet channels compared to last year. 
Outside of handbags, we saw strength in footwear across channels. In fact, footwear delivered positive growth driven by casual flats and sneakers as we continue to build momentum into the summer selling season. In addition, tech accessories continued to outperform, while the launch of our new fragrance in North America outpaced expectations. These categories, which are foundational to the brand's unique lifestyle positioning, are also important for customer recruitment and cross-selling. 
Turning to marketing. We drove brand heat, both through our lifestyle campaigns as well as organically on social media through our passionate Kate Spade community. To that end, we continue to drive organic engagement in the quarter with 2 more handbags going viral on TikTok from customer-created content. Following videos created post purchase, the Strawberry handbag and the Butterfly Wing crossbody have garnered approximately 12 million views to date on the platform with excitement spreading to other social channels. As a result, we saw increased site searches for these products, driving significant uptick in sales. This highlights the importance of social selling through the loyal and passionate members of the Kate Spade community. 
We also saw success with our first-ever male gifting campaign, which featured NBA star Kevin Love for Valentine's Day and fueled an increase in conversion among male shoppers. We're excited by these greenshoots and are taking these learnings into our Mother's Day campaign, which I'll touch on shortly. 
Turning to digital. During the quarter, we continued to drive momentum online, achieving approximately 50% revenue growth through a combination of engagement with existing customers and the recruitment of new consumers. In fact, we attracted nearly 300,000 new customers through our e-commerce channels in North America, a meaningful increase compared to last year. Importantly, these customers entering the brand for the first time are purchasing at a higher AUR compared to the balance, highlighting the brand's compelling value proposition along with a meaningful opportunity to build customer lifetime value. Additionally, we again reengaged lapsed customers at an increasing rate. During Q3, we reactivated over 100,000 customers through our North America digital channels, up approximately 40% compared to last year. This demonstrates our continued progress in strengthening relationships with our core customer. 
Turning to Kate Spade's priorities for summer. First, our focus is on delivering product that supports our brand promise and anchors the assortment to our brand codes. In specialty, we're continuing to reenergize the core leather goods offering through animations within the Knot family. We will also feature newness in the Sam nylon bag, an icon of the brand. In outlet, we will continue to expand our core saffiano assortment. We will also focus on fun storytelling groups such as the Strawberry collection and the Butterfly bag, which, as mentioned, are off to a solid start and generating excitement on social media. Across channels, we will continue to evolve our novelty offering with playful picnic theme product aimed to drive emotional purchasing. 
In marketing, our approach remains multidimensional, utilizing a wide range of digital platforms and influencers to tell our brand and product stories to engage with consumers and our community. As I mentioned, we were pleased with the results from our first male gifting campaign in the third quarter. Therefore, we're applying the learnings to our Mother's Day marketing, which features celebrities and athletes including Rob Gronkowski, Stephen Twitch Foss and Leslie Adam Jr. In addition, we're returning to marketing infused with storytelling, which is at the core of the brand's DNA. In fact, the summer campaign will feature joyful videos highlighted by a spontaneous dance taking place in the middle of New York City. This content is dynamic and optimistic, well-timed with consumers' increasing focus on celebrating the impending return to normalcy. 
Importantly, as announced in March, we redesigned Kate Spade's creative structure, and the team is energized by this new way of working. We believe these changes will help to sharpen our focus on the consumer, drive innovation and increase collaboration. This builds on the brand's heritage and strength as a storytelling brand with marketing and product design, developing and lockstep. 
In closing, I'm very encouraged by Kate Spade's results in the quarter, which reinforced the progress we're making through increased clarity of the brand's positioning and enhancements to our product and marketing, underpinned by a powerful platform of data analytics and digital capabilities. This is evidenced by new customer recruitment and lapsed customer reactivation as well as increasing handbag AUR and improving top and bottom line trends. I remain excited for the brand's future and the meaningful opportunity we have to accelerate revenue and profit growth. 
Turning now to Stuart Weitzman. The brand demonstrated continued progress through the execution of the acceleration program. Total revenue rose 13% compared to prior year, led by growth in China. This growth was partially offset by softness in wholesale, which included the negative impact of shipment timing into the fourth quarter as well as headwinds related to market exits and unprofitable store closures. Importantly, our strategic actions resulted in a significant operating margin expansion compared to both fiscal year '20 and fiscal year '19 as we continue to focus on restoring the brand's profitability. 
During the quarter, we remained focused on building relevance within the assortment. In keeping with market trends, elevated casual products represented the majority of our offering. We expanded on proven, successful product families in brand codes, namely the evolution of the 50-50 boot, the return of the jelly with the Sawyer sandal and the expansion of our signature Pearl embellishments with the Goldie family. At the same time, we reduced SKU count by over 50% globally, driving higher productivity and clearer messaging to our consumers. 
In digital, revenue increased over 50% compared to prior year as we leverage the Tapestry platform and sharpened our focus on creating relevant assortments to engage with our core consumers. 
As mentioned, China remained a significant area of growth for the brand, increasing over 130% compared to fiscal year '20 and approximately 45% versus pre-pandemic levels. This performance was driven by strong growth in new and younger customers, which supports our confidence in the long-term potential for the Stuart Weitzman brand in China. 
Touching on global marketing. We generated brand heat with optimistic marketing messages. Most notably, our campaign featuring Serena Williams and her daughter, Olympia, was a huge success garnering over 8 billion impressions, making it the most impactful campaign in the brand's history. 
In wholesale, we continue to strengthen our partnerships with key accounts. We were pleased with our reentry into 90 Nordstrom doors in the quarter, including an expanded assortment in the top 20 locations. 
Looking ahead to summer. In product, we are well positioned with a focused assortment, which will emphasize dress styles, including a range of sandals and pumps along with our bridal collection. As we have shared, we expect an increase in vaccine distribution to drive an improvement in demand for these key categories, and we have adjusted our offering to reflect this shift. At the same time, we will continue to provide balance with newness in our casual assortment to address the ongoing trend in the market. 
In marketing, our upcoming campaigns are focused on key product messages, including our espadrilles, bridal and limited edition capsules. We are also prioritizing investment in upper funnel activities aim to recruit new customers into our full-price channels. And in China, we are continuing our successful live streams with daily events planned, which will feature an array of hosts, including our sales associates and KOLs, such as Austin Lee, to build emotional connections with our customers. 
Overall, we've made important progress at Stuart Weitzman, and we remain focused on restoring the brand's profitability. 
In closing, at Tapestry, we are increasingly optimistic about our ability to generate sustainable top and bottom line growth building on our performance to date. Looking forward, while the environment remains volatile, we see encouraging signs of recovery as vaccination efforts progress resulting in increased consumer confidence, strong demand for our categories and improving in-store traffic trends. In this context, we remain focused on driving brand relevance and customer engagement through product innovation and compelling marketing, supported by data-driven insights. We will also continue to lean into our competitive advantages, including our globally diversified direct-to-consumer model and distort investments to high-growth opportunities. We are confident that our clear consumer-centric strategy, powerful brands and differentiated scalable platform uniquely position us to capture market share at higher levels of profitability. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Andrea for a detailed discussion of our financial results and outlook. Andrea?"
526573,712240434,2272306,"Tapestry, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, May 06, 2021",2021-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Tapestry, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Joanne, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin, please keep in mind that my comments are based on non-GAAP results.

Before I begin, please keep in mind that my comments are based on non-GAAP results. Corresponding GAAP results and the related reconciliation can be found in the earnings release posted on our website today. 
As Joanne mentioned, our performance in the third quarter and year-to-date was well ahead of our expectations as we drove operating income growth ahead of both FY '20 and FY '19 levels despite the volatile backdrop. Total sales increased 19% from the prior year and well-outpaced our projections. Compared to FY '19, revenue declined 4%, representing a sequential improvement from the prior quarter. Importantly, we were pleased with Coach's returned to prepandemic levels of sales in the quarter. 
By region, North America drove the improvement compared to the prior quarter on a 2-year basis as trends accelerated across stores, e-commerce and wholesale channels. In addition, the region achieved sales in line with FY '19 despite continued store traffic pressures. In Asia, direct sales increased approximately 40% compared to FY '20 and were in line with FY '19, fueled by significant gains in Greater China. Across the balance of Asia, sales remain below pre-pandemic levels with notable pressure in Japan given the declaration of a state of emergency during the quarter. Europe, while a small portion of our total sales experienced a material slowdown in the business given the significant increase in lockdowns in accordance with government regulations. 
By channel, performance was driven by another quarter of triple-digit growth in e-commerce as we continue to build our digital platform and capabilities, which enable us to lean into the opportunity to meet the consumer wherever they want to shop. 
In our global bricks-and-mortar channel, while revenue pressures continued, we were pleased with the trend improvement compared to the prior year as traffic levels started to recover, aided by the dissemination of the vaccine. 
In wholesale, while the channel remained below prior year and FY '19, trends improved, reflecting, in part, the significant growth of our duty-free business in China's Hainan province. Importantly, our momentum continued into April, and as Joanne mentioned, we're increasingly confident in the trajectory of our business as the consumer backdrop improves. 
Moving down the P&L, we realized another quarter of strong gross margin expansion compared to prior year with all brands exceeding our expectations. Tapestry's gross margin rose 450 basis points year-over-year and 240 basis points compared to FY '19 as we successfully executed our strategy to maintain price discipline, reduce SKU counts and leverage data analytics to tailor our product assortment and marketing messaging to the consumer. 
Coach drove the total company margin increase in the third quarter, realizing gross margin 490 basis points above last year, driven by lower levels of promotion and higher IMUs, resulting in higher AUR. At Kate Spade, gross margin rose 150 basis points, which included a benefit from the strategic pullback in lower-margin disposition sales along with lower levels of promotional activity in North America. For Stuart Weitzman, the brand's gross margin was 420 basis points, reflecting a tailwind from FX as well as a geographic mix benefit due to the strong growth in the high-margin China business. 
SG&A declined 3% year-over-year and 6% compared to FY '19, primarily reflecting effective expense management and the previously announced actions to transform the company's operating model. The savings from these structural changes were partially offset by reinvestments in the business, notably higher marketing spend and an increase in our annual incentive plan expense accrual given our outperformance year-to-date. 
Taken together, we delivered the third consecutive quarter of operating income growth and margin expansion compared to prepandemic levels in the face of the challenging backdrop. Our outperformance in both the third quarter and year-to-date reflect the foundational changes and strategies we have made as part of our acceleration program highlighted by efficiency-led profit growth through increases in gross margin and reductions in SG&A. 
Looking forward, we believe we can fuel continued momentum across our brands and are well positioned to transition the company to a period of demand-driven gains, fully unlocking the flywheel of sustainable long-term growth. 
Earnings per diluted share for the quarter was $0.51, a significant increase compared to a loss in the prior year and 21% ahead of pre-pandemic EPS levels. 
Now moving to distribution. We continue to optimize our global fleet to prioritize profitability. For Tapestry, we closed a net of 49 locations globally year-to-date, including 31 net closures in Q3 alone, representing a net of 94 closures as compared to the prior year. 
Turning to our discussion of our balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter in a strong position with $1.7 billion in cash and equivalents and total borrowings of $1.6 billion. Consistent with our stated near-term priorities and as previously shared, we utilized our free cash flow to pay down the remaining $200 million balance on our revolver at the beginning of the quarter. Therefore, at this time, there are no longer any borrowings outstanding under our revolver. 
Total inventory ended the quarter 18% below last year, reflecting, in part, deliberate actions to reduce SKU count and prioritize inventory turns. Due to our sales outperformance in the quarter, the [ IMU ] inventory balance was below our expectations. 
As previously discussed, like many others across all industries, we are experiencing some continuing distribution network disruption related to COVID-19, causing shipping capacity constraints and port congestion globally. As a result, we are experiencing longer lead times, which, in turn, have delayed the timing of receipts notably for product coming in through West Coast ports and may limit our ability to chase higher levels of demand going forward should it materialize. Separately, the widely reported Suez Canal blockage will have a modest impact on our fourth quarter results. In addition, we expect to continue to incur higher freight costs due to the environment. Importantly, these factors have been contemplated in our outlook, which I will address shortly. 
CapEx for the quarter was $19 million, a decline of 62% versus prior year as we continue to prioritize investments in high-return projects, notably in digital, while tightly controlling overall spend and reducing our outlay for new stores. We now expect CapEx to be in the area of $100 million for FY '21 based on our favorable year-to-date actualization and the timing of capital projects. Free cash flow for the quarter was an inflow of $179 million, as compared to an outflow of $166 million last year. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow was an inflow of $876 million versus $273 million during the same period a year ago, and $418 million year-to-date in FY '19. Our strong cash flow generation underscores the resilience and effective management of our brands and business. 
Now touching on our capital allocation priorities. As noted, the strength of our business and resulting free cash flow generation positioned us to pay down our revolver as of January. In the near term, we will continue to preserve our cash on hand while reinvesting in the business. Longer term, our objectives remain unchanged. Our strategic intent is to return to sustainable top and bottom line growth driving continued strong free cash flow generation, which will enable us to pay down debt as well as return capital to shareholders. 
Now turning to our outlook. As noted in our release, given our strong performance year-to-date and assuming a continuation of the recovery from the pandemic, we now project revenue to increase the mid-teens rate on both a 52-week and 53-week basis for the fiscal year. This includes the expectation for fiscal fourth quarter to sales to increase in the area of 110% as compared to prior year, thereby approaching FY '19 levels of revenue on a 13-week basis. As previously mentioned, the fourth quarter will also include the impact of an additional week, which is projected to contribute approximately $100 million in incremental sales. 
Turning to gross margin. We continue to expect significant expansion for the full year, reflecting our deliberate actions to lower promotional activity and drive higher AUR. Consistent with our original expectations, we anticipate moderate fourth quarter gross margin pressure compared to prior year due to geographic mix headwinds as we anniversary the atypical comparison due to COVID-19. That said, this forecast implies that gross margin will be meaningfully above prepandemic levels. 
Touching on SG&A, we continue to estimate that we will realize approximately $300 million in gross run rate expense savings, including approximately $200 million in gross savings in FY '21 alone. This reflects the steps we have taken to aggressively control spending and implement structural changes to drive efficiency. Keep in mind, given our incremental investments and the increased level of variable costs associated with the higher sales forecast, we would expect our net savings to be substantially lower. In Q4, we are projecting SG&A to increase over 40% on a 13-week basis versus FY '20, reflecting higher investments, notably in marketing as well as the impact of lapping depressed expense levels from a year ago as a result of COVID-19, which included the benefit from the cancellation of the company's annual incentive plan. Taken together, we are now expecting EPS to exceed pre-pandemic levels on a 52-week basis. This reflects our outperformance year-to-date as well as a more favorable outlook for the balance of the year given our confidence in the ongoing benefits of our acceleration program, the improving consumer backdrop as well as the traction we're seeing in the business today. 
In closing, we're proud of the results we have achieved despite the volatile environment, demonstrating strength of our iconic brands and the bold and deliberate actions we are taking as part of our acceleration program. Throughout this year, our results have been driven by efficiency-led gains. As we turn the corner and look towards recovery from the pandemic, we have an opportunity to fully unlock the flywheel to drive bottom line growth in excess of top line gains over our planning horizon. We are confident that the foundational changes we have made during this fiscal year will benefit our platform over the long term, and we remain steadfast in our strategic intent to drive both organic growth and profitability.

But starting with confidence, we have increasing confidence in our Tapestry platform. We see it as a competitive advantage. We're also gaining confidence in the power of our brands and the potential that we see in the acceleration program, including the execution from our talented teams around the globe. 
Our year-to-date results have definitely increased our confidence in the strategy despite the volatile backdrop, our teams continue to deliver, and we're building a foundation for sustainable long-term growth. We're getting closer to the consumer, remaining into digital and leveraging data in better ways, and we have a streamlined operating model. But we are also seeing the backdrop improve. We're seeing encouraging signs of recovery, we've seen vaccination efforts progressing, resulting in increasing consumer confidence, strong demand for our categories and improving in-store traffic trends. 
And I think to your question that begs the question of what do we see in digital with those increasing trends? And our approach to our digital business is really being laser-focused on meeting the consumers where they want to shop. We're focused on the omnichannel experiences with digital and stores contributing to our success, and that's an important qualifier. Digital, we see as an and, not an or. We're acquiring new younger customers through these channels. And we are seeing the ongoing strength of our digital business, even as stores begin to reopen and traffic begins to build back to historic levels. We've seen another quarter of triple-digit growth, while also driving sequential improvement in store trends. So we're encouraged by that performance as we see traffic starting to come back -- I should say, starting to come back.

This is supported by the fact that our new customer recruitment has fueled our strong digital growth. In fact, as Joanne mentioned, in the quarter, we added another 400,000 new customers from our e-commerce platforms, bringing the year-to-date number of new customers from these channels to 2 million in North America. And what is really encouraging, of these 2 million, approximately half are Gen Z and millennial. 
And then when I return to brick-and-mortar, if I take Texas as an example, we experienced a significant acceleration in our store sales trends, while, at the same time, we see the restrictions being lifted. And while those restrictions are being lifted, our digital traffic and demand trends remain strong. So this bodes really well for our future as we see a return to traffic in North America brick-and-mortar."

We do see the digital business being accretive to our operating margins currently. Our digital business is quite profitable. It's structurally more profitable than their respective bricks-and-mortar channels. And it's really a function of the fact that we have structurally higher AURs, high margins and relatively low returns in that channel. So we consistently deliver higher margins through our digital performance. And I think it's also important to mention that for, as Todd said, recruiting new customers and engaging new customers through our digital channels. So that makes the channel accretive as well. 
And in terms of where we see the penetration going, ultimately, the customer will decide. We're very focused on meeting the customer where they are. And I think we've been innovating quite well in terms of our ability to engage consumers, both digitally and on social channels with real innovations on TikTok, as an example, capturing customers where they are today. And we're committed to staying close to the customer and seeing how that unfolds. 
Having said that, our brick-and-mortar business, also, we're really pleased to see the operating margins of our brick-and-mortar business this quarter achieve pre-pandemic levels -- exceed prepandemic levels this quarter. So that also bodes well for our business, really driven by the gross margin gains that we've seen. And we expect that as traffic builds back, those numbers will also improve. 
So we see digital as accretive where it lands in terms of penetration. Ultimately, the customer will decide and we're focused on driving improved profitability in our brick-and-mortar channel as well."

On sustainability, Joanne can talk about the Tapestry sustainability, but I see this as a really interesting opportunity for the Coach brand. As an 80-year-old brand, particularly one grounded in leather, we have opportunities to talk in a really authentic way about sustainability. And we've done some interesting things. On Earth Day, we brought forward a handful of bags, which we call reloved, which were bags that were literally returned, unusable over many years, we couldn't repair them. And what we did was our designers and our workshop reconstructed them basically. And the bags that we put up online on Earth Day is sold out in an hour. And the demand for them were incredibly strong. So as we start thinking about and talking about sustainability and what it means for each of our brands, particularly at the Coach brand, I see opportunities in this relove concept, in the -- something else we've done, which is basically taking scraps and turning it into a weave that creates an entirely new handbag. So I think you're going to see us do some really interesting and innovative opportunities.

In the third quarter, our handbag AUR rose approximately 25%, both globally and in North America. 
And as Joanne indicated, so much of this is deliberate actions that we've taken about how we're looking at things differently. First, it starts with incredibly strong innovative product led by Stuart Dever's creative direction. We then couple that with using data to inform our decision-making and really, really put the consumer at the center. And the SKU reduction is helping driving AUR. And let me give you a quick example. If you take Tabby, which right now is our #1 family in our retail fleet, Tabby originally launched in July of '19. Entire years, what would have happened by the time we got to February of '21, we would have been bored with it and tired and moved on. Instead, we recognize what an incredible family -- iconic family we have, and we relaunched it with Pillow Tabby, bringing the entire Tabby family back to the #1 position in our fleet. So this elongation and -- of the life cycle of an iconic family helps us raise our AURs, helps us reduce our SKU counts and helps create greater gross margin and profitability. And I think you're going to see us do that over and over again."

And that's really been accomplished through the focus on the consumer, leveraging digital and data and transformation into a leaner organization. And we feel we're exiting the pandemic even stronger positioned to take market share at higher levels of profitability. 
We're not providing detailed guidance by brand. But to your point, Coach, this year, will already be at a best-in-class op margin in and around 30-ish percent. And we still think that we'll have digital and China being the revenue drivers. So our opportunities at Coach are really around opportunity to grow the top line and maintain attractive margin. These are excellent margins already. 
Kate Spade, where we've clarified our brand position and better execution to deliver for our customers, we have an opportunity to drive both top and bottom line growth. I think we're in, I would say, early innings, and this will be a meaningful Tapestry growth driver over the planning horizon. 
And then lastly, when we look at Stuart Weitzman, our priority there has and continues to be a return to profitability, and we're making great progress. We're leaning into our strength in China, which obviously has very strong margins, we've exited quite a number of unprofitable doors and geographies, and we've strengthened our position in North America, including in wholesale.

I think you're absolutely right when you're looking at Lorraine at the upside to the gross margin will primarily now come from Kate Spade, where we are, as I mentioned, in the early innings. We do have the benefit of China growing for all of our brands and having that be this gross margin anywhere in the world, and that will continue.

Thank you, Christina, and welcome, everyone. As you read in our press release, Tapestry reported a standout quarter, which once again outpaced expectations, reflecting the successful execution of our acceleration program and the power of our brands. Our sharpened focus on the consumer-fueled new customer acquisition at Coach, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman, contributing to a continued sequential improvement in overall top line trends. Revenue growth in the quarter was led by robust increases in digital and China, 2 areas of meaningful long-term opportunity. 
In addition, for the third consecutive quarter, we achieved operating income and EPS gains, both compared to prior year and to pre-pandemic fiscal year '19, supported by a reduction in promotional activity and higher AUR as well as disciplined expense management. We also generated significant free cash flow in the quarter, demonstrating our financial strength and flexibility. 
This performance is a testament to our talented teams around the world. Their creativity, agility and resilience have enabled us to effectively navigate a challenging backdrop and deliver for our customers, while positioning Tapestry to emerge from the pandemic stronger and build on our recent momentum to drive sustainable growth. 
Before turning to a discussion of our strategic pillars, I want to touch on the leadership changes we've announced in recent weeks. I'm delighted with the team that we brought together, which combines deep knowledge of our company with fresh perspectives as we position Tapestry to win in the dynamic retail and consumer environment. 
Todd Kahn, who was appointed Coach CEO, has a unique balance of brand stewardship and commercial capabilities and has done a tremendous job leading Coach and delivering exceptional results. Andrea Resnick is a proven leader who ensured that we successfully executed on our acceleration program as interim CFO, and we're excited that she will now assume a new role as Chief Communications Officer, where we know she'll continue to make important contributions to our company. As such, Christina Colone, who has tremendous credibility and experience with the investment community has been promoted to Global Head of Investor Relations. 
Finally, I'm thrilled to have Scott Roe join us in June as Chief Financial Officer and Head of Strategy. With his extensive experience in consumer, retail and apparel businesses, as well as his deep expertise developing best-in-class global multi-brand platforms, I'm confident he is the right strategic business partner to further enhance our strategy and financial performance. 
With this strong leadership team now in place, we are galvanized around our shared commitment to fully realized Tapestry's growth potential across brands as well as our passion for building a purpose-led organization with empowered inclusive and highly collaborative teams. 
Now I'll discuss the important progress we've made advancing our acceleration program during the third quarter. First, we continue to create immersive customer experiences across our e-commerce and social channels, driving our global digital business to over $1.5 billion in revenue on a trailing 12-month basis, more than doubling in size from a year ago. 
During the quarter, we generated triple-digit e-commerce growth, bringing digital sales to approximately 30% of total revenue as compared to a mid-teens percentage last year. This growth was led by the recruitment of approximately 700,000 new customers across brands through our e-commerce channels in North America, where we're continuing to capture a growing number of millennial and Gen Z customers. And not only did we successfully recruit new customers, we also drove a higher purchase frequency versus prior year across brands. 
We also continued to reactivate lapsed customers across the portfolio. This reflects the work we've done to crystallize the unique positioning of our brands while strengthening our platform to better utilize data to support more targeted marketing campaigns. 
Overall, we remain incredibly excited by the digital opportunity and the scalable Tapestry omnichannel platform we're building. Digital is a key competitive advantage and a growth enabler for us long term, supporting both revenue growth and profit gains, particularly given that our digital business is accretive to our operating margin. 
Second, our ongoing efforts to sharpen our focus on the Chinese consumer led to significant growth in China as compared to both prior year and pre-pandemic levels. In fact, the strength of our results in Mainland China more than offset continued pressure from lower Chinese tourist spend with our sales-to-Chinese consumers globally increasing at a high single-digit rate compared to pre-pandemic levels. These results benefited from the integrated, comprehensive brand-building strategies, which drove innovative products, marketing and experiences. 
Third, we're strengthening our platform and changing the way we work to increase our agility and responsiveness. A key element of the strategy is embedding data across the organization, allowing each brand to leverage the shared resource to drive more effective decision-making. 
In the quarter, we utilized these capabilities to deepen our understanding of customer preferences and behaviors. This enhanced our processes, ultimately driving significant gross margin expansion and higher AUR, specifically by supporting optimized assortment planning, which helped to affect a 30% to 50% reduction in SKU counts across brands, resulting in higher productivity per SKU, driving inventory turn and providing clearer messaging to the consumer. 
And we leverage data analytics to drive more dynamic and informed pricing decisions, supporting lower levels of promotional activity. Overall, we believe the use of data is powering a shift in our culture, creating a robust test-and-learn environment that empowers our teams to move quickly to respond to changes in consumer preferences and demand. 
Fourth, we continue to drive operational efficiencies in our business. We further enhanced the flexibility of our operating model through the optimization of our global fleet. As you know, our focus is to improve profitability across our store network. We've made substantial progress. And in fact, the operating margin for our global bricks-and-mortar business exceeded pre-pandemic fiscal year '19 levels despite the challenging backdrop. 
We see further opportunity going forward as we remain focused on delivering compelling omnichannel experiences with both digital and stores contributing to our success. This is clearly evidenced by the ongoing strength we're seeing in our digital channels even as our brick-and-mortar business improves. 
Overall, I'm very pleased with the continued improvements we've realized under our acceleration program. Based on our results to date and assuming a continued recovery emerging from the pandemic, we now expect to exceed pre-pandemic levels of operating income and EPS for the fiscal year, far surpassing our original expectations provided in August. 
Importantly, the changes we have made are foundational. As we embed a consumer-centric approach into our organization, unlock new ways of working and distort our focus to high-return initiatives, we're establishing sustainable growth drivers for Tapestry and our brands. 
Now let me touch on our results and strategies for Coach, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman. Starting with Coach, where results were once again impressive. Revenue exceeded our expectations with sales improving sequentially, increasing 25% as compared to last year and returning to pre-pandemic levels, an important milestone for the brand. In addition, we continued to significantly expand gross margin and leverage SG&A, resulting in strong operating margin expansion and substantial profit gains. 
There were many highlights from the third quarter guided by our strategic priorities, which drove our positive results. First, we delivered compelling and innovative products with a focus on reinvigorating key families that are foundational to the brand. In retail, we successfully built on our core icons, infusing newness that is resonating with consumers. 
We introduced Pillow Tabby, a fresh take on a bestselling family, which was very well received, particularly with new younger customers. We also launched extensions within the Beat and Willow families, which outperformed plan. In outlet, we expanded the top-selling Georgie and Dempsey families to include new styles and fabrics, which performed well at higher AURs. Overall, we are building enduring icons, which respond to the emotional and functional needs of our target consumers and help to create a strong foundation for our product pipeline in future seasons. 
We also continued to deliver strong gross margin expansion through deliberate actions. As anticipated, we significantly reduced the number of SKUs in our offering across channels, providing more focused, impactful assortments and clearer messages to consumers. Importantly, we also continue to be disciplined in our approach to promotions. Consistent with our strategy, we're shifting the customer's focus to the value, attributes and quality of the Coach product. In fact, our handbag AUR rose over 25%, both globally and in North America. 
These results are not possible without great product. I want to take a minute to recognize our talented design and merchandising teams who, under Stuart Vevers' creative direction, continue to deliver product innovation with a focus on quality that has infused energy and excitement into our assortments and delivered exceptional value to customers across all channels. 
Turning to marketing. We continue to build deeper customer relationships, leaning into our values of inclusivity and authenticity through our campaigns and digital content, which are driving increased engagement, recruitment and reactivation. Two key examples are Coach It Forward, which featured our global ambassador, sharing personal messages of gratitude and our YouTube series, Coach Conversations, which provided a forum to discuss culture, community and creativity and engage audiences through authentic dialogue. These campaigns increased engagement, creating buzz across social media platforms. 
In digital, Coach again realized triple-digit revenue growth. We recruited roughly 400,000 new customers through our North America digital channels, representing a significant increase compared to last year. These new customers who are increasingly younger are helping to fuel the strong growth we're delivering online. In addition to customer acquisition, we also focused on driving retention and lifetime value through a number of actions, including the recent launch of the Coach outlet loyalty program. 
Overall, we see significant runway to realize continued digital growth while improving our brick-and-mortar productivity. This is reinforced by the trends we're seeing in the business as stores have reopened. Specifically, in the U.S., we've seen continued strong demand online even amid easing restrictions and improving brick-and-mortar traffic. 
Moving on to China. Revenue on the Mainland rose significantly compared to last year and approximately 40% compared to pre-pandemic levels. In addition, we recaptured tourist demand through the China duty free channel as consumers increasingly shift to domestic travel. 
To celebrate the Chinese New Year, we featured a playful ox across our limited edition collection, which drove e-commerce growth, including on Tmall. As we previously shared, in February, we were the first luxury brand to launch an e-commerce platform on Douyin, the TikTok of China. Our results thus far, have well outpaced our expectations, with the majority of customers transacting with us entering the brand for the first time. 
Now looking ahead to summer. We are building on our momentum into the fourth quarter with key product launches, while continuing to sharpen our merchandising strategy to deliver innovative and emotionally compelling collections. In retail, we are expanding our signature offering into new and bright colorways of jacquard to infuse optimism into the assortment. 
We're also excited for a new combination of our Signature C and Horse & Carriage logos, bringing together 2 icons on our best-selling Beat and fields families. In addition, to capitalize on trends in the market, we are introducing our Coach Originals in a new quilted version, named Coach Quilties, which will be offered in seasonal colors. 
Separately, following the success of our Pillow Tabby, we recently introduced a mini version, which is already off to a promising start. In fact, over the last 3 months, we've seen an increase in viral user-generated content on TikTok featuring the Pillow Tabby. In outlet, we launched a Disney Princesses collaboration in April, which is outperforming our expectations. And for Mother's Day, we plan to deliver a floral-focused collection for the important holiday. 
Turning to marketing. We are excited to host a Winter '21 collection runway show in Shanghai in June. We believe this will support our growth ambitions both in China and globally by driving desire for the Coach brand and broadening our reach through partnerships with a diversified group of ambassadors, celebrities and key opinion leaders. The collection will feature exclusive products for the Chinese market, and we'll amplify the show through integrated guest experiences, including live streaming. 
In summary, we believe Coach's return to pre-pandemic levels of sales and significant profit growth is a standout achievement, particularly given the challenging backdrop. We are building on this momentum and the foundational changes we've made this year as we head into the fourth quarter and beyond. We're proud to celebrate the brand's 80th anniversary this year and are confident in the future. 
Now moving to Kate Spade. The brand, again, outperformed expectations in the quarter from both a top and bottom line perspective, highlighting the progress we've made through strong execution. Revenue improved sequentially, increasing 1% compared to fiscal year '20, which included a 6-point impact from the wholesale business, inclusive of the strategic pullback in the disposition channel. We delivered gross margin expansion of 150 basis points, well ahead of our projections, while also reducing SG&A, resulting in operating income growth and operating margin expansion versus last year. 
There are many key strategic milestones of the quarter, highlighting the traction we're making as we continue to fulfill the brand's promise and build stronger connections with consumers, starting with product. In retail, we made further progress on rebuilding our core as exemplified through the strength of our recently launched families. The Knot collection, which featured new colorways was particularly well received by our younger customer. We also expanded our signature platform, the spade flower, with the jacquard fabric continuing to outperform expectations. 
The success of these introductions supports our momentum and reinforces our ability to sustain higher AURs by offering differentiated, innovative designs. Additionally, our novelty assortment, which reflects a return to our roots, continue to resonate with our customers, notably our mailbox, crab and strawberry milk carton bags. 
In outlet, we saw continued traction in Saffiano leather styles. We also brought in new crossbody options in keeping with the hands-free trend. Importantly, we leveraged data to inform our assortment breadth and pricing strategies, reducing our SKU counts by over 40% and remaining disciplined in our promotions, which drove an increase in global handbag AUR in both our specialty and outlet channels compared to last year. 
Outside of handbags, we saw strength in footwear across channels. In fact, footwear delivered positive growth, driven by casual flats and sneakers as we continue to build momentum into the summer selling season. In addition, tech accessories continued to outperform, while the launch of our new fragrance in North America outpaced expectations. These categories, which are foundational to the brand's unique lifestyle positioning, are also important for customer recruitment and cross-selling.  
Turning to marketing. We drove brand heat, both through our lifestyle campaigns as well as organically on social media through our passionate Kate Spade community. To that end, we continue to drive organic engagement in the quarter with 2 more handbags going viral on TikTok from customer-created content. 
Following videos created post purchase, the Strawberry handbag and the Butterfly Wing crossbody have garnered approximately 12 million views to date on the platform with excitement spreading to other social channels. As a result, we saw increased site searches for these products, driving significant uptick in sales. This highlights the importance of social selling through the loyal and passionate members of the Kate Spade community.  
We also saw success with our first-ever male gifting campaign, which featured NBA star Kevin Love for Valentine's Day and fueled an increase in conversion among male shoppers. We're excited by these green shoots and are taking these learnings into our Mother's Day campaign, which I'll touch on shortly. 
Turning to digital. During the quarter, we continued to drive momentum online, achieving approximately 50% revenue growth through a combination of engagement with existing customers and the recruitment of new consumers. In fact, we attracted nearly 300,000 new customers through our e-commerce channels in North America, a meaningful increase compared to last year. Importantly, these customers entering the brand for the first time are purchasing at a higher AUR compared to the balance, highlighting the brand's compelling value proposition along with a meaningful opportunity to build customer lifetime value. 
Additionally, we again reengaged lapsed customers at an increasing rate. During Q3, we reactivated over 100,000 customers through our North America digital channels, up approximately 40% compared to last year. This demonstrates our continued progress in strengthening relationships with our core customer.  
Turning to Kate Spade's priorities for summer. First, our focus is on delivering product that supports our brand promise and anchors the assortment to our brand codes. In specialty, we're continuing to reenergize the core leather goods offering through animations within the Knot family. We will also feature newness in the Sam Nylon bag, an icon of the brand. In outlet, we will continue to expand our core Saffiano assortment. 
We will also focus on fun storytelling groups such as the Strawberry collection and the Butterfly bag, which, as mentioned, are off to a solid start and generating excitement on social media. Across channels, we will continue to evolve our novelty offering with playful picnic-themed product aimed to drive emotional purchasing. 
In marketing, our approach remains multidimensional, utilizing a wide range of digital platforms and influencers to tell our brand and product stories to engage with consumers and our community. As I mentioned, we were pleased with the results from our first male gifting campaign in the third quarter. Therefore, we're applying the learnings to our Mother's Day marketing, which features celebrities and athletes including Rob Gronkowski, Stephen tWitch Boss and Leslie Odom, Jr. 
In addition, we're returning to marketing infused with storytelling, which is at the core of the brand's DNA. In fact, the summer campaign will feature joyful videos highlighted by a spontaneous dance taking place in the middle of New York City. This content is dynamic and optimistic, well-timed with consumers' increasing focus on celebrating the impending return to normalcy.
Importantly, as announced in March, we redesigned Kate Spade's creative structure, and the team is energized by this new way of working. We believe these changes will help to sharpen our focus on the consumer, drive innovation and increase collaboration. This builds on the brand's heritage and strength as a storytelling brand, with marketing and product design, developing in lockstep. 
In closing, I'm very encouraged by Kate Spade's results in the quarter, which reinforced the progress we're making through increased clarity of the brand's positioning and enhancements to our product and marketing, underpinned by a powerful platform of data analytics and digital capabilities. This is evidenced by new customer recruitment and lapsed customer reactivation as well as increasing handbag AUR and improving top and bottom line trends. I remain excited for the brand's future and the meaningful opportunity we have to accelerate revenue and profit growth. 
Turning now to Stuart Weitzman. The brand demonstrated continued progress through the execution of the acceleration program. Total revenue rose 13% compared to prior year, led by growth in China. This growth was partially offset by softness in wholesale, which included the negative impact of shipment timing into the fourth quarter as well as headwinds related to market exits and unprofitable store closures. Importantly, our strategic actions resulted in a significant operating margin expansion compared to both fiscal year '20 and fiscal year '19 as we continue to focus on restoring the brand's profitability. 
During the quarter, we remained focused on building relevance within the assortment. In keeping with market trends, elevated casual products represented the majority of our offering. We expanded on proven, successful product families in brand codes, namely the evolution of the 5050 boot, the return of the jelly with the Sawyer sandal and the expansion of our signature pearl embellishments with the Goldie family. At the same time, we reduced SKU count by over 50% globally, driving higher productivity and clearer messaging to our consumers. 
In digital, revenue increased over 50% compared to prior year as we leverage the Tapestry platform and sharpened our focus on creating relevant assortments to engage with our core consumers. As mentioned, China remained a significant area of growth for the brand, increasing over 130% compared to fiscal year '20 and approximately 45% versus pre-pandemic levels. This performance was driven by strong growth in new and younger customers, which supports our confidence in the long-term potential for the Stuart Weitzman brand in China.  
Touching on global marketing. We generated brand heat with optimistic marketing messages. Most notably, our campaign featuring Serena Williams and her daughter, Olympia, was a huge success garnering over 8 billion impressions, making it the most impactful campaign in the brand's history. 
In wholesale, we continue to strengthen our partnerships with key accounts. We were pleased with our reentry into 90 Nordstrom doors in the quarter, including an expanded assortment in the top 20 locations. 
Looking ahead to summer. In product, we are well positioned with a focused assortment, which will emphasize dress styles, including a range of sandals and pumps along with our bridal collection. As we have shared, we expect an increase in vaccine distribution to drive an improvement in demand for these key categories, and we have adjusted our offering to reflect this shift. At the same time, we will continue to provide balance with newness in our casual assortment to address the ongoing trend in the market.  
In marketing, our upcoming campaigns are focused on key product messages, including our espadrilles, bridal and limited edition capsules. We are also prioritizing investment in upper funnel activities aim to recruit new customers into our full-price channels. And in China, we are continuing our successful live streams, with daily events planned, which will feature an array of hosts, including our sales associates and KOLs, such as Austin Li, to build emotional connections with our customers. Overall, we've made important progress at Stuart Weitzman, and we remain focused on restoring the brand's profitability. 
In closing, at Tapestry, we are increasingly optimistic about our ability to generate sustainable top and bottom line growth building on our performance to date. Looking forward, while the environment remains volatile, we see encouraging signs of recovery as vaccination efforts progress resulting in increased consumer confidence, strong demand for our categories and improving in-store traffic trends. 
In this context, we remain focused on driving brand relevance and customer engagement through product innovation and compelling marketing, supported by data-driven insights. We will also continue to lean into our competitive advantages, including our globally diversified direct-to-consumer model and distort investments to high-growth opportunities. We are confident that our clear consumer-centric strategy, powerful brands and differentiated scalable platform uniquely position us to capture market share at higher levels of profitability. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Andrea for a detailed discussion of our financial results and outlook. Andrea?"

Before I begin, please keep in mind that my comments are based on non-GAAP results. Corresponding GAAP results and the related reconciliation can be found in the earnings release posted on our website today. 
As Joanne mentioned, our performance in the third quarter and year-to-date was well ahead of our expectations as we drove operating income growth ahead of both FY '20 and FY '19 levels despite the volatile backdrop. Total sales increased 19% from the prior year and well-outpaced our projections. Compared to FY '19, revenue declined 4%, representing a sequential improvement from the prior quarter. Importantly, we were pleased with Coach's returned to pre-pandemic levels of sales in the quarter. 
By region, North America drove the improvement compared to the prior quarter on a 2-year basis as trends accelerated across stores, e-commerce and wholesale channels. In addition, the region achieved sales in line with FY '19 despite continued store traffic pressures. In Asia, direct sales increased approximately 40% compared to FY '20 and were in line with FY '19, fueled by significant gains in Greater China. 
Across the balance of Asia, sales remained below pre-pandemic levels with notable pressure in Japan given the declaration of a state of emergency during the quarter. Europe, while a small portion of our total sales, experienced a material slowdown in the business given the significant increase in lockdowns in accordance with government regulations. 
By channel, performance was driven by another quarter of triple-digit growth in e-commerce as we continue to build our digital platform and capabilities, which enable us to lean into the opportunity to meet the consumer wherever they want to shop. In our global bricks-and-mortar channel, while revenue pressures continued, we were pleased with the trend improvement compared to the prior year as traffic levels started to recover, aided by the dissemination of the vaccine. 
In wholesale, while the channel remained below prior year and FY '19, trends improved, reflecting, in part, the significant growth of our duty-free business in China's Hainan province. Importantly, our momentum continued into April, and as Joanne mentioned, we're increasingly confident in the trajectory of our business as the consumer backdrop improves. 
Moving down the P&L, we realized another quarter of strong gross margin expansion compared to prior year with all brands exceeding our expectations. Tapestry's gross margin rose 450 basis points year-over-year and 240 basis points compared to FY '19 as we successfully executed our strategy to maintain price discipline, reduce SKU counts and leverage data analytics to tailor our product assortment and marketing messaging to the consumer. 
Coach drove the total company margin increase in the third quarter, realizing gross margin 490 basis points above last year, driven by lower levels of promotion and higher IMUs, resulting in higher AUR. At Kate Spade, gross margin rose 150 basis points, which included a benefit from the strategic pullback in lower-margin disposition sales along with lower levels of promotional activity in North America. For Stuart Weitzman, the brand's gross margin was 420 basis points, reflecting a tailwind from FX as well as a geographic mix benefit due to the strong growth in the high-margin China business. 
SG&A declined 3% year-over-year and 6% compared to FY '19, primarily reflecting effective expense management and the previously announced actions to transform the company's operating model. The savings from these structural changes were partially offset by reinvestments in the business, notably higher marketing spend and an increase in our annual incentive plan expense accrual given our outperformance year-to-date. 
Taken together, we delivered the third consecutive quarter of operating income growth and margin expansion compared to pre-pandemic levels in the face of the challenging backdrop. Our outperformance in both the third quarter and year-to-date reflect the foundational changes and strategies we have made as part of our acceleration program, highlighted by efficiency-led profit growth through increases in gross margin and reductions in SG&A. 
Looking forward, we believe we can fuel continued momentum across our brands and are well positioned to transition the company to a period of demand-driven gains, fully unlocking the flywheel of sustainable long-term growth. Earnings per diluted share for the quarter was $0.51, a significant increase compared to a loss in the prior year and 21% ahead of pre-pandemic EPS levels. 
Now moving to distribution. We continue to optimize our global fleet to prioritize profitability. For Tapestry, we closed a net of 49 locations globally year-to-date, including 31 net closures in Q3 alone, representing a net of 94 closures as compared to the prior year. 
Turning to our discussion of our balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter in a strong position with $1.7 billion in cash and equivalents and total borrowings of $1.6 billion. Consistent with our stated near-term priorities and as previously shared, we utilized our free cash flow to pay down the remaining $200 million balance on our revolver at the beginning of the quarter. Therefore, at this time, there are no longer any borrowings outstanding under our revolver. 
Total inventory ended the quarter 18% below last year, reflecting, in part, deliberate actions to reduce SKU count and prioritize inventory turns. Due to our sales outperformance in the quarter, the [ ending ] inventory balance was below our expectations. 
As previously discussed, like many others across all industries, we are experiencing some continuing distribution network disruption related to COVID-19, causing shipping capacity constraints and port congestion globally. As a result, we are experiencing longer lead times, which, in turn, have delayed the timing of receipts notably for product coming in through West Coast ports and may limit our ability to chase higher levels of demand going forward should it materialize. 
Separately, the widely reported Suez Canal blockage will have a modest impact on our fourth quarter results. In addition, we expect to continue to incur higher freight costs due to the environment. Importantly, these factors have been contemplated in our outlook, which I will address shortly. 
CapEx for the quarter was $19 million, a decline of 62% versus prior year as we continue to prioritize investments in high-return projects, notably in digital, while tightly controlling overall spend and reducing our outlay for new stores. We now expect CapEx to be in the area of $100 million for FY '21 based on our favorable year-to-date actualization and the timing of capital projects. Free cash flow for the quarter was an inflow of $179 million, as compared to an outflow of $166 million last year. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow was an inflow of $876 million versus $273 million during the same period a year ago, and $418 million year-to-date in FY '19. Our strong cash flow generation underscores the resilience and effective management of our brands and business. 
Now touching on our capital allocation priorities. As noted, the strength of our business and resulting free cash flow generation positioned us to pay down our revolver as of January. In the near term, we will continue to preserve our cash on hand while reinvesting in the business. Longer term, our objectives remain unchanged. Our strategic intent is to return to sustainable top and bottom line growth driving continued strong free cash flow generation, which will enable us to pay down debt as well as return capital to shareholders. 
Now turning to our outlook. As noted in our release, given our strong performance year-to-date and assuming a continuation of the recovery from the pandemic, we now project revenue to increase the mid-teens rate on both a 52-week and 53-week basis for the fiscal year. This includes the expectation for fiscal fourth quarter to sales to increase in the area of 110% as compared to prior year, thereby approaching FY '19 levels of revenue on a 13-week basis. As previously mentioned, the fourth quarter will also include the impact of an additional week, which is projected to contribute approximately $100 million in incremental sales. 
Turning to gross margin. We continue to expect significant expansion for the full year, reflecting our deliberate actions to lower promotional activity and drive higher AUR. Consistent with our original expectations, we anticipate moderate fourth quarter gross margin pressure compared to prior year due to geographic mix headwinds as we anniversary the atypical comparison due to COVID-19. That said, this forecast implies that gross margin will be meaningfully above pre-pandemic levels. 
Touching on SG&A, we continue to estimate that we will realize approximately $300 million in gross run rate expense savings, including approximately $200 million in gross savings in FY '21 alone. This reflects the steps we have taken to aggressively control spending and implement structural changes to drive efficiency. Keep in mind, given our incremental investments and the increased level of variable costs associated with the higher sales forecast, we would expect our net savings to be substantially lower. 
In Q4, we are projecting SG&A to increase over 40% on a 13-week basis versus FY '20, reflecting higher investments, notably in marketing as well as the impact of lapping depressed expense levels from a year ago as a result of COVID-19, which included the benefit from the cancellation of the company's annual incentive plan. Taken together, we are now expecting EPS to exceed pre-pandemic levels on a 52-week basis. This reflects our outperformance year-to-date as well as a more favorable outlook for the balance of the year given our confidence in the ongoing benefits of our acceleration program, the improving consumer backdrop as well as the traction we're seeing in the business today. 
In closing, we're proud of the results we have achieved despite the volatile environment, demonstrating strength of our iconic brands and the bold and deliberate actions we are taking as part of our acceleration program. Throughout this year, our results have been driven by efficiency-led gains. 
As we turn the corner and look towards recovery from the pandemic, we have an opportunity to fully unlock the flywheel to drive bottom line growth in excess of top line gains over our planning horizon. We are confident that the foundational changes we have made during this fiscal year will benefit our platform over the long term, and we remain steadfast in our strategic intent to drive both organic growth and profitability. 
Thank you. I'd now like to open it up for Q&A."

I'll also touch on what we see in the backdrop and then how we see our digital business evolving. 
But starting with confidence, we have increasing confidence in our Tapestry platform. We see it as a competitive advantage. We're also gaining confidence in the power of our brands and the potential that we see in the acceleration program, including the execution from our talented teams around the globe. 
Our year-to-date results have definitely increased our confidence in the strategy despite the volatile backdrop, our teams continue to deliver, and we're building a foundation for sustainable long-term growth. We're getting closer to the consumer, we're leaning into digital and leveraging data in better ways, and we have a streamlined operating model. But we are also seeing the backdrop improve. We're seeing encouraging signs of recovery, we've seen vaccination efforts progressing, resulting in increasing consumer confidence, strong demand for our categories and improving in-store traffic trends. 
And I think to your question, that begs the question of what do we see in digital with those increasing trends. And our approach to our digital business is really being laser-focused on meeting the consumers where they want to shop. We're focused on the omnichannel experiences with digital and stores contributing to our success, and that's an important qualifier. Digital, we see as an and, not an or. We're acquiring new younger customers through these channels. And we are seeing the ongoing strength of our digital business, even as stores begin to reopen and traffic begins to build back to historic levels. We've seen another quarter of triple-digit growth, while also driving sequential improvement in store trends. So we're encouraged by that performance as we see traffic starting to come back -- I should say, starting to come back. 
But let me toss it to Todd, he can give you a little bit of color on what we're seeing specifically at Coach."

Specifically in the U.S., we continue to see incredibly strong demand online, even as we see restrictions and improving brick-and-mortar traffic. This is supported by the fact that our new customer recruitment has fueled our strong digital growth. 
In fact, as Joanne mentioned, in the quarter, we added another 400,000 new customers from our e-commerce platforms, bringing the year-to-date number of new customers from these channels to 2 million in North America. And what is really encouraging, of these 2 million, approximately half are Gen Z and millennial. 
And then when I return to brick-and-mortar, if I take Texas as an example, we experienced a significant acceleration in our store sales trends, while, at the same time, we see the restrictions being lifted. And while those restrictions are being lifted, our digital traffic and demand trends remain strong. So this bodes really well for our future as we see a return to traffic in North America brick-and-mortar."

We do see the digital business being accretive to our operating margins currently. Our digital business is quite profitable. It's structurally more profitable than their respective bricks-and-mortar channels. And it's really a function of the fact that we have structurally higher AURs, high margins and relatively low returns in that channel. So we consistently deliver higher margins through our digital performance. And I think it's also important to mention that for, as Todd said, recruiting new customers and engaging new customers through our digital channels. So that makes the channel accretive as well. 
And in terms of where we see the penetration going, ultimately, the customer will decide. We're very focused on meeting the customer where they are. And I think we've been innovating quite well in terms of our ability to engage consumers, both digitally and on social channels with real innovations on TikTok, as an example, capturing customers where they are today. And we're committed to staying close to the customer and seeing how that unfolds. 
Having said that, our brick-and-mortar business, also, we're really pleased to see the operating margins of our brick-and-mortar business this quarter achieve pre-pandemic levels -- exceed pre-pandemic levels this quarter. So that also bodes well for our business, really driven by the gross margin gains that we've seen. And we expect that as traffic builds back, those numbers will also improve.

On sustainability, Joanne can talk about the Tapestry sustainability, but I see this as a really interesting opportunity for the Coach brand. As an 80-year-old brand, particularly one grounded in leather, we have opportunities to talk in a really authentic way about sustainability. And we've done some interesting things. 
On Earth Day, we brought forward a handful of bags, which we call Reloved, which were bags that were literally returned, unusable over many years, we couldn't repair them. And what we did was our designers and our workshop reconstructed them basically. And the bags that we put up online on Earth Day, it sold out in an hour. And the demand for them were incredibly strong. 
So as we start thinking about and talking about sustainability and what it means for each of our brands, particularly at the Coach brand, I see opportunities in this Reloved concept, in the -- something else we've done, which is basically taking scraps and turning it into a weave that creates an entirely new handbag. So I think you're going to see us do some really interesting and innovative opportunities.

In the third quarter, our handbag AUR rose approximately 25%, both globally and in North America. 
And as Joanne indicated, so much of this is deliberate actions that we've taken about how we're looking at things differently. First, it starts with incredibly strong innovative product led by Stuart Vevers' creative direction. We then couple that with using data to inform our decision-making and really, really put the consumer at the center. And the SKU reduction is helping driving AUR. 
And let me give you a quick example. If you take Tabby, which right now is our #1 family in our retail fleet, Tabby originally launched in July of '19. In prior years, what would have happened by the time we got to February of '21, we would have been bored with it and tired and moved on. Instead, we recognize what an incredible family -- iconic family we have, and we relaunched it with Pillow Tabby, bringing the entire Tabby family back to the #1 position in our fleet. So this elongation and -- of the life cycle of an iconic family helps us raise our AURs, helps us reduce our SKU counts and helps create greater gross margin and profitability.

And that's really been accomplished through the focus on the consumer, leveraging digital and data and transformation into a leaner organization. And we feel we're exiting the pandemic even stronger positioned to take market share at higher levels of profitability. 
We're not providing detailed guidance by brand. But to your point, Coach, this year, will already be at a best-in-class op margin in and around 30-ish percent. And we still think that we'll have digital and China being the revenue drivers. So our opportunities at Coach are really around opportunity to grow the top line and maintain attractive margin. These are excellent margins already. 
Kate Spade, where we've clarified our brand position and better execution to deliver for our customers, we have an opportunity to drive both top and bottom line growth. I think we're in, I would say, early innings, and this will be a meaningful Tapestry growth driver over the planning horizon. 
And then lastly, when we look at Stuart Weitzman, our priority there has and continues to be a return to profitability, and we're making great progress. We're leaning into our strength in China, which obviously has very strong margins. We've exited quite a number of unprofitable doors and geographies, and we've strengthened our position in North America, including in wholesale.

I think when you're looking at our overall gross margin, and Joanne and Todd alluded to this, we see where we are at Coach as a sustainable gross margin given the ability for us to reduce promotions, we've controlled the SKU count, et cetera. So when we look at all of those factors taken together, we feel that Coach's gross margin, which we used to say was going to be in the area of 69% to 70%, ad infinitum, can stay at these higher levels. 
I think you're absolutely right when you're looking at it, Lorraine, that the upside to the gross margin will primarily now come from Kate Spade, where we are, as I mentioned, in the early innings. We do have the benefit of China growing for all of our brands and having that be this gross margin anywhere in the world, and that will continue. 
So I think the combination of both the focus on lower promo, higher AUR across brands as well as the change in the geographic mix will help overall Tapestry gross margin sustain and perhaps rise. But again, I think where we are with Coach is definitely best-in-class, and we do believe it's sustainable."

I'm curious if you have any insights where that customer came from and any kind of early indications of repeat levels with that customer, what you're learning about that customer relative to old cohorts.

We have increasing confidence in our ability to manage and control our own fate as it relates to managing our margins, managing our AURs and managing our business. 
So we, as Andrea mentioned, believe these margins are sustainable given the confidence we're building and our execution behind the levers of our acceleration program. 
And then as it relates to customer metrics, it's -- that is where our focus is. We're increasingly recruiting new customers. These customers are increasingly younger. And we've maintained a very robust database of customers over many years. So we know that these are customers that are new to the brand. And again, the fact that they're increasingly younger really bodes well for the long-term health of our brand. And to your point, we're focused on driving lifetime value of these customers. We are seeing these customers repeat at higher frequency. And again, those are -- that is a result of the work we've been doing through our acceleration program, leveraging data, new marketing tools, staying close to our consumers, building relevant product and marketing stories. 
Some of the focus in our assortments also helps, telling better, stronger stories for our consumers. So we have increasing confidence in our ability to continue to drive, not only our business forward at these margins, but also continue to drive lifetime value for our customers over time."

Through our Acceleration Program,",2516,"Good morning. Thank you, Christina, and welcome, everyone. We delivered standout results in fiscal 2021, a transformational year for Tapestry. 
We are a fundamentally different company today than we were just 1 year ago. Through our Acceleration Program, we reached new customers in new ways and effectively adapted to a rapidly changing environment. Our success is a testament to our powerful brands and talented teams. 
We achieved many strategic milestones this year, which have strengthened our organization. We've sharpened our focus on the consumer and clarified the unique positioning of each of our brands. This drove improvements in key customer metrics, including recruitment, retention, and reactivation. 
We enhanced our digital capabilities, highlighted by our global e-commerce channel, a margin-accretive business for Tapestry, reaching approximately $1.6 billion in revenue, nearly doubling versus prior year and over $1 billion ahead of prepandemic levels. This was fueled by the acquisition of nearly 4 million new customers in North America alone, including a growing number of Millennial and Gen Z consumers. And we sustained double-digit e-commerce sales growth in the fourth quarter even as we lap more difficult comparisons online. At the same time, we drove continued sequential sales improvement for our global store fleet with operating margins that were once again above pre-pandemic levels. 
We further strengthened our positioning in China, which still has tremendous runway supported by the growth of the rising middle class. In fact, Tapestry's business in Greater China reached $1.1 billion in sales this fiscal year led by over 60% growth on the Mainland. At the same time, we grew our business with Chinese consumers globally, increasing at a high single-digit rate as compared to pre-pandemic levels. 
We successfully leveraged data and analytics, embedding capabilities across the company to enhance our understanding of the customer, increase responsiveness and drive faster, more effective decision-making. This has underpinned our ability to optimize the assortment planning process, lower SKU counts by 40% to 45%, and reduced promotional activity, supporting higher AUR and gross margin as well as improved inventory turns. 
We also embraced new ways of working with a leaner operating model and more empowered teams. This resulted in $200 million of gross expense savings in fiscal year '21, which funded investments in areas such as digital and marketing to fuel our continued growth as well as our purpose-led initiatives to accelerate and amplify our work within our social fabric to affect positive change for our industry and stakeholders. 
Importantly, the traction of our strategy is clearly evidenced by our financial performance, including the achievement of record operating margin at Tapestry, Inc. as well as operating income and EPS growth versus both FY '20 and FY '19 in each quarter of the year. We also exceeded pre-pandemic sales in the fourth quarter, representing an important financial milestone. In addition, we generated $1.2 billion of free cash flow and ended the year in a strong cash position while reducing our leverage through organic profit growth and the paydown of the company's revolver. 
Given our strong financial position and underlying business trends, our Board of Directors approved the reinstatement of our capital return programs with a plan to return over $750 million to shareholders through both dividend and share repurchases in fiscal year '22. These actions underscore our conviction in Tapestry's ability to drive long-term growth, along with our commitment to enhancing value for our stakeholders. Scott will discuss our capital allocation priorities in more detail shortly. 
Now let me touch on our results and strategies for Coach, Kate Spade, and Stuart Weitzman. Coach, our largest brand, led Tapestry, outperforming in each quarter of the year. The brand fueled momentum through innovation across consumer touch points, driving engagement with new and existing customers. 
During the fourth quarter, Coach revenue rose 117% versus prior year, outpacing pre-pandemic levels of sales by 2%, a meaningful achievement given the volatile backdrop. In addition, we delivered significant profitability enhancements during the fiscal year, resulting in operating income increases of 67% on a 1-year basis and 14% on a 2-year basis. This outstanding performance was the result of both gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage, reflecting strategic actions and structural changes we've made to sustain long-term growth. 
Throughout the fiscal year, we made significant progress at Coach against the pillars of our multiyear growth agenda. First, we deepened our engagement with consumers by leaning into our brand values of inclusivity and authenticity to drive increased recruitment and reactivation. In addition, through the launch of our loyalty program in North America and more targeted marketing, we drove significant gains in the number of repeat transactions. 
Second, we created innovative, unique and compelling product to meet the needs of our target consumer segment. We are building enduring icons that create a foundation for our product pipeline in future seasons. This was evidenced by the recent success of newness within the Tabby family, including our Pillow and Mini versions. In addition, we saw continued strength in our signature platforms across an expanded assortment of refreshed styles, highlighting desirability for the brand. 
Third, we drove triple-digit sales growth in our digital channels on both a 1- and 2-year basis, led by new customer recruitment. During the fiscal year, we acquired nearly 2.5 million new Coach customers through our digital channels in North America alone, a meaningful increase versus prior year. Importantly, we sustained strong momentum in the fourth quarter even as we comped our digital initiatives and the initial uplift in e-com sales that occurred during the pandemic in the prior year, highlighting continued opportunity in the channel. 
Fourth, we accelerated growth in China by leveraging our foundation in the country, which resulted in over 60% revenue growth on the Mainland in fiscal year '21 with strength across channels. This performance reflected our integrated and comprehensive brand-building strategies, including investments in marketing, innovative products and a continued focus on digital channels. Most recently, we hosted our live streams fashion show in Shanghai, which was extremely well received and highlights our commitment to the Chinese consumer. 
Finally, we enhanced profitability to realize an operating margin of over 31%. This performance was driven by higher gross margin, which reached nearly 74% through a focus on streamlining our offering, sharpening our merchandising efforts, and reducing SKU counts by approximately 45%. These initiatives resulted in global handbag AUR growth in each quarter of the fiscal year. In fact, in the fourth quarter, our handbag AUR rose high single digits globally, led by particular strength in North America. In addition, we made structural changes to SG&A, including our fleet optimization efforts. 
Looking ahead to fiscal year '22, our goals are to increase market share in our core handbag and small leather goods categories through a combination of AUR and unit growth by continuing to develop the brand's iconic families, approachable and inclusive messaging and consistent global positioning, invest and grow in digital while delivering differentiated and compelling omnichannel experiences, continue to drive growth in China with key initiatives to capitalize on market trends of the emerging middle class and increased digitalization, and grow men's by expanding lifestyle building brand awareness and increasing our presence in Asia in keeping with our ambition to deliver over $1 billion in revenue in this category over our planning horizon. 
In summary, Coach is both a remarkable 80-year history and a bright future. We are confident that the deliberate actions we've taken to improve the foundation of the brand, including the realization of higher AUR and stronger margins are sustainable over the long term as revenue continues to inflect. We're continuing to improve on the momentum we've built to drive market share gains at sustainably high margins in fiscal '22 and beyond. 
Now moving to Kate Spade. Throughout the year, the brand delivered consistent improvement on the top line, resulting in fiscal year '21 sales growth of 3% compared to prior year, or a 13% decline compared to pre-pandemic revenue levels. In the most recent quarter, sales increased 95% versus prior year and were 4% below fiscal year '19. Direct sales in the fourth quarter, excluding wholesale, increased on a 2-year basis. In addition, for both the quarter and fiscal year, operating income rose meaningfully with margin expansion compared to prior year on both a stronger gross margin and SG&A leverage. 
We were pleased with Kate Spade's progress across its growth strategies, which highlight the traction we're making to build stronger connections with consumers. In fiscal '21, we crystallized the brand's purpose, returning to its roots of unique and best-in-class storytelling and fulfilling its promise as a lifestyle brand, representing joy, optimism, and color. During the most recent quarter, we continued to reengage lapsed customers at an increasing rate as we reactivated 550,000 customers through our North America digital channels, an increase of nearly 35% compared to prior year, demonstrating our focus on building lasting relationships with our customers. 
Second, we embedded a laser focus on the customer by harnessing the power of the broad and loyal Kate Spade community to engage consumers in new and exciting ways. This was evidenced by our viral Happy Dance campaign on TikTok, which has over 11 billion views and counting. 
Third, we reenergized our core handbag offering by introducing innovative and universal brand elements. We're seeing traction in leather with the introduction of the Knot, which has already grown to approximately 20% of our retail assortment, proving its position as a key family in the assortment going forward. In addition, our new signature branding, the spade flower, continues to perform while the reimagined SAM and nylon has outpaced expectations. These platforms represent strong foundations for future growth. 
Fourth, we leaned into our digital strength, delivering approximately 35% growth compared to prior year across our e-commerce channels, reaching 35% of sales for the fiscal year. This growth was driven by both the acquisition of nearly 1.4 million new customers through our North America digital channels as well as the engagement of existing customers. 
Fifth, we improved profitability by focusing on acquiring, reengaging, and retaining customers to drive top and bottom line growth. Through the use of data, we adjusted our assortment and pricing strategies, which resulted in approximately 40% lower SKU count and disciplined promotional activity. This ultimately drove overall handbag AUR growth, which increased mid-single digits in both the fourth quarter and for the fiscal year. 
Finally, we've continued to focus on talent and culture. This year, we reorganized our creative structure with the formation of the cross-functional ideation studio, spanning across our brand creative, design, merchandising, and marketing teams. This is increased collaboration and cohesion to drive more impactful and consistent storytelling. 
As we head into fiscal '22, we are building on the strong foundation we've established with a goal to deliver profitable and sustainable global growth. To achieve this, we will maintain a consumer-centric approach across all aspects of the business, amplify recent product introductions while continuing to build out our core handbag platforms; continue to engage newly acquired, reactivated and existing customers to drive higher lifetime value; drive brand heat through marketing focused on our Kate Spade community, particularly in social channels; maximize lifestyle positioning by strengthening the foundation of ready-to-wear, jewelry, and footwear; and improve the global omnichannel experience and drive continued growth in digital. 
Overall, we are pleased with Kate Spade's execution and the traction we gained with consumers in fiscal '21, including AUR improvement and strong customer engagement. This progress is reflected in Kate Spade's outperformance versus internal expectations, reinforcing our confidence in the brand's potential. 
Kate Spade is a unique yet universal brand, and our teams are galvanized around driving our clear strategy. We continue to believe in a significant runway ahead and our ability to achieve $2 billion in revenue and enhanced profitability in the future. 
Turning now to Stuart Weitzman. Throughout the fiscal year, the brand progressed on its growth strategies. Specifically, we continue to renew the brand's reputation for fit, comfort, and quality by listening and responding to customer needs. During the fourth quarter, we were pleased to see a significant increase in demand for dress styles as much of the world began to reopen, and events and in-person socialization returns. 
Second, we grew our key categories by building strength in boots, booties, and sandals through fashion innovation, highlighted by the continued success of our iconic 50-50 [ land and Metis ] families, which brought in new and younger customers. We also expanded the casual assortment, including a broader sneaker offering in the recently introduced on-trend Jelly style. At the same time, we dramatically simplified the product assortment with SKU counts declining approximately 45%. 
Third, we focused our distribution on markets and channels of greatest opportunity to create a foundation to return to profitability as revenues inflect. This included the exit of unprofitable markets across the globe and rightsizing of the fleet in North America. At the same time, momentum continued for our China business in fiscal '21 with revenue on the Mainland increase over 35% compared to prior year, or nearly 50% on a 2-year basis. We kept the Chinese consumer at the forefront of our strategy, highlighted by our tailored product offerings, featuring capsule collections, relevant marketing with key opinion leaders, and continued outperformance across digital channels. China remains an important area of long-term opportunity for Stuart Weitzman at structurally higher margins. 
Fourth, we strengthened our relationship with wholesale partners by providing relevant products in faster, more consistent execution. As previously shared, we reentered 90 Nordstrom doors in the year, fueling North America wholesale revenue ahead of pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter. 
Finally, we made progress in establishing a robust digital presence and drove approximately 30% e-commerce growth during the fiscal year, including continued strength in the fourth quarter even as store trends improve. 
In fiscal '22, our overarching goal is to return to profitability. We will recruit and engage customers through product that sparks desire with a focus on must-have launches featuring icons, key items, and capsule collections, as well as bright [indiscernible]; drive brand heat with a digital-first drumbeat of relevant romantic storytelling; fuel continued growth in China, including an expanded footprint and further investment in digital; elevate the omnichannel customer journey, including delivering a best-in-class digital experience; and accelerate wholesale partnerships with an expanded footprint in key accounts globally. 
Overall, I'm pleased with the progress we've made at Stuart Weitzman, and we remain focused on restoring the brand's profitability. 
In closing, we are focused on driving our next phase of growth supported by our clear strategy, compelling brands, and differentiated platform. Although the environment remains volatile, we see a strong consumer who is ready to shop and continuing to engage with our brands. 
We entered fiscal year '22 with a solid foundation, improved capabilities, and increasing momentum. From this position of strength, we are confident in our ability to win with consumers and capture market share, accelerating growth and profitability across our portfolio long term, enhancing value for all stakeholders. 
With that, I'm pleased to welcome Scott Roe, who many of you know, to discuss our financial results, capital allocation priorities, and fiscal '22 outlook. Scott?"

Thanks, Joanne, and good morning, everyone. I'm thrilled to be with you today after joining Tapestry just a few months ago. 
While I'm still relatively new, I can already see that this is a truly unique company with strong and engaged talent, great brands that are well positioned in attractive market spaces, and a distribution model that allows us to directly own our consumer relationships, coupled with advanced digital and analytics capabilities. 
As we move forward, my focus is to work alongside our management team to align business and financial strategies to drive sustainable long-term growth, which profits shareholders and all stakeholders alike. 
Looking back at fiscal year '21, it was a transformational year for the organization, as Joanne mentioned. We effectively executed our acceleration program against a difficult backdrop creating a foundation for sustainable growth. Specifically, we increased the penetration of our margin-accretive digital and China businesses, which led overall growth in the fiscal year; we expanded gross margins primarily through higher AURs driven by lower levels of promotional activity; we grew operating margin by 300 basis points versus FY '19, reaching peak levels at Tapestry. This, despite significant investments in talent, digital capabilities and marketing, which were more than funded by gross profit gains and $200 million in gross SG&A savings delivered through the acceleration program. And we further strengthened our financial position through tight inventory management and a reduction in debt levels while achieving $1.2 billion in free cash flow, resulting in an ending cash position of approximately $2 billion. 
Turning to the details of the fourth quarter. Total sales rose 126% versus prior year on a 14-week basis, or 113% on a 13-week basis, outpacing pre-pandemic levels, an important milestone. These results were led by strength at Coach, while Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman delivered material sequential improvements in trends. 
By region, North America led the overall growth, rising approximately 150% versus FY '20 and a high single-digit percentage versus FY '19, fueled by digital and a continued improvement in our brick-and-mortar businesses. 
In Mainland China, our strong momentum continued as revenue increased approximately 60% on a 1-year basis and over 40% compared to pre-pandemic levels. 
Across the balance of Asia, sales rose materially compared to the prior year but remain below pre-pandemic levels with notable pressure in Japan given the continued state of emergency and lack of tourist sales. 
In Europe, while a small portion of our total sales, experienced a sequential improvement in trends on the 1- and 2-year basis as lockdown measures were lifted. And while revenue remained well below fiscal '19, given the lack of tourist travel, our local demand did rise in the quarter. 
By channel, we maintained strength in digital, which grew more than 35% compared to prior year, reaching 30% penetration. That's 3x 2019 levels. While our stores remain pressured, slightly better traffic drove a sequential improvement for the channel. And in wholesale, while revenue remained below FY '19, trends improved with particular strength in duty free growth in China. 
Moving down to P&L. We realized another quarter of overall gross margin expansion compared to prior year and FY '19, with all brands exceeding expectations. We continued to successfully execute our strategy to maintain price discipline, reduce SKU counts, and leverage data analytics to more effectively tailor our product assortment and marketing messaging to the consumer. 
As anticipated, SG&A rose significantly given the prior year's atypical comparison due to the impact of COVID-19. On a 2-year basis, the increase in SG&A was attributable to higher marketing spend of almost $100 million compared to Q4 '19 and an increase in our annual incentive plan given our outperformance this year. In addition, our expenses for the quarter included the $25 million contribution towards the endowment of the newly established Tapestry Foundation. 
Taken together, we achieved our fourth consecutive quarter of operating income growth and margin expansion compared to prepandemic levels. Earnings per diluted share for the quarter was $0.74 on a 14-week basis, or $0.65 on a 13-week basis, a significant increase compared to a loss in the prior year and 7% ahead of pre-pandemic EPS level. 
Now moving to distribution. We continue to optimize our global fleet to prioritize profitability. For Tapestry, we closed a net of 59 locations globally in FY '21, including 10 net closures in the fourth quarter. As compared to fiscal '19 year-end, we have closed a net of 90 locations across our brands. 
Turning to a discussion of our balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter in a strong position with $2 billion in cash and equivalents and total borrowings of $1.6 billion. Total inventory at quarter end was approximately in line with last year and 6% below FY '19, reflecting, in part, deliberate actions to reduce SKU counts and prioritize inventory turns. And we generated $1.2 billion in free cash flow in FY '21 versus $202 million in the prior year and $518 million in fiscal '19. This included CapEx of $116 million, a decline of 44% versus prior year as we prioritize investments in high-return projects, notably in digital, while tightly controlling overall spend and reducing our outlay for new stores. 
Now touching on our capital allocation priorities. First, we continue to prioritize investments in the business to support strong returns and long-term profitable growth. 
Second, we're committed to returning capital to shareholders through both dividend and share repurchases. In keeping with this strategy, we're pleased to announce today a plan to return over $750 million to shareholders. Specifically, the Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 with an anticipated annual dividend rate of $1 per share. Over time, our intent is to increase the dividend at a faster rate than earnings growth. We also expect to repurchase approximately $500 million worth of stock in fiscal '22 under our current authorization. 
Importantly, once we have more visibility into a normalization in the external environment, we expect over time to more aggressively return cash to shareholders. 
And finally, in keeping with our objective to reduce leverage, we expect to repay our July 2022 bonds totaling $400 million at the end of this fiscal year. So when considered together, the dividend, share repurchase, and debt repayment are intended to approximately equal our projected free cash flow in the fiscal year. And as Joanne mentioned, these actions demonstrate our confidence in the underlying strength of our business as well as our commitment to driving total shareholder returns. 
Now moving to our fiscal '22 outlook. Before touching on the specific details, it's important to note the paradigm shift compared to just a year ago. Entering COVID, there was a macro demand concern, and we took bold actions to adjust supply in order to preserve liquidity. 
As you can see in our just-reported results, we were very successful in achieving our goals while continuing to accelerate investments to drive increasing momentum in our brands. Today, we find ourselves in a dynamic where the consumer demand backdrop is strong, while supply chain remains challenging. So I want to emphasize the underlying strength and [indiscernible] of our business and separate that from the uncertainty in the macro environment primarily due to COVID-related impacts, which are largely out of our control. Therefore, the outlook we're giving you is a reflection of what we know as of today. 
It's a point in time. While we have visibility into the risk that we see on the horizon, we're not trying to predict that, which is unknowable. We have taken the position that we'll be aggressive on protecting the momentum of the business by securing significant expedited deliveries at an additional cost in order to mitigate the impact of supply chain disruptions at least through the holiday period. Further, we'll continue to increase AUR as prices are levered to counter some of the additional cost pressures. Of course, we'll continue to monitor the impact of the new developments on our outlook over time. 
Now turning to the details of our FY '22 outlook. Please note that all growth rates, as compared to prior year, are on a comparable 52-week basis. We expect revenue to increase at a mid-teens rate versus FY '21, resulting in approximately $6.4 billion in sales, which would mark a record for the company. This includes the expectation for a continuation of strong growth in digital and Greater China as well as improving global trends in stores. While we expect stores to show improvement, revenue is currently planned to remain below pre-pandemic levels. 
Turning to gross margin. We expect to sustain the company's strong margins through continued AUR improvements and lower promotional activity. Our outlook also incorporates the expectation for GSP's renewal with a retroactive benefit in the second fiscal quarter, which is currently planned to partially mitigate the negative impact associated with higher freight costs currently embedded in our plan. 
Touching on SG&A. We expect expenses to grow relatively in line with sales for the year. We continue to estimate that we will realize approximately $300 million in structural gross run rate expense savings, including $100 million of incremental savings from the prior year. We are utilizing these savings to fund investments in the business, including $50 million of planned higher marketing spend which is expected to represent approximately 7% of sales in fiscal '22, up roughly 75% or 3 full percentage points compared to FY '19. 
We're also investing in our teams, adding talent to growing areas of the business such as digital, and we're focused on continuing to retain and develop these strong teams as evidenced by our recently announced commitment that all U.S. Tapestry employees will earn at least $15 per hour. 
Operating income is expected to increase at a mid-teens rate resulting in operating margin modestly ahead of prior year and an increase of over 300 basis points versus 2019. Net interest expense for the year is expected to be $65 million and the tax rate is estimated at 18.5%, assuming a continuation of current tax laws. 
Weighted average diluted share count is forecasted to be in the area of 283 million shares, approximately even with last year, with share repurchase activity expected to offset dilution. We anticipate EPS to be in the range of $3.30 to $3.35, reflecting leverage to the bottom line. CapEx for the year is projected to be about $220 million. We anticipate approximately 40% of the spend to be related to store development primarily in China, with the balance dedicated to our digital and IT initiatives, including the initial investments related to build out our new distribution center. Specifically, as our digital business continues to grow, we've recognized the opportunity to sharpen our focus on the consumer by expanding our distribution capabilities. 
We recently signed a lease for a new distribution facility based in Las Vegas, which we believe will allow us to better serve our customers in the western part of the United States. Finally, we expect inventory levels to be up meaningfully throughout the year as we pull forward receipts to match strong demand and face elongated lead times from supply chain pressures due to COVID disruptions. 
Given the dynamic environment and last year's atypical comparisons, we again expect significant variability by quarter. Revenue growth versus prior year is expected to be front half way given relatively easier compares due to lapping COVID impacts, with the first quarter forecasted to increase more than 20%. Earnings growth in the first half is expected to be somewhat pressured due to incremental SG&A investments along with last year's unusual compare, including lower expenses due to compensation reductions, lease abatements, and the timing of government assistance. That said, we still expect EPS growth in the first half versus prior year, particularly in Q1. 
So in closing, we drove strong results in FY '21. Our significant progress is a testament to the successful execution by our passionate teams, the power of our brands, and our competitive advantages including our differentiated platform. The bold and deliberate actions we've made under Tapestry's acceleration program that transformed our organization. These changes are foundational and will continue to be a meaningful point of difference for our brands. 
As we look ahead, with regard to those things we can control, we're continuing to build momentum, and we are confident in our ability to leverage the solid foundation to drive sustainable top and bottom line growth across our portfolio of brands. And with respect to those things we can't control, we've taken aggressive actions to protect our strong momentum and mitigate those macro challenges we see today. Our conviction is underscored by our capital allocation actions, highlighting our optimism for the future and commitment to enhancing value for all stakeholders. 
I'd now like to open it up for Q&A."

I would say that our confidence begins with the standout results we delivered this fiscal year. Fiscal '21 was a year of successful transformation for the company, and it was capped by a strong fourth quarter. 
We saw sales trends improve every quarter of the year and exceeded pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter. For the year, we delivered record operating income and record operating margin as a multi-brand company despite the challenging backdrop. And we see momentum building as we enter fiscal '22. And you can see that in the outlook we shared. 
We expect to reach a record level of revenue for fiscal '22 at $6.4 billion on mid-teens growth. And we see further untapped potential longer term, particularly in digital and China. And those represent sustainable top and bottom line growth vehicles going forward. 
I think importantly, we're investing in long-term growth drivers. We're investing in marketing and we're investing in digital and our people. And while we've made significant progress this past year, we're just getting started. 
As Scott said, we're operating from a position of strength as a fundamentally different company today. We're reaching, through our Acceleration Program, we took bold actions and we're now reaching new customers in new ways as a more agile organization. And the actions we took not only delivered a strong year, but positioned us to thrive on the other side of the pandemic. 
And we're better equipped as a company, I would say, to pull these levers -- growth levers going forward. We have new capabilities to engage consumers and drive higher lifetime value. And we have 4 million new consumers that we acquired in the last year alone who are increasingly younger. 
We have -- we're delivering really strong gross margins at increasing AUR, showing pricing power in our brands. And we have a direct-to-consumer model building strength in digital and China with significant runway ahead. 
And Scott also mentioned, we have a strong team, and we continue to invest in our team to secure that competitive advantage. So I would say, overall, we're operating from a position of strength. We're building momentum, and we see significant runway ahead for all of our brands."

So over time, I see -- I laid out capital allocation priorities, which are investing in our great brands. That's our highest return today. Number two, the dividend, you saw, we reinstated that and returning cash to shareholders. That's where our focus is right now.

So I guess my question is on the Kate Spade margins, really good to see some of the green shoots that you have there now and the expansion relative to 2019. But they still trail the Coach brand by 20 percentage points. 
So just curious, I guess, maybe Joanne and Scott, for you, how you see that evolving over time? Really, what's the potential with the Kate Spade margin profile over time?

We are really pleased with our execution in fiscal '21. And we made important progress. You noted the progress on margin, but we made important progress across the foundations of the brand. 
I'll just call out a few highlights. Kate is highly digitally penetrated. We showed continued strength in the digital channel. It now represents nearly 35% of sales for the brand. We're acquiring new customers, 1.4 million new customers during the year. And we're reactivating customers at a more frequent rate. So 550,000 customers reactivated, a 35% increase from last year, and some of those customers are deeply lapsed customers. 
So when we think about the Kate Spade brand and engaging consumers and really building -- rebuilding the brand, we made really important progress. And I would say that partly is due to the fact that we've reenergized our core handbag offering. 
Liz and team have worked really quickly to build a stronger, more solid platform. We're seeing traction across our leather platform with the Knot, our signature platform we've talked about with the spade flower, and our nylon platform with the reimagined sandbag. 
And what we're seeing is the customer reacting to those changes in our assortment with increased global handbag AUR. So with handbag AURs moving higher, that's another sign of brand health. 
So longer term, we continue to have and see a path for Kate Spade to build to a $2 billion brand and, to your point, a significantly higher margins. We see a path to high teens margin opportunity. 
And as you compare versus Coach, Kate Spade is a true full lifestyle brand. And there are some differences to the Coach business today. Kate Spade has, as I said, more lifestyle style categories. And right now, as a brand, it's centered more in North America and Japan. Doesn't have as developed an international business. But we see those as opportunities moving forward."

We are really pleased with how we change the brand very materially over the last year plus, partly because of the Acceleration Program and partly because we really changed the conversation with our customer from leaning in and the call to action being around price and promotion to move to value and values. 
And this has really fundamentally changed us and it has really increased our AUR. Our approach to how we merchandise is fundamentally different. We have reduced our SKUs, but we've leaned into icon. And [ Stuart Vevers ] and the creative team have been getting data from the customer and really leaning in. 
So you mentioned Tabby. Tabby is a brand -- is a collection we launched in June of '19. By February of '21, it would normally have been out of the mix. Instead, we doubled down, we relaunched it with Pillow Tabby. It became the #1 bag. You saw this month, we've launched Soft Tabby. And then we're going to see Pillow Tabby reemerge. 
So having these iconic styles that are not so pressured by short selling window, really materially changes our outlook. 
And then regarding lifestyle. One of the opportunities, I think, we have is while we call it men's. Men's product is all gender product often. And one of the things we recognize is we can do better, not necessarily merchandising it exactly the same way we merchandise historically women's product. 
So you'll see us mix in more outerwear, more cut and sew opportunities, and it is really resonating with our customer. And then finally, I'm a big believer and have been for many years and the opportunities that we have with footwear.

We're learning a lot about those new customers, and we're also engaging them in different ways. And we're meeting our customers where they are. 
And we're better capable to meet those customers and engage them with our data and analytics capabilities, with our increasing presence on social media and the innovations we're bringing to life there. 
And at the end of the day, it's about delivering great products. So taking those insights and really understanding our consumer at a deeper level. And that's a lot of the foundation that we built this past year is how do we really truly understand our customer, our consumer and embed that consumer and those insights in the product development process, where our creative teams bring their terrific product and creativity to bear against things that consumers value. 
And our focus moving ahead is with all this new customer acquisition, driving higher lifetime value with our consumers going forward."

And as we focus on the consumer, it's about providing a seamless experience for a consumer, regardless of where they choose to shop. 
And we've been incredibly successful at building a digital business and meeting our consumer on digital platforms. But the store platform and that physical touch point is still important. And if you go back a year, what we said is -- or more than a year now, we said, while stores are still important, we have higher profitability expectations for our fleet and productivity thresholds. 
And we've taken bold actions to structure our fleet in that way, but we're also investing to make sure that, that represents the right experience and the right physical touch point. We're adding omnichannel capabilities for our consumers. And that's paying off. 
It's paying off on the top line, but it's also because we've seen incremental growth in our brick-and-mortar fleet as the world sort of recovers from the pandemic. But what we've also seen, importantly, and here's where I'm stealing a little bit of Scott's thunder, is we've seen operating margins of our store fleet actually above pre-pandemic levels even right now on depressed volume and a depressed traffic.

The other thing I would just say is as we think about the omnichannel journey that we're on, remember Joanne's comment, $1 billion more in digital. At the same time, we're rationalizing getting more profitable on brick-and-mortar, we're reinforcing the omni experience, and added -- we're at $1.6 billion of sale, that's $1 billion in 2 years. 
So it's not just one channel. And increasingly, it's how we meet that consumer where she is. And it's pretty impressive from my perspective, seeing that we've managed both of these channels increasing profitability and, at the same time, finding a foundation for future growth."

I want to -- I guess, Scott, I'll ask you on Slide 17 here in the deck, you mentioned improving visibility, could let you more aggressively return cash to shareholders. I'm just curious, maybe a thought there early on here is how you think about leverage in the business, given what we know about the very, very strong cash flows of this business pre-pandemic and then it's improving now. I wonder how you think what the appropriate level is early on? 
And then, I'd also be curious on the SG&A guidance, just to follow up with Mark's question earlier. This will be the first year in a more normal environment -- more normal after you did a big reset to the structure of SG&A last year. So I know there's a lot more variability in there. Scott, you took some corporate costs out and you're generating really good ROAS on the marketing investments you've made. It sounds like you still have good growth from high-margin drivers like AUR, kept margin targets high teens over time versus the 10% exit rate this year. 
So I'm just wondering, it seems like a lot of good margin drivers in there. To the extent that we do see revenues coming in above plan, how should we think about what flows through to earnings this year and an upside scenario for revenues?"

First of a",519,"Yes. Well, first of all, Michael, good to talk to you again. As usual, very thorough and comprehensive on your insights here. 
So let's start with capital allocation and how we're thinking about it. I think a little context first is important. First of all, don't lose the message here. The reinstatement of the dividend, the reinstatement of the repurchase program, $750 million intended return of cash is really a testament to our underlying confidence in the business. So that -- I think that's the important message here. 
And if you think about the journey over the last year, early on in COVID, given the massive uncertainty and demand issues, we took a lot of actions to protect liquidity, to protect the enterprise with our rating agencies, bankers, bondholders, et cetera. There was a commitment on deleveraging and a glide path that we laid out. 
So the great news here is we're able to not only advance on that glide path and even be a little ahead of it. You heard us mention paying off the $400 million of debt at the end of this fiscal year, which is our intent and reinstate the dividend. And we still have a strong balance sheet, and we still have ample cash. 
We're in between these 2 periods, right? Where we see much more confidence, and that's why we've stated the aggressive return to shareholder cash -- or returning cash to shareholders. But at the same time, we think it's prudent to take -- to keep a little elevated cash position given the uncertainty of the environment. 
So my comment was really intended to signal that while we're definitely in a more confident position, we're engaging in repurchases and dividends, we're still maintaining an elevated buffer until we get better line of sight on what COVID, Delta variant, et cetera, the uncertainty, how that evolves. 
Once we have that confidence, there's no reason that we wouldn't be -- go back to kind of normal levels, and we have opportunities to be even a little more aggressive from a return of cash to shareholders. 
So that was the intent, right, to say we're not going ditch to ditch here, right? We've made progress, but we want to watch the uncertainty. 
As it relates to margin plans. Again, I'd point you back, SG&A, the picture there is the tale of 2 things. We have the benefits around acceleration, which are providing leverage throughout the P&L and allow us to reinvest obviously, in a very -- in -- we have variability, and we're making choices. Those choices are based on the insights and data that we have, and we've seen it pay off, right? So that's why we've given guidance that says we do expect to expand margins next year. 
Should we get more upside? Would some of that flow through? Depends. Yes, likely. But we're also going to look at where we can lean in and advance our platforms and capabilities for the future. But we expect expanding margins, and you should expect that some of that would flow through as we see upside."

And we've made significant changes within the P&L. Scott called it out in his prepared remarks, but 3% higher investment in marketing. And we've done that with confidence because with our new data and analytics capabilities, we're better able to measure the return on our marketing investments. And our intention is to structure our business so that we can continue to engage consumers across all of our brands and create -- and continue to create and tap into growth. 
And we have seen tremendous traction over the past year based on these capabilities. The investments that we're making in marketing are across the funnel. And I think that's important to know, too, because as we get better at measuring our returns, we're getting better at measuring returns across the full funnel. So it's not only performance marketing, but it is about brand building and measuring our returns on those brand-building investments we're making. 
And of course, digital is a priority. We're better able to engage consumers on many digital platforms, and we're driving innovation there. We've called out the work we've done on live streaming and TikTok with even organic and viral videos on TikTok. So we're continuing to innovate, we're investing across the funnel, and we think that is an important enabler as we look to unlock future growth."

And our outlook reflects additional airfreight really through the holiday period, which is as far as we can see in terms of getting the deliveries and trying to maintain the strong momentum we have. 
You heard Joanne say it, right, the great news here is demand for our brands is strong. And while we see some disruption, we're taking bold actions, and we got out ahead of this a little bit in terms of securing as much supply as we can to keep that strong momentum going. 
Now we've talked about gross margins being roughly equal to this year, and that means we're consolidating on record high gross margins, up 300 basis points versus a couple of years ago. 
And underneath that, we have some elevated costs related to expedited freight. We also see the continuing build in AUR pricing leverage, less discount and the general trend of the business, which is helping us offset that. So those are the puts and the takes. 
I would say though, by quarter. It's not necessarily going to be a straight line. We're going to see as some of this freight cost turns into the P&L, it may not come exactly matched with some of the price increases. But over time, for the year, that's the picture that we see."

This is part of a very focused effort in simplifying, reducing SKUs, and seeing real progress there, and it's one of the factors for cash flow. 
But as we look to next year, we are going to see elevated inventory positions starting in the first quarter. And the reason for that is twofold. Number one, just supporting the growth of the business. 
Number two, we're expediting, as I said, what we can to bring in inventory, whether it be even by air or by sea, we're getting inventory in as fast as we can reasonably do in order to keep the momentum of the business. And those factors together are going to be a slightly elevated increase in inventory. 
But I have no concerns about this at all. This is inventory that is supporting the trend of the business. And frankly, if we could get more, we probably would. So you're going to see that dynamic play out. It's not significant, but understand what's really driving it. 
And you asked about our ability to chase. Listen, we're doing what we can. I just told you expedited air freight. We're looking to -- I think we were quick to get in front of our suppliers, and we've secured what we can. So to the best of our ability, we will chase.

We delivered standout results in fiscal 2021, a transformational year for Tapestry.  We are a fundamentally different company today than we were just 1 year ago. Through our Acceleration Program",2512,"Good morning. Thank you, Christina, and welcome, everyone. We delivered standout results in fiscal 2021, a transformational year for Tapestry.  
We are a fundamentally different company today than we were just 1 year ago. Through our Acceleration Program, we reached new customers in new ways and effectively adapted to a rapidly changing environment. Our success is a testament to our powerful brands and talented teams.  
We achieved many strategic milestones this year, which have strengthened our organization. We've sharpened our focus on the consumer and clarified the unique positioning of each of our brands. This drove improvements in key customer metrics, including recruitment, retention and reactivation.  
We enhanced our digital capabilities, highlighted by our global e-commerce channel, a margin-accretive business for Tapestry, reaching approximately $1.6 billion in revenue, nearly doubling versus prior year and over $1 billion ahead of pre-pandemic levels. This was fueled by the acquisition of nearly 4 million new customers in North America alone, including a growing number of millennial and Gen Z consumers. And we sustained double-digit e-commerce sales growth in the fourth quarter even as we lapped more difficult comparisons online.  At the same time, we drove continued sequential sales improvement for our global store fleet, with operating margins that were once again above pre-pandemic levels.  
We further strengthened our positioning in China, which still has tremendous runway, supported by the growth of the rising middle class. In fact, Tapestry's business in Greater China reached $1.1 billion in sales this fiscal year, led by over 60% growth on the Mainland. At the same time, we grew our business with Chinese consumers globally, increasing at a high single-digit rate as compared to pre-pandemic levels.  
We successfully leveraged data and analytics, embedding capabilities across the company to enhance our understanding of the customer, increase responsiveness and drive faster, more effective decision-making. This has underpinned our ability to optimize the assortment planning process, lower SKU counts by 40% to 45% and reduced promotional activity, supporting higher AUR and gross margin as well as improved inventory turns.  
We also embraced new ways of working with a leaner operating model and more empowered teams. This resulted in $200 million of gross expense savings in fiscal year '21, which funded investments in areas such as digital and marketing to fuel our continued growth as well as our purpose-led initiatives to accelerate and amplify our work within our social fabric to affect positive change for our industry and stakeholders.  
Importantly, the traction of our strategy is clearly evidenced by our financial performance, including the achievement of record operating margin at Tapestry, Inc. as well as operating income and EPS growth versus both FY '20 and FY '19 in each quarter of the year. We also exceeded pre-pandemic sales in the fourth quarter, representing an important financial milestone. In addition, we generated $1.2 billion of free cash flow and ended the year in a strong cash position while reducing our leverage through organic profit growth and the paydown of the company's revolver.  
Given our strong financial position and underlying business trends, our Board of Directors approved the reinstatement of our capital return programs, with a plan to return over $750 million to shareholders through both dividend and share repurchases in fiscal year '22. These actions underscore our conviction in Tapestry's ability to drive long-term growth, along with our commitment to enhancing value for our stakeholders. Scott will discuss our capital allocation priorities in more detail shortly.  
Now let me touch on our results and strategies for Coach, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman. Coach, our largest brand, led Tapestry, outperforming in each quarter of the year. The brand fueled momentum through innovation across consumer touch points, driving engagement with new and existing customers.  
During the fourth quarter, Coach revenue rose 117% versus prior year, outpacing pre-pandemic levels of sales by 2%, a meaningful achievement given the volatile backdrop. In addition, we delivered significant profitability enhancements during the fiscal year, resulting in operating income increases of 67% on a 1-year basis and 14% on a 2-year basis. This outstanding performance was the result of both gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage, reflecting strategic actions and structural changes we've made to sustain long-term growth.  
Throughout the fiscal year, we made significant progress at Coach against the pillars of our multiyear growth agenda. First, we deepened our engagement with consumers by leaning into our brand values of inclusivity and authenticity to drive increased recruitment and reactivation. In addition, through the launch of our loyalty program in North America and more targeted marketing, we drove significant gains in the number of repeat transactions.  
Second, we created innovative, unique and compelling product to meet the needs of our target consumer segment. We are building enduring icons that create a foundation for our product pipeline in future seasons. This was evidenced by the recent success of newness within the Tabby family, including our Pillow and mini versions. In addition, we saw continued strength in our signature platforms across an expanded assortment of refreshed styles, highlighting desirability for the brand. 
Third, we drove triple-digit sales growth in our digital channels on both a 1- and 2-year basis, led by new customer recruitment. During the fiscal year, we acquired nearly 2.5 million new Coach customers through our digital channels in North America alone, a meaningful increase versus prior year. Importantly, we sustained strong momentum in the fourth quarter even as we comped our digital initiatives and the initial uplift in e-com sales that occurred during the pandemic in the prior year, highlighting continued opportunity in the channel.  
Fourth, we accelerated growth in China by leveraging our foundation in the country, which resulted in over 60% revenue growth on the Mainland in fiscal year '21 with strength across channels. This performance reflected our integrated and comprehensive brand-building strategies, including investments in marketing, innovative products and a continued focus on digital channels. Most recently, we hosted our live-streamed fashion show in Shanghai, which was extremely well received and highlights our commitment to the Chinese consumer.  
Finally, we enhanced profitability to realize an operating margin of over 31%. This performance was driven by higher gross margin, which reached nearly 74% through a focus on streamlining our offering, sharpening our merchandising efforts and reducing SKU counts by approximately 45%. These initiatives resulted in global handbag AUR growth in each quarter of the fiscal year. In fact, in the fourth quarter, our handbag AUR rose high single digits globally, led by particular strength in North America. In addition, we made structural changes to SG&A, including our fleet optimization efforts.  
Looking ahead to fiscal year '22, our goals are to increase market share in our core handbag and small leather goods categories through a combination of AUR and unit growth by continuing to develop the brand's iconic families, approachable and inclusive messaging and consistent global positioning; invest and grow in digital while delivering differentiated and compelling omnichannel experiences; continue to drive growth in China with key initiatives to capitalize on market trends of the emerging middle class and increased digitalization; and grow men's by expanding lifestyle, building brand awareness and increasing our presence in Asia in keeping with our ambition to deliver over $1 billion in revenue in this category over our planning horizon.  
In summary, Coach is both a remarkable 80-year history and a bright future. We are confident that the deliberate actions we've taken to improve the foundation of the brand, including the realization of higher AUR and stronger margins, are sustainable over the long term as revenue continues to inflect. We're continuing to improve on the momentum we've built to drive market share gains at sustainably high margins in fiscal '22 and beyond.  
Now moving to Kate Spade. Throughout the year, the brand delivered consistent improvement on the top line, resulting in fiscal year '21 sales growth of 3% compared to prior year, or a 13% decline compared to pre-pandemic revenue levels. In the most recent quarter, sales increased 95% versus prior year and were 4% below fiscal year '19. Direct sales in the fourth quarter, excluding wholesale, increased on a 2-year basis. In addition, for both the quarter and fiscal year, operating income rose meaningfully with margin expansion compared to prior year on both a stronger gross margin and SG&A leverage.  
We were pleased with Kate Spade's progress across its growth strategies, which highlight the traction we're making to build stronger connections with consumers. In fiscal '21, we crystallized the brand's purpose, returning to its roots of unique and best-in-class storytelling and fulfilling its promise as a lifestyle brand, representing joy, optimism and color. During the most recent quarter, we continued to reengage lapsed customers at an increasing rate as we reactivated 550,000 customers through our North America digital channels, an increase of nearly 35% compared to prior year, demonstrating our focus on building lasting relationships with our customers.  
Second, we embedded a laser focus on the customer by harnessing the power of the broad and loyal Kate Spade community to engage consumers in new and exciting ways. This was evidenced by our viral happy dance campaign on TikTok, which has over 11 billion views and counting.  
Third, we reenergized our core handbag offering by introducing innovative and universal brand elements. We're seeing traction in leather with the introduction of the Knott, which has already grown to approximately 20% of our retail assortment, proving its position as a key family in the assortment going forward. In addition, our new signature branding, the spade flower, continues to perform while the reimagined sam and nylon has outpaced expectations. These platforms represent strong foundations for future growth.  
Fourth, we leaned into our digital strength, delivering approximately 35% growth compared to prior year across our e-commerce channels, reaching 35% of sales for the fiscal year. This growth was driven by both the acquisition of nearly 1.4 million new customers through our North America digital channels as well as the engagement of existing customers.  
Fifth, we improved profitability by focusing on acquiring, reengaging, and retaining customers to drive top and bottom line growth. Through the use of data, we adjusted our assortment and pricing strategies, which resulted in approximately 40% lower SKU count and disciplined promotional activity. This ultimately drove overall handbag AUR growth, which increased mid-single digits in both the fourth quarter and for the fiscal year.  
Finally, we've continued to focus on talent and culture. This year, we reorganized our creative structure with the formation of the cross-functional ideation studio, spanning across our brand creative, design, merchandising and marketing teams. This is increased collaboration and cohesion to drive more impactful and consistent storytelling.  
As we head into fiscal '22, we are building on the strong foundation we've established with a goal to deliver profitable and sustainable global growth. To achieve this, we will maintain a consumer-centric approach across all aspects of the business; amplify recent product introductions while continuing to build out our core handbag platforms; continue to engage newly acquired, reactivated and existing customers to drive higher lifetime value; drive brand heat through marketing focused on our Kate Spade community, particularly in social channels; maximize lifestyle positioning by strengthening the foundation of ready-to-wear, jewelry, and footwear; and improve the global omnichannel experience and drive continued growth in digital.  
Overall, we are pleased with Kate Spade's execution and the traction we gained with consumers in fiscal '21, including AUR improvement and strong customer engagement. This progress is reflected in Kate Spade's outperformance versus internal expectations, reinforcing our confidence in the brand's potential.  Kate Spade is a unique yet universal brand, and our teams are galvanized around driving our clear strategy. We continue to believe in the significant runway ahead in our ability to achieve $2 billion in revenue and enhanced profitability in the future.  
Turning now to Stuart Weitzman. Throughout the fiscal year, the brand progressed on its growth strategies. Specifically, we continue to renew the brand's reputation for fit, comfort and quality by listening and responding to customer needs. During the fourth quarter, we were pleased to see a significant increase in demand for dress styles as much of the world began to reopen, and events and in-person socialization returns.  
Second, we grew our key categories by building strength in boots, booties and sandals through fashion innovation, highlighted by the continued success of our iconic 5050 Land and Nudist families, which brought in new and younger customers. We also expanded the casual assortment, including a broader sneaker offering in the recently introduced on-trend jelly style. At the same time, we dramatically simplified the product assortment with SKU counts declining approximately 45%.  
Third, we focused our distribution on markets and channels of greatest opportunity to create a foundation to return to profitability as revenues inflect. This included the exit of unprofitable markets across the globe and rightsizing of the fleet in North America. At the same time, momentum continued for our China business in fiscal '21, with revenue on the Mainland increasing over 35% compared to prior year, or nearly 50% on a 2-year basis. We kept the Chinese consumer at the forefront of our strategy, highlighted by our tailored product offerings, featuring capsule collections, relevant marketing with key opinion leaders and continued outperformance across digital channels. China remains an important area of long-term opportunity for Stuart Weitzman at structurally higher margins.  
Fourth, we strengthened our relationship with wholesale partners by providing relevant products in faster, more consistent execution. As previously shared, we reentered 90 Nordstrom doors in the year, fueling North America wholesale revenue ahead of pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter.  
Finally, we made progress in establishing a robust digital presence and drove approximately 30% e-commerce growth during the fiscal year, including continued strength in the fourth quarter even as store trends improved.  
In fiscal '22, our overarching goal is to return to profitability. We will recruit and engage customers through product that sparks desire with a focus on must-have launches featuring icons, key items and capsule collections as well as [indiscernible]; drive brand heat with a digital-first drumbeat of relevant romantic storytelling; fuel continued growth in China, including an expanded footprint and further investment in digital; elevate the omnichannel customer journey, including delivering a best-in-class digital experience; and accelerate wholesale partnerships with an expanded footprint in key accounts globally.  Overall, I'm pleased with the progress we've made at Stuart Weitzman, and we remain focused on restoring the brand's profitability.  
In closing, we are focused on driving our next phase of growth supported by our clear strategy, compelling brands and differentiated platform. Although the environment remains volatile, we see a strong consumer who is ready to shop and continuing to engage with our brands.  
We entered fiscal year '22 with a solid foundation, improved capabilities and increasing momentum. From this position of strength, we are confident in our ability to win with consumers and capture market share, accelerating growth and profitability across our portfolio long term, enhancing value for all stakeholders.  
With that, I'm pleased to welcome Scott Roe, who many of you know, to discuss our financial results, capital allocation priorities and fiscal '22 outlook. Scott?"

I'm thrilled to be with you today after joining Tapestry just a few months ago.  
While I'm still relatively new, I can already see that this is a truly unique company with strong and engaged talent, great brands that are well positioned in attractive market spaces and a distribution model that allows us to directly own our consumer relationships, coupled with advanced digital and analytics capabilities.  
As we move forward, my focus is to work alongside our management team to align business and financial strategies to drive sustainable long-term growth, which profits shareholders and all stakeholders alike.  
Looking back at fiscal year '21, it was a transformational year for the organization, as Joanne mentioned. We effectively executed our Acceleration Program against a difficult backdrop, creating a foundation for sustainable growth. Specifically, we increased the penetration of our margin-accretive digital and China businesses, which led overall growth in the fiscal year; we expanded gross margins primarily through higher AURs, driven by lower levels of promotional activity; we grew operating margin by 300 basis points versus FY '19, reaching peak levels at Tapestry. This, despite significant investments in talent, digital capabilities and marketing, which were more than funded by gross profit gains and $200 million in gross SG&A savings delivered through the Acceleration Program. And we further strengthened our financial position through tight inventory management and a reduction in debt levels while achieving $1.2 billion in free cash flow, resulting in an ending cash position of approximately $2 billion.  
Turning to the details of the fourth quarter. Total sales rose 126% versus prior year on a 14-week basis, or 113% on a 13-week basis, outpacing pre-pandemic levels, an important milestone. These results were led by strength at Coach, while Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman delivered material sequential improvements in trends.  
By region, North America led the overall growth, rising approximately 150% versus FY '20 and a high single-digit percentage versus FY '19, fueled by digital and a continued improvement in our brick-and-mortar businesses.  
In Mainland China, our strong momentum continued as revenue increased approximately 60% on a 1-year basis and over 40% compared to pre-pandemic levels.  Across the balance of Asia, sales rose materially compared to the prior year but remain below pre-pandemic levels, with notable pressure in Japan given the continued state of emergency and lack of tourist sales.  
In Europe, while a small portion of our total sales experienced a sequential improvement in trends on both the 1- and 2-year basis, as lockdown measures were lifted. And while revenue remained well below fiscal '19, given the lack of tourist travel, our local demand did rise in the quarter.  
By channel, we maintained strength in digital, which grew more than 35% compared to prior year, reaching 30% penetration. That's 3x 2019 levels. While our stores remain pressured, slightly better traffic drove a sequential improvement for the channel. And in wholesale, while revenue remained below FY '19, trends improved with particular strength in duty-free growth in China.  
Moving down the P&L. We realized another quarter of overall gross margin expansion compared to prior year and FY '19, with all brands exceeding expectations. We continued to successfully execute our strategy to maintain price discipline, reduce SKU counts and leverage data analytics to more effectively tailor our product assortment and marketing messaging to the consumer.  
As anticipated, SG&A rose significantly given the prior year's atypical comparison due to the impact of COVID-19. On a 2-year basis, the increase in SG&A was attributable to higher marketing spend of almost $100 million compared to Q4 '19 and an increase in our annual incentive plan given our outperformance this year. In addition, our expenses for the quarter included the $25 million contribution towards the endowment of the newly established Tapestry Foundation. Taken together, we achieved our fourth consecutive quarter of operating income growth and margin expansion compared to pre-pandemic levels. Earnings per diluted share for the quarter was $0.74 on a 14-week basis, or $0.65 on a 13-week basis, a significant increase compared to a loss in the prior year and 7% ahead of pre-pandemic EPS levels.  
Now moving to distribution. We continue to optimize our global fleet to prioritize profitability. For Tapestry, we closed a net of 59 locations globally in FY '21, including 10 net closures in the fourth quarter. As compared to fiscal '19 year-end, we have closed a net of 90 locations across our brands.  
Turning to a discussion of our balance sheet and cash flows. We ended the quarter in a strong position with $2 billion in cash and equivalents and total borrowings of $1.6 billion. Total inventory at quarter end was approximately in line with last year and 6% below FY '19, reflecting, in part, deliberate actions to reduce SKU counts and prioritize inventory turn. And we generated $1.2 billion in free cash flow in FY '21 versus $202 million in the prior year and $518 million in fiscal '19. This included CapEx of $116 million, a decline of 44% versus prior year as we prioritize investments in high-return projects, notably in digital, while tightly controlling overall spend and reducing our outlay for new stores.  
Now touching on our capital allocation priorities. First, we continue to prioritize investments in the business to support strong returns and long-term profitable growth.  Second, we're committed to returning capital to shareholders through both dividend and share repurchases. In keeping with this strategy, we're pleased to announce today a plan to return over $750 million to shareholders. Specifically, the Board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25, with an anticipated annual dividend rate of $1 per share. Over time, our intent is to increase the dividend at a faster rate than earnings growth. We also expect to repurchase approximately $500 million worth of stock in fiscal '22 under our current authorization.  Importantly, once we have more visibility into a normalization in the external environment, we expect over time to more aggressively return cash to shareholders.  
And finally, in keeping with our objective to reduce leverage, we expect to repay our July 2022 bonds totaling $400 million at the end of this fiscal year. So when considered together, the dividend, share repurchase and debt repayment are intended to approximately equal our projected free cash flow in the fiscal year. And as Joanne mentioned, these actions demonstrate our confidence in the underlying strength of our business as well as our commitment to driving total shareholder returns.  
Now moving to our fiscal '22 outlook. Before touching on the specific details, it's important to note the paradigm shift compared to just a year ago. Entering COVID, there was a macro demand concern, and we took bold actions to adjust supply in order to preserve liquidity.  
As you can see in our just-reported results, we were very successful in achieving our goals while continuing to accelerate investments to drive increasing momentum in our brands. Today, we find ourselves in a dynamic where the consumer demand backdrop is strong, while supply chain remains challenging. So I want to emphasize the underlying strength and trend of our business and separate that from the uncertainty in the macro environment primarily due to COVID-related impacts, which are largely out of our control. Therefore, the outlook we're giving you is a reflection of what we know as of today.  
It's a point in time. While we have visibility into the risk that we see on the horizon, we're not trying to predict that, which is unknowable. We have taken the position that we'll be aggressive on protecting the momentum of the business by securing significant expedited deliveries at an additional cost in order to mitigate the impact of supply chain disruptions at least through the holiday period. Further, we'll continue to increase AUR as prices are levered to counter some of the additional cost pressures. Of course, we'll continue to monitor the impact of the new developments on our outlook over time. 
Now turning to the details of our FY '22 outlook. Please note that all growth rates, as compared to prior year, are on a comparable 52-week basis. We expect revenue to increase at a mid-teens rate versus FY '21, resulting in approximately $6.4 billion in sales, which would mark a record for the company. This includes the expectation for a continuation of strong growth in digital and Greater China as well as improving global trends in stores. While we expect stores to show improvement, revenue is currently planned to remain below pre-pandemic levels. 
Turning to gross margin. We expect to sustain the company's strong margins through continued AUR improvements and lower promotional activity. Our outlook also incorporates the expectation for GST's renewal, with a retroactive benefit in the second fiscal quarter, which is currently planned to partially mitigate the negative impact associated with higher freight costs currently embedded in our plan. 
Touching on SG&A. We expect expenses to grow relatively in line with sales for the year. We continue to estimate that we will realize approximately $300 million in structural gross run rate expense savings, including $100 million of incremental savings from the prior year. We are utilizing these savings to fund investments in the business, including $50 million of planned higher marketing spend, which is expected to represent approximately 7% of sales in fiscal '22, up roughly 75% or 3 full percentage points compared to FY '19. 
We're also investing in our teams, adding talent to growing areas of the business such as digital, and we're focused on continuing to retain and develop these strong teams as evidenced by our recently announced commitment that all U.S. Tapestry employees will earn at least $15 per hour. 
Operating income is expected to increase at a mid-teens rate, resulting in operating margin modestly ahead of prior year and an increase of over 300 basis points versus 2019. Net interest expense for the year is expected to be $65 million, and the tax rate is estimated at 18.5%, assuming a continuation of current tax laws. 
Weighted average diluted share count is forecasted to be in the area of 283 million shares, approximately even with last year, with share repurchase activity expected to offset dilution. We anticipate EPS to be in the range of $3.30 to $3.35, reflecting leverage to the bottom line. CapEx for the year is projected to be about $220 million. We anticipate approximately 40% of the spend to be related to store development, primarily in China, with the balance dedicated to our digital and IT initiatives, including the initial investments related to build-out of our new distribution center. Specifically, as our digital business continues to grow, we've recognized the opportunity to sharpen our focus on the consumer by expanding our distribution capabilities. 
We recently signed a lease for a new distribution facility based in Las Vegas, which we believe will allow us to better serve our customers in the western part of the United States. Finally, we expect inventory levels to be up meaningfully throughout the year as we pull forward receipts to match strong demand and face elongated lead times from supply chain pressures due to COVID disruptions. 
Given the dynamic environment and last year's atypical comparisons, we again expect significant variability by quarter. Revenue growth versus prior year is expected to be front-half weighted given relatively easier compares due to lapping COVID impacts, with the first quarter forecasted to increase more than 20%. Earnings growth in the first half is expected to be somewhat pressured due to incremental SG&A investments along with last year's unusual compare, including lower expenses due to compensation reductions, lease abatements and the timing of government assistance. That said, we still expect EPS growth in the first half versus prior year, particularly in Q1. 
So in closing, we drove strong results in FY '21. Our significant progress is a testament to the successful execution by our passionate teams; the power of our brands and our competitive advantages, including our differentiated platform; the bold and deliberate actions we've made under Tapestry's Acceleration Program that transformed our organization. These changes are foundational and will continue to be a meaningful point of difference for our brands. 
As we look ahead, with regard to those things we can control, we're continuing to build momentum, and we are confident in our ability to leverage the solid foundation to drive sustainable top and bottom line growth across our portfolio of brands. And with respect to those things we can't control, we've taken aggressive actions to protect our strong momentum and mitigate those macro challenges we see today. Our conviction is underscored by our capital allocation actions, highlighting our optimism for the future and commitment to enhancing value for all stakeholders. 
I'd now like to open it up for Q&A."

I would say that our confidence begins with the standout results we delivered this fiscal year. Fiscal '21 was a year of successful transformation for the company, and it was capped by a strong fourth quarter. 
We saw sales trends improve every quarter of the year and exceeded pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter. For the year, we delivered record operating income and record operating margin as a multi-brand company despite the challenging backdrop, and we see momentum building as we enter fiscal '22. And you can see that in the outlook we shared. 
We expect to reach a record level of revenue for fiscal '22 at $6.4 billion on mid-teens growth. And we see further untapped potential longer term, particularly in digital and China. And those represent sustainable top and bottom line growth vehicles going forward. 
I think importantly, we're investing in long-term growth drivers. We're investing in marketing and we're investing in digital and our people. And while we've made significant progress this past year, we're just getting started. 
As Scott said, we're operating from a position of strength as a fundamentally different company today. We're reaching -- through our Acceleration Program, we took bold actions and we're now reaching new customers in new ways as a more agile organization. And the actions we took not only delivered a strong year, but positioned us to thrive on the other side of the pandemic. 
And we're better equipped as a company, I would say, to pull these levers -- growth levers going forward. We have new capabilities to engage consumers and drive higher lifetime value. And we have 4 million new consumers that we acquired in the last year alone who are increasingly younger. 
We have -- we're delivering really strong gross margins at increasing AUR, showing pricing power in our brands. And we have a direct-to-consumer model building strength in digital and China with significant runway ahead. 
And Scott also mentioned, we have a strong team, and we continue to invest in our team to secure that competitive advantage. So I would say, overall, we're operating from a position of strength. We're building momentum, and we see significant runway ahead for all of our brands."

So welcome, Scott, and I can't wait to hear -- or see the man satchel you'll be sporting next time we all travel together. I guess it's going to be an upgrade. 
So I guess my question is on the Kate Spade margins, really good to see some of the green shoots that you have there now and the expansion relative to 2019. But they still trail the Coach brand by 20 percentage points. 
So just curious, I guess, maybe Joanne and Scott, for you, how you see that evolving over time. Really, what's the potential with the Kate Spade margin profile over time? 
And then if I can just have a clarification from Todd. The AUR for Coach, I believe you said was up high single digits. How did that compare outlet versus full price in the quarter?"

We are really pleased with our execution in fiscal '21. And we made important progress. You noted the progress on margin, but we made important progress across the foundations of the brand. 
I'll just call out a few highlights. Kate is highly digitally penetrated. We showed continued strength in the digital channel. It now represents nearly 35% of sales for the brand. We're acquiring new customers, 1.4 million new customers during the year and we're reactivating customers at a more frequent rate. So 550,000 customers reactivated, a 35% increase from last year, and some of those customers are deeply lapsed customers. 
So when we think about the Kate Spade brand and engaging consumers and really building -- rebuilding the brand, we made really important progress. And I would say that partly is due to the fact that we've reenergized our core handbag offering. 
Liz and team have worked really quickly to build a stronger, more solid platform. We're seeing traction across our leather platform with the Knott, our signature platform we've talked about with the spade flower and our nylon platform with the reimagined handbag. 
And what we're seeing is the customer reacting to those changes in our assortment with increased global handbag AUR. So with handbag AURs moving higher, that's another sign of brand health. 
So longer term, we continue to have and see a path for Kate Spade to build to a $2 billion brand and, to your point, a significantly higher margins. We see a path to high teens margin opportunity. 
And as you compare it versus Coach, Kate Spade is a true full lifestyle brand. And there are some differences to the Coach business today. Kate Spade has, as I said, more lifestyle style categories. And right now, as a brand, it's centered more in North America and Japan. Doesn't have as developed an international business, but we see those as opportunities moving forward."

But underneath that, the Acceleration Program has -- and the savings according or attendant to that have given us the ability to see leverage elsewhere. So some of these things are certainly variable, right?

Thank you. We are really pleased with how we change the brand very materially over the last year plus, partly because of the Acceleration Program and partly because we really changed the conversation with our customer from leaning in and the call to action being around price and promotion to move to value and values. 
And this has really fundamentally changed us and it has really increased our AUR. Our approach to how we merchandise is fundamentally different. We have reduced our SKUs, but we've leaned into icon. And Stuart Vevers and the creative team have been getting data from the customer and really leaning in. 
So you've mentioned Tabby. Tabby is a brand -- is a collection we launched in June of '19. By February of '21, it would normally have been out of the mix. Instead, we doubled down, we relaunched it with Pillow Tabby. It became the #1 bag. You saw this month, we've launched Soft Tabby. And then we're going to see Pillow Tabby reemerge. 
So having these iconic styles that are not so pressured by short selling window really materially changes our outlook. 
And then regarding lifestyle. One of the opportunities, I think, we have is while we call it men's, men's product is an all-gender product often. And one of the things we recognize is we can do better, not necessarily merchandising it exactly the same way we merchandise historically women's product. 
So you'll see us mix in more outerwear, more cut-and-sew opportunities, and it is really resonating with our customer. And then finally, I'm a big believer and have been for many years in the opportunities that we have with footwear. And you're seeing us win in those category, both in our own stores, retail and outlet, but even in wholesale, which is obviously a very competitive environment, that is the most democratic environment. And when we're winning there, we know we actually are winning in the category."

I wonder how you think what the appropriate level is early on? 
And then, I'd also be curious on the SG&A guidance, just to follow up with Mark's question earlier. This will be the first year in a more normal environment -- more normal after you did a big reset to the structure of SG&A last year. So I know there's a lot more variability in there. Scott, you took some corporate costs out and you're generating really good ROAs on the marketing investments you've made. It sounds like you still have good growth from high-margin drivers like AUR, take margin targets high teens over time versus the 10% exit rate this year. 
So I'm just wondering, it seems like a lot of good margin drivers in there. To the extent that we do see revenues coming in above plan, how should we think about what flows through to earnings this year in an upside scenario for revenues?"

First of a",521,"Yes. Well, first of all, Michael, good to talk to you again. As usual, very thorough and comprehensive on your insights here. 
So let's start with capital allocation and how we're thinking about it. I think a little context first is important. First of all, don't lose the message here. The reinstatement of the dividend, the reinstatement of the repurchase program, $750 million intended return of cash is really a testament to our underlying confidence in the business. So that -- I think that's the important message here. 
And if you think about the journey over the last year, early on in COVID, given the massive uncertainty and demand issues, we took a lot of actions to protect liquidity, to protect the enterprise with our rating agencies, bankers, bondholders, et cetera. There was a commitment on deleveraging and the glide path that we laid out. 
So the great news here is we're able to not only advance on that glide path and even be a little ahead of it. You heard us mention paying off the $400 million of debt at the end of this fiscal year, which is our intent and reinstate the dividend. And we still have a strong balance sheet and we still have ample cash. 
We're in between these 2 periods, right, where we see much more confidence, and that's why we've stated the aggressive return to shareholder cash -- or returning cash to shareholders. But at the same time, we think it's prudent to take -- to keep a little elevated cash position given the uncertainty of the environment. 
So my comment was really intended to signal that while we're definitely in a more confident position, we're engaging in repurchases and dividends, we're still maintaining an elevated buffer until we get better line of sight on what COVID, Delta variant, et cetera, the uncertainty, how that evolves. 
Once we have that confidence, there's no reason that we wouldn't be -- go back to kind of normal levels, and we have opportunities to be even a little more aggressive from a return of cash to shareholders. 
So that was the intent, right, to say we're not going ditch to ditch here, right? We've made progress, but we want to watch the uncertainty. 
As it relates to margin flows, again, I'd point you back -- SG&A, the picture there is the tale of two things. We have the benefits around acceleration, which are providing leverage throughout the P&L and allow us to reinvest obviously, in a very -- in a -- we have variability and we're making choices. Those choices are based on the insights and data that we have, and we've seen it pay off, right? So that's why we've given guidance that says we do expect to expand margins next year. 
Should we get more upside? Would some of that flow through? Depends. Yes, likely. But we're also going to look at where we can lean in and advance our platforms and capabilities for the future. But we expect expanding margins, and you should expect that some of that would flow through as we see upside."

And our intention is to structure our business so that we can continue to engage consumers across all of our brands and create -- and continue to create and tap into growth. 
And we have seen tremendous traction over the past year based on these capabilities. The investments that we're making in marketing are across the funnel. And I think that's important to know too, because as we get better at measuring our returns, we're getting better at measuring returns across the full funnel. So it's not only performance marketing, but it is about brand building and measuring our returns on those brand-building investments we're making. 
Of course, digital is a priority. We're better able to engage consumers on many digital platforms, and we're driving innovation there. We've called out the work we've done on live streaming and TikTok with even organic and viral videos on TikTok. So we're continuing to innovate, we're investing across the funnel, and we think that is an important enabler as we look to unlock future growth."

And our outlook reflects additional airfreight really through the holiday period, which is as far as we can see in terms of getting the deliveries and trying to maintain the strong momentum we have. 
You heard Joanne say it, right? The great news here is demand for our brands is strong. And while we see some disruption, we're taking bold actions, and we got out ahead of this a little bit in terms of securing as much supply as we can to keep that strong momentum going. 
Now we've talked about gross margins being roughly equal to this year, and that means we're consolidating on record-high gross margins, up 300 basis points versus a couple of years ago. 
And underneath that, we have some elevated costs related to expedited freight. We also see the continuing build in AUR pricing leverage, less discount and the general trend of the business, which is helping us offset that. So those are the puts and the takes. 
I would say though, by quarter. It's not necessarily going to be a straight line. We're going to see, as some of this freight cost turns into the P&L, it may not come exactly matched with some of the price increases. But over time, for the year, that's the picture that we see."

So first of all, yes, we had a great performance from an inventory standpoint for all the reasons that have already been said and done versus the last couple of years. This is part of a very focused effort in simplifying, reducing SKUs, and seeing real progress there, and it's one of the factors for cash flow. 
But as we look to next year, we are going to see elevated inventory positions starting in the first quarter. And the reason for that is twofold. Number one, just supporting the growth of the business. 
Number two, we're expediting, as I said, what we can to bring in inventory, whether it be even by air or by sea, we're getting inventory in as fast as we can reasonably do in order to keep the momentum of the business. And those factors together are going to be a slightly elevated increase in inventory. 
But I have no concerns about this at all. This is inventory that is supporting the trend of the business. And frankly, if we could get more, we probably would. So you're going to see that dynamic play out. It's not significant, but understand what's really driving it. 
And you asked about our ability to chase. Listen, we're doing what we can. I just told you expedited airfreight. We're looking to -- I think we were quick to get in front of our suppliers, and we've secured what we can. So to the best of our ability, we will chase. It's going to be a difficult environment to chase, frankly, given the dynamic in the short term. But we feel good about all the levers that are in our control to set us up as well as we can."

I'm pleased to report that the strong momentum we saw throughout last year has accelerated further in the first quarter, with our sales now 9% above pre-pandemic levels. Our operating margin has improved 8.5 points compared to fiscal year '20, even as we've reinvested in key growth drivers for our business. 
The fundamental changes we've made through the acceleration program to transform Tapestry and our brands have enabled our teams to act with agility to drive highly effective customer engagement and support increasing demand. This performance also reaffirms our confidence in our differentiated platform. Our 3 unique brands are enabled by our talented teams, technology infrastructure, globally diversified supply chain and a 90% direct-to-consumer model. These assets, coupled with our growing data and consumer insights capabilities, have fueled more targeted product development, more efficient pricing and more effective marketing. All of which support accelerating revenue, higher gross margin, improving profitability, and most importantly, stronger connections with our customers. 
Now turning to the highlights from the first quarter. 
We continued to make meaningful progress against the Acceleration Program by sharpening our focus on the consumer, leveraging data to lead with a digital-first mindset and transforming Tapestry into a more responsive organization. 
First, we kept the consumer at the forefront of our strategy, which drove further increases in customer recruitment. In fact, we acquired approximately 1.6 million new customers across our direct channels in North America, an increase of over 20%, with growth in both stores and online. 
Second, we leveraged our unique data and analytics capabilities to enhance engagement with our consumers. As a result, retention improved year-over-year at each brand, including strong reengagement with the 4 million customers acquired last year in our North America digital channels. In addition, we drove a higher number of repeat transactions and reactivated lapsed customers at an increasing rate. These examples highlight the advancements we've made to utilize customer insights, to increase engagement with our brands and drive higher lifetime value. 
Third, we enhanced our expertise in the digital channel, a margin-accretive business, across brands. We've made significant investments, including in talent, to improve the customer experience and drive conversion. As a result, we realized a sequential acceleration in e-commerce revenue trends in the quarter, a meaningful achievement as we lap difficult online comparisons from last year. Sales rose close to 50%, with digital penetration now nearly 4x pre-pandemic levels. At the same time, trends across our global store fleet again improved, with operating margins that continued to exceed pre-pandemic levels. 
Fourth, we further strengthened our positioning in China, a region that represents significant long-term opportunity, supported by the rising middle class. While COVID resurgences during the quarter impacted traffic across the industry, we delivered sales growth of over 25%. Compared to pre-pandemic levels, sales increased roughly 65%, accelerating versus the prior quarter. And importantly, we grew on both the mainland and with Chinese consumers globally, which increased at a low double-digit rate versus fiscal year '20. 
And fifth, we increased global AUR at each of our brands, reflecting traction with our customer base and the deliberate structural changes we've made to reduce promotional activity and improve assortment productivity. 
Now let me touch on the first quarter highlights for each of our brands. 
Coach delivered another exceptional quarter, accelerating further off an already strong base. Revenue rose 27%, representing an increase of 15% compared to pre-pandemic levels or a 13 point sequential improvement. Operating margin expanded, fueled by gross margin, which reached nearly 75%, the highest rate in any quarter in the last 10 years. These results are a testament to the increasing brand heat and strong customer demand and engagement we're seeing at Coach, highlighting progress against the brand's fiscal year '22 growth strategies. 
First, we drove another quarter of AUR gains as we benefited from strengthening pricing power and our deliberate actions to improve SKU productivity and lower promotional activity. Globally, Coach's handbag AUR increased high single-digits in both the retail and outlet channels. In addition, we achieved the tenth consecutive quarter of AUR improvements in North America, which rose low double-digits. 
This continued improvement reflects our pricing power and strong engagement with consumers as we focus on enhancing customer lifetime value. In the quarter, we acquired over 900,000 new customers across our North America channels, a high-teens increase compared to the prior year. At the same time, purchase frequency rose versus last year. 
Second, we continued to develop our iconic families to create a foundation for our product pipeline in future seasons with notable strength in key families such as Tabby and Rogue. In addition, we are led by Stuart Vevers creative vision, who is building on 80 years of iconic Coach codes, notably the signature C and horse and carriage. Both of which have supported increasing sales across all channels. 
Third, we increased investments and drove stronger returns in marketing, leveraging our data capabilities to drive outsized growth in our digital business. In the first quarter, e-commerce increased over 60%, representing a sequential improvement on both a 1- and 2-year basis, underscoring the significant opportunity that this channel represents. 
Fourth, we again drove growth in China. Sales rose over 25% compared to last year, with improvements across stores and e-commerce as we diversify our approach to meet the customer where they want to shop. This includes better leveraging existing platforms and establishing relationships with new online forums. As we build on the strength of our brand and our positioning with the emerging middle class, we continue to see tremendous long-term potential in China. 
And fifth, we outperformed in the men's business in keeping with our ambition to deliver $1 billion in sales in the category over our planning horizon. In the quarter, we reinvigorated some of our iconic leather goods silhouettes, infusing camoprint in retail and the Basquiat collaboration in outlet. 
In summary, Coach continues to stand out even amid external pressures. Customers are engaging with the brand at an increasing rate given the traction of our product and marketing. We're driving continued momentum as we enter the important holiday quarter. The brand has proven that the foundational changes we've made are working and our results are sustainable. We are increasingly confident in our ability to drive both revenue and profit gains for fiscal '22 and beyond. 
Now moving to Kate Spade. The brand continued to make steady progress against its strategic priorities and outperformed internal expectations across the P&L. We built on the increasing traction we're seeing with consumers, which drove top line improvement during the quarter. Importantly, direct sales, excluding wholesale, increased mid single-digits versus pre-pandemic levels, a sequential improvement compared to the fourth quarter. These results confirm that the growth strategies we're executing to return Kate Spade to its roots and improve the underlying foundation of the brand are taking hold. 
In the quarter, we maintained a consumer-centric approach in our execution, acquiring over 650,000 new customers across channels in North America, a significant increase over last year. At the same time, we reactivated lapsed customers with outsized growth among those customers lapsed over 3 years, reflecting a renewed connection with our core customers and confirming the efforts to clarify the brand's positioning are gaining traction. 
Second, we continued to build out our core product offering by amplifying key platforms. Most notably, the Knott and spade flower again outperformed expectation and act as strong foundations for future growth. The strength of these recent introductions, coupled with deliberate actions to improve full-price selling and pull back on promotional activity, fueled another quarter of global handbag AUR growth, which rose low double-digits. The progress we've made has increased our confidence in Kate Spade's pricing power as we deepen our connection with consumers and execute on our strategic agenda. 
Third, we drove brand heat by deploying marketing centered on our Kate Spade community and leaning into our DNA as a best-in-class storytelling brand. We employed new ways of reaching our customers, including a variety of social media platforms and a reimagined and uniquely Kate Spade approach to New York Fashion Week, which featured a pop-up Apple Orchard in downtown Manhattan, incorporating our iHeart New York collection. 
Fourth, we maximized our lifestyle positioning by continuing to strengthen the foundation of ready wear footwear and jewelry. All of which outperformed our expectations. Overall, the brand's differentiated and broad offering supports our goal to increase lifetime value as those customers buying lifestyle products tend to purchase more frequently and spend more. 
And fifth, we utilized our already strong digital platform to continue to grow e-commerce sales, which rose over 15% in the quarter as we test, learn and scale innovative and new ways to engage the consumer online. 
In closing, we're leading with our values to strengthen the emotional connection with our passionate Kate Spade community. We are excited by the brand's progress. And our solid performance underscores that we have the right strategy in place. We have significant in confident in our ability to achieve $2 billion in revenue at high-teens operating margins over the planning horizon. 
Turning now to Stuart Weitzman. The brand has made continued progress towards achieving our overarching goal of restoring profitability in the current fiscal year. To achieve this, we advanced our growth strategies in the quarter. 
First, we improved operating margin compared to prior year, further increasing our confidence in a return to profitability this year. This was driven by continued outperformance in high-growth areas, including digital and China. Our e-commerce channels rose over 30% globally, driven by customer experience upgrades to improve conversion. And in China, a market that remains a significant opportunity for the brand, revenue increased over 25%. 
Second, we recruited an increasing number of new customers compared to last year and drove higher retention rates overall. The consumer remains at the forefront of our strategy as we capitalize on shifting market trends, most notably the return to in-person socialization and the growing need for occasion and dressy footwear. At the same time, our iconic collections continue to resonate, notably the Nudist family, which brought an increasing number of new and younger customers to the brand. 
Third, we drove brand heat through a tailored offering supported by marketing actions to engage the consumer. Stuart Weitzman's momentum was evidenced by a return to AUR growth, which rose low double-digits compared to prior year, reflecting deliberate actions to lower promotional activity as well as select price increases, which we intend to continue on a strategic basis. This was a key driver of the gross margin expansion of over 250 basis points. 
Fourth, we strengthened our wholesale partnerships, specifically with key domestic full-price partners, resulting in high-teens growth in the channel. 
Overall, our solid execution is evidenced by our improving financial performance. We're laser-focused on the consumer by offering compelling product and marketing to enhance customer engagement and increase our productivity in key regions and channels. This in turn will support our goal to restore profitability in fiscal '22. 
Now turning to the overarching strategies for the holiday quarter. The consumer backdrop is healthy. And our recent internal survey work in North America highlights the demand for the handbag and footwear categories remain strong. We're remaining nimble on keeping the customer at the center of our priorities. 
First, we are controlling the factors within our control and playing offense. We've moved quickly and taken bold and deliberate actions to mitigate industry-wide inventory constraints. We're also messaging to customers earlier in the holiday season to elongate the shopping period and capture demand early. Importantly, we will be maintaining our discipline around discounting and selectively increasing prices as we lead with messaging on innovation and value over price. Separately, we are creating engaging omnichannel customer experiences as in-store traffic continues to improve and online engagement increases. 
Across brands, we're employing exciting initiatives to surprise and delight consumers during this important shopping period. At Coach, we've kicked off the holiday season in a truly iconic fashion with our recreation of Jennifer Lopez's All I Have video nearly 2 decades after the original, featuring our signature codes. At Kate Spade, we're creating magical holiday moments with our, To All A Sparkly Night collection, which captures the sense that the littlest things can be life's biggest indulgences. And at Stuart Weitzman, our recently launched campaign featuring Kate Hudson arrives just in time for the start of the holiday season as well as celebrations for our 35th anniversary. 
Overall, our first quarter results and the momentum we're delivering are evidence that our strategy, led by the Acceleration Program, is working. We've radically transformed our company, realizing material operating margin improvement while fueling investments in key growth areas of our business. 
We're largely a direct-to-consumer business with a digital-first mindset, building a deeper understanding of our customers. We're utilizing these capabilities along with the additional benefits of our multi-brand platform to drive even further growth at Coach and accelerate the trajectory of both Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman over our planning horizon. 
I'm encouraged by the growing vibrancy of each of our brands and the strengthening engagement with consumers, backed by the work of our talented and passionate teams. Our confidence is underscored by the stronger outlook for fiscal year '22 and additional shareholder return plans announced today. 
We've entered the second quarter with momentum and have proactively put in place plans to deliver for our customers this holiday season and into the new year. We are well positioned to capture market share at structurally higher operating margin in the years to come, creating significant value for all our stakeholders. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Scott, who will discuss our financial results, capital deployment priorities and fiscal year '22 outlook. Scott?"

We delivered another quarter of high-quality earnings results, outpacing last year, pre-pandemic levels and expectations. We continue to execute against the strategies of our acceleration program, building upon the foundational changes made in fiscal year '21 against the difficult backdrop. We drove continued top line momentum and improved operating margin meaningfully, fueled by gross margin expansion. 
Turning to the details of the first quarter. 
Total sales increased 26% versus prior year and outperformed expectations. Compared to pre-pandemic levels, revenue rose 9%, representing an 8-point acceleration compared to the prior quarter, fueled by improvements across all channels, stores, digital and wholesale. 
By region, revenue rose double-digits versus last year in Mainland China, North America and Europe. Importantly, these regions improved on a 2-year basis, including relative outperformance of North America, which rose at a high-teens percentage compared to pre-pandemic levels. In Mainland China, while there were pockets of COVID increases, overall momentum continued. And in Europe, we realized improving trends as lockdown measures were lifted. 
Moving down the P&L. We expanded gross margin at each brand during the quarter. These results reflect a continuation of the successful execution of our strategy as we maintain price discipline, improve SKU productivity and leverage our data analytics capabilities to more effectively tailor our product assortment and marketing messaging to the consumer. 
SG&A rose relatively in line with sales, given the reinvestment of cost savings into the organic business, the prior year's atypical comparison due to COVID-19 and the impact from higher sales. Taken together, we achieved operating income growth and margin expansion both company-wide and at each individual brand. 
Earnings per diluted share for the quarter was $0.82, an increase of 42% compared to the prior year and more than doubling pre-pandemic levels. 
Now turning to our balance sheet and cash flow as well as an update to our capital deployment plans. 
We ended the quarter in a strong position, with $1.7 billion in cash and investments and total borrowings of $1.6 billion. Therefore, given the strong results of our first quarter, our robust balance sheet, significant free cash flow generation and outlook for growth, we're announcing an incremental $1 billion share repurchase program, as highlighted in our press release. As such, we now expect to return approximately $1.25 billion to shareholders in the fiscal year, a meaningful increase compared to our previous outlook to return $750 million to shareholders in fiscal '22. This return reflects approximately $1 billion of share repurchases in the fiscal year, which consists of $600 million to complete our existing program, inclusive of the 250 million of shares already repurchased in the first quarter. And we expect to utilize approximately $400 million under our new program in fiscal '22. In addition, our shareholder return plans continue to forecast approximately $250 million return through our dividend program. 
Overall, the organic business momentum and the actions announced today underscore our commitment to capital allocation priorities: first, investing in the business to drive long-term profitable growth; and second, returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In addition, we still intend to repay our July 2022 bonds totaling $400 million by the end of the fiscal year. These actions highlight our confidence in the strength of our brands, our ability to drive sustainable growth and our commitment to returning capital to shareholders. 
Now moving to our fiscal year '22 outlook. 
Before turning to the specific details, I want to touch on the current state of the industry. The external environment continues to be dynamic as consumer demand remains solid with supply chain headwinds are constricting inventory availability. We certainly see the same dynamic within our business as demand for our brands remains robust. As Joanne mentioned, we've acted early and boldly to maintain the momentum we're seeing across each of our brands. While we're not immune to external factors nor can we predict future challenges that may come, the bold actions we've taken to secure supply, along with our experience at reacting with agility to a constantly changing landscape over the last 18 months or so, gives us confidence to increase our annual guidance. 
Please note that all growth rates compared to prior year are on a comparable 52-week basis, excluding the impact of our 53rd week last year. So let's unpack this increase in outlook. 
We now expect revenue to approach $6.6 billion, which would mark a record for the company. This represents a mid-teens increase compared to fiscal '21. Our outlook for operating income is now expected to grow at the high end of our previous growth expectation for a mid-teens increase compared to prior year, resulting in modest operating margin expansion. This contemplates modest gross margin pressure due entirely to the incremental freight investments in order to maintain product flow to meet strong consumer demand. This pressure is expected to be most acute in Q2 and Q3. Excluding this additional freight impact of approximately 200 basis points, we are driving continued underlying gross margin expansion through lower discounting, improved SKU productivity, along with price increases that will be implemented for the balance of the year across brands. 
In addition, we now expect modest SG&A leverage for the fiscal year. We continue to expect about $300 million in structural gross run rate expense savings as a result of the Acceleration Program. As previously shared, we are reinvesting these benefits to fuel growth, including $90 million in higher marketing spend or approximately 3 percentage points higher than fiscal '19. We're also investing further in our digital talent and capabilities. 
Net interest expense for the year is expected to be $65 million. And the tax rate is estimated at 18.5%, assuming a continuation of current tax laws. We're now forecasting weighted average diluted share count to be in the area of 278 million shares, incorporating a planned $1 billion in share repurchases. So taken together, we now expect EPS to be in the range of $3.45 to $3.50, incorporating the first quarter's outperformance and an approximate $0.05 benefit from additional share repurchases. 
We continue to expect CapEx to be about $220 million for the year. Of this spend, we anticipate approximately 45% of it related to store development, primarily in China, with the balance dedicated to our digital and IT initiatives. This also includes initial investments related to the build-out of our new fulfillment center to support both growth and speed to market. 
Finally, we expect inventory levels to be up meaningfully during the balance of this year as we pull forward receipts to match strong demand and face elongated lead times from supply chain pressures due to COVID disruptions. As mentioned, we're taking deliberate steps to accelerate inventory growth. And we feel comfortable in our inventory positioning to meet demand. 
Given the dynamic environment and last year's atypical comparisons, we expect variability by quarter. To provide some guardrails on Q2 specifically, revenue is forecasted to grow high teens, reflecting continued momentum on a 2-year basis. Operating income is projected to be in the area of prior year levels, which contemplates incremental airfreight of approximately $70 million in the quarter or roughly 350 basis points. In addition, we have shifted the benefit from the reinstatement of GSP into the second half of the fiscal year. As a reminder, GSP is expected to benefit the full year by almost 50 basis points. So taken together, while margin pressure is anticipated in the second quarter, our full year operating margin outlook remains unchanged, as our underlying business momentum and price increases are estimated to offset costs and inflationary pressures. As a result, EPS in Q2 is expected to be relatively in line with prior year. 
In closing, we entered the fiscal year with strong momentum, reflecting the benefits of the deliberate and decisive actions we've made under our acceleration program. We're continuing to focus on what's in our control as we navigate a dynamic operating environment. And we're taking bold steps to ensure that we can meet robust underlying demand for our brands without compromising our long-term operating margins that are already up significantly. We're increasing both our fiscal year revenue and EPS guidance as well as our expected return of cash to shareholders. 
Overall, our strategy is working. I'm confident that we're in a position to create significant value for all our stakeholders in the years to come. 
I'd now like to open up the call for your questions."

We're seeing a strong consumer backdrop, and we're taking bold actions to manage the environment. 
We're pleased with the momentum we're seeing across brands. The actions we've taken through our Acceleration Program have transformed our company and are driving strong and sustainable results. We see brand heat building as evidenced with the AUR growth that we're delivering in each of our brands. We're also seeing acceleration in top line trends. In the first quarter, we delivered growth of 9% above pre-pandemic levels, which was an 8-point acceleration from the fourth quarter. We're delivering that with significant gross margin expansion, which is allowing us to deliver structurally higher operating margin while also reinvesting in the key growth drivers of the business. And we're seeing continued strength in digital in China, which are 2 areas that we've talked about represent long-term opportunity for Tapestry. As I mentioned, as we look at the landscape, consumer spending is healthy, and demand for our categories remains very strong. 
So although the environment continues to be dynamic, we've moved aggressively to manage the supply side of the equation, to protect the strong trends that we're seeing and serve our customers, really keeping the customer at the center of our strategy and of our execution. Our teams have a proven track record of managing these dynamics. And we are very confident in our ability to deliver for our customers this holiday and beyond. And that confidence, Bob, is really evidenced by the increased guidance and incremental share repurchase programs that we announced today."

So on a direct basis, we are growing above pre-pandemic levels, and that improved quarter-over-quarter. And we are focused on returning the brand to its roots and driving stronger consumer engagement. We acquired over 650,000 new customers across North America channels to the brand this past quarter alone. And we're reactivating lapsed customers at an increasing rate, which gives us confidence that the strategy is working, that we're reaching the core Kate Spade consumer. And we've worked hard to improve the product assortment there. We talked about new platforms like the nut and spade flower, which continue to perform. And those represent important platforms for future growth. And we're seeing increased global handbag AUR. AURs grew low double-digits.

Maybe just a little bit of perspective before I get into the quarter-by-quarter details. Remember, the last time we spoke to you all, we talked about reopening in our largest single supply source,",375,"Yes. Erinn, I'll jump in on your freight question as well. Maybe just a little bit of perspective before I get into the quarter-by-quarter details. Remember, the last time we spoke to you all, we talked about reopening in our largest single supply source, Vietnam, which is about 40% of our supply base. We expected that to start reopening in August. And in fact, that occurred about 7 weeks later. And so what we decided -- to just build on Joanne's comments, early and boldly, so we did secure air freight. The reason I give you that perspective because it's important as you take not only about the flow by quarter, but also, at this point, we now see that we're approaching normalized level of production. We see goods flowing. We have much better visibility than we did the last time we spoke, even at the SKU level, so we can merchandise against the product flow that we see. So the result of that is the exceptional air freight that we have used to bridge that gap and meet this really strong consumer demand that we see. That's starting to moderate as you get into back half of the year. 
So as you think about gross margin shaping, you just saw the gross margin in Q1, up 450 basis points from 2 years ago. You're going to see, we said, elevated air freight in Q2 and Q3. We gave you our best estimate. Obviously, it matters as we see what exact products sell through. And there could be a little timing between Q2 and Q3. But think about that as roughly equal from an air freight standpoint. But remember, in the second half, we start to see the increase in prices, making a meaningful impact. We talked about the change in GSP from a timing standpoint. So what that means is gross margins will be up in the second half and specifically in the fourth quarter. So that's one of the reasons we speak with confidence about our ability to maintain operating margins over time. We're exiting this year coming out of the fourth quarter with strong gross margins and the kind of increases that you're used to seeing from us on an overall basis."

And one of the things we've done differently now is, when we design a bag, we actually think about the market where that bag will do the best, and we price accordingly. So in the past, we might have priced at the lowest common denominator. Now we price at the highest common denominator."

As we embarked on our Acceleration Program, we saw a huge opportunity to better understand and serve our customers where they wanted to shop. And that really had us leaning into investments we had made historically, but leaning into our capabilities in digital and data. We are, as we said, 90% direct-to-consumer business. We know a lot about our customers. And we knew we had an opportunity to better engage our customers and meet customers as their shopping behaviors were changing. So we have invested quite a bit, and we've grown that business tremendously. We are seeing continued engagement, at Coach, where we have runway, but across all of our brands. We're seeing continued engagement, customer acquisition through digital channels. That's not to say that's our only focus. We -- the omnichannel customer and customer shopping behaviors are changing and continue to change rapidly. So we're staying close to the customer. And we want to be available with our brand to our customers where they want to shop and how they want to shop. And we're staying close to that. We're making the investments we need to make. And we're seeing really high returns on those investments, leveraging data and getting closer to our consumers. Leaning into those digital capabilities has been paying off. And it's not just acquisition. As I mentioned earlier, it's really -- once we acquire our consumers driving to drive higher lifetime value. And that's engaging them across our broad array of categories in each of our brands. So proud of the work the teams are doing. As I mentioned, it's early days for us. We're happy and very pleased with the traction we're seeing, but a long runway ahead."

I guess the first thing I need to remind you of is we have given no guidance beyond our current outlook. So there's -- we're not at a point where we're ready to have that conversation. 
But I would point you to a few things. So you're exactly right. As we grow our digital business, it's one of our most profitable channels and actually our most profitable. And as Joanne said, it's -- our penetration is now 4x what it was just 2 years ago. And the data and analytics that Joanne just outlined and some of the things Todd said around pricing and our opportunity, we see that absolutely -- we're using data better, understanding our consumer at a more intimate level. And all that gives us confidence that we can maintain our margins. On the other hand, don't forget, we are in an elevated cost environment. So we -- that's not new. We've been seeing this for a while, and input costs are up. The great news is we've got visibility to it. We see that we have the pricing power, and that gives us confidence to maintain those margins over time. So more to come as we get closer to next year, but I think what I hope you would take away from that is the things that we're seeing and demonstrating this year and our outlook are structurally favorable for us as we look to the future."

It starts with getting to know our customers and being clear on who our target customers are for each of our brands. And then serving those customers, understanding them and then serving them with great creative product, and then making sure we've got the right assortments in the right places. So we're leveraging data and analytics, plus the creativity of our talented creative teams to put the right assortments in the right places and manage inventory in the right way. 
And then the marketing investments that we've made is we've structurally changed the pitch of our P&L to invest more in those things that will drive acquisition, retention, those investments in the growth drivers in digital and in marketing. At the same time we're doing that, we're increasing our -- improving our capabilities to understand and reach customers. So we have specific strategies that we're executing. We've got a test and learn framework that our teams are executing under. And we're innovating constantly as we learn how to better engage our consumers, bring them back more frequently, serve them, better messaging. And those are the things that are working.

But I think maybe even more important is the focus on engagement of the employees. As someone relatively new to the story here, as I've come in, I've been very impressed with how high the engagement scores are on our retail employees and distribution centers. This is an area that's been a long-term focus. It's a people-centered approach.

526573,1686392043,2435252,"Tapestry, Inc., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 11, 2021",2021-11-11,"Earnings Calls","Tapestry, Inc.","Executives","Good morning. Thank you, Kelsey, and welcome, everyone. I am pleased to report that the strong momentum we saw throughout last year has accelerated further in the first quarter with our sales now 9% above pre-pandemic levels. Our operating margin has impr",2290,"Good morning. Thank you, Kelsey, and welcome, everyone. I am pleased to report that the strong momentum we saw throughout last year has accelerated further in the first quarter with our sales now 9% above pre-pandemic levels. Our operating margin has improved 8.5 points compared to fiscal year '20 even as we've reinvested in key growth drivers for our business.
The fundamental changes we've made through the Acceleration Program to transform Tapestry and our brands have enabled our teams to act with agility to drive highly effective customer engagement and support increasing demand. This performance also reaffirms our confidence in our differentiated platform. Our 3 unique brands are enabled by our talented teams, technology infrastructure, globally diversified supply chain and a 90% direct-to-consumer model.
These assets, coupled with our growing data and consumer insights capabilities, have fueled more targeted product development, more efficient pricing and more effective marketing, all of which support accelerating revenue, higher gross margin, improving profitability, and most importantly, stronger connections with our customers.
Now turning to the highlights from the first quarter. We continued to make meaningful progress against the Acceleration Program by sharpening our focus on the consumer, leveraging data to lead with a digital-first mindset and transforming Tapestry into a more responsive organization.
First, we kept the consumer at the forefront of our strategy, which drove further increases in customer recruitment. In fact, we acquired approximately 1.6 million new customers across our direct channels in North America, an increase of over 20%, with growth in both stores and online.
Second, we leveraged our unique data and analytics capabilities to enhance engagement with our consumers. As a result, retention improved year-over-year at each brand, including strong reengagement with the 4 million customers acquired last year in our North America digital channels. In addition, we drove a higher number of repeat transactions and reactivated lapsed customers at an increasing rate. These examples highlight the advancements we've made to utilize customer insights, to increase engagement with our brands and drive higher lifetime value.
Third, we enhanced our expertise in the digital channel, a margin-accretive business, across brands. We've made significant investments, including in talent, to improve the customer experience and drive conversion. As a result, we realized a sequential acceleration in e-commerce revenue trends in the quarter, a meaningful achievement as we lap difficult online comparisons from last year. Sales rose close to 50%, with digital penetration now nearly 4x pre-pandemic levels. At the same time, trends across our global store fleet again improved, with operating margins that continued to exceed pre-pandemic levels.
Fourth, we further strengthened our positioning in China, a region that represents significant long-term opportunity, supported by the rising middle class. While COVID resurgences during the quarter impacted traffic across the industry, we delivered sales growth of over 25%. Compared to pre-pandemic levels, sales increased roughly 65%, accelerating versus the prior quarter. And importantly, we grew on both the mainland and with Chinese consumers globally, which increased at a low double-digit rate versus fiscal year '20.
And fifth, we increased global AUR at each of our brands, reflecting traction with our customer base and the deliberate structural changes we've made to reduce promotional activity and improve assortment productivity.
Now let me touch on the first quarter highlights for each of our brands.
Coach delivered another exceptional quarter, accelerating further off an already strong base. Revenue rose 27%, representing an increase of 15% compared to pre-pandemic levels or a 13 point sequential improvement. Operating margin expanded, fueled by gross margin, which reached nearly 75%, the highest rate in any quarter in the last 10 years. These results are a testament to the increasing brand heat and strong customer demand and engagement we're seeing at Coach, highlighting progress against the brand's fiscal year '22 growth strategies.
First, we drove another quarter of AUR gains as we benefited from strengthening pricing power and our deliberate actions to improve SKU productivity and lower promotional activity. Globally, Coach's handbag AUR increased high single-digits in both the retail and outlet channels. In addition, we achieved the 10th consecutive quarter of AUR improvement in North America, which rose low double-digits. This continued improvement reflects our pricing power and strong engagement with consumers as we focus on enhancing customer lifetime value. In the quarter, we acquired over 900,000 new customers across our North America channels, a high-teens increase compared to the prior year. At the same time, purchase frequency rose versus last year.
Second, we continued to develop our iconic families to create a foundation for our product pipeline in future seasons with notable strength in key families such as Tabby and Rogue. In addition, we are led by Stuart Vevers' creative vision, who is building on 80 years of iconic Coach codes, notably the signature C and Horse & Carriage, both of which have supported increasing sales across all channels.
Third, we increased investments and drove stronger returns in marketing, leveraging our data capabilities to drive outsized growth in our digital business. In the first quarter, e-commerce increased over 60%, representing a sequential improvement on both a 1- and 2-year basis, underscoring the significant opportunity that this channel represents.
Fourth, we again drove growth in China. Sales rose over 25% compared to last year, with improvements across stores and e-commerce as we diversify our approach to meet the customer where they want to shop. This includes better leveraging existing platforms and establishing relationships with new online forums. As we build on the strength of our brand and our positioning with the emerging middle class, we continue to see tremendous long-term potential in China.
And fifth, we outperformed in the men's business in keeping with our ambition to deliver $1 billion in sales in the category over our planning horizon. In the quarter, we reinvigorated some of our iconic leather goods silhouettes, infusing camo print in retail and the Basquiat collaboration in outlet.
In summary, Coach continues to stand out even amid external pressures. Customers are engaging with the brand at an increasing rate, given the traction of our product and marketing. We're driving continued momentum as we enter the important holiday quarter. The brand has proven that the foundational changes we've made are working and our results are sustainable. We are increasingly confident in our ability to drive both revenue and profit gains for fiscal '22 and beyond.
Now moving to Kate Spade. The brand continued to make steady progress against its strategic priorities and outperformed internal expectations across the P&L. We built on the increasing traction we're seeing with consumers, which drove top line improvement during the quarter. Importantly, direct sales, excluding wholesale, increased mid single-digits versus pre-pandemic levels, a sequential improvement compared to the fourth quarter. These results confirm that the growth strategies we're executing to return Kate Spade to its roots and improve the underlying foundation of the brand are taking hold.
In the quarter, we maintained a consumer-centric approach in our execution, acquiring over 650,000 new customers across channels in North America, a significant increase over last year. At the same time, we reactivated lapsed customers with outsized growth among those customers lapsed over 3 years, reflecting a renewed connection with our core customers and confirming the efforts to clarify the brand's positioning are gaining traction.
Second, we continued to build out our core product offering by amplifying key platforms. Most notably, the Knott and spade flower again outperformed expectation and act as strong foundations for future growth. The strength of these recent introductions, coupled with deliberate actions to improve full price selling and pull back on promotional activity, fueled another quarter of global handbag AUR growth, which rose low double-digits. The progress we've made has increased our confidence in Kate Spade's pricing power as we deepen our connection with consumers and execute on our strategic agenda.
Third, we drove brand heat by deploying marketing centered on our Kate Spade community and leaning into our DNA as a best-in-class storytelling brand. We employed new ways of reaching our customers, including a variety of social media platforms and a reimagined an uniquely Kate Spade approach to New York Fashion Week, which featured a pop-up Apple Orchard in Downtown Manhattan, incorporating our iHeart New York collection.
Fourth, we maximized our lifestyle positioning by continuing to strengthen the foundation of ready wear footwear and jewelry, all of which outperformed our expectations. Overall, the brand's differentiated and broad offering supports our goal to increase lifetime value as those customers buying lifestyle products tend to purchase more frequently and spend more.
And fifth, we utilized our already strong digital platform to continue to grow e-commerce sales, which rose over 15% in the quarter as we test, learn and scale innovative and new ways to engage the consumer online.
In closing, we're leading with our values to strengthen the emotional connection with our passionate Kate Spade community. We are excited by the brand's progress, and our solid performance underscores that we have the right strategy in place. We have significant confidence in our ability to achieve $2 billion in revenue at high-teens operating margins over the planning horizon.
Turning now to Stuart Weitzman. The brand has made continued progress towards achieving our overarching goal of restoring profitability in the current fiscal year. To achieve this, we advanced our growth strategies in the quarter.
First, we improved operating margin compared to prior year, further increasing our confidence in a return to profitability this year. This was driven by continued outperformance in high-growth areas, including digital and China. Our e-commerce channels rose over 30% globally, driven by customer experience upgrades to improve conversion. And in China, a market that remains a significant opportunity for the brand, revenue increased over 25%.
Second, we recruited an increasing number of new customers compared to last year and drove higher retention rates overall. The consumer remains at the forefront of our strategy as we capitalize on shifting market trends, most notably the return to in-person socialization and the growing need for occasion and dressy footwear. At the same time, our iconic collections continue to resonate, notably the Nudist family, which brought an increasing number of new and younger customers to the brand.
Third, we drove brand heat through a tailored offering supported by marketing actions to engage the consumer. Stuart Weitzman's momentum was evidenced by a return to AUR growth, which rose low double-digits compared to prior year, reflecting deliberate actions to lower promotional activity as well as select price increases, which we intend to continue on a strategic basis. This was a key driver of the gross margin expansion of over 250 basis points.
Fourth, we strengthened our wholesale partnerships, specifically with key domestic full-price partners, resulting in high-teens growth in the channel.
Overall, our solid execution is evidenced by our improving financial performance. We're laser-focused on the consumer by offering compelling product and marketing to enhance customer engagement and increase our productivity in key regions and channels. This in turn will support our goal to restore profitability in fiscal '22.
Now turning to the overarching strategies for the holiday quarter. The consumer backdrop is healthy. And our recent internal survey work in North America highlights the demand for the handbag and footwear categories remain strong. We're remaining nimble on keeping the customer at the center of our priorities.
First, we are controlling the factors within our control and playing offense. We've moved quickly and taken bold and deliberate actions to mitigate industry-wide inventory constraints. We're also messaging to customers earlier in the holiday season to elongate the shopping period and capture demand early. Importantly, we will be maintaining our discipline around discounting and selectively increasing prices as we lead with messaging on innovation and value over price. Separately, we are creating engaging omnichannel customer experiences as in-store traffic continues to improve and online engagement increases.
Across brands, we're employing exciting initiatives to surprise and delight consumers during this important shopping period. At Coach, we've kicked off the holiday season in a truly iconic fashion with our recreation of Jennifer Lopez's All I Have video nearly 2 decades after the original, featuring our signature codes. At Kate Spade, we're creating magical holiday moments with our To All A Sparkly Night collection, which captures the sense that the littlest things can be life's biggest indulgences. And at Stuart Weitzman, our recently launched campaign featuring Kate Hudson arrives just in time for the start of the holiday season as well as celebrations for our 35th anniversary.
Overall, our first quarter results and the momentum we're delivering are evidence that our strategy, led by the Acceleration Program, is working. We've radically transformed our company, realizing material operating margin improvement while fueling investments in key growth areas of our business.
We're largely a direct-to-consumer business with a digital-first mindset, building a deeper understanding of our customers. We're utilizing these capabilities along with the additional benefits of our multi-brand platform to drive even further growth at Coach and accelerate the trajectory of both Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman over our planning horizon.
I'm encouraged by the growing vibrancy of each of our brands and the strengthening engagement with consumers, backed by the work of our talented and passionate teams. Our confidence is underscored by the stronger outlook for fiscal year '22 and additional shareholder return plans announced today. We've entered the second quarter with momentum and have proactively put in place plans to deliver for our customers this holiday season and into the New Year. We are well positioned to capture market share at structurally higher operating margin in the years to come, creating significant value for all our stakeholders. 
With that, I'll turn it over to Scott, who will discuss our financial results, capital deployment priorities and fiscal year '22 outlook. Scott?"

We delivered another quarter of high-quality earnings results, outpacing last year pre-pandemic levels and expectations. We continue to execute against the strategies of our acceleration program, building upon the foundational changes made in fiscal year '21 against the difficult backdrop. We drove continued top line momentum and improved operating margin meaningfully, fueled by gross margin expansion.
Turning to the details of the first quarter.
Total sales increased 26% versus prior year and outperformed expectations. Compared to pre-pandemic levels, revenue rose 9%, representing an 8-point acceleration compared to the prior quarter, fueled by improvements across all channels, stores, digital and wholesale.
By region, revenue rose double-digits versus last year in Mainland China, North America and Europe. Importantly, these regions improved on a 2-year basis, including relative outperformance of North America, which rose at a high-teens percentage compared to pre-pandemic levels. In Mainland China, while there were pockets of COVID increases, overall momentum continued. And in Europe, we realized improving trends as lockdown measures were lifted.
Moving down to P&L. We expanded gross margin at each brand during the quarter. These results reflect a continuation of the successful execution of our strategy as we maintain price discipline, improve SKU productivity and leverage our data analytics capabilities to more effectively tailor our product assortment and marketing messaging to the consumer.
SG&A rose relatively in line with sales, given the reinvestment of cost savings into the organic business, the prior year's atypical comparison due to COVID-19 and the impact from higher sales. Taken together, we achieved operating income growth and margin expansion both company-wide and at each individual brand. Earnings per diluted share for the quarter was $0.82, an increase of 42% compared to the prior year and more than doubling pre-pandemic levels.
Now turning to our balance sheet and cash flow as well as an update to our capital deployment plans.
We ended the quarter in a strong position, with $1.7 billion in cash and investments and total borrowings of $1.6 billion. Therefore, given the strong results of our first quarter, our robust balance sheet, significant free cash flow generation and outlook for growth, we're announcing an incremental $1 billion share repurchase program, as highlighted in our press release. As such, we now expect to return approximately $1.25 billion to shareholders in the fiscal year, a meaningful increase compared to our previous outlook to return $750 million to shareholders in fiscal '22.
This return reflects approximately $1 billion of share repurchases in the fiscal year, which consists of $600 million to complete our existing programs, inclusive of the 250 million of shares already repurchased in the first quarter. And we expect to utilize approximately $400 million under our new program in fiscal '22. In addition, our shareholder return plans continue to forecast approximately $250 million return through our dividend program.
Overall, the organic business momentum and the actions announced today underscore our commitment to capital allocation priorities: First, investing in the business to drive long-term profitable growth; and second, returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In addition, we still intend to repay our July 2022 bonds totaling $400 million by the end of the fiscal year. These actions highlight our confidence in the strength of our brands, our ability to drive sustainable growth and our commitment to returning capital to shareholders.
Now moving to our fiscal year '22 outlook. Before turning to the specific details, I want to touch on the current state of the industry. The external environment continues to be dynamic as consumer demand remains solid with supply chain headwinds are constricting inventory availability. We certainly see the same dynamic within our business as demand for our brands remains robust. As Joanne mentioned, we've acted early and boldly to maintain the momentum we're seeing across each of our brands. While we're not immune to external factors nor can we predict future challenges that may come, the bold actions we've taken to secure supply, along with our experience at reacting with agility to a constantly changing landscape over the last 18 months or so gives us confidence to increase our annual guidance.
Please note that all growth rates compared to prior year are on a comparable 52-week basis, excluding the impact of our 53rd week last year. So let's unpack this increase in outlook.
We now expect revenue to approach $6.6 billion, which would mark a record for the company. This represents a mid-teens increase compared to fiscal '21. Our outlook for operating income is now expected to grow at the high end of our previous growth expectation for a mid-teens increase compared to prior year, resulting in modest operating margin expansion. This contemplates modest gross margin pressure due entirely to the incremental freight investments in order to maintain product flow to meet strong consumer demand. This pressure is expected to be most acute in Q2 and Q3.
Excluding this additional freight impact of approximately 200 basis points, we are driving continued underlying gross margin expansion through lower discounting, improved SKU productivity along with price increases that will be implemented for the balance of the year across brands.
In addition, we now expect modest SG&A leverage for the fiscal year. We continue to expect about $300 million in structural gross run rate expense savings as a result of the Acceleration Program. As previously shared, we are reinvesting these benefits to fuel growth, including $90 million in higher marketing spend or approximately 3 percentage points higher than fiscal '19. We're also investing further in our digital talent and capabilities.
Net interest expense for the year is expected to be $65 million, and the tax rate is estimated at 18.5%, assuming a continuation of current tax laws. We're now forecasting weighted average diluted share count to be in the area of 278 million shares, incorporating a planned $1 billion in share repurchases. So taken together, we now expect EPS to be in the range of $3.45 to $3.50, incorporating the first quarter's outperformance and an approximate $0.05 benefit from additional share repurchases.
We continue to expect CapEx to be about $220 million for the year. Of this spend, we anticipate approximately 45% of it related to store development, primarily in China, with the balance dedicated to our digital and IT initiatives. This also includes initial investments related to the build-out of our new fulfillment center to support both growth and speed to market.
Finally, we expect inventory levels to be up meaningfully during the balance of this year as we pull forward receipts to match strong demand and face elongated lead times from supply chain pressures due to COVID disruptions. As mentioned, we're taking deliberate steps to accelerate inventory growth. And we feel comfortable in our inventory positioning to meet demand.
Given the dynamic environment and last year's atypical comparisons, we expect variability by quarter. To provide some guardrails on Q2 specifically, revenue is forecasted to grow high teens, reflecting continued momentum on a 2-year basis. Operating income is projected to be in the area of prior year levels, which contemplates incremental airfreight of approximately $70 million in the quarter or roughly 350 basis points.
In addition, we have shifted the benefit from the reinstatement of GSP into the second half of the fiscal year. As a reminder, GSP is expected to benefit the full year by almost 50 basis points. So taken together, while margin pressure is anticipated in the second quarter, our full year operating margin outlook remains unchanged, as our underlying business momentum and price increases are estimated to offset costs and inflationary pressures. As a result, EPS in Q2 is expected to be relatively in line with prior year.
In closing, we entered the fiscal year with strong momentum, reflecting the benefits of the deliberate and decisive actions we've made under our Acceleration Program. We're continuing to focus on what's in our control as we navigate a dynamic operating environment. And we're taking bold steps to ensure that we can meet robust underlying demand for our brands without compromising our long-term operating margins that are already up significantly. We're increasing both our fiscal year revenue and EPS guidance as well as our expected return of cash to shareholders.
Overall, our strategy is working. I'm confident that we're in a position to create significant value for all our stakeholders in the years to come.  
I'd now like to open up the call for your questions."

We're seeing a strong consumer backdrop, and we're taking bold actions to manage the environment. We're pleased with the momentum we're seeing across brands. The actions we've taken through our Acceleration Program have transformed our company and are driving strong and sustainable results. We see brand heat building as evidenced with the AUR growth that we're delivering in each of our brands. We're also seeing acceleration in top line trends.
In the first quarter, we delivered growth of 9% above pre-pandemic levels, which was an 8-point acceleration from the fourth quarter. We're delivering that with significant gross margin expansion, which is allowing us to deliver structurally higher operating margin while also reinvesting in the key growth drivers of the business. And we're seeing continued strength in digital in China, which are 2 areas that we've talked about represent long-term opportunity for Tapestry. As I mentioned, as we look at the landscape, consumer spending is healthy, and demand for our categories remains very strong.
So although the environment continues to be dynamic, we've moved aggressively to manage the supply side of the equation, to protect the strong trends that we're seeing and serve our customers, really keeping the customer at the center of our strategy and of our execution. Our teams have a proven track record of managing these dynamics. And we are very confident in our ability to deliver for our customers this holiday and beyond. And that confidence, Bob, is really evidenced by the increased guidance and incremental share repurchase programs that we announced today."

We acquired over 650,000 new customers across North America channels to the brand this past quarter alone. And we're reactivating lapsed customers at an increasing rate, which gives us confidence that the strategy is working, that we're reaching the core Kate Spade consumer.
And we've worked hard to improve the product assortment there. We talked about new platforms like the Knott and spade flower, which continue to perform.

Maybe just a little bit of perspective before I get into the quarter-by-quarter details. Remember, the last time we spoke to you all, we talked about reopening in our largest single supply source,",371,"Yes, Erinn, I'll jump in on your freight question as well. Maybe just a little bit of perspective before I get into the quarter-by-quarter details. Remember, the last time we spoke to you all, we talked about reopening in our largest single supply source, Vietnam, which is about 40% of our supply base. We expected that to start reopening in August. And in fact, that occurred about 7 weeks later. And so what we decided, to just build on Joanne's comments, early and boldly, so we did secure airfreight.
The reason I give you that perspective because it's important as you think not only about the flow by quarter, but also, at this point, we now see that we're approaching normalized level of production. We see goods flowing. We have much better visibility than we did the last time we spoke, even at the SKU level, so we can merchandise against the product flow that we see. So the result of that is the exceptional airfreight that we have used to bridge that gap and meet this really strong consumer demand that we see. That's starting to moderate as you get into back half of the year.
So as you think about gross margin shaping, you just saw the gross margin in Q1 up 450 basis points from 2 years ago. You're going to see -- we said, elevated airfreight in Q2 and Q3. We gave you our best estimate. Obviously, it matters as we see what exact products sell through, and there could be a little timing between Q2 and Q3. But think about that as roughly equal from an airfreight standpoint.
But remember, in the second half, we start to see the increase in prices making a meaningful impact. We talked about the change in GSP from a timing standpoint. So what that means is gross margins will be up in the second half and specifically in the fourth quarter. So that's one of the reasons we speak with confidence about our ability to maintain operating margins over time. We're exiting this year, coming out of the fourth quarter, with strong gross margins and the kind of increases that you're used to seeing from us on an overall basis."

As we embarked on our Acceleration Program, we saw a huge opportunity to better understand and serve our customers where they wanted to shop. And that really had us leaning into investments we had made historically, but leaning into our capabilities in digital and data. We are, as we said, 90% direct-to-consumer business. We know a lot about our customers. And we knew we had an opportunity to better engage our customers and meet customers as their shopping behaviors were changing.
So we have invested quite a bit, and we've grown that business tremendously. We are seeing continued engagement, at Coach, where we have runway, but across all of our brands. We're seeing continued engagement, customer acquisition through digital channels. That's not to say that's our only focus. We -- the omnichannel customer and customer shopping behaviors are changing and continue to change rapidly. So we're staying close to the customer. And we want to be available with our brand to our customers where they want to shop and how they want to shop. And we're staying close to that.
We're making the investments we need to make. And we're seeing really high returns on those investments, leveraging data and getting closer to our consumers. Leaning into those digital capabilities has been paying off. And it's not just acquisition, as I mentioned earlier. It's really -- once we acquire our consumers driving -- to drive higher lifetime value. And that's engaging them across our broad array of categories in each of our brands. So proud of the work the teams are doing. As I mentioned, it's early days for us. We're happy and very pleased with the traction we're seeing, but a long runway ahead."

I guess, the first thing I need to remind you of is, we have given no guidance beyond our current outlook. So there's -- we're not at a point where we're ready to have that conversation.
But I would point you to a few things. So you're exactly right. As we grow our digital business, it's one of our most profitable channels and actually our most profitable. And as Joanne said, it's -- our penetration is now 4x what it was just 2 years ago. And the data and analytics that Joanne just outlined and some of the things Todd shared around pricing and our opportunity, we see that absolutely. We're using data better, understanding our consumer at a more intimate level. And all that gives us confidence that we can maintain our margins.
On the other hand, don't forget, we are in an elevated cost environment. So we -- that's not new. We've been seeing this for a while, and input costs are up. The great news is we've got visibility to it. We see that we have the pricing power, and that gives us confidence to maintain those margins over time. So more to come as we get closer to next year, but I think what I hope you would take away from that is the things that we're seeing and demonstrating this year and our outlook are structurally favorable for us as we look to the future."

And then, Scott, maybe as a follow-up. Some other companies have talked a lot about labor supply as being a big focus recently.

And we've deployed strategies really across our value chain. It's not one thing. It's really through the work of our Acceleration Program. It starts with getting to know our customers and being clear on who our target customers are for each of our brands. And then serving those customers, understanding them and then serving them with great creative product, and then making sure we've got the right assortments in the right places. So we're leveraging data and analytics plus the creativity of our talented creative teams to put the right assortments in the right places and manage inventory in the right way.
And then the marketing investments that we've made is, we've structurally changed the pitch of our P&L to invest more in those things that will drive acquisition, retention, those investments in the growth drivers in digital and in marketing. At the same time we're doing that, we're increasing our -- improving our capabilities to understand and reach customers. So we have specific strategies that we're executing. We've got a test and learn framework that our teams are executing under. And we're innovating constantly as we learn how to better engage our consumers, bring them back more frequently, serve them, better messaging. And those are the things that are working.

But I guess, as I look at it, the good news here is we're not just beginning to address this issue. This has been a multiyear journey. Not just on wages, you might recall earlier in the year we talked about raising wages, the $15 minimum, and things that we have done on the -- to be competitive from a cost -- or a wage dollar amount standpoint.
But I think maybe even more important is the focus on engagement of the employees. As someone relatively new to the story here, as I've come in, I've been very impressed with how high the engagement scores are on our retail employees and distribution centers. This is an area that's been a long-term focus. It's a people-centered approach. And that double prong of focusing on the people and also making sure we're competitive so far has been a pretty good formula for us in terms of getting the labor that we need.
