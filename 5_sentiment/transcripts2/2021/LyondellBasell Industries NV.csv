I'm joined today by Bob Patel, our Chief Executive Officer; and Michael McMurray, our Chief Financial Officer. 
Before we begin the business discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com. Today, we will be discussing our business results while making reference to some forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions and the alternative measures are useful to investors. Nonetheless, the forward-looking statements are subject to significant risk and uncertainty. We encourage you to learn more about the factors that could lead our actual results to differ by reviewing the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our regulatory filings, which are available at www.lyondellbasell.com/investorrelations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with other disclosures, including the earnings release, are also currently available on our website. 
Finally, I would like to point out that a recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time today until February 28 by calling (800) 846-0305 in the United States and (402) 998-0543 outside the United States. The pass code for both numbers is 6541. 
During today's call, we will focus on the fourth quarter and full year results, the current environment, our near-term outlook and provide an update on our growth initiatives. Before I turn the call over to Bob, I would like to call your attention to the noncash lower of cost or market inventory adjustments, or LCM, that we have discussed on past calls. These adjustments are related to our use of last in, first out LIFO accounting and the recent volatility in prices for our raw materials and finished goods inventories. 
During the fourth quarter, we recognized pretax LCM benefits totaling $147 million compared to LCM charges of $163 million during the first 9 months of 2020. During the third quarter, we recognized a noncash impairment charge of $582 million related to our Houston refinery. Comments made on the call will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impacts of the refinery impairment and the LCM inventory adjustments. 
With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Bob."

We appreciate you joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full year results for 2020. Let's turn to Slide 3. 2020 was unlike anything we have ever seen or experienced. Oil",1230,"Thank you, Dave, and good day to all of you participating around the world. We appreciate you joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full year results for 2020. 
Let's turn to Slide 3. 2020 was unlike anything we have ever seen or experienced. Oil price volatility, a global pandemic and an associated recession, to call this year unprecedented would be an understatement. So before we get into the results today, I want to take a few minutes to provide some context around our approach to navigating the past year, because I think it speaks well to who we are as a company and the character and talent of our team. 
Early in the year, as it became clear that the virus was becoming more widespread, our leadership team established three guiding principles for the short term. Number one, protect our employees and communities; two, keep our commitments to our investors; and three, take actions to strengthen the company for the future. In past earnings calls, I've talked about some attributes of our culture, operational and commercial excellence cost management and capital discipline. These qualities served us particularly well during 2020 as we bolstered liquidity by rapidly accessing capital markets minimizing working capital and efficiently generating cash. Importantly, we honored our commitment to an investment-grade credit rating and continue to fund dividends and capital investments with cash from operations. 
As we review our results today, I hope the outcome of these priorities and the benefits of this culture will be clear. Beyond the strategy itself, I also wanted to take a moment to acknowledge our global team that delivered our results. These individuals, both those who were able to work remotely and those who continue to work on the front lines at our manufacturing sites, form a strong and nimble team. They have my sincere and deepest gratitude. If the pandemic reinforced anything, it is the value of our products and industry in serving modern society's needs. 
Knowing that the materials produced by our plants go into end products like face masks, medical gowns and COVID-19 test kids, our team took immediate action to ensure our manufacturing sites would continue to supply our customers while prioritizing the safety of our workforce. I'm very proud to say that not only did we continue to operate reliably, but to date, there have been no cases of workplace virus transmission among our employees. 
The last topic I'd like to highlight before we get into the specifics of our results was how our team not only managed through the immediate challenges but how we also remain focused on our future. During the year, we advanced our growth agenda through the formation of JVs in China and here on the U.S. Gulf Coast that provided immediate benefits to earnings. We also made meaningful progress on our ESG strategy, especially in the areas of eliminating plastic waste and enhancing our efforts in the areas of diversity, equity and inclusion. Our company believes these initiatives are critical for our future. And despite the challenges, we maintained our focus on making meaningful progress throughout the year. Taken together, I hope these examples tell the story of a strong, nimble and focused company that is building a bright future for our employees, our customers and our shareholders. 
Let's turn to Slide 4 and review some of last year's highlights. 2020 earnings were $5.61 per share with $3.9 billion of EBITDA. This represents a decline of 42% and 32%, respectively, relative to the prior year. Economists believe that global GDP fell by approximately 4% in 2020, more than double the decline during the financial crisis in 2009. Considering the severe decline in economic activity during the past year, LyondellBasell's results proved to be relatively resilient. Our performance was supported by strong and consistent consumer-driven demand for many of our products, some industry supply constraints and the recovery in demand for durable goods during the second half of the year. Our refining and oxyfuels and related products businesses suffered from the unprecedented decline in demand for transportation fuels that began during March due to the pandemic. 
We efficiently converted EBITDA into cash from operating activities that fully covered both dividends and our capital investments during 2020. Through rapid access to debt capital markets and aggressive working capital management, we ended the year with over $5 billion in available liquidity. 
Our strong balance sheet served us well by allowing the company to advance on our growth strategies during this challenging environment. In September, we formed a new integrated olefin and polyolefin joint venture in China. And only a few short months later, we formed a second joint venture comprised of newly built integrated polyethylene assets in Louisiana. Both joint ventures provided immediate benefits to our fourth quarter profitability. 
Despite the challenges of the pandemic, we continue to advance on our substantive and ambitious goals to develop more circular and sustainable business models for our products that we outlined in our most recent sustainability report. In December, our QCP joint venture in Europe completed an acquisition that increased their polyolefin recycling capacity to [ 55 tons ]. Our actions during 2020 are prime examples of our strategy to identify, develop and capture opportunities through business cycles that should provide significant upside as market conditions continue to improve. 
On Slide 5, you can see that the challenges of the past year did not diminish our relentless focus on pursuing Goal Zero safety performance. If anything, our employees exhibited an increased sense of ownership for ensuring workplace safety and hygiene to enable a slight improvement upon our 2019 metrics. I'm particularly thankful for the progress exhibited by the employees who joined LyondellBasell when we acquired A. Schulman in 2018. Prior to the acquisition, the recordable injury rate at these facilities was 1.54 per 200,000 hours worked, more than 3x the scale of this chart. Following the acquisition, our new employees quickly adopted LyondellBasell's safety focus, and injury rates were reduced by more than 50% for 2018 and 2019. In 2020, the injury rate for these facilities was 0.35 and in the top quartile for our industry. We will work diligently for further improvements in our safety performance to ensure all our employees, contractors and the communities in which we operate finish the day in the same or better condition than when they started. In December, we announced the latest step in our progress to increase utilization of plastic waste as a feedstock to create a more circular economy. 
Please turn to Slide 6. As I mentioned, our QCP joint venture with SUEZ acquired [ Tivaco ] in Belgium in December. This acquisition increased the JV's recycling capacity to approximately 55,000 tons per year. More importantly, the acquisition expands QCT's geographic footprint to increase our capability to produce premium circular polymers for the local market using locally sourced plastic waste. With the increased range of end-use applications from Tivaco's existing product line, QCP will be better poised to serve brand owners in achieving their ambitious goals for increased utilization of circular polymers in packaging and other products. The acquisition represents another step in advancing LyondellBasell's goal to annually produce and market over 2 million tons of recycled and renewable base polymers by 2030. 
With that said, I'll turn the call over to Michael, who will lead us through several topics related to our financial results."
792424,701284613,2186171,"LyondellBasell Industries N.V., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2021",2021-01-29,"Earnings Calls","LyondellBasell Industries N.V.","Executives","Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone.

Please turn to Slide 7, and let me begin by highlighting our track record of improving cash conversion. The benefits of efficient cash conversion become more apparent during periods of economic downturns when liquidity provides defense against risk from volatility and uncertainty. Over the past year, LyondellBasell converted 88% of our EBITDA into $3.4 billion of cash from operating activities. As a result of the challenging market dynamics in 2020, our business teams took aggressive actions in managing inventories to drive free cash flow and maximize liquidity to release more than $300 million of cash from working capital. We are pleased to report that despite the downturn, we've fully funded $1.4 billion in dividends and our $1.9 billion capital investment program through cash generated from operating activities in 2020. The $4.20 per share of dividends paid by our company during the year extends LyondellBasell's track record of consistently paying and increasing our base dividend over the past 10 years. 
Let's continue with Slide 8 and review further details of our cash generation and deployment throughout the year. As you can see, we increased the amount of cash in our balance sheet by approximately $1.4 billion during 2020, to end the year with $2.5 billion in cash and liquid investments. Cash from operations fully funded a small amount of share repurchases in the first quarter of 2020 as well as the full year's dividends and capital expenditures. 
In 2020, we accessed very attractive debt capital markets to extend maturities of existing debt, fund acquisitions and bolster liquidity. These borrowings increased gross debt by $3.9 billion relative to the prior year. A portion of the new bonds funded the $470 million equity contribution for our joint venture with Bora in China and the $2 billion acquisition of our 50% share of the Louisiana integrated polyethylene joint venture with Sasol. We incurred about $70 million in pretax cost due to our fourth quarter refinancing activities. We ended the year with $5.2 billion of cash and available liquidity that enabled us to reduce the balance of our term loan by $500 million in January of 2021. We will continue to prioritize deleveraging over the course of this year, which should allow us to further strengthen our investment-grade balance sheet. 
Before I turn the call over to Bob, let me address some of your annual modeling questions for 2021. On Slide 9. We are planning to invest approximately $2 billion in capital expenditures during 2021. Approximately $1 billion is targeted towards profit-generating growth projects, with the balance supporting sustaining maintenance. The majority of the 2021 growth investment is planned for the construction of the PO/TBA plant in Houston. Work on the PO/TBA project ramped up during the fourth quarter after slowing down earlier last year to ensure worksite safety and preserve liquidity during the pandemic. We expect a similar level of capital expenditures for 2022, followed by a modest reduction in 2023 upon completion of the PO/TBA facility. 
We have a relatively light planned maintenance schedule for 2021, with only 1 major cracker turnaround planned in Europe as well as a few turnarounds in our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Based on expected volumes and margins, we estimate that lost production associated with this maintenance downtime will impact 2021 EBITDA by approximately $170 million. While routine maintenance costs are expensed, maintenance costs arising from turnarounds of major production units are capitalized and included in our capital expenditure forecast. The European cracker turnaround will occur in the third and fourth quarters of 2021 and is expected to impact O&P EAI quarterly EBITDA by $10 million and $15 million, respectively. Planned maintenance in our Intermediates and Derivatives segment is expected to impact EBITDA by approximately $20 million, $60 million, $35 million and $30 million in the first through fourth quarters, respectively. We expect 2021 net interest expense to be approximately $430 million after netting capitalized interest of about $90 million. 2021 book depreciation and amortization is forecasted to be approximately $1.4 billion. We plan to make regular pension contributions in 2021 totaling approximately $100 million, with a similar amount of pension expense for the year. We currently expect our 2021 effective tax rate to be approximately 17%. We expect our cash tax rate will be lower than our ETR due to an anticipated cash refund, but uncertainties around the timing of that refund do not allow us to provide a reliable estimate. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob for a more detailed discussion of our segment results. Bob?"

Let's turn to Slide 10, which illustrates our quarterly profitability over the past 5 quarters. Unlike a typical year where LyondellBasell's business portfolio would follow a seasonal trend with peak earnings occurring midyear, the patterns seen in 2020 are reversed with higher profitability in the first and fourth quarters. The rebound in profitability since the second quarter has been remarkable as the global economy proceeds on a path to recovery. 
EBITDA in the final quarter of 2020 was $1.3 billion, the highest for any [ 4 ] quarter since 2017 and more than $375 million higher than the prior quarter. The trajectory supports our belief that pandemic-driven reductions in demand for our products bottomed during the second quarter. 
Our Olefins and Polyolefins segments serve strong consumer-driven demand for packaging and nondurable products throughout the year, while our Intermediates and Derivatives and Advanced Polymer Solutions segment benefited from improving industrial sector demand for durable goods during the second half of the year. 
We have only seen modest recovery in the demand for transportation fuels. Our refinery and Oxyfuels and related products businesses continue to experience headwinds from excess capacity and flat demand due to persistently low global mobility. While we would naturally prefer to see strength in all of the markets we serve, the geographic and end-market diversity of our product portfolio continues to provide offsets that helped to dampen business cycles. 
Let's turn to Slide 11 and look at the latest thoughts from consultants on the global polyethylene business cycle. 
Industry consultants have forecasted that capacity additions, especially in China, could outpace global demand over the next 4 years. These predictions seem reminiscent of forecast from consulting reports published in 2016, depicted by the dotted blue line, which predicted global operating rates would dip due to the capacity additions on the U.S. Gulf Coast from 2017 through 2018. The actual operating rate depicted by the solid line demonstrates that press releases announcing capacity additions often have ambitious time lines, and typical delays in construction and commissioning can allow consistent demand growth to absorb capacity additions with less impact on operating rates and margins than predicted. In addition to delays in capacity additions, we believe recent forecasts underestimate growth in demand. 
Early in the pandemic, many predicted declines in PV demand for 2020. By the middle of the year, forecast improved to flat demand. Most consultants now believe that global [ PE ] demand grew by approximately 4% in 2020, similar to growth rates seen consistently over the past 30 years. Adjusting these forecasts to 4% demand growth for both 2020 and 2021 results in a predicted operating rate depicted in the dotted [ gray ] line. If 2021 follows patterns seen after prior recessions and demand growth rebounds to levels higher than 4%, then operating rates would accordingly move upward. A rebounding economy that increases 2021 global polyethylene demand by 7%, followed by reversion to consultant forecast of 4% growth thereafter would generate the robust operating rate forecast depicted by the dotted orange line. 
In summary, we believe the next wave of capacity additions will result in operating rates within the boundaries of a balanced market. The next wave of capacity additions will undoubtedly occur, but we believe that typical project delays, a few project cancellations and perhaps increased demand from a recovering economy could contribute to a more orderly absorption of the new capacity by the global market. 
Let's review the fourth quarter results for each of our segments. As mentioned, my discussion will describe our underlying business results, excluding the noncash impacts of LCM inventory changes and the impairment of the Houston refinery. I'll begin with our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment on Slide 12. 
Fourth quarter 2020 EBITDA was $722 million, $318 million higher than the third quarter. Margins improved on higher pricing driven by higher demand for both olefins and polyolefins. Olefins results increased $185 million compared to the third quarter of 2020. Margin improved on higher ethylene and propylene pricing. Volume increased with improved demand. Combined polyolefin results were approximately $65 million higher than the third quarter, primarily due to an increase in polyethylene and polypropylene spreads over monomer. For the full year, results decreased by $514 million. Margins declined for both Olefins and Polyolefins, driven by lower prices for olefin coproducts and polyethylene despite lower feedstock costs. 
Lifestyle changes associated with the pandemic drove increases in demand for nondurable packaging and consumer goods, providing strength in the polyethylene market and increased volumes for ethylene and polyethylene. Based on strong February orders, increasing seasonal demand and tight industry supply, we expect robust margins to continue into the first quarter. 
Now please turn to Slide 13 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. During the fourth quarter, EBITDA was $251 million, an increase of $120 million compared to the third quarter. Improving demand for polyolefins and a full quarter of contribution from our Bora joint venture increased both polyolefin volumes and equity income. 
Olefins results were relatively unchanged with lower margins due to increased maintenance expense, partially offset by increased volume. Combined polyolefin results increased more than $20 million, driven by higher demand and volumes from our Bora joint venture. Equity income increased about $60 million, with more than half of that improvement arising from Bora. Full year EBITDA was $236 million lower than 2019. Margins declined in both olefins and polyolefins due to lower polyolefin and ethylene prices outpacing lower feedstock costs. Polyolefin demand remained relatively stable with increased sales from the start-up of our Bora joint venture during the fourth quarter. In Europe, we expect typical seasonal improvements as we progress through the first half of the year. 
Please turn to Slide 14, let's take a look at our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $196 million, a decline of $49 million from the third quarter 2020. Compressed margins for oxyfuels and related products, driven by weaker gasoline demand and prices, muted the margin improvement in our propylene oxide and derivatives business. 
Fourth quarter propylene oxide and derivatives results increased approximately $25 million due to significantly higher Asia propylene oxide pricing, driven by strong demand and tight market supplies. Intermediate Chemicals results were relatively unchanged. Oxyfuels and related products results decreased by approximately $10 million as small volume improvements were more than offset by margin declines due to continued low gasoline prices and higher butane feedstock costs. 
During 2020, EBITDA declined $714 million compared to 2019. Margin declined in most businesses, primarily in the Oxyfuels and related products and intermediate chemicals businesses. Volumes for most businesses also declined due to lower demand, partially offset by increased Asia demand for our propylene oxide and derivatives products. 
In the first quarter of 2021, we expect margins to be relatively flat as market tightness in Asia is alleviated by higher industry supply. Our volumes will be impacted during the first quarter due to planned maintenance at our Channelview propylene oxide and styrene monomer unit. 
Now let's move forward and review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 15. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $126 million, a $9 million increase over the third quarter of 2020. Volumes increased with improved demand in the automotive sector, partially offset by lower margins. Results for both Compounding & Solutions and Advanced Polymer businesses were relatively unchanged. Within our Compounding & Solutions business, volumes increased as automotive manufacturers ramped up production. Margins declined as a result of product prices lagging price increases for propylene feedstocks. 
Full year EBITDA for the segment was $381 million, a $51 million decline over 2019. Compared to the prior period, results benefited from an $80 million reduction in integration costs. Volumes declined with significantly lower automotive, appliance and construction demand, partially offset by higher margins as a result of product mix. We expect continued recovery in industrial durable goods demand, particularly for products from our Advanced Polymers business during the spring. 
At our Investor Day in 2019, we announced an increased target of $200 million of synergies from the A. Schulman acquisition. We have successfully implemented our synergy plan, and we are beginning to capture an annual run rate of more than $200 million, which will become increasingly visible with volume recovery in the Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. 
Now let's dig a little deeper on how the recovery in durable goods demand is playing out in the polypropylene and compounds markets for our company on Slide 16. China's rapid response to control COVID transmission and stimulate industrial production resulted in strong demand growth despite pandemic. Automotive production in China was up 6% in the fourth quarter compared to the same quarter last year, and China polypropylene demand for the full year 2020 increased by 10% over 2019. 
The strength in durable goods markets is also evident in LyondellBasell's metrics. Our polypropylene inventory levels had all-time lows in both North America and Europe on strong market demand. In North America, construction activities increased in the fourth quarter with a 5% year-over-year increase in demand for single-ply thermoplastic roofing materials that utilize our Catalloy Advanced Polymers. 
Looking at our own order books for polypropylene compounds, engineered plastics and Catalloy within the APS segment, a nice V-shaped recovery is shown in the chart where the forecast for January suggests a first quarter that is nearly the same level seen in the first quarter of 2019. Tight markets, low inventory and strong orders indicate that markets for polypropylene-based durable goods are showing strength going into the first quarter 2021. The increased demand for our polypropylene compounds, engineered plastics and Catalloy products should benefit the APS segment in 2021. 
Now let's turn to Slide 17 and discuss the results of our Refining segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was negative $74 million, a $47 million improvement versus the third quarter of 2020. As I discussed earlier, this excludes the impact of both LCM and impairment of the Houston refinery in the third quarter. Results for the fourth quarter were driven by an improvement in margins due to lower fixed costs and improved margin capture. Improvements in the Maya 2-1-1 industry benchmark crack [ spread ] were more than offset by increased costs for renewable identification number of credits or REMS. Similar to the prior period, we operated the refinery at about 80% of nameplate crude capacity to match reduced demand with an average crude throughput of 214,000 barrels per day. 
Full year EBITDA was negative $289 million, $224 million lower than 2019. Refining margins were compressed due to pandemic-driven reductions in demand for gasoline and jet fuel. The Maya 2-1-1 spread was at a historically low point during the year and averaged $12.63 per barrel. 2020 crude throughput was limited to an average of 223,000 barrels per day as we actively managed operations to match the reduced market demand. 
Refining margins are expected to move sideways until demand for gasoline and jet fuel improves. We plan to continue operating the refinery at about 80% of nameplate crude capacity during the first quarter. We remain diligent with efforts to reduce expenses and minimize losses at our Houston refinery, and we'll continue to evaluate production decisions as the market evolves. 
Please turn to Slide 18 as we review the results for our Technology segment. EBITDA was $45 million during the fourth quarter and was $324 million for the full year. Fourth quarter technology profitability declined due to a lower number of licensing revenue recognition milestones. Catalyst margins increased due to inventory mix improvements, partially offset by decrease in volumes as customers manage year-end inventories. Based on the timing of anticipated licensing milestones and improving catalyst demand, we expect the first quarter Technology business profitability to improve to a similar level as in the first quarter of 2019. 
Please turn to Slide 19 for a refreshed view of our value-driven growth investments. Our company is executing on a clear and straightforward strategy to increase free cash flow by harvesting new sources of EBITDA generation while moderating our capital expenditure budget to $2 billion or less for each of the next 3 years. The formula is simple. More EBITDA and moderating capital expenditures should improve free cash flow at any point in business cycles. 
Let me summarize the year's highlights and outlook with Slide 20. During 2020, LyondellBasell to remain true to our strategy of capturing value and delivering resilient results at all points in the cycle. We delivered on our commitments to investors, served our customers and supported our employees while moving forward on sustainability initiatives. By maximizing cash generation and prioritizing liquidity, we maintained our investment-grade rating and extended the continuity of our dividend. Demand for consumer-driven goods remained strong, and durable goods markets are rebounding with increased industrial activity. As global mobility improves, we expect that demand and margin for fuels from our refinery and oxyfuels and related product businesses will follow. Over the past several years, LyondellBasell has captured opportunities through disciplined and profitable growth investments. Whether building, acquiring or partnering on assets, our company focused on leveraging our technology, building on our advantages and increasing our earnings capacity. Our path is clear. LyondellBasell will remain focused on meeting our commitments and pursuing a disciplined financial strategy. With robust cash generation and ample liquidity, we plan to continue strengthening our balance sheet and optimizing our portfolio during 2021. We look forward to sharing our progress toward developing more circular business models for our industry and creating a more supportive culture for our workforce that will allow all of us to continue delivering sustainable results for years to come. 
In summary, our strategy has served us well. And now LyondellBasell is poised to emerge from this pandemic with more earnings power and free cash flow potential.

And of that fraction, how would you split it into the 3 buckets that you're working in? You have the mechanical recycling JV with SUEZ, you have the pyrolysis molecular recycling project and then you also have the bio-based feedstock project with [ Neste ]. Which of those 3 do you think are really driving this? Or do you think those end market customers are really above the one?"

Well, first of all, in terms of how much of our polyethylene demand or customers are asking for sustainable products, I mean if you think about our sales of polyethylene, more than half of it goes into packaging, whether it's flexible or blow-molded bottles or those sorts of things. So I think it's safe to say more than half, probably close to 2/3 over time, we'll want to have sustainable products as part of the mix that we sell them. 
In terms of their preference for food packaging, clearly, the molecular recycling would be the most desirable because essentially, what we're doing is we're creating new feedstock and producing FDA-approved resin. So our sense is that molecular recycling will be the most important development as we look at the next 5 to 7 years. But I think mechanical recycling will continue to play a role. And that's where we're capturing the near-term opportunities. And as you know, we have a molecular recycling pilot plant that we've built in Italy. We're working -- I had a review with my R&D team, in fact, this week, and they're working diligently to perfect the technology and get to semi works as soon as possible."

In fact, we're looking for opportunities to build back some inventory. But because demand is so strong, we're not able to do that. 
On the pricing front, January price increase discussions are essentially finished, and the implementation of the increase is going to occur. The next increase for February is on the table. And likely, there will be very good discussion about that as well. If you think about markets being tight in January, typically, as we go into the spring, we see a seasonal uptick in demand. And so I think that supply-demand fundamentals are going to remain tight through the first half of the year for polyethylene. 
Polypropylene, similarly, as you said, propylene prices run up quite a lot, but inventories are still low. We're struggling to build inventory because demand is so good. And as you said about durables, probably applies more to polypropylene. As the economic recovery really takes hold in Europe and U.S., I think we're going to see probably more pull from durable goods end users. So we're quite constructive about both, frankly. It looks tight through the first half of the year. 
And the other thing I would add is there's quite a bit of downtime on -- a planned downtime in the industry for crackers. So that's going to keep monomer prices probably high through the first half of the year. There's also a very large PDH turnaround here on the Gulf Coast. So that will keep propylene pretty snugged through May, I would imagine."

To your question about how do you bridge the 4 to the 7. First of all, in polyethylene -- here in the U.S., the pipe market has been very, very weak. And if there's an infrastructure bill, as oil and gas starts to come back a bit, I think that could help demand growth here in the U.S.. And likely, if there's infrastructure spending in Europe and China, I mean, you could really see that market contribute to bridging the 4 to 7. The other is there's still enough durable goods content for industrial demand for, for example, like industrial bulk containers. As industrial activity picks up I think we'll see recovery or higher demand rates for polyethylene. So I don't think it would take much to get to the 7%. And when you factor that in, it looks like operating rates could stay elevated through -- over the next few years."

But we've not seen significant impact on demand for polyolefins. So polyolefins demand has been still very resilient. 
If you look at EAI across the board, and of course, a lot of that's Europe, if you think about our volume. If you compare Q1 '21, how our book is building compared to Q1 '19, we expect that ethylene is going to be up about 15% from Q1 '19 to Q1 '21; polyethylene, up 17%; polypropylene, up 12%, Q1 '19 to Q1 '21. So it really points to a very resilient demand. And as you look forward into the turnaround season, very heavy turnaround season also in Europe. 
In fact, in April, about 13% of the ethylene capacity is expected to be offline on a planned basis. So I mean, I think we could see tightness through a good bit of the first half of the year based on demand hanging in there, even when there's a spike of COVID rates in various countries. And as the vaccine is distributed, I would think all of that will settle down and the demand growth we should see year-over-year."

Another sort of data point is that polypropylene demand in China grew about 10% from 2019 to '20. 
Now your second question about pandemic-related, certainly, the mass and the medical gowns and all of that has been a pretty important driver. And frankly, I think even after vaccinations are more widespread, use of masks will still be pretty common, I think, for most of this year and maybe even into next year. So it's -- I don't have a number for you on what percent of the growth was accounted for by the masks.

So first of all, with the completion of 2020, you've seen a resilient performance from our company through the first significant downturn since our emergence back in 2010. Our fourth quarter results have given you a preview of our increased earnings power. Going into 2021, we have more assets, strong order books, tight markets and rising economic activity, all of which should provide confidence for continuing improvement into the first quarter. While much of our industry is scheduling high levels of second quarter maintenance, LyondellBasell's planned downtime for 2021 is relatively light. Our assets are ready to capture improving seasonal demand. Refining and Oxyfuels businesses are poised to benefit from increased mobility during the second half of the year. I think all of this positions us well to increase cash flow and continue to strengthen our balance sheet as we work our way through 2021. So thank you for your interest in our company, and we look forward to updating you in about 90 days. Have a great weekend."

Before we begin the business discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com. Today, we will be discussing our business results while making reference to some forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, and the alternative measures are useful to investors. Nonetheless, the forward-looking statements are subject to significant risk and uncertainty. We encourage you to learn more about the factors that could lead our actual results to differ by reviewing the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our regulatory filings, which are available at www.lyondellbasell.com/investorrelations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with other disclosures, including the earnings release, are also currently available on our website.  
Finally, I would like to point out that a recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 1 p.m. Eastern Time today until February 28 by calling (800) 846-0305 in the United States and (402) 998-0543 outside the United States. The pass code for both numbers is 6541.  
During today's call, we will focus on the fourth quarter and full year results, the current environment, our near-term outlook and provide an update on our growth initiatives. Before I turn the call over to Bob, I would like to call your attention to the noncash lower of cost or market inventory adjustments, or LCM, that we have discussed on past calls. These adjustments are related to our use of last in, first out LIFO accounting and the recent volatility in prices for our raw materials and finished goods inventories.  
During the fourth quarter, we recognized pretax LCM benefits totaling $147 million compared to LCM charges of $163 million during the first 9 months of 2020. During the third quarter, we recognized a noncash impairment charge of $582 million related to our Houston refinery. Comments made on the call will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impacts of the refinery impairment and the LCM inventory adjustments.

Let's turn to Slide 3. 2020 was unlike anything we have ever seen or experienced. Oil price volatility, a global pandemic and an associated recession, to call this year unprecedented would be an understatement. So before we get into the results today, I want to take a few minutes to provide some context around our approach to navigating the past year because I think it speaks well to who we are as a company and the character and talent of our team.  
Early in the year as it became clear that the virus was becoming more widespread, our leadership team established three guiding principles for the short term. Number one, protect our employees and communities; two, keep our commitments to our investors; and three, take actions to strengthen the company for the future. 
In past earnings calls, I've talked about some attributes of our culture, operational and commercial excellence, cost management and capital discipline. These qualities served us particularly well during 2020 as we bolstered liquidity by rapidly accessing capital markets, minimizing working capital and efficiently generating cash. Importantly, we honored our commitment to an investment-grade credit rating and continue to fund dividends and capital investments with cash from operations. As we review our results today, I hope the outcome of these priorities and the benefits of this culture will be clear. 
Beyond the strategy itself, I also wanted to take a moment to acknowledge our global team that delivered our results. These individuals, both those who were able to work remotely and those who continue to work on the front lines at our manufacturing sites, form a strong and nimble team. They have my sincere and deepest gratitude. If the pandemic reinforced anything, it is the value of our products and industry in serving modern society's needs.  
Knowing that the materials produced by our plants go into end products like face masks, medical gowns and COVID-19 test kits, our team took immediate action to ensure our manufacturing sites would continue to supply our customers while prioritizing the safety of our workforce. I'm very proud to say that not only did we continue to operate reliably, but to date, there have been no cases of workplace virus transmission among our employees.  
The last topic I'd like to highlight before we get into the specifics of our results was how our team not only managed through the immediate challenges but how we also remain focused on our future. During the year, we advanced our growth agenda through the formation of JVs in China and here on the U.S. Gulf Coast that provided immediate benefits to earnings. We also made meaningful progress on our ESG strategy, especially in the areas of eliminating plastic waste and enhancing our efforts in the areas of diversity, equity and inclusion. Our company believes these initiatives are critical for our future. And despite the challenges, we maintained our focus on making meaningful progress throughout the year. Taken together, I hope these examples tell the story of a strong, nimble and focused company that is building a bright future for our employees, our customers and our shareholders.  
Let's turn to Slide 4 and review some of last year's highlights. 2020 earnings were $5.61 per share with $3.9 billion of EBITDA. This represents a decline of 42% and 32%, respectively, relative to the prior year. Economists believe that global GDP fell by approximately 4% in 2020, more than double the decline during the financial crisis in 2009. Considering the severe decline in economic activity during the past year, LyondellBasell's results proved to be relatively resilient. Our performance was supported by strong and consistent consumer-driven demand for many of our products, some industry supply constraints and the recovery in demand for durable goods during the second half of the year. Our Refining and Oxyfuels & Related Products businesses suffered from the unprecedented decline in demand for transportation fuels that began during March due to the pandemic.  
We efficiently converted EBITDA into cash from operating activities that fully covered both dividends and our capital investments during 2020. Through rapid access to debt capital markets and aggressive working capital management, we ended the year with over $5 billion in available liquidity.  
Our strong balance sheet served us well by allowing the company to advance on our growth strategies during this challenging environment. In September, we formed a new integrated olefin and polyolefin joint venture in China. And only a few short months later, we formed a second joint venture comprised of newly-built integrated polyethylene assets in Louisiana. Both joint ventures provided immediate benefits to our fourth quarter profitability.  
Despite the challenges of the pandemic, we continue to advance on our substantive and ambitious goals to develop more circular and sustainable business models for our products that we outlined in our most recent sustainability report. In December, our QCP joint venture in Europe completed an acquisition that increased their polyolefin recycling capacity to 55 tons. Our actions during 2020 are prime examples of our strategy to identify, develop and capture opportunities through business cycles that should provide significant upside as market conditions continue to improve.  
On Slide 5, you can see that the challenges of the past year did not diminish our relentless focus on pursuing GoalZERO safety performance. If anything, our employees exhibited an increased sense of ownership for ensuring workplace safety and hygiene to enable a slight improvement upon our 2019 metrics. 
I'm particularly thankful for the progress exhibited by the employees who joined LyondellBasell when we acquired A. Schulman in 2018. Prior to the acquisition, the recordable injury rate at these facilities was 1.54 per 200,000 hours worked, more than 3x the scale of this chart. Following the acquisition, our new employees quickly adopted LyondellBasell's safety focus, and injury rates were reduced by more than 50% for 2018 and 2019. In 2020, the injury rate for these facilities was 0.35 and in the top quartile for our industry. We will work diligently for further improvements in our safety performance to ensure all our employees, contractors and the communities in which we operate finish the day in the same or better condition than when they started. In December, we announced the latest step in our progress to increase utilization of plastic waste as a feedstock to create a more circular economy.  
Please turn to Slide 6. As I mentioned, our QCP joint venture with SUEZ acquired Tivaco in Belgium in December. This acquisition increased the JV's recycling capacity to approximately 55,000 tons per year. More importantly, the acquisition expands QCP's geographic footprint to increase our capability to produce premium circular polymers for the local market using locally-sourced plastic waste. 
With the increased range of end-use applications from Tivaco's existing product line, QCP will be better poised to serve brand owners in achieving their ambitious goals for increased utilization of circular polymers in packaging and other products. The acquisition represents another step in advancing LyondellBasell's goal to annually produce and market over 2 million tons of recycled and renewable base polymers by 2030.  
With that said, I'll turn the call over to Michael, who will lead us through several topics related to our financial results."

Please turn to Slide 7, and let me begin by highlighting our track record of improving cash conversion. 
The benefits of efficient cash conversion become more apparent during periods of economic downturns when liquidity provides defense against risk from volatility and uncertainty. Over the past year, LyondellBasell converted 88% of our EBITDA into $3.4 billion of cash from operating activities. As a result of the challenging market dynamics in 2020, our business teams took aggressive actions in managing inventories to drive free cash flow and maximize liquidity to release more than $300 million of cash from working capital. We are pleased to report that despite the downturn, we've fully funded $1.4 billion in dividends and our $1.9 billion capital investment program through cash generated from operating activities in 2020. The $4.20 per share of dividends paid by our company during the year extends LyondellBasell's track record of consistently paying and increasing our base dividend over the past 10 years.  
Let's continue with Slide 8 and review further details of our cash generation and deployment throughout the year. As you can see, we increased the amount of cash in our balance sheet by approximately $1.4 billion during 2020, to end the year with $2.5 billion in cash and liquid investments. Cash from operations fully funded a small amount of share repurchases in the first quarter of 2020 as well as the full year's dividends and capital expenditures.  
In 2020, we accessed very attractive debt capital markets to extend maturities of existing debt, fund acquisitions and bolster liquidity. These borrowings increased gross debt by $3.9 billion relative to the prior year. A portion of the new bonds funded the $470 million equity contribution for our joint venture with Bora in China and the $2 billion acquisition of our 50% share of the Louisiana integrated polyethylene joint venture with Sasol. We incurred about $70 million in pretax cost due to our fourth quarter refinancing activities. We ended the year with $5.2 billion of cash and available liquidity that enabled us to reduce the balance of our term loan by $500 million in January of 2021. We will continue to prioritize deleveraging over the course of this year, which should allow us to further strengthen our investment-grade balance sheet.  
Before I turn the call over to Bob, let me address some of your annual modeling questions for 2021 on Slide 9. We are planning to invest approximately $2 billion in capital expenditures during 2021. Approximately $1 billion is targeted towards profit-generating growth projects, with the balance supporting sustaining maintenance. The majority of the 2021 growth investment is planned for the construction of the PO/TBA plant in Houston. Work on the PO/TBA project ramped up during the fourth quarter after slowing down earlier last year to ensure worksite safety and preserve liquidity during the pandemic. We expect a similar level of capital expenditures for 2022, followed by a modest reduction in 2023 upon completion of the PO/TBA facility.  
We have a relatively light planned maintenance schedule for 2021, with only one major cracker turnaround planned in Europe as well as a few turnarounds in our Intermediates & Derivatives segment. Based on expected volumes and margins, we estimate that lost production associated with this maintenance downtime will impact 2021 EBITDA by approximately $170 million. While routine maintenance costs are expensed, maintenance costs arising from turnarounds of major production units are capitalized and included in our capital expenditure forecast. The European cracker turnaround will occur in the third and fourth quarters of 2021 and is expected to impact O&P EAI quarterly EBITDA by $10 million and $15 million, respectively. Planned maintenance in our Intermediates & derivatives segment is expected to impact EBITDA by approximately $20 million, $60 million, $35 million and $30 million in the first through fourth quarters, respectively. We expect 2021 net interest expense to be approximately $430 million after netting capitalized interest of about $90 million. 2021 book depreciation and amortization is forecasted to be approximately $1.4 billion. We plan to make regular pension contributions in 2021 totaling approximately $100 million with a similar amount of pension expense for the year. We currently expect our 2021 effective tax rate to be approximately 17%. We expect our cash tax rate will be lower than our ETR due to an anticipated cash refund, but uncertainties around the timing of that refund do not allow us to provide a reliable estimate.  
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob for a more detailed discussion of our segment results. Bob?"

Let's turn to Slide 10, which illustrates our quarterly profitability over the past 5 quarters.

Let's turn to Slide 10, which illustrates our quarterly profitability over the past 5 quarters. Unlike a typical year, where LyondellBasell's business portfolio would follow a seasonal trend with peak earnings occurring midyear, the patterns seen in 2020 are reversed with higher profitability in the first and fourth quarters. The rebound in profitability since the second quarter has been remarkable as the global economy proceeds on a path to recovery.  
EBITDA in the final quarter of 2020 was $1.3 billion, the highest for any fourth quarter since 2017 and more than $375 million higher than the prior quarter. The trajectory supports our belief that pandemic-driven reductions in demand for our products bottomed during the second quarter.  
Our Olefins and Polyolefins segments serve strong consumer-driven demand for packaging and nondurable products throughout the year, while our Intermediates & Derivatives and Advanced Polymer Solutions segment benefited from improving industrial sector demand for durable goods during the second half of the year.  
We have only seen modest recovery in the demand for transportation fuels. Our Refinery and Oxyfuels & Related Products businesses continue to experience headwinds from excess capacity and flat demand due to persistently low global mobility. While we would naturally prefer to see strength in all of the markets we serve, the geographic and end-market diversity of our product portfolio continues to provide offsets that helped to dampen business cycles.  
Let's turn to Slide 11 and look at the latest thoughts from consultants on the global polyethylene business cycle. Industry consultants have forecasted that capacity additions, especially in China, could outpace global demand over the next 4 years. These predictions seem reminiscent of forecast from consulting reports published in 2016 depicted by the dotted blue line, which predicted global operating rates would dip due to the capacity additions on the U.S. Gulf Coast from 2017 through 2018. The actual operating rate depicted by the solid line demonstrates that press releases announcing capacity additions often have ambitious time lines, and typical delays in construction and commissioning can allow consistent demand growth to absorb capacity additions with less impact on operating rates and margins than predicted. 
In addition to delays in capacity additions, we believe recent forecasts underestimate growth in demand. Early in the pandemic, many predicted declines in PE demand for 2020. By the middle of the year, forecasts improved to flat demand. Most consultants now believe that global PE demand grew by approximately 4% in 2020, similar to growth rates seen consistently over the past 30 years. Adjusting these forecasts to 4% demand growth for both 2020 and 2021 results in a predicted operating rate depicted in the dotted gray line. If 2021 follows patterns seen after prior recessions and demand growth rebounds to levels higher than 4%, then operating rates would accordingly move upward. A rebounding economy that increases 2021 global polyethylene demand by 7% followed by reversion to consultant forecast of 4% growth thereafter would generate the robust operating rate forecast depicted by the dotted orange line.  
In summary, we believe the next wave of capacity additions will result in operating rates within the boundaries of a balanced market. The next wave of capacity additions will undoubtedly occur, but we believe that typical project delays, a few project cancellations and perhaps increased demand from a recovering economy could contribute to a more orderly absorption of the new capacity by the global market.  
Let's review the fourth quarter results for each of our segments. As mentioned, my discussion will describe our underlying business results, excluding the noncash impacts of LCM inventory changes and the impairment of the Houston refinery. I'll begin with our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment on Slide 12.  
Fourth quarter 2020 EBITDA was $722 million, $318 million higher than the third quarter. Margins improved on higher pricing driven by higher demand for both olefins and polyolefins. Olefins results increased $185 million compared to the third quarter of 2020. Margin improved on higher ethylene and propylene pricing. Volume increased with improved demand. Combined polyolefin results were approximately $65 million higher than the third quarter, primarily due to an increase in polyethylene and polypropylene spreads over monomer. For the full year, results decreased by $514 million. Margins declined for both Olefins and Polyolefins driven by lower prices for olefin coproducts and polyethylene despite lower feedstock costs.  
Lifestyle changes associated with the pandemic drove increases in demand for nondurable packaging and consumer goods, providing strength in the polyethylene market and increased volumes for ethylene and polyethylene. Based on strong February orders, increasing seasonal demand and tight industry supply, we expect robust margins to continue into the first quarter.  
Now please turn to Slide 13 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. During the fourth quarter, EBITDA was $251 million, an increase of $120 million compared to the third quarter. Improving demand for polyolefins and a full quarter of contribution from our Bora joint venture increased both polyolefin volumes and equity income. Olefins results were relatively unchanged with lower margins due to increased maintenance expense, partially offset by increased volume. Combined polyolefin results increased more than $20 million driven by higher demand and volumes from our Bora joint venture. Equity income increased about $60 million, with more than half of that improvement arising from Bora. Full year EBITDA was $236 million lower than 2019. Margins declined in both olefins and polyolefins due to lower polyolefin and ethylene prices, outpacing lower feedstock costs. Polyolefin demand remained relatively stable with increased sales from the start-up of our Bora joint venture during the fourth quarter. In Europe, we expect typical seasonal improvements as we progress through the first half of the year.  
Please turn to Slide 14, let's take a look at our Intermediates & derivatives segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $196 million, a decline of $49 million from the third quarter 2020. Compressed margins for Oxyfuels & Related Products, driven by weaker gasoline demand and prices, muted the margin improvement in our Propylene Oxide & Derivatives business. 
Fourth quarter Propylene Oxide & Derivatives results increased approximately $25 million due to significantly higher Asia propylene oxide pricing driven by strong demand and tight market supplies. Intermediate Chemicals results were relatively unchanged. Oxyfuels & Related Products results decreased by approximately $10 million as small volume improvements were more than offset by margin declines due to continued low gasoline prices and higher butane feedstock costs.  
During 2020, EBITDA declined $714 million compared to 2019. Margin declined in most businesses, primarily in the Oxyfuels & Related Products and Intermediate Chemicals businesses. Volumes for most businesses also declined due to lower demand, partially offset by increased Asia demand for our Propylene Oxide & Derivatives products.  
In the first quarter of 2021, we expect margins to be relatively flat as market tightness in Asia is alleviated by higher industry supply. Our volumes will be impacted during the first quarter due to planned maintenance at our Channelview propylene oxide and styrene monomer unit.  
Now let's move forward and review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 15. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $126 million, a $9 million increase over the third quarter of 2020. Volumes increased with improved demand in the automotive sector, partially offset by lower margins. Results for both Compounding & Solutions and Advanced Polymer businesses were relatively unchanged. Within our Compounding & Solutions business, volumes increased as automotive manufacturers ramped up production. Margins declined as a result of product prices lagging price increases for propylene feedstocks.  
Full year EBITDA for the segment was $381 million, a $51 million decline over 2019. Compared to the prior period, results benefited from an $80 million reduction in integration costs. Volumes declined with significantly lower automotive, appliance and construction demand, partially offset by higher margins as a result of product mix. We expect continued recovery in industrial durable goods demand, particularly for products from our Advanced Polymers business during the spring.  
At our Investor Day in 2019, we announced an increased target of $200 million of synergies from the A. Schulman acquisition. We have successfully implemented our synergy plan, and we are beginning to capture an annual run rate of more than $200 million, which will become increasingly visible with volume recovery in the Advanced Polymer Solutions segment.  
Now let's dig a little deeper on how the recovery in durable goods demand is playing out in the polypropylene and compounds markets for our company on Slide 16. China's rapid response to control COVID transmission and stimulate industrial production resulted in strong demand growth despite the pandemic. Automotive production in China was up 6% in the fourth quarter compared to the same quarter last year, and China polypropylene demand for the full year 2020 increased by 10% over 2019. 
The strength in durable goods markets is also evident in LyondellBasell's metrics. Our polypropylene inventory levels had all-time lows in both North America and Europe on strong market demand. In North America, construction activities increased in the fourth quarter with a 5% year-over-year increase in demand for single-ply thermoplastic roofing materials that utilize our Catalloy Advanced Polymers.  
Looking at our own order books for Polypropylene Compounds, Engineered Plastics and Catalloy within the APS segment, a nice V-shaped recovery is shown in the chart where the forecast for January suggests a first quarter that is nearly the same level seen in the first quarter of 2019. Tight markets, low inventory and strong orders indicate that markets for polypropylene-based durable goods are showing strength going into the first quarter 2021. The increased demand for our polypropylene compounds, engineered plastics and Catalloy products should benefit the APS segment in 2021.  
Now let's turn to Slide 17 and discuss the results of our Refining segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was negative $74 million, a $47 million improvement versus the third quarter of 2020. As I discussed earlier, this excludes the impact of both LCM and impairment of the Houston refinery in the third quarter. Results for the fourth quarter were driven by an improvement in margins due to lower fixed costs and improved margin capture. Improvements in the Maya 2-1-1 industry benchmark crack spread were more than offset by increased costs for Renewable Identification Number of Credits or RINs. Similar to the prior period, we operated the refinery at about 80% of nameplate crude capacity to match reduced demand with an average crude throughput of 214,000 barrels per day.  
Full year EBITDA was negative $289 million, $224 million lower than 2019. Refining margins were compressed due to pandemic-driven reductions in demand for gasoline and jet fuel. The Maya 2-1-1 spread was at a historically low point during the year and averaged $12.63 per barrel. 2020 crude throughput was limited to an average of 223,000 barrels per day as we actively managed operations to match the reduced market demand.  
Refining margins are expected to move sideways until demand for gasoline and jet fuel improves. We plan to continue operating the refinery at about 80% of nameplate crude capacity during the first quarter. We remain diligent with efforts to reduce expenses and minimize losses at our Houston refinery, and we'll continue to evaluate production decisions as the market evolves. 
Please turn to Slide 18 as we review the results for our Technology segment. EBITDA was $45 million during the fourth quarter and was $324 million for the full year. Fourth quarter technology profitability declined due to a lower number of licensing revenue recognition milestones. Catalyst margins increased due to inventory mix improvements, partially offset by decrease in volumes as customers manage year-end inventories. Based on the timing of anticipated licensing milestones and improving catalyst demand, we expect the first quarter Technology business profitability to improve to a similar level as in the first quarter of 2019.  
Please turn to Slide 19 for a refreshed view of our value-driven growth investments. Our company is executing on a clear and straightforward strategy to increase free cash flow by harvesting new sources of EBITDA generation while moderating our capital expenditure budget to $2 billion or less for each of the next 3 years. The formula is simple. More EBITDA and moderating capital expenditures should improve free cash flow at any point in business cycles.  
Let me summarize the year's highlights and outlook with Slide 20. During 2020, LyondellBasell remain true to our strategy of capturing value and delivering resilient results at all points in the cycle. We delivered on our commitments to investors, served our customers and supported our employees while moving forward on sustainability initiatives. By maximizing cash generation and prioritizing liquidity, we maintained our investment-grade rating and extended the continuity of our dividend. Demand for consumer-driven goods remained strong, and durable goods markets are rebounding with increased industrial activity. As global mobility improves, we expect that demand and margin for fuels from our Refinery and Oxyfuels & Related Product businesses will follow. 
Over the past several years, LyondellBasell has captured opportunities through disciplined and profitable growth investments, whether building, acquiring or partnering on assets, our company focused on leveraging our technology, building on our advantages and increasing our earnings capacity. Our path is clear. LyondellBasell will remain focused on meeting our commitments and pursuing a disciplined financial strategy. With robust cash generation and ample liquidity, we plan to continue strengthening our balance sheet and optimizing our portfolio during 2021. We look forward to sharing our progress toward developing more circular business models for our industry and creating a more supportive culture for our workforce that will allow all of us to continue delivering sustainable results for years to come.  
In summary, our strategy has served us well, and now LyondellBasell is poised to emerge from this pandemic with more earnings power and free cash flow potential.

What fraction of your polyethylene volumes are sold into end markets, where customers are asking for some type of a sustainable product? I'm curious to hear your view whether this is a push by your initiatives. Or is this being pulled by the end market customers that you're selling into? 
And of that fraction, how would you split it into the 3 buckets that you're working in? You have the mechanical recycling JV with SUEZ, you have the pyrolysis molecular recycling project and then you also have the bio-based feedstock project with Neste. Which of those 3 do you think are really driving this? Or do you think those end market customers are really above the one?"

Well, first of all, in terms of how much of our polyethylene demand or customers are asking for sustainable products, I mean if you think about our sales of polyethylene, more than half of it goes into packaging, whether it's flexible or blow-molded bottles or those sorts of things. So I think it's safe to say more than half, probably close to 2/3 over time, we'll want to have sustainable products as part of the mix that we sell them.  
In terms of their preference, for food packaging, clearly, the molecular recycling would be the most desirable because, essentially, what we're doing is we're creating new feedstock and producing FDA-approved resin. So our sense is that molecular recycling will be the most important development as we look at the next 5 to 7 years. But I think mechanical recycling will continue to play a role, and that's where we're capturing the near-term opportunities. And as you know, we have a molecular recycling pilot plant that we've built in Italy. We're working -- I had a review with my R&D team, in fact, this week, and they're working diligently to perfect the technology and get to semi works as soon as possible."

In fact, we're looking for opportunities to build back some inventory. But because demand is so strong, we're not able to do that.  
On the pricing front, January price increase discussions are essentially finished, and the implementation of the increase is going to occur. The next increase for February is on the table. And likely, there will be very good discussion about that as well. If you think about markets being tight in January, typically, as we go into the spring, we see a seasonal uptick in demand. And so I think that supply/demand fundamentals are going to remain tight through the first half of the year for polyethylene.  
Polypropylene, similarly, as you said, propylene prices run up quite a lot, but inventories are still low. We're struggling to build inventory because demand is so good. And as you said about durables, probably applies more to polypropylene. As the economic recovery really takes hold in Europe and U.S., I think we're going to see probably more pull from durable goods end users. So we're quite constructive about both, frankly. It looks tight through the first half of the year.  
And the other thing I would add is there's quite a bit of downtime on -- a planned downtime in the industry for crackers. So that's going to keep monomer prices probably high through the first half of the year. There's also a very large PDH turnaround here on the Gulf Coast. So that'll keep propylene pretty snugged through May, I would imagine."

To your question about how do you bridge the 4% to the 7%. First of all, in polyethylene here in the U.S., the pipe market has been very, very weak. And if there's an infrastructure bill as oil and gas starts to come back a bit, I think that could help demand growth here in the U.S. And likely, if there's infrastructure spending in Europe and China, I mean you could really see that market contribute to bridging the 4% to 7%. 
The other is there's still enough durable goods content for industrial demand for, for example, like industrial bulk containers. As industrial activity picks up, I think we'll see recovery or higher demand rates for polyethylene. So I don't think it would take much to get to the 7%.

And generally, when propylene gets close to being sold out, any outage causes these kinds of bursts in price. 
I would add a fourth item to your list, which is very robust demand for the derivatives of propylene, not just polypropylene, but the other propylene derivatives: cumene and derivatives and so on. So we've really had a strong full from all propylene derivatives, which has helped. I think until the PDH outages or turnarounds are behind us, I think we're going to have tightness in propylene.  
The other thing is propane is very far out today so -- as the economic feedstock. So maybe if propane cracking returns in the summer when propane gets cheaper, you could see a little bit more propylene supply come. But my sense is that we have a pretty tight propylene market probably through May."

But we've not seen significant impact on demand for polyolefins. So polyolefins demand has been still very resilient.  
If you look at EAI across the board, and of course, a lot of that's Europe if you think about our volume, if you compare Q1 '21 how our book is building compared to Q1 '19, we expect that ethylene is going to be up about 15% from Q1 '19 to Q1 '21; polyethylene, up 17%; polypropylene, up 12%, Q1 '19 to Q1 '21. So it really points to a very resilient demand. And as you look forward into the turnaround season, very heavy turnaround season also in Europe. In fact, in April, about 13% of the ethylene capacity is expected to be offline on a planned basis. 
So I mean, I think we could see tightness through a good bit of the first half of the year based on demand hanging in there even when there's a spike of COVID rates in various countries. And as the vaccine is distributed, I would think all of that will settle down and the demand growth we should see year-over-year."

So I think, again, if you go back to what we talked about in the prepared materials, if we have recovery kind of growth in '21 at 7% or something, I think we essentially can absorb what's coming globally.  
Your question about the Shell plant that will start up in Pennsylvania, yes, I mean certainly, there will be temporary dislocation. They'll have to -- they'll find their way into the market. They'll export some product. But much like when, for example, Sasol started up, it was a 4 quarter or a month or 2 when these large plants start up. But eventually, as long as kind of the overall demand is such that the supply is needed, it tends to find its way to where demand is.

Speaking for ourselves, we can barely keep up with orders, let alone allow any kind of prebuy. So our team is essentially under pretty strict instructions to not allow prebuy because we simply don't have the inventory to do it. We're just trying to meet the demand for customers. And many customers are saying, ""Hey, if you're 3 days late, we're going to run out of product."" So I think we find ourselves in a really tight environment.

So I'm going to give you statistics for the first part of your question, and then I'll talk kind of qualitatively about the second half. So if you look at our polypropylene volume, I'll tell you how Q1 '21, we think, is shaping up compared to Q1 '19. In the U.S., we're likely up 14% from Q1 '19 to Q1 '21; and in EAI, up 12%. Another sort of data point is that polypropylene demand in China grew about 10% from 2019 to '20.  
Now your second question about pandemic-related, certainly, the masks and the medical gowns and all of that has been a pretty important driver. And frankly, I think even after vaccinations are more widespread, use of masks will still be pretty common, I think, for most of this year and maybe even into next year. So it's -- I don't have a number for you on what percent of the growth was accounted for by the masks. But if I were to estimate, maybe 1% to 2% of the growth is related to the masks of the 14% that I mentioned for the Americas polypropylene growth. 
All right. So I think that was our last question. I'd like to just offer a few closing remarks before I let you all go. Thank you for hanging in there. So first of all, with the completion of 2020, you've seen a resilient performance from our company through the first significant downturn since our emergence back in 2010. Our fourth quarter results have given you a preview of our increased earnings power. 
Going into 2021, we have more assets, strong order books, tight markets and rising economic activity, all of which should provide confidence for continuing improvement into the first quarter. While much of our industry is scheduling high levels of second quarter maintenance, LyondellBasell's planned downtime for 2021 is relatively light. Our assets are ready to capture improving seasonal demand. Refining and Oxyfuels businesses are poised to benefit from increased mobility during the second half of the year. I think all of this positions us well to increase cash flow and continue to strengthen our balance sheet as we work our way through 2021. 
So thank you for your interest in our company, and we look forward to updating you in about 90 days. Have a great weekend."

I'm joined today by Bob Patel, our Chief Executive Officer; and Michael McMurray, our Chief Financial Officer.  
Before we begin the business discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com. Today, we will be discussing our business results while making reference to some forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, and the alternative measures are useful to investors. Nonetheless, the forward-looking statements are subject to significant risk and uncertainty. We encourage you to learn more about the factors that could lead our actual results to differ by reviewing the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our regulatory filings, which are available at www.lyondellbasell.com/investorrelations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with other disclosures, including the earnings release, are also currently available on our website.  
Finally, I would like to point out that a recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 1 p.m. Eastern Time today until February 28 by calling (800) 846-0305 in the United States and (402) 998-0543 outside the United States. The pass code for both numbers is 6541.  
During today's call, we will focus on the fourth quarter and full year results, the current environment, our near-term outlook and provide an update on our growth initiatives. Before I turn the call over to Bob, I would like to call your attention to the noncash lower of cost or market inventory adjustments, or LCM, that we have discussed on past calls. These adjustments are related to our use of last in, first out LIFO accounting and the recent volatility in prices for our raw materials and finished goods inventories.  
During the fourth quarter, we recognized pretax LCM benefits totaling $147 million compared to LCM charges of $163 million during the first 9 months of 2020. During the third quarter, we recognized a noncash impairment charge of $582 million related to our Houston refinery. Comments made on the call will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impacts of the refinery impairment and the LCM inventory adjustments.  
With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Bob."

Oil",1223,"Thank you, Dave, and good day to all of you participating around the world. We appreciate you joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full year results for 2020.  
Let's turn to Slide 3. 2020 was unlike anything we have ever seen or experienced. Oil price volatility, a global pandemic and an associated recession, to call this year unprecedented would be an understatement. So before we get into the results today, I want to take a few minutes to provide some context around our approach to navigating the past year because I think it speaks well to who we are as a company and the character and talent of our team.  
Early in the year as it became clear that the virus was becoming more widespread, our leadership team established three guiding principles for the short term. Number one, protect our employees and communities; two, keep our commitments to our investors; and three, take actions to strengthen the company for the future. 
In past earnings calls, I've talked about some attributes of our culture, operational and commercial excellence, cost management and capital discipline. These qualities served us particularly well during 2020 as we bolstered liquidity by rapidly accessing capital markets, minimizing working capital and efficiently generating cash. Importantly, we honored our commitment to an investment-grade credit rating and continue to fund dividends and capital investments with cash from operations. As we review our results today, I hope the outcome of these priorities and the benefits of this culture will be clear. 
Beyond the strategy itself, I also wanted to take a moment to acknowledge our global team that delivered our results. These individuals, both those who were able to work remotely and those who continue to work on the front lines at our manufacturing sites, form a strong and nimble team. They have my sincere and deepest gratitude. If the pandemic reinforced anything, it is the value of our products and industry in serving modern society's needs.  
Knowing that the materials produced by our plants go into end products like face masks, medical gowns and COVID-19 test kits, our team took immediate action to ensure our manufacturing sites would continue to supply our customers while prioritizing the safety of our workforce. I'm very proud to say that not only did we continue to operate reliably, but to date, there have been no cases of workplace virus transmission among our employees.  
The last topic I'd like to highlight before we get into the specifics of our results was how our team not only managed through the immediate challenges but how we also remain focused on our future. During the year, we advanced our growth agenda through the formation of JVs in China and here on the U.S. Gulf Coast that provided immediate benefits to earnings. We also made meaningful progress on our ESG strategy, especially in the areas of eliminating plastic waste and enhancing our efforts in the areas of diversity, equity and inclusion. Our company believes these initiatives are critical for our future. And despite the challenges, we maintained our focus on making meaningful progress throughout the year. Taken together, I hope these examples tell the story of a strong, nimble and focused company that is building a bright future for our employees, our customers and our shareholders.  
Let's turn to Slide 4 and review some of last year's highlights. 2020 earnings were $5.61 per share with $3.9 billion of EBITDA. This represents a decline of 42% and 32%, respectively, relative to the prior year. Economists believe that global GDP fell by approximately 4% in 2020, more than double the decline during the financial crisis in 2009. Considering the severe decline in economic activity during the past year, LyondellBasell's results proved to be relatively resilient. Our performance was supported by strong and consistent consumer-driven demand for many of our products, some industry supply constraints and the recovery in demand for durable goods during the second half of the year. Our Refining and Oxyfuels & Related Products businesses suffered from the unprecedented decline in demand for transportation fuels that began during March due to the pandemic.  
We efficiently converted EBITDA into cash from operating activities that fully covered both dividends and our capital investments during 2020. Through rapid access to debt capital markets and aggressive working capital management, we ended the year with over $5 billion in available liquidity.  
Our strong balance sheet served us well by allowing the company to advance on our growth strategies during this challenging environment. In September, we formed a new integrated olefin and polyolefin joint venture in China. And only a few short months later, we formed a second joint venture comprised of newly-built integrated polyethylene assets in Louisiana. Both joint ventures provided immediate benefits to our fourth quarter profitability.  
Despite the challenges of the pandemic, we continue to advance on our substantive and ambitious goals to develop more circular and sustainable business models for our products that we outlined in our most recent sustainability report. In December, our QCP joint venture in Europe completed an acquisition that increased their polyolefin recycling capacity to 55 tons. Our actions during 2020 are prime examples of our strategy to identify, develop and capture opportunities through business cycles that should provide significant upside as market conditions continue to improve.  
On Slide 5, you can see that the challenges of the past year did not diminish our relentless focus on pursuing GoalZERO safety performance. If anything, our employees exhibited an increased sense of ownership for ensuring workplace safety and hygiene to enable a slight improvement upon our 2019 metrics. 
I'm particularly thankful for the progress exhibited by the employees who joined LyondellBasell when we acquired A. Schulman in 2018. Prior to the acquisition, the recordable injury rate at these facilities was 1.54 per 200,000 hours worked, more than 3x the scale of this chart. Following the acquisition, our new employees quickly adopted LyondellBasell's safety focus, and injury rates were reduced by more than 50% for 2018 and 2019. In 2020, the injury rate for these facilities was 0.35 and in the top quartile for our industry. We will work diligently for further improvements in our safety performance to ensure all our employees, contractors and the communities in which we operate finish the day in the same or better condition than when they started. In December, we announced the latest step in our progress to increase utilization of plastic waste as a feedstock to create a more circular economy.  
Please turn to Slide 6. As I mentioned, our QCP joint venture with SUEZ acquired Tivaco in Belgium in December. This acquisition increased the JV's recycling capacity to approximately 55,000 tons per year. More importantly, the acquisition expands QCP's geographic footprint to increase our capability to produce premium circular polymers for the local market using locally-sourced plastic waste. 
With the increased range of end-use applications from Tivaco's existing product line, QCP will be better poised to serve brand owners in achieving their ambitious goals for increased utilization of circular polymers in packaging and other products. The acquisition represents another step in advancing LyondellBasell's goal to annually produce and market over 2 million tons of recycled and renewable base polymers by 2030.  
With that said, I'll turn the call over to Michael, who will lead us through several topics related to our financial results."

Please turn to Slide 7, and let me begin by highlighting our track record of improving cash conversion. 
The benefits of efficient cash conversion become more apparent during periods of economic downturns when liquidity provides defense against risk from volatility and uncertainty. Over the past year, LyondellBasell converted 88% of our EBITDA into $3.4 billion of cash from operating activities. As a result of the challenging market dynamics in 2020, our business teams took aggressive actions in managing inventories to drive free cash flow and maximize liquidity to release more than $300 million of cash from working capital. We are pleased to report that despite the downturn, we've fully funded $1.4 billion in dividends and our $1.9 billion capital investment program through cash generated from operating activities in 2020. The $4.20 per share of dividends paid by our company during the year extends LyondellBasell's track record of consistently paying and increasing our base dividend over the past 10 years.  
Let's continue with Slide 8 and review further details of our cash generation and deployment throughout the year. As you can see, we increased the amount of cash in our balance sheet by approximately $1.4 billion during 2020, to end the year with $2.5 billion in cash and liquid investments. Cash from operations fully funded a small amount of share repurchases in the first quarter of 2020 as well as the full year's dividends and capital expenditures.  
In 2020, we accessed very attractive debt capital markets to extend maturities of existing debt, fund acquisitions and bolster liquidity. These borrowings increased gross debt by $3.9 billion relative to the prior year. A portion of the new bonds funded the $470 million equity contribution for our joint venture with Bora in China and the $2 billion acquisition of our 50% share of the Louisiana integrated polyethylene joint venture with Sasol. We incurred about $70 million in pretax cost due to our fourth quarter refinancing activities. We ended the year with $5.2 billion of cash and available liquidity that enabled us to reduce the balance of our term loan by $500 million in January of 2021. We will continue to prioritize deleveraging over the course of this year, which should allow us to further strengthen our investment-grade balance sheet.  
Before I turn the call over to Bob, let me address some of your annual modeling questions for 2021 on Slide 9. We are planning to invest approximately $2 billion in capital expenditures during 2021. Approximately $1 billion is targeted towards profit-generating growth projects, with the balance supporting sustaining maintenance. The majority of the 2021 growth investment is planned for the construction of the PO/TBA plant in Houston. Work on the PO/TBA project ramped up during the fourth quarter after slowing down earlier last year to ensure worksite safety and preserve liquidity during the pandemic. We expect a similar level of capital expenditures for 2022, followed by a modest reduction in 2023 upon completion of the PO/TBA facility.  
We have a relatively light planned maintenance schedule for 2021, with only one major cracker turnaround planned in Europe as well as a few turnarounds in our Intermediates & Derivatives segment. Based on expected volumes and margins, we estimate that lost production associated with this maintenance downtime will impact 2021 EBITDA by approximately $170 million. While routine maintenance costs are expensed, maintenance costs arising from turnarounds of major production units are capitalized and included in our capital expenditure forecast. The European cracker turnaround will occur in the third and fourth quarters of 2021 and is expected to impact O&P EAI quarterly EBITDA by $10 million and $15 million, respectively. Planned maintenance in our Intermediates & derivatives segment is expected to impact EBITDA by approximately $20 million, $60 million, $35 million and $30 million in the first through fourth quarters, respectively. We expect 2021 net interest expense to be approximately $430 million after netting capitalized interest of about $90 million. 2021 book depreciation and amortization is forecasted to be approximately $1.4 billion. We plan to make regular pension contributions in 2021 totaling approximately $100 million with a similar amount of pension expense for the year. We currently expect our 2021 effective tax rate to be approximately 17%. We expect our cash tax rate will be lower than our ETR due to an anticipated cash refund, but uncertainties around the timing of that refund do not allow us to provide a reliable estimate.  
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob for a more detailed discussion of our segment results. Bob?"

Let's turn to Slide 10, which illustrates our quarterly profitability over the past 5 quarters. Unlike a typical year, where LyondellBasell's business portfolio would follow a seasonal trend with peak earnings occurring midyear, the patterns seen in 2020 are reversed with higher profitability in the first and fourth quarters. The rebound in profitability since the second quarter has been remarkable as the global economy proceeds on a path to recovery.  
EBITDA in the final quarter of 2020 was $1.3 billion, the highest for any fourth quarter since 2017 and more than $375 million higher than the prior quarter. The trajectory supports our belief that pandemic-driven reductions in demand for our products bottomed during the second quarter.  
Our Olefins and Polyolefins segments serve strong consumer-driven demand for packaging and nondurable products throughout the year, while our Intermediates & Derivatives and Advanced Polymer Solutions segment benefited from improving industrial sector demand for durable goods during the second half of the year.  
We have only seen modest recovery in the demand for transportation fuels. Our Refinery and Oxyfuels & Related Products businesses continue to experience headwinds from excess capacity and flat demand due to persistently low global mobility. While we would naturally prefer to see strength in all of the markets we serve, the geographic and end-market diversity of our product portfolio continues to provide offsets that helped to dampen business cycles.  
Let's turn to Slide 11 and look at the latest thoughts from consultants on the global polyethylene business cycle. Industry consultants have forecasted that capacity additions, especially in China, could outpace global demand over the next 4 years. These predictions seem reminiscent of forecast from consulting reports published in 2016 depicted by the dotted blue line, which predicted global operating rates would dip due to the capacity additions on the U.S. Gulf Coast from 2017 through 2018. The actual operating rate depicted by the solid line demonstrates that press releases announcing capacity additions often have ambitious time lines, and typical delays in construction and commissioning can allow consistent demand growth to absorb capacity additions with less impact on operating rates and margins than predicted. 
In addition to delays in capacity additions, we believe recent forecasts underestimate growth in demand. Early in the pandemic, many predicted declines in PE demand for 2020. By the middle of the year, forecasts improved to flat demand. Most consultants now believe that global PE demand grew by approximately 4% in 2020, similar to growth rates seen consistently over the past 30 years. Adjusting these forecasts to 4% demand growth for both 2020 and 2021 results in a predicted operating rate depicted in the dotted gray line. If 2021 follows patterns seen after prior recessions and demand growth rebounds to levels higher than 4%, then operating rates would accordingly move upward. A rebounding economy that increases 2021 global polyethylene demand by 7% followed by reversion to consultant forecast of 4% growth thereafter would generate the robust operating rate forecast depicted by the dotted orange line.  
In summary, we believe the next wave of capacity additions will result in operating rates within the boundaries of a balanced market. The next wave of capacity additions will undoubtedly occur, but we believe that typical project delays, a few project cancellations and perhaps increased demand from a recovering economy could contribute to a more orderly absorption of the new capacity by the global market.  
Let's review the fourth quarter results for each of our segments. As mentioned, my discussion will describe our underlying business results, excluding the noncash impacts of LCM inventory changes and the impairment of the Houston refinery. I'll begin with our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment on Slide 12.  
Fourth quarter 2020 EBITDA was $722 million, $318 million higher than the third quarter. Margins improved on higher pricing driven by higher demand for both olefins and polyolefins. Olefins results increased $185 million compared to the third quarter of 2020. Margin improved on higher ethylene and propylene pricing. Volume increased with improved demand. Combined polyolefin results were approximately $65 million higher than the third quarter, primarily due to an increase in polyethylene and polypropylene spreads over monomer. For the full year, results decreased by $514 million. Margins declined for both Olefins and Polyolefins driven by lower prices for olefin coproducts and polyethylene despite lower feedstock costs.  
Lifestyle changes associated with the pandemic drove increases in demand for nondurable packaging and consumer goods, providing strength in the polyethylene market and increased volumes for ethylene and polyethylene. Based on strong February orders, increasing seasonal demand and tight industry supply, we expect robust margins to continue into the first quarter.  
Now please turn to Slide 13 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. During the fourth quarter, EBITDA was $251 million, an increase of $120 million compared to the third quarter. Improving demand for polyolefins and a full quarter of contribution from our Bora joint venture increased both polyolefin volumes and equity income. Olefins results were relatively unchanged with lower margins due to increased maintenance expense, partially offset by increased volume. Combined polyolefin results increased more than $20 million driven by higher demand and volumes from our Bora joint venture. Equity income increased about $60 million, with more than half of that improvement arising from Bora. Full year EBITDA was $236 million lower than 2019. Margins declined in both olefins and polyolefins due to lower polyolefin and ethylene prices, outpacing lower feedstock costs. Polyolefin demand remained relatively stable with increased sales from the start-up of our Bora joint venture during the fourth quarter. In Europe, we expect typical seasonal improvements as we progress through the first half of the year.  
Please turn to Slide 14, let's take a look at our Intermediates & derivatives segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $196 million, a decline of $49 million from the third quarter 2020. Compressed margins for Oxyfuels & Related Products, driven by weaker gasoline demand and prices, muted the margin improvement in our Propylene Oxide & Derivatives business. 
Fourth quarter Propylene Oxide & Derivatives results increased approximately $25 million due to significantly higher Asia propylene oxide pricing driven by strong demand and tight market supplies. Intermediate Chemicals results were relatively unchanged. Oxyfuels & Related Products results decreased by approximately $10 million as small volume improvements were more than offset by margin declines due to continued low gasoline prices and higher butane feedstock costs.  
During 2020, EBITDA declined $714 million compared to 2019. Margin declined in most businesses, primarily in the Oxyfuels & Related Products and Intermediate Chemicals businesses. Volumes for most businesses also declined due to lower demand, partially offset by increased Asia demand for our Propylene Oxide & Derivatives products.  
In the first quarter of 2021, we expect margins to be relatively flat as market tightness in Asia is alleviated by higher industry supply. Our volumes will be impacted during the first quarter due to planned maintenance at our Channelview propylene oxide and styrene monomer unit.  
Now let's move forward and review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 15. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $126 million, a $9 million increase over the third quarter of 2020. Volumes increased with improved demand in the automotive sector, partially offset by lower margins. Results for both Compounding & Solutions and Advanced Polymer businesses were relatively unchanged. Within our Compounding & Solutions business, volumes increased as automotive manufacturers ramped up production. Margins declined as a result of product prices lagging price increases for propylene feedstocks.  
Full year EBITDA for the segment was $381 million, a $51 million decline over 2019. Compared to the prior period, results benefited from an $80 million reduction in integration costs. Volumes declined with significantly lower automotive, appliance and construction demand, partially offset by higher margins as a result of product mix. We expect continued recovery in industrial durable goods demand, particularly for products from our Advanced Polymers business during the spring.  
At our Investor Day in 2019, we announced an increased target of $200 million of synergies from the A. Schulman acquisition. We have successfully implemented our synergy plan, and we are beginning to capture an annual run rate of more than $200 million, which will become increasingly visible with volume recovery in the Advanced Polymer Solutions segment.  
Now let's dig a little deeper on how the recovery in durable goods demand is playing out in the polypropylene and compounds markets for our company on Slide 16. China's rapid response to control COVID transmission and stimulate industrial production resulted in strong demand growth despite the pandemic. Automotive production in China was up 6% in the fourth quarter compared to the same quarter last year, and China polypropylene demand for the full year 2020 increased by 10% over 2019. 
The strength in durable goods markets is also evident in LyondellBasell's metrics. Our polypropylene inventory levels had all-time lows in both North America and Europe on strong market demand. In North America, construction activities increased in the fourth quarter with a 5% year-over-year increase in demand for single-ply thermoplastic roofing materials that utilize our Catalloy Advanced Polymers.  
Looking at our own order books for Polypropylene Compounds, Engineered Plastics and Catalloy within the APS segment, a nice V-shaped recovery is shown in the chart where the forecast for January suggests a first quarter that is nearly the same level seen in the first quarter of 2019. Tight markets, low inventory and strong orders indicate that markets for polypropylene-based durable goods are showing strength going into the first quarter 2021. The increased demand for our polypropylene compounds, engineered plastics and Catalloy products should benefit the APS segment in 2021.  
Now let's turn to Slide 17 and discuss the results of our Refining segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was negative $74 million, a $47 million improvement versus the third quarter of 2020. As I discussed earlier, this excludes the impact of both LCM and impairment of the Houston refinery in the third quarter. Results for the fourth quarter were driven by an improvement in margins due to lower fixed costs and improved margin capture. Improvements in the Maya 2-1-1 industry benchmark crack spread were more than offset by increased costs for Renewable Identification Number of Credits or RINs. Similar to the prior period, we operated the refinery at about 80% of nameplate crude capacity to match reduced demand with an average crude throughput of 214,000 barrels per day.  
Full year EBITDA was negative $289 million, $224 million lower than 2019. Refining margins were compressed due to pandemic-driven reductions in demand for gasoline and jet fuel. The Maya 2-1-1 spread was at a historically low point during the year and averaged $12.63 per barrel. 2020 crude throughput was limited to an average of 223,000 barrels per day as we actively managed operations to match the reduced market demand.  
Refining margins are expected to move sideways until demand for gasoline and jet fuel improves. We plan to continue operating the refinery at about 80% of nameplate crude capacity during the first quarter. We remain diligent with efforts to reduce expenses and minimize losses at our Houston refinery, and we'll continue to evaluate production decisions as the market evolves. 
Please turn to Slide 18 as we review the results for our Technology segment. EBITDA was $45 million during the fourth quarter and was $324 million for the full year. Fourth quarter technology profitability declined due to a lower number of licensing revenue recognition milestones. Catalyst margins increased due to inventory mix improvements, partially offset by decrease in volumes as customers manage year-end inventories. Based on the timing of anticipated licensing milestones and improving catalyst demand, we expect the first quarter Technology business profitability to improve to a similar level as in the first quarter of 2019.  
Please turn to Slide 19 for a refreshed view of our value-driven growth investments. Our company is executing on a clear and straightforward strategy to increase free cash flow by harvesting new sources of EBITDA generation while moderating our capital expenditure budget to $2 billion or less for each of the next 3 years. The formula is simple. More EBITDA and moderating capital expenditures should improve free cash flow at any point in business cycles.  
Let me summarize the year's highlights and outlook with Slide 20. During 2020, LyondellBasell remain true to our strategy of capturing value and delivering resilient results at all points in the cycle. We delivered on our commitments to investors, served our customers and supported our employees while moving forward on sustainability initiatives. By maximizing cash generation and prioritizing liquidity, we maintained our investment-grade rating and extended the continuity of our dividend. Demand for consumer-driven goods remained strong, and durable goods markets are rebounding with increased industrial activity. As global mobility improves, we expect that demand and margin for fuels from our Refinery and Oxyfuels & Related Product businesses will follow. 
Over the past several years, LyondellBasell has captured opportunities through disciplined and profitable growth investments, whether building, acquiring or partnering on assets, our company focused on leveraging our technology, building on our advantages and increasing our earnings capacity. Our path is clear. LyondellBasell will remain focused on meeting our commitments and pursuing a disciplined financial strategy. With robust cash generation and ample liquidity, we plan to continue strengthening our balance sheet and optimizing our portfolio during 2021. We look forward to sharing our progress toward developing more circular business models for our industry and creating a more supportive culture for our workforce that will allow all of us to continue delivering sustainable results for years to come.

Well, first of all, in terms of how much of our polyethylene demand or customers are asking for sustainable products, I mean if you think about our sales of polyethylene, more than half of it goes into packaging, whether it's flexible or blow-molded bottles or those sorts of things. So I think it's safe to say more than half, probably close to 2/3 over time, we'll want to have sustainable products as part of the mix that we sell them.  
In terms of their preference, for food packaging, clearly, the molecular recycling would be the most desirable because, essentially, what we're doing is we're creating new feedstock and producing FDA-approved resin. So our sense is that molecular recycling will be the most important development as we look at the next 5 to 7 years. But I think mechanical recycling will continue to play a role, and that's where we're capturing the near-term opportunities. And as you know, we have a molecular recycling pilot plant that we've built in Italy. We're working -- I had a review with my R&D team, in fact, this week, and they're working diligently to perfect the technology and get to semi works as soon as possible."

In fact, we're looking for opportunities to build back some inventory. But because demand is so strong, we're not able to do that.  
On the pricing front, January price increase discussions are essentially finished, and the implementation of the increase is going to occur. The next increase for February is on the table. And likely, there will be very good discussion about that as well. If you think about markets being tight in January, typically, as we go into the spring, we see a seasonal uptick in demand. And so I think that supply/demand fundamentals are going to remain tight through the first half of the year for polyethylene.  
Polypropylene, similarly, as you said, propylene prices run up quite a lot, but inventories are still low. We're struggling to build inventory because demand is so good. And as you said about durables, probably applies more to polypropylene. As the economic recovery really takes hold in Europe and U.S., I think we're going to see probably more pull from durable goods end users. So we're quite constructive about both, frankly. It looks tight through the first half of the year.  
And the other thing I would add is there's quite a bit of downtime on -- a planned downtime in the industry for crackers. So that's going to keep monomer prices probably high through the first half of the year. There's also a very large PDH turnaround here on the Gulf Coast. So that'll keep propylene pretty snugged through May, I would imagine."

Now typically, in recovery years, we've seen demand growth above trend line in the first year or even 2, post recessions.  
To your question about how do you bridge the 4% to the 7%. First of all, in polyethylene here in the U.S., the pipe market has been very, very weak. And if there's an infrastructure bill as oil and gas starts to come back a bit, I think that could help demand growth here in the U.S. And likely, if there's infrastructure spending in Europe and China, I mean you could really see that market contribute to bridging the 4% to 7%. 
The other is there's still enough durable goods content for industrial demand for, for example, like industrial bulk containers. As industrial activity picks up, I think we'll see recovery or higher demand rates for polyethylene. So I don't think it would take much to get to the 7%. And when you factor that in, it looks like operating rates could stay elevated through -- over the next few years."

I would add a fourth item to your list, which is very robust demand for the derivatives of propylene, not just polypropylene, but the other propylene derivatives: cumene and derivatives and so on. So we've really had a strong full from all propylene derivatives, which has helped. I think until the PDH outages or turnarounds are behind us, I think we're going to have tightness in propylene.  
The other thing is propane is very far out today so -- as the economic feedstock. So maybe if propane cracking returns in the summer when propane gets cheaper, you could see a little bit more propylene supply come. But my sense is that we have a pretty tight propylene market probably through May."

But we've not seen significant impact on demand for polyolefins. So polyolefins demand has been still very resilient.  
If you look at EAI across the board, and of course, a lot of that's Europe if you think about our volume, if you compare Q1 '21 how our book is building compared to Q1 '19, we expect that ethylene is going to be up about 15% from Q1 '19 to Q1 '21; polyethylene, up 17%; polypropylene, up 12%, Q1 '19 to Q1 '21. So it really points to a very resilient demand. And as you look forward into the turnaround season, very heavy turnaround season also in Europe. In fact, in April, about 13% of the ethylene capacity is expected to be offline on a planned basis. 
So I mean, I think we could see tightness through a good bit of the first half of the year based on demand hanging in there even when there's a spike of COVID rates in various countries.

With the hurricanes that came through the U.S., there were some unplanned outages in Europe, there was just enough to really firm up the market.  
Speaking for ourselves, we can barely keep up with orders, let alone allow any kind of prebuy. So our team is essentially under pretty strict instructions to not allow prebuy because we simply don't have the inventory to do it. We're just trying to meet the demand for customers. And many customers are saying, ""Hey, if you're 3 days late, we're going to run out of product."" So I think we find ourselves in a really tight environment. And I think if there's some softness, let's say in February, I can tell you, for us, we're going to take the opportunity to selectively build back inventory and get ready for the spring season, which we expect to be robust like usual."

Another sort of data point is that polypropylene demand in China grew about 10% from 2019 to '20.  
Now your second question about pandemic-related, certainly, the masks and the medical gowns and all of that has been a pretty important driver. And frankly, I think even after vaccinations are more widespread, use of masks will still be pretty common, I think, for most of this year and maybe even into next year. So it's -- I don't have a number for you on what percent of the growth was accounted for by the masks. But if I were to estimate, maybe 1% to 2% of the growth is related to the masks of the 14% that I mentioned for the Americas polypropylene growth.

So first of all, with the completion of 2020, you've seen a resilient performance from our company through the first significant downturn since our emergence back in 2010. Our fourth quarter results have given you a preview of our increased earnings power. 
Going into 2021, we have more assets, strong order books, tight markets and rising economic activity, all of which should provide confidence for continuing improvement into the first quarter. While much of our industry is scheduling high levels of second quarter maintenance, LyondellBasell's planned downtime for 2021 is relatively light. Our assets are ready to capture improving seasonal demand. Refining and Oxyfuels businesses are poised to benefit from increased mobility during the second half of the year. I think all of this positions us well to increase cash flow and continue to strengthen our balance sheet as we work our way through 2021. 
So thank you for your interest in our company, and we look forward to updating you in about 90 days. Have a great weekend."

We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our first quarter results. 
Before we get into the discussion of our results, I would like to take a moment to recognize the tremendous progress that has been made in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic and how much hard work still needs to be done around the world to reduce the effects of this disease. While financial markets are focused on the economic upside enabled by increased vaccination and the eventual reopening today, our employees, customers, suppliers and the communities where we operate, in India, in particular, as well as Brazil and even parts of Europe, are still suffering from terribly high case rates and fatalities. We are working closely with governments around the world to do our part to advance immunity for our employees and their communities and to hasten an end to the devastation brought on by this virus. Our thoughts remain with those most affected by this pandemic. 
Now moving into the discussion of our Q1 results. LyondellBasell is continuing to build upon the momentum seen in the second half of 2020. During last year's recession, we advanced on our strategic initiatives to grow our asset base and emerge stronger from the downturn to position our company to capture the benefits of a recovering economy in 2021. 
Let's begin with Slide 3 and review the highlights. In the first quarter, earnings more than doubled from the same quarter of last year to $3.18 per share. LyondellBasell's first quarter net income improved by 25% relative to the fourth quarter as we earned approximately $1.6 billion of EBITDA. Our businesses benefited from strong demand and tight markets at improved margins across the majority of our segments. 
Our Olefins and Polyolefins - Europe, Asia and International segment achieved their highest quarterly EBITDA since 2018, while the O&P-Americas segment reached a quarterly EBITDA level that has not been seen since 2015. 
Strong cash generation enabled us to pay down $500 million of debt in January and end the first quarter with nearly $5 billion of cash and available liquidity. After the quarter closed, we paid down an additional $500 million of debt in April. We expect that our robust cash generation should continue throughout the year, and our top priority for capital deployment in 2021 is debt reduction, which will enable meaningful progress toward improving our credit metrics to 2 turns of total debt-to-EBITDA. 
As we approach the end of the first month of the second quarter, low inventories and persistently high demand are driving higher margins for most of our products. The unusually cold weather and associated power outages that occurred during February in Texas resulted in approximately 1 month of downtime for a significant share of total U.S. capacity located within the state. Deferred turnarounds from 2020 are resulting in high levels of planned maintenance downtime for many of our competitors during the second quarter. LyondellBasell has no major planned maintenance for the second quarter at any of the global assets that we operate. We are focused on running our assets safely, reliably and at maximum rates to supply our customers' needs and capture the opportunities available in these strong markets. 
We expect markets will remain tight through at least the end of this year due to very high demand, low inventories and the capacity that will be lost during planned downtime. With customer demand exceeding production, the full extent of our customers' backlogs, deferred consumption and unmet demand are unknown. 
In the days after the Texas freeze, North American PE exports fell by 13% for the month of February, and we expect the March data to reflect further declines in exports. It will likely require quite some time before North American polyethylene industry can fulfill backlogs, satisfy domestic demand and returned to last year's pace of selling 40% of production into the export market to serve global demand. 
And this scenario of replenishing inventory over the course of 2021 does not factor in an additional wave of demand that is likely to arise in the second half of this year from restocking and increased activity in the travel, leisure and hospitality sectors as vaccines provide for increased mobility. The reopening and considerable pent-up demand will add another leg of growth across our businesses. Increased mobility and rising demand for transportation fuels should enable our oxyfuels and refining businesses to deliver meaningful profit improvements in the second half of '21 and into 2022. 
Let's turn to Slide 4 and review our recent safety performance. At LyondellBasell, the first topic on the agenda for a meeting of our leadership or any group of employees throughout the company is typically oriented toward improving the health and safety of our teams. Our consistent emphasis on a culture of safety provides clear and direct benefits towards improving the health and welfare of our employees, contractors and communities. We also believe the attention to detail embedded in our safety culture cascades indirect benefits towards our work to ensure reliable operations, commercial leadership, and ultimately, differential financial performance. 
As such, I'm pleased to report that in the first quarter of 2021, our employees and contractors achieved the best safety performance we have attained in any prior year. We look forward to continued progress on our journey toward our goal of 0 injuries. 
Earlier this month, we launched our Circulen portfolio of polymers, described on Slide 5, to enable our customers and brand owners to improve the sustainability of their products. Circulen Recover polymers are already in use, producing consumer products such as the Samsonite Magnum Eco suitcase line depicted on the slide. We are stepping up volumes of Circulen Renew polymers in Europe and advancing our proprietary catalyzed pyrolysis technology at our MoReTec molecular recycling pilot facility in Italy, with the goal of bringing this potentially game-changing technology for Circulen Revive polymers to a commercial scale. 
Over the past 70 years, our polymers have played a central role in advancing modern living by reducing food waste with protective packaging, delivering safe drinking water through plastic pipes and advancing health care with sterile and affordable devices and equipment. With the introduction of our Circulen product line, we are making further progress towards LyondellBasell's goal of producing and marketing 2 million metric tons of recycle- and renewal-based polymers annually by 2030. 
On Slide 6, we highlight how LyondellBasell's technological advancements can enable our customers to independently improve the sustainability profile of their product formulations. Our new Hyperzone HDPE process is capable of producing polyethylene with more than 5x the crack resistance of standard polyethylene produced with a chromium catalyst in a slurry loop process. This premium performance of polyethylene from our Hyperzone multi-zone process can be directly leveraged by customers to produce packaging, such as detergent bottles with thinner walls, and less polyethylene that reduces weight without sacrificing durability or performance. 
As our customers seek to improve the circularity of their business models, many plastics converters have set aggressive goals to increase their utilization of post-consumer recycled, or PCR, plastics in packaging and other applications. Hyperzone's outstanding performance can also be leveraged to allow for increased blending of PCR without sacrificing performance. 
As you can see in the chart, Hyperzone HDPE blended with 25% PCR can still exceed the crack resistance of standard polyethylene by 70%. Our customers are leveraging LyondellBasell's advanced technology to improve the crack resistance, top load strength, impact resistance and other critical properties for their products while simultaneously improving the sustainability profile of their business models. 
Now let's step back a bit and on Slide 7 review some of the macroeconomic forces that have been driving LyondellBasell's business performance during the pandemic and the ongoing recovery. One way to think about the trajectory of the economy is to untangle a few of the societal trends that are fueling demand in markets for nondurable goods, durable goods and transportation. 
In the early days of the pandemic in March, April and May of 2020, we saw elevated demand for nondurable goods as households engaged in pantry stocking to protect against supply disruptions and adapt to the transition toward increased working from home, schooling from home and other lifestyle changes associated with quarantines and societal lockdowns. LyondellBasell's Olefins and Polyolefins businesses benefited from the double-digit improvements in packaging demand has increased utilization of nonbulk packaging and e-commerce deliveries boosted demand for our materials. 
In 2021, consumer packaged goods demand remains elevated by single-digit percentages relative to pre-pandemic levels. We expect somewhat elevated demand for packaging will persist following the pandemic with some permanent changes in society that a portion of the population continues to work remotely, school remotely and use home delivery for convenience. 
The second economic driver for our businesses has been the recovery in consumer-, industrial- and construction-related demand for durable goods that began in the third quarter of 2020. This trend can be reflected by the dark blue line that tracks the ongoing recovery in vehicle production in North America. With government stimulus supporting the U.S. economy and limited options for travel, leisure and public dining, consumers remodeled homes and purchased appliances, home entertainment and vehicles that drove recovery for the industrial economy. This trend has been boosting demand for LyondellBasell's propylene oxide from our Intermediates and Derivatives segment that is used in polyurethane foams for furniture and construction insulation as well as polymers from our O&P segments that are used both directly and in plastic compounds produced by our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. 
The third significant trend is the increased mobility that is developing around the world as vaccination rates improve and activity in the travel, leisure and hospitality sectors returns to some semblance of normalcy. Increases in vehicle miles traveled are supporting a rebound in crude oil and gasoline prices to bring back margins for our oxyfuels business in the I&D segment. While a slower rebound in international air travel is holding back demand for jet fuel, strong demand for diesel and improving demand for gasoline is expected to improve profitability for LyondellBasell's Refining segment during the second half of this year. Increased mobility will also benefit our polymer businesses as the restaurant, hotel and tourism industries restock and begin to address substantial pent-up demand. 
The sum of these trends points to a strong outlook for both the global economy and LyondellBasell during the remainder of 2021 and well into 2022. On Slide 8, these trends can be seen in first quarter global demand growth for our 2 largest products, polyethylene and polypropylene, relative to pre-pandemic levels seen 2 years ago in the first quarter of 2019. 
Over this period, we've seen modest improvements in European demand. In the first quarter of 2021, North American demand was quite strong, but constrained by lack of supply due to the downtime triggered by the cold weather and associated power outages in Texas. Northeast Asian demand increased by an astounding 23% driven by the post-pandemic strength of the Chinese economy. Since imports account for approximately 40% of China's demand needs for polyethylene, China's growth benefited LyondellBasell's production sites in the United States and the Middle East that export polyethylene to China. 
Global demand for polyolefins has grown by 14% over the past 2 years, far above the long-term trends of 4% and 5% annual demand growth for polyethylene and polypropylene, respectively. Strong global demand and constrained production have supported polyethylene contract price increases of $950 per metric ton in the U.S. from May 2020 through March of this year, with $420 per ton occurring since November and more than $300 per ton of additional price increases on the table for April and May of 2021. As demand should get even stronger as we progress through the recovery, we expect tight markets and strong margins for polyolefins to persist into next year. 
On Slide 9, I would like to remind you of our view on the cyclical outlook that we discussed during our fourth quarter call. In January, we talked about concerns that global polyethylene capacity additions, particularly in China, could outpace global demand and depress operating rates and profitability over the coming years. This quarter, we have updated a chart we discussed during the fourth quarter call to address operating rates for both polyethylene and polypropylene. 
Predictions of reduced operating rates due to new capacity are highly reminiscent of forecasts from consulting reports published in 2016. These are depicted by the dotted blue line, which predicted global operating rates would dip due to capacity additions on the U.S. Gulf Coast from 2017 through 2018. The actual operating rate depicted by the solid line demonstrates that press releases announcing capacity additions often have ambitious time lines, and typical delays in construction and commissioning can allow consistent demand growth to absorb capacity additions with less impact on operating rates and margins than predicted. 
More importantly than delays in capacity, we believe recent forecasts are underestimating demand growth. Early in the pandemic, many predicted declines in PE demand for 2020. By the middle of the year, forecasts improved to flat demand. Most consultants now believe that global polyolefin demand grew by approximately 4% in 2020, similar to growth rates seen consistently over the past 30 years. Adjusting these forecasts to 4% demand growth for both '20 and '21 results in a predicted operating rate shown by the dotted gray line. 
Last quarter, we suggested that 2021 would likely follow the patterns seen after prior recessions, and this year's demand growth could be higher than the historical trend of 4%. A 7% growth in demand during 2021 for only 1 year with reversion to the historical mean in 2022 and beyond would generate the robust operating rate forecast depicted by the dotted orange line. 
Today, with global polyolefin demand growing in the first quarter by 14% over the past 2 years, we are even more confident that the recovering economy is likely to facilitate a more orderly absorption of this new capacity by the global market, which should support robust margins. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Michael, who will describe our financial and segment results over the past quarter."

Please turn to Slide 10, and let me begin by highlighting our track record of strong cash conversion. Over the last 12 months, LyondellBasell converted almost 80% of our EBITDA into $3.4 billion of cash from ope",1648,"Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 10, and let me begin by highlighting our track record of strong cash conversion. Over the last 12 months, LyondellBasell converted almost 80% of our EBITDA into $3.4 billion of cash from operating activities. In the first quarter of 2021, our businesses delivered over 40% more free operating cash flow relative to the same period last year. We expect continued improvement of our LTM performance as we progress through each quarter of 2021. 
Let's turn to Slide 11 and review further details of our cash generation and deployment during the first quarter. As Bob mentioned, our goal for this year is to accomplish meaningful deleveraging to further strengthen our investment-grade balance sheet. In the first quarter, while paying dividends of $352 million and investing in a similar amount in capital expenditures, we reduced the balance on our term loan by $500 million to close the first quarter with cash and liquid investments of $1.8 billion. After the quarter closed, we repaid an additional $500 million on the term loan in April. We expect that robust cash generation should enable continued progress on deleveraging throughout the year. 
Before I continue with a more detailed discussion of our segment results, let me provide a brief update on our 2021 modeling guidance. We continue to be on track to invest approximately $2 billion in capital expenditures during 2021, targeted equally towards profit-generating growth projects and sustaining maintenance. Due to extremely strong demand for propylene oxide, we have shifted a turnaround at one of our PO/TBA units in Bayport, Texas from the second quarter to the third quarter of this year and reduced the scope and associated downtime for the maintenance. 
With this change, we expect no major planned maintenance downtime in the second quarter of 2021. And based on expected volumes and margins, we estimate that the third quarter EBITDA impact due to lost production associated with planned maintenance across the company will increase by $30 million to $75 million. In total, the EBITDA impact associated with all of LyondellBasell's 2021 planned maintenance downtime should decrease by $30 million relative to our original guidance to approximately $140 million for the year. 
Let's turn to Slide 12 and review our quarterly profitability. In the first quarter of 2021, LyondellBasell's business portfolio delivered EBITDA of $1.6 billion. This was an improvement of more than $300 million relative to the fourth quarter, exceeding typical first quarter seasonal trends. The upward trajectory of LyondellBasell's profitability reflects improving demand and margins for our products driven by the recovering global economy and tight markets. 
As Bob mentioned, cold weather and associated power outages resulted in unplanned shutdowns that constrained first quarter production for LyondellBasell and nearly all of our competitors in the state of Texas. This downtime was exacerbated by strong global demand that tightened markets and elevated margins across most of our businesses. 
While it's clear that we lost production during the first quarter due to unplanned downtime, the offsetting effects of higher margins and sales from inventory complicates the effort to quantify the impact on first quarter business results. In the second quarter, we plan to operate our assets at nearly full rates as profitability improves for oxyfuels and refining businesses. We expect further EBITDA improvement during the second quarter. 
On the left side of the chart, our all-time high quarterly EBITDA, excluding LCM of approximately $2.2 billion reported in the third quarter of 2015, provides useful perspective. While profitability for transportation fuels was quite strong in 2015, today, our company has more earnings power from a larger asset base. Over the last 6 years, we have added ethylene capacity at Corpus Christi, expanded our compounding business through the acquisition of A. Schulman, started a new Hyperzone HDPE plant in Houston and added significant joint venture capacity in Louisiana and China. In 2021, LyondellBasell is poised to capture opportunities that are emerging in the rebounding global economy with a larger asset base. 
Now let's review the first quarter results for each of our segments. As mentioned, my discussion will describe our underlying business results excluding the noncash impacts of LCM inventory changes. I will begin with our Olefins and Polyolefins - Americas segment on Slide 13. 
Third quarter EBITDA was $867 million, $145 million higher than the fourth quarter. Tight markets and strong demand resulted in improved margins, driving quarterly results higher than we have seen since 2015. Olefin results increased approximately $155 million compared to the fourth quarter. Olefins margins increased, with higher ethylene and propylene prices outpacing higher feedstock and utility costs. Volumes decreased due to downtime driven by Texas weather events, partially offset by a full quarter of volume from our Louisiana joint venture that we formed in December. The ethylene cracker at the joint venture ran continuously throughout the weather events and exceeded ethylene nameplate operating rates by 9% during March. 
Polyolefin results for the segment decreased by about $15 million during the first quarter. Polyethylene margin decreased, while polypropylene margin improved. Polyethylene volume increased due to a full quarter of contribution from the Louisiana joint venture, partially offset by lost production during the weather events. We anticipate both volume and margin improvement for our O&P-Americas segment during the second quarter. Volumes are expected to rebound in the absence of weather-related downtime. Tight markets due to high demand, low inventories and customer backlogs are expected to continue to support strong integrated chain margins. 
Now please turn to Slide 14 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins - Europe, Asia and International segment. During the first quarter, EBITDA was $412 million, $161 million higher than the fourth quarter. Strong demand expanded margins, driving quarter results higher than we have seen for the segment since 2018. Olefins results increased $30 million driven by increased margins and volumes. Ethylene margin improved due to increased ethylene prices and lower fixed costs despite higher feedstock cost. Demand was robust during the quarter, and we increased volumes by operating our crackers at a rate of 98%, almost 10% above industry benchmarks for the first quarter. 
Combined polythene results increased approximately $150 million compared to the prior quarter. Strong polymer demand drove spread improvements for both polyethylene and polypropylene prices relative to monomer. Margin improvements at our Middle East And Asia joint ventures were offset by higher LPG feedstock costs, pressuring profitability at our new Bora joint venture in China, resulting in little change in equity income for the segment. During the second quarter, we expect strong demand in tight markets to drive further margin improvement for our O&P-EAI businesses. 
Please turn to Slide 15 as we take a look at our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. First quarter EBITDA was $182 million, $14 million lower than the prior quarter. Margins improved with higher product prices, while volumes declined due to the Texas weather events and planned maintenance in our Propylene Oxide & Derivatives business. First quarter Propylene Oxide & Derivatives results decreased by approximately $35 million due to lower volumes, offsetting stronger margins driven by tight market supply. 
Intermediate chemical results decreased about $55 million due to lower volumes as a result of the weather events. Oxyfuels and related products results increased by approximately $25 million as a result of higher margins benefiting from improved gasoline prices that were partially offset by constrained volumes. We expect both volumes and margins to improve for our I&D segment in the second quarter. Strong demand for durable goods, coupled with continued tight market supply, are expected to increase profitability across most of the businesses in this segment. 
Now let's move forward and review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 16. First quarter EBITDA was $135 million, $9 million higher than the fourth quarter. Volumes improved driven by higher demand for our products, partially offset by lower margins. Compounding & Solutions results were relatively unchanged, with higher volumes driven by improved demand being offset by compressed margins due to rising feedstock cost. Advanced Polymer results increased by approximately $15 million due to both higher margins and volumes. 
In April, North American feedstock costs for our polypropylene compounds rapidly declined to reverse much of the price escalation that occurred during the first quarter. We expect that falling feedstock prices, combined with continued price improvements for our compounded products, will expand margins during the second quarter. 
Now let's turn to Slide 17 and discuss the results for our Refining segment. First quarter EBITDA was negative $110 million, a $36 million decrease versus the fourth quarter of 2020. Higher cost for renewable fuel credits, or RINs, and lower crude throughput overwhelmed improvements in the Maya 2-1-1 industry crack spread. In the first quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 crack spread increased by $5.21 per barrel to $15.32 per barrel. As a result of the Texas weather event, the average crude throughput at the refinery fell to 152,000 barrels per day. In April, we continue to see improvements in refined product demand, and we are running the refinery at nearly full rates. 
Strong demand for diesel and improving demand for gasoline is expected to improve both volumes and margins at our refinery during the second half of this year. However, we don't expect a full recovery until there is further progress in vaccination rates and a rebound in global demand for jet fuel driven by increased business and international air travel. 
Please turn to Slide 18 as we review the results of our Technology segment. First quarter Technology segment EBITDA was $94 million, $49 million higher than the prior quarter. Catalyst profitability increased with customers rebuilding inventories and increased demand from Asia and the Middle East. Based on anticipated timing of upcoming licensing milestones and catalyst demand, we expect that second quarter Technology business profitability will be similar to the first quarter. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob."
792424,711644260,2265132,"LyondellBasell Industries N.V., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 30, 2021",2021-04-30,"Earnings Calls","LyondellBasell Industries N.V.","Executives","Thank you, Michael. Let me summarize our view of current conditions and the outlook for our businesses with Slide 19. We began this year with low inventories and increasing demand from a recovering global economy. During our fourth quarter earnings call i",848,"Thank you, Michael. Let me summarize our view of current conditions and the outlook for our businesses with Slide 19. We began this year with low inventories and increasing demand from a recovering global economy. During our fourth quarter earnings call in January, we thought that strong February order books, increasing seasonal demand and tight industry supply would support strong margins for at least the first half of 2021. Since January, our industry lost several weeks of supply due to Texas weather events during February, and deferred maintenance from 2020 is resulting in higher levels of planned downtime across the industry, particularly in the second quarter. 
North American inventories were depleted during the downtime, and European inventories have been pressured by unusually strong first quarter demand. While our company normally maintains over 1 month of polyolefin sales inventory, our European PE and PP businesses ended margin levels well below those targets, most notably, with less than 2 weeks of low-density polyethylene inventory. 
Logistics constraints are exacerbating the situation due to shortages of shipping containers on critical routes and escalating freight rates that are limiting opportunities for regional arbitrage. China remains structurally short of polyethylene, and U.S. exports to China have vanished as North American suppliers seek to replenish inventories and address order backlogs from domestic customers. Backlogs for finished goods are rising as the recovering global economy continues to be supported by government stimulus and pent-up demand emerges with increased vaccination rates. 
In summary, we believe that tight global markets are likely to persist well into the second half of this year, and continued improvements in mobility and associated economic activity could sustain strong volumes and margins into 2022. 
Please turn to Slide 20, and let's review LyondellBasell's profitability over the course of the first complete business cycle for our company. In the years following the 2008 Great Recession, our company nimbly captured the benefits of low-cost feedstocks that arose from the development of North American oil and gas resources. LyondellBasell typically delivered between $6 billion to $7 billion of EBITDA over the past 10 years. Our EBITDA after LCM inventory adjustments reached $8.1 billion in 2015 during my first year as CEO of our company. 
At the end of 2019, we thought we might simply be coming to the end of a very long business cycle until we learn more about COVID and the extreme tolls it would take on our society, the economy, and ultimately, in human lives. As we rebound from the pandemic and contemplate how our company could perform through the recovery and the next business cycle, it is worthwhile to consider the factors that should provide additional earnings power relative to our performance last year and in the previous cycle. 
Recovery in automotive and other durable goods demand is rebuilding volumes within our new APS segment back towards 2018 levels. Increased utilization of our capacity should provide greater visibility on the more than $200 million in synergies that we've built into the business since acquiring A. Schulman. 
In 2020, we added 500,000 tons of polyethylene capacity utilizing our next-generation Hyperzone technology. During the depths of the pandemic and recession, our strong balance sheet enabled us to move forward and form accretive joint ventures for integrated crackers in China and Louisiana that provided immediate returns on our investments. 
This quarter, we finalized an agreement to form our second propylene oxide joint venture with Sinopec. Beyond the broad-based margin improvements that are currently underway for many of our products, full recovery in demand for transportation fuels still lies ahead and should drive margin improvement for our sizable Refining & Oxyfuels businesses over the coming quarters. Our larger asset base is well poised to capture the opportunities of a recovering economy, establish new earnings benchmarks and position LyondellBasell for further growth over the upcoming business cycle. 
Let me close with Slide 21. The title of our 2020 annual report is Emerging Stronger, and it is an appropriate description of LyondellBasell's trajectory as the global economy recovers from the pandemic and recession. Our leading and advantaged business positions are primed to capture the benefits of a recovering economy. In the second quarter, we have no major planned downtime, and we are operating our highly reliable and low-cost global network of assets at maximum rates to capture rising margins. 
We have remained steadfast to our disciplined financial strategy. Over the coming year, our priority will continue to be deleveraging while supporting shareholder returns with a strong and progressive dividend. We remain committed to an investment-grade credit rating, and our plan is to bolster our credit metrics through increased earnings and additional debt reduction over the coming quarters. Our aim is to maximize free cash flow by leveraging our larger asset base, efficiently converting earnings into cash and deploying capital in a prudent manner toward high-return investments. All of this will help drive our ultimate focus on delivering strong shareholder returns. The outlook for our business is quite promising, and we look forward to delivering our commitments over the coming quarters. 
We are now pleased to take your questions."

And so our first priority is to meet the demand of our customers and then find the opportunity to rebuild inventory. 
So if you think about what's ahead, we still have reopening ahead in the U.S. We have reopening ahead in Europe; many parts of Asia, ex China, still reopening ahead. So a stronger demand period. Typically, we see seasonal improvement. So opportunity to rebuild inventory, we may not have that until later in Q3. 
Also recall that there's a lot of planned downtime in the industry because many producers deferred planned maintenance last year into this year. So I mean, I think all of these reasons are why the setup looks to be for a very tight market for most of this year, if not all."

And generally speaking, auto sales are up. Inventories are low. Fleet sales have been low. Rental car fleets have been depleted last year. So all of that has to be replenished. So my sense is that polypropylene market will continue to be strong. And if I were to look at inventories, the data that I saw this morning from an industry perspective, in the U.S., PP inventories are actually lower than PE inventories. And this data that I'm citing is 60 days in the rear. So my guess is that trend will continue to decline as we see data for March and April."

I wanted to also answer Vincent's question about polyethylene. Vincent, I thought you asked about polypropylene building on the prior question. On polyethylene spreads, market is still extremely tight. So our sense is that the price increases that have been implemented could remain in place through Q3. There are more increases out there. Market remains tight. And again, as I've said several times, we really don't know where the real level of demand is because we've been on allocation.

So based on that and where CapEx has turned out recently on new projects, I still think it kind of leaves us at maybe low double-digit kind of returns. And more importantly, many companies who would think about investing are likely thinking about repairing their balance sheets from last year and paying down debt. So I don't expect with this sort of a profile for there to be a rush in terms of new project announcements, let's say, ex China. 
But let's see how it develops. Each company has its own considerations. But certainly for us, we don't have plans to take on additional organic growth in O&P in the near term. 
In terms of your question about what are we seeing from catalyst activity and licensing activity, we are seeing slower activity in China compared to what we saw over the last 2 years, especially in polyethylene. So -- and we participate in most, if not all, tenders that occur for new projects. So it seems the activity is slowing compared to '18 and '19."

So Frank, on the operating rates, I mean in Q1, we lost about 30 days of production on average in our Texas assets. One of our crackers was down for almost 90 days. So now we're back up and running fully. I suspect that our competitors do have some planned downtime maintenance that they had planned last year that was deferred into this year. So likely, our operating rate on a planned basis is higher than most in Q2. 
Your earlier question about our confidence about the outlook. I mean I think, Frank, as time goes on, I just see the number of shortages on consumable items on automobiles, lumber, steel, they're -- like furniture, if you want to buy furniture, there's like a 6-month delay from the time you order to the time you receive. And then reopening is still in front of us. I think there are so many factors that provide a very strong setup for how demand will develop for really all of our products in the company. So that makes me more optimistic about the fact that we'll have tighter markets for longer as we go through the year. 
So thanks for your questions. I do have a few closing remarks, if I may. First of all, really good questions, as always. And Slide 9 will continue to be part of our discussion as we go forward. 
I want to emphasize a couple of things. First of all, Q2, we're going to run full rates, no planned downtime. As I mentioned, there's a lot of backlog. We have reopening still in front of us. That should benefit our Refining & Oxyfuels business and continue to underpin demand strength in the other businesses that have been doing well. 
I think it's very important to note that with the larger asset base that we have, we've added $1 billion to $1.2 billion more of EBITDA as we sit here today at mid-cycle kind of margins. Now clearly, today, we're well above mid-cycle margins in some of our businesses. So I think that's a bit differential for LyondellBasell that in 2021, more assets deployed in a much, much stronger market. 
And I'm really pleased that we can see a path to perhaps reaching our leverage targets by year-end on -- both on a gross debt basis and on the debt-to-EBITDA metric. So that, as I mentioned earlier, brings buybacks kind of back into the equation as we think about capital allocation as we go into 2022. 
So we look forward to giving you an update in July on our Q2 results. In the meantime, have a great and safe weekend. Thank you."

We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our first quarter results.
Before we get into the discussion of our results, I would like to take a moment to recognize the tremendous progress that has been made in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic and how much hard work still needs to be done around the world to reduce the effects of this disease. While financial markets are focused on the economic upside enabled by increased vaccination and the eventual reopening, today, our employees, customers, suppliers and the communities where we operate in India, in particular, as well as Brazil and even parts of Europe, are still suffering from terribly high case rates and fatalities. We are working closely with governments around the world to do our part to advance immunity for our employees and their communities and to hasten an end to the devastation brought on by this virus. Our thoughts remain with those most affected by this pandemic.
Now moving into the discussion of our Q1 results. LyondellBasell is continuing to build upon the momentum seen in the second half of 2020. During last year's recession, we advanced on our strategic initiatives to grow our asset base and emerge stronger from the downturn to position our company to capture the benefits of a recovering economy in 2021.  
Let's begin with Slide 3 and review the highlights. In the first quarter, earnings more than doubled from the same quarter of last year to $3.18 per share. LyondellBasell's first quarter net income improved by 25% relative to the fourth quarter as we earned approximately $1.6 billion of EBITDA. Our businesses benefited from strong demand and tight markets at improved margins across the majority of our segments.
Our Olefins and Polyolefins - Europe, Asia and International segment achieved their highest quarterly EBITDA since 2018, while the O&P-Americas segment reached a quarterly EBITDA level that has not been seen since 2015.
Strong cash generation enabled us to pay down $500 million of debt in January and end the first quarter with nearly $5 billion of cash and available liquidity. After the quarter closed, we paid down an additional $500 million of debt in April. We expect that our robust cash generation should continue throughout the year, and our top priority for capital deployment in 2021 is debt reduction, which will enable meaningful progress toward improving our credit metrics to 2 turns of total debt-to-EBITDA.  
As we approach the end of the first month of the second quarter, low inventories and persistently high demand are driving higher margins for most of our products. The unusually cold weather and associated power outages that occurred during February in Texas resulted in approximately 1 month of downtime or a significant share of total U.S. capacity located within the state. Deferred turnarounds from 2020 are resulting in high levels of planned maintenance downtime for many of our competitors during the second quarter. LyondellBasell has no major planned maintenance for the second quarter at any of the global assets that we operate. We are focused on running our assets safely, reliably and at maximum rates to supply our customers' needs and capture the opportunities available in these strong markets.
We expect markets will remain tight through at least the end of this year due to very high demand, low inventories and the capacity that will be lost during planned downtime. With customer demand exceeding production, the full extent of our customers' backlogs, deferred consumption and unmet demand are unknown.
In the days after the Texas freeze, North American PG exports fell by 13% for the month of February, and we expect the March data to reflect further decline in exports. It will likely require quite some time before North American polyethylene industry can fulfill backlogs, satisfy domestic demand and returned to last year's pace of selling 40% of production into the export market to serve global demand.
And this scenario of replenishing inventory over the course of 2021 does not factor in an additional wave of demand that is likely to arise in the second half of this year from restocking and increased activity in the travel, leisure and hospitality sectors as vaccines provide for increased mobility. The reopening and considerable pent-up demand will add another leg of growth across our businesses. Increased mobility and rising demand for transportation fuels should enable our Oxyfuels and Refining businesses to deliver meaningful profit improvements in the second half of '21 and into 2022.
Let's turn to Slide 4 and review our recent safety performance. At LyondellBasell, the first topic on the agenda for a meeting of our leadership or any group of employees throughout the company is typically oriented toward improving the health and safety of our teams. Our consistent emphasis on a culture of safety provides clear and direct benefits towards improving the health and welfare of our employees, contractors and communities. We also believe the attention to detail embedded in our safety culture cascades indirect benefits towards our work to ensure reliable operations, commercial leadership, and ultimately, differential financial performance. 
As such, I'm pleased to report that in the first quarter of 2021, our employees and contractors achieved the best safety performance we have attained in any prior year. We look forward to continued progress on our journey toward our goal of 0 injuries. 
Earlier this month, we launched our Circulen portfolio of polymers, described on Slide 5, to enable our customers and brand owners to improve the sustainability of their products. CirculenRecover polymers are already in use, producing consumer products such as the Samsonite Magnum Eco suitcase line depicted on the slide. We are stepping up volumes of CirculenRenew polymers in Europe and advancing our proprietary catalyzed pyrolysis technology at our MoReTec molecular recycling pilot facility in Italy, with the goal of bringing this potentially game-changing technology for CirculenRevive polymers to a commercial scale. 
Over the past 70 years, our polymers have played a central role in advancing modern living by reducing food waste with protective packaging, delivering safe drinking water through plastic pipes and advancing health care with sterile and affordable devices and equipment. With the introduction of our Circulen product line, we are making further progress towards LyondellBasell's goal of producing and marketing 2 million metric tons of recycle- and renewal-based polymers annually by 2030.
On Slide 6, we highlight how LyondellBasell's technological advancements can enable our customers to independently improve the sustainability profile of their product formulations. Our new Hyperzone HDPE process is capable of producing polyethylene with more than 5x the crack resistance of standard polyethylene produced with a chromium catalyst in a slurry loop process. This premium performance of polyethylene from our Hyperzone multi-zone process can be directly leveraged by customers to produce packaging, such as detergent bottles with thinner walls, and less polyethylene that reduces weight without sacrificing durability or performance.
As our customers seek to improve the circularity of their business models, many plastics converters have set aggressive goals to increase their utilization of post-consumer recycled, or PCR, plastics in packaging and other applications. Hyperzone's outstanding performance can also be leveraged to allow for increased blending of PCR without sacrificing performance. 
As you can see in the chart, Hyperzone HDPE blended with 25% PCR can still exceed the crack resistance of standard polyethylene by 70%. Our customers are leveraging LyondellBasell's advanced technology to improve the crack resistance, top load strength, impact resistance and other critical properties for their products while simultaneously improving the sustainability profile of their business models.
Now let's step back a bit and on Slide 7 review some of the macroeconomic forces that have been driving LyondellBasell's business performance during the pandemic and the ongoing recovery. One way to think about the trajectory of the economy is to untangle a few of the societal trends that are fueling demand in markets for nondurable goods, durable goods and transportation. In the early days of the pandemic in March, April and May of 2020, we saw elevated demand for nondurable goods as households engaged in pantry stocking to protect against supply disruptions and adapt to the transition toward increased working from home, schooling from home and other lifestyle changes associated with quarantines and societal lockdowns. LyondellBasell's Olefins and Polyolefins businesses benefited from the double-digit improvements in packaging demand as increased utilization of nonbulk packaging and e-commerce deliveries boosted demand for our materials.
In 2021, consumer packaged goods demand remains elevated by single-digit percentages relative to prepandemic levels. We expect somewhat elevated demand for packaging will persist following the pandemic with some permanent changes in society as a portion of the population continues to work remotely, school remotely and use home delivery for convenience.
The second economic driver for our businesses has been the recovery in consumer-, industrial- and construction-related demand for durable goods that began in the third quarter of 2020. This trend can be reflected by the dark blue line that tracks the ongoing recovery in vehicle production in North America. With government stimulus supporting the U.S. economy and limited options for travel, leisure and public dining, consumers remodeled homes and purchased appliances, home entertainment and vehicles that drove recovery for the industrial economy. This trend has been boosting demand for LyondellBasell's propylene oxide from our Intermediates & Derivatives segment that is used in polyurethane foams for furniture and construction insulation as well as polymers from our O&P segments that are used both directly and in plastic compounds produced by our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment.
The third significant trend is the increased mobility that is developing around the world as vaccination rates improve and activity in the travel, leisure and hospitality sectors returns to some semblance of normalcy. Increases in vehicle miles traveled are supporting a rebound in crude oil and gasoline prices to bring back margins for our Oxyfuels business in the I&D segment.
While a slower rebound in international air travel is holding back demand for jet fuel, strong demand for diesel and improving demand for gasoline is expected to improve profitability for LyondellBasell's Refining segment during the second half of this year. Increased mobility will also benefit our polymer businesses as the restaurant, hotel and tourism industries restock and begin to address substantial pent-up demand. The sum of these trends points to a strong outlook for both the global economy and LyondellBasell during the remainder of 2021 and well into 2022. 
On Slide 8, these trends can be seen in first quarter global demand growth for our 2 largest products, polyethylene and polypropylene, relative to prepandemic levels seen 2 years ago in the first quarter of 2019. Over this period, we've seen modest improvements in European demand. In the first quarter of 2021, North American demand was quite strong, but constrained by lack of supply due to the downtime triggered by the cold weather and associated power outages in Texas. Northeast Asian demand increased by an astounding 23% driven by the postpandemic strength of the Chinese economy. Since imports account for approximately 40% of China's demand needs for polyethylene, China's growth benefited LyondellBasell's production sites in the United States and the Middle East that export polyethylene to China.
Global demand for polyolefins has grown by 14% over the past 2 years, far above the long-term trends of 4% and 5% annual demand growth for polyethylene and polypropylene, respectively. Strong global demand and constrained production have supported polyethylene contract price increases of $950 per metric ton in the U.S. from May 2020 through March of this year, with $420 per ton occurring since November and more than $300 per ton of additional price increases on the table for April and May of 2021. As demand should get even stronger as we progress through the recovery, we expect tight markets and strong margins for polyolefins to persist into next year. 
On Slide 9, I would like to remind you of our view on the cyclical outlook that we discussed during our fourth quarter call. In January, we talked about concerns that global polyethylene capacity additions, particularly in China, could outpace global demand and depress operating rates and profitability over the coming years.
This quarter, we have updated the chart we discussed during the fourth quarter call to address operating rates for both polyethylene and polypropylene. Predictions of reduced operating rates due to new capacity are highly reminiscent of forecasts from consulting reports published in 2016. These are depicted by the dotted blue line, which predicted global operating rates would dip due to capacity additions on the U.S. Gulf Coast from 2017 through 2018. The actual operating rate, depicted by the solid line, demonstrates that press releases announcing capacity additions often have ambitious time lines and typical delays in construction and commissioning can allow consistent demand growth to absorb capacity additions with less impact on operating rates and margins than predicted.
More importantly than delays in capacity, we believe recent forecasts are underestimating demand growth. Early in the pandemic, many predicted declines in PE demand for 2020. By the middle of the year, forecasts improved to flat demand. Most consultants now believe that global polyolefin demand grew by approximately 4% in 2020, similar to growth rates seen consistently over the past 30 years. Adjusting these forecasts to 4% demand growth for both '20 and '21 results in a predicted operating rate shown by the dotted gray line. Last quarter, we suggested that 2021 would likely follow the patterns seen after prior recessions, and this year's demand growth could be higher than the historical trend of 4%. A 7% growth in demand during 2021 for only 1 year with reversion to the historical mean in 2022 and beyond would generate the robust operating rate forecast depicted by the dotted orange line. 
Today, with global polyolefin demand growing in the first quarter by 14% over the past 2 years, we are even more confident that the recovering economy is likely to facilitate a more orderly absorption of this new capacity by the global market, which should support robust margins.
With that, I will turn the call over to Michael, who will describe our financial and segment results over the past quarter."

Please turn to Slide 10, and let me begin by highlighting our track record of strong cash conversion. Over the last 12 months, LyondellBasell converted almost 80% of our EBITDA into $3.4 billion of cash from operating activities. In the first quarter of 2021, our businesses delivered over 40% more free operating cash flow relative to the same period last year. We expect continued improvement of our LTM performance as we progress through each quarter of 2021. 
Let's turn to Slide 11 and review further details of our cash generation and deployment during the first quarter. As Bob mentioned, our goal for this year is to accomplish meaningful deleveraging to further strengthen our investment-grade balance sheet. In the first quarter, while paying dividends of $352 million and investing a similar amount in capital expenditures, we reduced the balance on our term loan by $500 million to close the first quarter with cash and liquid investments of $1.8 billion. After the quarter closed, we repaid an additional $500 million on the term loan in April. We expect that robust cash generation should enable continued progress on deleveraging throughout the year.
Before I continue with a more detailed discussion of our segment results, let me provide a brief update on our 2021 modeling guidance. We continue to be on track to invest approximately $2 billion in capital expenditures during 2021, targeted equally towards profit-generating growth projects and sustaining maintenance. Due to extremely strong demand for propylene oxide, we have shifted a turnaround at one of our PO/TBA units in Bayport, Texas from the second quarter to the third quarter of this year and reduced the scope and associated downtime for the maintenance.
With this change, we expect no major planned maintenance downtime in the second quarter of 2021. And based on expected volumes and margins, we estimate that the third quarter EBITDA impact due to lost production associated with planned maintenance across the company will increase by $30 million to $75 million. In total, the EBITDA impact associated with all of LyondellBasell's 2021 planned maintenance downtime should decrease by $30 million relative to our original guidance to approximately $140 million for the year. 
Let's turn to Slide 12 and review our quarterly profitability. In the first quarter of 2021, LyondellBasell's business portfolio delivered EBITDA of $1.6 billion. This was an improvement of more than $300 million relative to the fourth quarter, exceeding typical first quarter seasonal trends. The upward trajectory of LyondellBasell's profitability reflects improving demand and margins for our products driven by the recovering global economy and tight markets. 
As Bob mentioned, cold weather and associated power outages resulted in unplanned shutdowns that constrained first quarter production for LyondellBasell and nearly all of our competitors in the state of Texas. This downtime was exacerbated by strong global demand that tightened markets and elevated margins across most of our businesses. While it's clear that we lost production during the first quarter due to unplanned downtime, the offsetting effects of higher margins and sales from inventory complicates the effort to quantify the impact on first quarter business results. In the second quarter, we plan to operate our assets at nearly full rates as profitability improves for oxyfuels and refining businesses. We expect further EBITDA improvement during the second quarter.
On the left side of the chart, our all-time high quarterly EBITDA, excluding LCM of approximately $2.2 billion reported in the third quarter of 2015, provides useful perspective. While profitability for transportation fuels was quite strong in 2015, today, our company has more earnings power from a larger asset base. Over the last 6 years, we have added ethylene capacity at Corpus Christi, expanded our compounding business through the acquisition of A. Schulman, started a new Hyperzone HDPE plant in Houston and added significant joint venture capacity in Louisiana and China. In 2021, LyondellBasell is poised to capture opportunities that are emerging in the rebounding global economy with a larger asset base.
Now let's review the first quarter results for each of our segments. As mentioned, my discussion will describe our underlying business results excluding the noncash impacts of LCM inventory changes. I will begin with our Olefins and Polyolefins - Americas segment on Slide 13. Third quarter EBITDA was $867 million, $145 million higher than the fourth quarter. Tight markets and strong demand resulted in improved margins, driving quarterly results higher than we have seen since 2015. Olefin results increased approximately $155 million compared to the fourth quarter. Olefins margins increased, with higher ethylene and propylene prices outpacing higher feedstock and utility costs. Volumes decreased due to downtime driven by Texas weather events, partially offset by a full quarter of volume from our Louisiana joint venture that we formed in December. The ethylene cracker at the joint venture ran continuously throughout the weather events and exceeded ethylene nameplate operating rates by 9% during March. 
Polyolefin results for the segment decreased by about $15 million during the first quarter. Polyethylene margin decreased, while polypropylene margin improved. Polyethylene volume increased due to a full quarter of contribution from the Louisiana joint venture, partially offset by lost production during the weather events. We anticipate both volume and margin improvement for our O&P-Americas segment during the second quarter. Volumes are expected to rebound in the absence of weather-related downtime. Tight markets due to high demand, low inventories and customer backlogs are expected to continue to support strong integrated chain margins.
Now please turn to Slide 14 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins - Europe, Asia and International segment. During the first quarter, EBITDA was $412 million, $161 million higher than the fourth quarter. Strong demand expanded margins, driving quarter results higher than we have seen for the segment since 2018. Olefins results increased $30 million driven by increased margins and volumes. Ethylene margin improved due to increased ethylene prices and lower fixed costs despite higher feedstock cost. Demand was robust during the quarter, and we increased volumes by operating our crackers at a rate of 98%, almost 10% above industry benchmarks for the first quarter. Combined polyolefin results increased approximately $150 million compared to the prior quarter. Strong polymer demand drove spread improvements for both polyethylene and polypropylene prices relative to monomer.
Margin improvements at our Middle East and Asia joint ventures were offset by higher LPG feedstock costs, pressuring profitability at our new Bora joint venture in China, resulting in little change in equity income for the segment. During the second quarter, we expect strong demand in tight markets to drive further margin improvement for our O&P-EAI businesses.
Please turn to Slide 15 as we take a look at our Intermediates & Derivatives segment. First quarter EBITDA was $182 million, $14 million lower than the prior quarter. Margins improved with higher product prices, while volumes declined due to the Texas weather events and planned maintenance in our Propylene Oxide & Derivatives business. First quarter Propylene Oxide & Derivatives results decreased by approximately $35 million due to lower volumes, offsetting stronger margins driven by tight market supply.
Intermediate chemical results decreased about $55 million due to lower volumes as a result of the weather events. Oxyfuels and related products results increased by approximately $25 million as a result of higher margins benefiting from improved gasoline prices that were partially offset by constrained volumes. We expect both volumes and margins to improve for our I&D segment in the second quarter. Strong demand for durable goods, coupled with continued tight market supply, are expected to increase profitability across most of the businesses in this segment.
Now let's move forward and review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 16. First quarter EBITDA was $135 million, $9 million higher than the fourth quarter. Volumes improved driven by higher demand for our products, partially offset by lower margins. Compounding & Solutions results were relatively unchanged, with higher volumes driven by improved demand being offset by compressed margins due to rising feedstock cost. Advanced Polymer results increased by approximately $15 million due to both higher margins and volumes. In April, North American feedstock costs for our polypropylene compounds rapidly declined to reverse much of the price escalation that occurred during the first quarter. We expect that falling feedstock prices, combined with continued price improvements for our compounded products, will expand margins during the second quarter.
Now let's turn to Slide 17 and discuss the results for our Refining segment. First quarter EBITDA was negative $110 million, a $36 million decrease versus the fourth quarter of 2020. Higher cost for renewable fuel credits, or RINs, and lower crude throughput overwhelmed improvements in the Maya 2-1-1 industry crack spread. In the first quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 crack spread increased by $5.21 per barrel to $15.32 per barrel. As a result of the Texas weather event, the average crude throughput at the refinery fell to 152,000 barrels per day. In April, we continue to see improvements in refined product demand, and we are running the refinery at nearly full rates.
Strong demand for diesel and improving demand for gasoline is expected to improve both volumes and margins at our refinery during the second half of this year. However, we don't expect a full recovery until there is further progress in vaccination rates and a rebound in global demand for jet fuel driven by increased business and international air travel. 
Please turn to Slide 18 as we review the results of our Technology segment. First quarter Technology segment EBITDA was $94 million, $49 million higher than the prior quarter. Catalyst profitability increased with customers rebuilding inventories and increased demand from Asia and the Middle East. Based on anticipated timing of upcoming licensing milestones and catalyst demand, we expect that second quarter Technology business profitability will be similar to the first quarter.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob."

Let me summarize our view of current conditions and the outlook for our businesses with Slide 19. We began this year with low inventories and increasing demand from a recovering global economy. During our fourth quarter earnings call i",849,"Thank you, Michael. Let me summarize our view of current conditions and the outlook for our businesses with Slide 19. We began this year with low inventories and increasing demand from a recovering global economy. During our fourth quarter earnings call in January, we thought that strong February order books, increasing seasonal demand and tight industry supply would support strong margins for at least the first half of 2021. Since January, our industry lost several weeks of supply due to Texas weather events during February, and deferred maintenance from 2020 is resulting in higher levels of planned downtime across the industry, particularly in the second quarter. 
North American inventories were depleted during the downtime, and European inventories have been pressured by unusually strong first quarter demand. While our company normally maintains over 1 month of polyolefin sales inventory, our European PE and PP businesses ended March levels well below those targets, most notably, with less than 2 weeks of low-density polyethylene inventory. 
Logistics constraints are exacerbating the situation due to shortages of shipping containers on critical routes and escalating freight rates that are limiting opportunities for regional arbitrage. China remains structurally short of polyethylene, and U.S. exports to China have vanished as North American suppliers seek to replenish inventories and address order backlogs from domestic customers. Backlogs for finished goods are rising as the recovering global economy continues to be supported by government stimulus and pent-up demand emerges with increased vaccination rates. 
In summary, we believe that tight global markets are likely to persist well into the second half of this year, and continued improvements in mobility and associated economic activity could sustain strong volumes and margins into 2022. 
Please turn to Slide 20, and let's review LyondellBasell's profitability over the course of the first complete business cycle for our company. In the years following the 2008 Great Recession, our company nimbly captured the benefits of low-cost feedstocks that arose from the development of North American oil and gas resources. LyondellBasell typically delivered between $6 billion to $7 billion of EBITDA over the past 10 years. Our EBITDA after LCM inventory adjustments reached $8.1 billion in 2015 during my first year as CEO of our company. 
At the end of 2019, we thought we might simply be coming to the end of a very long business cycle until we learned more about COVID and the extreme tolls it would take on our society, the economy, and ultimately, in human lives. As we rebound from the pandemic and contemplate how our company could perform through the recovery and the next business cycle, it is worthwhile to consider the factors that should provide additional earnings power relative to our performance last year and in the previous cycle. 
Recovery in automotive and other durable goods demand is rebuilding volumes within our new APS segment back towards 2018 levels. Increased utilization of our capacity should provide greater visibility on the more than $200 million in synergies that we've built into the business since acquiring A. Schulman. 
In 2020, we added 500,000 tons of polyethylene capacity utilizing our next-generation Hyperzone technology. During the depths of the pandemic and recession, our strong balance sheet enabled us to move forward and form accretive joint ventures for integrated crackers in China and Louisiana that provided immediate returns on our investments. 
This quarter, we finalized an agreement to form our second propylene oxide joint venture with Sinopec. Beyond the broad-based margin improvements that are currently underway for many of our products, full recovery in demand for transportation fuels still lies ahead and should drive margin improvement for our sizable Refining & Oxyfuels businesses over the coming quarters. Our larger asset base is well poised to capture the opportunities of a recovering economy, establish new earnings benchmarks and position LyondellBasell for further growth over the upcoming business cycle. 
Let me close with Slide 21. The title of our 2020 annual report is Emerging Stronger, and it is an appropriate description of LyondellBasell's trajectory as the global economy recovers from the pandemic and recession. Our leading and advantaged business positions are primed to capture the benefits of a recovering economy. In the second quarter, we have no major planned downtime, and we are operating our highly reliable and low-cost global network of assets at maximum rates to capture rising margins. 
We have remained steadfast to our disciplined financial strategy. Over the coming year, our priority will continue to be deleveraging while supporting shareholder returns with a strong and progressive dividend. We remain committed to an investment-grade credit rating, and our plan is to bolster our credit metrics through increased earnings and additional debt reduction over the coming quarters. Our aim is to maximize free cash flow by leveraging our larger asset base, efficiently converting earnings into cash and deploying capital in a prudent manner toward high-return investments. All of this will help drive our ultimate focus on delivering strong shareholder returns. The outlook for our business is quite promising, and we look forward to delivering on our commitments over the coming quarters.

And we've learned recently that government is considering canceling those projects for the environment.
In the U.S., because of COVID, the projects that are underway maybe were delayed a quarter or 2, especially Q2, Q3 last year, as there were slowdowns until we all figured out how to manage density in our sites and construction sites. So maybe a couple of quarters for those projects that are underway. And if you think longer term, projects that are CTO, MTO based in China could be at risk.
And Bora -- your question about Bora Phase 2. So we're still discussing with our partner on Bora Phase 2. No definitive decisions yet. I would say that would be middle of the decade or beyond in terms of product hitting the market."

And so our first priority is to meet the demand of our customers and then find the opportunity to rebuild inventory. 
So if you think about what's ahead, we still have reopening ahead in the U.S. We have reopening ahead in Europe. Many parts of Asia, ex China, still reopening ahead. So a stronger demand period. Typically, we see seasonal improvement. So opportunity to rebuild inventory, we may not have that until later in Q3. Also recall that there's a lot of planned downtime in the industry because many producers deferred planned maintenance last year into this year. So I mean, I think all of these reasons are why the setup looks to be for a very tight market for most of this year, if not all."

So my sense is that polypropylene market will continue to be strong. And if I were to look at inventories, the data that I saw this morning from an industry perspective, in the U.S., PP inventories are actually lower than PE inventories.

I wanted to also answer Vincent's question about polyethylene. Vincent, I thought you asked about polypropylene building on the prior question. On polyethylene spreads, market is still extremely tight. So our sense is that the price increases that have been implemented could remain in place through Q3. There are more increases out there. Market remains tight. And again, as I've said several times, we really don't know where the real level of demand is because we've been on allocation.

So based on that and where CapEx has turned out recently on new projects, I still think it kind of leaves us at maybe low double-digit kind of returns. And more importantly, many companies who would think about investing are likely thinking about repairing their balance sheets from last year and paying down debt. So I don't expect with this sort of a profile for there to be a rush in terms of new project announcements, let's say, ex China. But let's see how it develops. Each company has its own considerations. But certainly for us, we don't have plans to take on additional organic growth in O&P in the near term.
In terms of your question about what are we seeing from catalyst activity and licensing activity, we are seeing slower activity in China compared to what we saw over the last 2 years, especially in polyethylene. So -- and we participate in most, if not all, tenders that occur for new projects. So it seems the activity is slowing compared to '18 and '19."

So Frank, on the operating rates, I mean in Q1, we lost about 30 days of production on average in our Texas assets. One of our crackers was down for almost 90 days. So -- and now we're back up and running fully. I suspect that our competitors do have some planned downtime maintenance that they had planned last year that was deferred into this year. So likely, our operating rate on a planned basis is higher than most in Q2.
To your earlier question about our confidence about the outlook, I mean I think, Frank, as time goes on, I just see the number of shortages on consumable items on automobiles, lumber, steel, they're -- like furniture, if you want to buy furniture, there's like a 6-month delay from the time you order to the time you receive. And then reopening is still in front of us. I think there are so many factors that provide a very strong setup for how demand will develop for really all of our products in the company. So that makes me more optimistic about the fact that we'll have tighter markets for longer as we go through the year.
So thanks for your questions. I do have a few closing remarks, if I may. First of all, really good questions, as always. And Slide 9 will continue to be part of our discussion as we go forward.
I want to emphasize a couple of things. First of all, Q2, we're going to run full rates, no planned downtime. As I mentioned, there's a lot of backlog. We have reopening still in front of us. That should benefit our Refining & Oxyfuels business and continue to underpin demand strength in the other businesses that have been doing well.
I think it's very important to note that with the larger asset base that we have, we've added $1 billion to $1.2 billion more of EBITDA as we sit here today at mid-cycle kind of margins. Now clearly, today, we're well above mid-cycle margins in some of our businesses. So I think it's a bit differential for LyondellBasell that in 2021, more assets deployed in a much, much stronger market. And I'm really pleased that we can see a path to perhaps reaching our leverage targets by year-end on -- both on a gross debt basis and on the debt-to-EBITDA metric. So that, as I mentioned earlier, brings buybacks kind of back into the equation as we think about capital allocation as we go into 2022.
So we look forward to giving you an update in July on our Q2 results. In the meantime, have a great and safe weekend. Thank you."

We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our second quarter results. Before we begin with the business discussion, I would like to acknowledge the sadness we are feeling throughout the LyondellBasell family after a tragic incident this week at our La Porte facility, which resulted in the death of 2 contractors and injuries to several additional contractors and employees. Every day, we work diligently to ensure that the colleagues, the friends and most importantly, the families of our employees and contractors never have to receive the calls that went out last Tuesday evening. Notifying them for the loss or injury of a loved one. Our investigation is underway, and it will be some time before we reach a conclusive determination recovery for all of the injured. 
Please turn to Slide 3, and let's review our second quarter financial results with more than $3 billion of quarterly EBITDA. Despite the increased working capital required by higher prices and volumes, we generated $1.9 billion of cash from operating activities. These results demonstrate how LyondellBasell's disciplined investments in growth and share repurchases over the past few years have enabled us to establish new benchmarks for our company's profitability. 
Second quarter EBITDA is [Audio Gap] a larger LyondellBasell is now positioned to generate stronger results and higher cash flow through business cycles. The events of this week provide a vivid reminder of the reasons behind our company's commitment to safe and reliable operations. Let's turn to Slide 4 and review our recent safety performance. 
As of the end of June, our year-to-date total recordable incident rate of 0.22 for employees and contractors remained in the top 10% of our industry. As we do with all major incidents, we will investigate the root cause and contributing factors involved in this week's events and share our findings with our contractors, our employees and our industry peers. Our aim is to learn from all incidents and achieve a goal 0 work environment that prevents such tragedies from occurring. 
On Slide 5, I would like to highlight our most recent sustainability report that we released last month. This report focuses on LyondellBasell's efforts to address 3 urgent global challenges for our business, eliminating plastic waste in the environment, addressing climate change and supporting a thriving society. 
LyondellBasell is leading work to transform our industry towards more sustainable market for Circular Polymers. On climate change, we support the ambitions of the Paris Climate Agreement and we're moving forward with investments in energy reduction, increased utilization of renewable energy and evaluation of new low-carbon technologies. We will be sharing more details on our carbon reduction plans over the coming months. 
In our work to advance the thriving society, I'm very pleased to see the enthusiasm from our employees [Audio Gap] with our emphasis on a safe work culture and community engagement, our work to capture the full potential of our diverse global workforce should further enhance the sustainability of our company's performance. 
Following an exceptional second quarter, some market observers are predicting a rapid decline in prices and profitability for our industry. On Slide 6, I would like to point out why we believe that markets will be stronger for longer. 
COVID vaccinations have been the driving force behind the reopening of societies and the rebounding global economy. As of July, only 14% of the global population is fully vaccinated. While the U.S. and roughly a dozen other countries have achieved vaccination rates approaching or exceeding 50%, health experts anticipate that vaccines will be rolling out to the rest of the world throughout 2022 and into 2023. 
As seen by the increased spread among unvaccinated populations and the rise of variants, we still have much work ahead of us to contain the coronavirus and realize the full economic power of global reopening. Returning to normalcy is eagerly anticipated by consumers with considerable pent-up demand and increased disposable income. 
The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that U.S. personal savings averaged $3.5 trillion during the first 5 months of 2021, nearly 3x the level seen in 2019. With fiscal stimulus continuing to flow into the economy, consumers are both motivated and well funded to [Audio Gap] This unfulfilled demand will persist to drive strong industrial production and demand for our materials for quite some time. 
One example is that the average age of an automobile in the U.S. reached an all-time high of 12 years in 2021. Businesses and consumers will eventually need to replace this aging fleet of cars and trucks. Despite higher prices and supply chain constraints, demand for our products serving automotive manufacturing are forecast to increase a total of 10% in 2021 and an additional 11% during 2022. 
Strong U.S. household formation during the pandemic has evolved into a robust housing market. LyondellBasell benefits from both direct demand for building and construction materials as well as demand for our products used in the myriad of furniture, appliances and other goods that complete a new home. 
And as vaccinations facilitate improvements in global mobility, LyondellBasell's products will see increased demand from restocking and consumption by service, entertainment, travel and hospitality industries as well as increased demand for transportation fuels supplied by LyondellBasell's oxyfuels and refining businesses. In short, we remain confident that persistently high demand should support strong markets for our products through 2022. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Michael, who will describe our financial and segment results over the past quarter."

Please turn to Slide 7, and let me begin by highlighting our strong cash generation, which has been enhanced by our recent growth investments. In the second quarter, LyondellBasell generated $1.9 billion of cash from operating activities that contributed towards the more than $4 billion over the past 12 months. 
Our free operating cash flow yield has been 10.1% over the past 4 quarters and free operating cash flow for the second quarter improved by more than 80% relative to the second quarter of 2019. We expect continued improvement of our last 12 months cash flow performance as we move forward through each quarter of 2021. Let's turn to Slide 8 and review the details of our cash generation and deployment during the second quarter. As I have mentioned during previous calls, a strong and progressive dividend plays a fundamental role in our capital deployment strategy. 
In the second quarter, we expressed our confidence in our outlook by increasing the quarterly dividend by 7.6% to $1.13 per share. We continue to invest in maintenance and growth projects during the quarter with approximately $430 million in capital expenditures. Strong cash flow supported debt repayments of $1.3 billion, bringing our year-to-date debt reduction to $1.8 billion. We closed the second quarter with cash and liquid investments of $1.5 billion. 
Last week, S&P Global Ratings recognize the improvement in our metrics by upgrading our credit ratings and indicating a stable outlook. We expect that robust cash generation and an anticipated tax refund will enable continued progress on our goal to reduce our net debt by up to $4 billion during 2021 and further strengthen our investment-grade balance sheet. 
One modeling item of note. Our original full year net interest expense guidance of $430 million did not include extinguishment costs associated with our accelerated debt repayment program. As a result, our 2021 net interest expense will likely exceed this prior guidance. 
Please turn to Slide 9 to review our quarterly profitability. In the second quarter of 2021, LyondellBasell's business portfolio delivered record EBITDA of $3 billion. This was an improvement of more than $1.4 billion relative to the first quarter. Our results reflect robust demand for our products driven by the recovery in global economy and our growth investments. Markets remained tight during the second quarter as the industry returned to normal operation following first quarter disruptions from the winter storm that constrained production for LyondellBasell and nearly all of our competitors with operations in the state of Texas. 
Persistent consumer and industrial demand has met tight markets, leading to 7 consecutive months of North American polyethylene contract price increases totaling more than $900 per ton. We expect market conditions to remain robust and that continued progress in global reopening, sizable order backlogs in the increasing demand for transportation fuels will all support strong margins across LyondellBasell's businesses. 
Our previous quarterly EBITDA record set in the third quarter of 2015 was approximately $2.2 billion, with more than $140 million of EBITDA contributed by our Refining segment. Today, our growth investments are helping offset a challenging refining environment and enabling us to surpass the 2015 record. Our aim is to leverage our larger business portfolio to achieve improved results at all stages of the business cycle. 
Now let's review second quarter results for each of our segments. As mentioned, my discussion will describe our underlying business results, I will begin with our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment on Slide 10. Strong demand, improved margins and our growth investments drove second quarter EBITDA to a record of $1.6 billion, $709 million higher than the first quarter. 
Olefins results increased by approximately $310 million compared to the first quarter due to higher margins and volumes. LyondellBasell's cracker operating rates increased to 93% and following the first quarter Texas weather events, about 5 points above the second quarter industry average. Margins improved primarily due to the absence of high cost incurred during the prior quarter's weather events. 
Polyolefin results increased by about $400 million during the second quarter as robust demand in tight markets drove higher prices and margins for polyethylene and polypropylene. We anticipate continued strength in demand and margins for our O&P and Americas businesses during the third quarter. While consultants are predicting some margin compression for ethylene recent outages have caused prices to quickly rebound and demonstrated that markets remain relatively tight. 
High demand, low downstream inventories and customer backlogs are expected to continue and provide ongoing support for strong polymer margins. As of this week, our August order volumes for PE and PP in the Americas segment are stronger than any prior month in 2021. 
Now please turn to Slide 11 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. Similar to the Americas, robust demand and improving margins in our EAI markets drove second quarter EBITDA to a record $708 million, $296 million higher than the first quarter. 
Olefins results improved by $100 million as margins increased driven by higher ethylene and coproduct prices. Demand was robust during the quarter, and we operated our crackers at a rate of 96%, more than 10% above industry benchmarks. 
Combined polyolefin results increased approximately $180 million compared to the prior quarter. Strong polymer demand drove spread improvements with price increases for polyethylene and polypropylene outpacing monomer prices. Margin improvements were partially offset by a small decline in polyolefin volume. During the third quarter, we could see modest rebalancing of tight European markets as customers take downtime for summer holidays. 
Please turn to Slide 12 as we take a look at our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Robust demand expanded our margins and increased our sales volumes following the Texas weather events and some plant maintenance during the prior quarter. Second quarter EBITDA was $596 million, more than 3x higher than the prior quarter. 
Second quarter propylene oxide and derivative results increased by $170 million driven by record high margins. Intermediate Chemicals results increased by about $170 million, primarily due to higher product prices for most of the businesses. Oxyfuels and related products results increased by $70 million, driven by higher margins, benefiting from improved demand and higher gasoline prices. We expect continued strength in durable goods and improving transportation fuels demand to increase third quarter volumes for our I&D segment. Margins could slightly moderate if industry production rates remain strong. 
Please turn to Slide 13 and allow me to dive a little deeper into transportation trends that support our improving outlook for LyondellBasell's oxyfuels and refined products. Demand for transportation fuels are rebounding from pandemic close. Total gasoline and distillate demand in June was within 5% of prepandemic levels. Reduced demand in margins for refined products is mostly due to lagging demand for jet fuel associated with business and international travel. Jet fuel demand remains stubbornly below pre-pandemic levels. 
As vaccinations in global travel resumes through 2022 and 2023, we expect refining margins will improve and drive additional earnings power for LyondellBasell's Houston refinery. The chart on the left illustrates the Northwest Europe raw material margin for MTBE, which is an industry marker for our oxyfuels products sold into gasoline blending markets around the world. 
While Oxyfuels are typically a reliable performing business through the cycle, low demand for gasoline pushed this margin into breakeven or negative territory over the prior 4 quarters. Since the beginning of this year, global demand for gasoline and gasoline blending components such as MTBE and ETBE has improved, increasing the margin to an average of $167 per ton during the second quarter. This is a significant rebound and well within the historical range shown by [Audio Gap] 
Now let's move forward and review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 14. The margin improvement was offset by a decline in volumes as semiconductor shortages reduced demand for our polymers serving automotive and electronic end markets. Second quarter EBITDA was $129 million, lower than the first quarter. 
Compounding & Solutions results decreased by about $25 million as volumes decline for polymers supplied to the automotive sector appliance manufacturing and other industries that were constrained by chip shortages. Advanced Polymer results increased by approximately $10 million due to improved polymer price spreads over propylene raw materials. 
In July, feedstock cost for our polypropylene compounds produced in Europe have increased and are likely to pressure margins during the third quarter. We only expect gradual volume recovery for compound supply to automotive electronics applications as semiconductor supply constraints decrease over the coming quarters. 
Now let's turn to Slide 15 and discuss [Audio Gap] and lower prices for refinery-grade propylene co-product. This resulted in second quarter EBITDA of negative $81 million, an improvement of $29 million relative to the first quarter of 2021. In the second quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 benchmark increased by $6.14 per barrel to $21.46 per barrel. 
The average crude throughput at the refinery increased to 248,000 barrels per day, an operating rate of 93%. In July, we continue to see improvements in refined product demand and we are running the refinery at nearly full rates. Strong demand for diesel and improving demand for gasoline is expected to improve refining margins and could enable our refinery to return to profitability before the end of 2021. And as mentioned, full margin recovery will require a stronger rebound in jet fuel demand. 
Please turn to Slide 16 as we review the results of our Technology segment. Increased licensing revenue was offset by a decline in Catalyst margin, resulting in a second EBITDA of $92 million, $2 million lower than the prior quarter. We expect that third quarter profitability for our technology business will be similar to the same quarter last year based on the anticipated timing of licensing revenue and catalyst demand. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob."

In the near to midterm, we are still in the early stages of the global economic recovery. And despite the challenges from variants, continued progress with vaccinations and reopening should continue to support robust demand and margins for our products. 
Pent-up demand is tangible and consumers have ample liquidity to drive purchases of both services and manufactured goods as reopening proceeds globally. Low inventories due to supply constraints and logistics disruptions will only serve to extend tight market conditions, downstream customer backlogs and persistent demand bode well for continued strength in LyondellBasell's order books. 
In polyethylene, strong U.S. and Latin American demand has overtaken volumes that previously flowed from the U.S. to export markets in Asia. As logistics constraints subside, and U.S. PG exports to Asia resume, producers will need to refill a depleted supply chain of 500,000 tons or more that is not fully captured in industry statistics. In North America, we expect markets for PE and PP will remain tight into next year. 
Higher vaccination rates are expected to improve global mobility over the coming year. The return of international travel will drive further recovery in transportation fuels markets to increase profitability for our oxyfuels and refining businesses, providing additional earnings upside for LyondellBasell. 
Let me close with Slide 18. Our second quarter results provide clear evidence of LyondellBasell's progress in maximizing cash flow performance through all stages of the business cycle. We are leveraging our leading and advantaged positions across a larger asset base to deliver results that far exceed our previous benchmarks. 
In today's strong markets, our second quarter EBITDA results are 38% higher than our previous record. By 2023, we expect that our recent growth investments will provide an additional $1.5 billion of mid-cycle EBITDA earnings capability relative to 2017. Our value-driven growth investments should propel stronger performance in a variety of business environments. 
Our prudent financial strategy remains consistent. We have increased our quarterly dividend and remain confident in our capability to deliver on this commitment throughout business cycles. We are prioritizing deleveraging and our rapid progress on debt repayment will serve to further strengthen our investment-grade balance sheet. 
Capacity expansions are coming online in our industry during a period of extraordinary demand growth and enabling an orderly absorption of this new capacity into the market. Further investments in petrochemicals are proceeding at a manageable rate and recent project cancellations and delays demonstrate capital discipline by market participants. 
At LyondellBasell, we're focused on providing leadership for our industry to establish a more sustainable future with new circular business models. We will increase our capacity to serve the growing market demand for circulun-branded polymers produced from recycled and renewable feedstocks as we work toward our goal of annually producing 2 million tons [Audio Gap] robust returns from our growing global business portfolio and look forward to updating you on our progress over the coming quarters. We're now pleased to take your questions."

They are improving. One other comment about inventory is that in the U.S., in particular, we're not positioned to do a lot of exports. That will require another level of inventory, which we don't have today. So the inventory situation is improving, not back to historic levels. On July contract, discussions are still ongoing. Markets are very firm tight. We still have hurricane season in front of us. We have a heavy maintenance schedule in the industry in Q3 and early Q4 in the U.S. So contract discussions are ongoing, and there are more announcements out there for August."

First of all, inventory at customers, it's difficult for us to have exact numbers on that. But I can tell you that when we've had some intermittent unplanned outages recently, we -- they seem to not have much inventory because for a day or 2 late, they're very concerned. So anecdotally, I would say there's not much inventory downstream, especially because there's this anticipation of pricing leveling off as well. And we've been talking about that for months now and prices continue to rise because of the persistent demand strength. So all of that says to me, customers are not holding an extraordinary amount of inventory. When we're late, they call us right away. 
Secondly, your question about imports. Historically, and even today, imports because of long lead times and generally only the more generic grades are available for import, the imports tend to be limited. Furthermore, if you think about today, transportation costs, shipping costs and container costs from Asia to the U.S. basically wipe out the entire arbitrage that exists today in polyethylene price, for example, shipping costs, including container cost is 3 to 4x what it used to be prepandemic. So all of that limits the amount of imports that really come in and the customer's ability to import product."

Thank you for that question, P.J. There's a lot there. First of all, you're absolutely right. This debate of where we are in the cycle whether we're at elevated levels or not, I think there's a couple of points to be made. One is that what's lost in this debate is that LyondellBasell's mid-cycle earnings have stepped up through the cycle earnings power is up by $1 billion to $1.1 billion so far in 2021 compared to 2017. And when we have a full year of PO/TBA production in '23, that will add another $400 million to $500 million of EBITDA to our earnings power. I think that's very important in terms of through the cycle cash generation ability to pay dividend fund buybacks in the future, all of that. We must not forget that while we continue to debate or we at peak or not. Secondly, in terms of capital allocation, our first priority is to continue to pay down debt. And Michael talked about that in the prepared remarks about our target of up to $4 billion of debt reduction this year. We think that's very achievable. We'll continue to update everyone on that. Once we're to that point where we've taken out of $4 billion of debt, then I think the whole range of sort of alternatives come into play, continue to strengthen the dividend think about buybacks, look for deep value M&A. I think we've demonstrated that, that's our focus and stay within the lanes where we swim today. So we'll continue to look for that. In terms of green projects, we're still studying where we can get the most bang for the buck, if you will. And I suspect that our CapEx will reflect some of those green investments later in the decade, probably 2025 onwards. And I would suspect that will be for a total in the second half of 2021, somewhere in $2 billion to $3 billion range in terms of CapEx in the second half of the decade not annually, but total for the second half of the decade."

So first of all, historically, even pre-pandemic freight rates coming from Asia to the U.S. were always higher than freight rates going out of U.S. to Asia because of the backhaul sort of concept on product going out. Typically, we would pay about $40 per ton, excluding packaging, just freight to get polyethylene, for example, from the Gulf Coast to Asia, Today, that's probably double. It's not really limited in terms of exports. Frankly, we just don't have enough production today to be able to export spot volume to Asia. We are doing some exports that are more contract-oriented down to Latin America. We have some contract commitments even in Asia that we continue to fulfill. But we're not quite back in that mode. Certainly, as a company, we're not where we're looking for spot volume going to Asia. And I think as the year progresses and some of these bottlenecks around shipping relieve themselves, I don't see that as being a challenge. And over time, as that happens, I think the price in China should start to come up as their ability to export finished goods improves. And I think the world will kind of equilibrate with China prices coming up as these shipping constraints relieve themselves."

We have feedstocks are coming up a bit with natural gas in the U.S. coming up. fact spreads haven't really opened up, but feedstocks are coming up. But my sense is in this kind of market environment, there's some ability to pass some of that through. As a company, we have some planned and unplanned outages here in Q3.

And I think as durables strengthen and especially auto because that is one of the larger end uses for polypropylene. For us, inventories are still low, and they're actually tighter on polypropylene than they are on polyethylene. We're kind of hand them out. And we have the lightning strike at Lake Charles, which set us back about a week or 2. And so we're very tight on polypropylene and love for the most part, we're managing to contract minimums with our customers. As some of these bottlenecks relieve themselves for auto production, that's just going to make the market tighter. And then appliances, those are big draws on polypropylene. So my outlook is that polypropylene is going to be tight through the rest of the year. And by the way, the other benefit that we're waiting to see is in our APS segment, with the auto sector being sluggish because of the chip shortage, we're not seeing the full earnings power of APS just yet, and that's a very significant part of the APS segment. Our service of the automotive market. So I think polypropylene is going to be very strong. I think propylene is going to be persistently high for the foreseeable future."

And as oil price rises and as prices go up globally on polyethylene, that JV tends to do very well. That's a big contributor to the increase in earnings from the existing JVs. And then the Sasol JV has done extremely well with the merchant ethylene that we sell from that and the ethane to polyethylene cash margins being where they are today. Between operating cash flow and the expected tax refund on that investment, we expect to recover or get back half of our investment in 2021. So that's been a big driver.

My sense is that the fuels part of the business was still a bit weak in Q2, but the polymers and the PO was very strong in production in Q2 and certainly up compared to Q1. Going forward, you asked about which product lines have the most potential for spread and volume improvement. Definitely, it's in fuels. I do think there's incremental potential in spread improvement in the polymers area globally. But where I think we have the greatest opportunity for a step up in volume and and spread is in oxyfuels and in gasoline and distillate here in the U.S., and we hope that will be very meaningful as we work through Q3 and certainly into Q4."

Every day, we work diligently to ensure that the colleagues, the friends and, most importantly, the families of our employees and contractors never have to receive the calls that went out last Tuesday evening, notifying them of the loss or injury of a loved one.

Please turn to Slide 3, and let's review our second quarter financial results. LyondellBasell's global businesses are benefiting from more than 90% higher than our first quarter results. Strong demand for our products allowed us to increase prices and expand margins to generate more than $3 billion of quarterly EBITDA. 
Despite the increased working capital required by higher prices and volumes, we generated $1.9 billion of cash from operating activities. 
These results demonstrate how LyondellBasell's disciplined investments in growth and share repurchases over the past few years have enabled us to establish new benchmarks for our company's profitability.  
Second quarter EBITDA is 38% higher than our previous record established in the third quarter of 
[Audio Gap]
a larger LyondellBasell is now positioned to generate stronger results and higher cash flow through business cycles. The events of this week provide a vivid reminder of the reasons behind our company's commitment to safe and reliable operations. Let's turn to Slide 4 and review our recent safety performance.  
As of the end of June, our year-to-date total recordable incident rate of 0.22 for employees and contractors remained in the top 10% of our industry. As we do with all major incidents, we will investigate the root cause and contributing factors involved in this week's events and share our findings with our contractors, our employees and our industry peers.  Our aim is to learn from all incidents and achieve a goal 0 work environment that prevents such tragedies from occurring.  
On Slide 5, I would like to highlight our most recent sustainability report that we released last month. This report focuses on LyondellBasell's efforts to address 3 urgent global challenges for our business, eliminating plastic waste in the environment, addressing climate change and supporting a thriving society.  
LyondellBasell is leading work to transform our industry towards more sustainable 
[Audio Gap] 
We are developing projects that should enable us to achieve our industry-leading goal of producing and marketing 2 million metric tons of recycled and renewable based polymers annually by 2030.
LyondellBasell aims to be a leader in supplying the large and growing addressable market for Circular Polymers. 
On climate change, we support the ambitions of the Paris Climate Agreement, and we're moving forward with investments in energy reduction, increased utilization of renewable energy and evaluation of new low-carbon technologies. We will be sharing more details on our carbon reduction plans over the coming months.  
In our work to advance the thriving society, I'm very pleased to see the enthusiasm from our employees to embrace a more inclusive work environment. During the second quarter, we launched employee network Basell. These networks allow colleagues with similar interests, identities and goals to foster professional and personal growth. When combined with our emphasis on a safe work culture and community engagement, our work to capture the full potential of our diverse global workforce should further enhance the sustainability of our company's performance.  
Following an exceptional second quarter, some market observers are predicting a rapid decline in prices and profitability for our industry. On Slide 6, I would like to point out why we believe that markets will be stronger for longer.  
COVID vaccinations have been the driving force behind the reopening of societies and the rebounding global economy. As of July, only 14% of the global population is fully vaccinated. While the U.S. and roughly a dozen other countries have achieved vaccination rates approaching or exceeding 50%, health experts anticipate that vaccines will be rolling out to the rest of the world throughout 2022 and into 2023.  
As seen by the increased spread among unvaccinated populations and the rise of variants, we still have much work ahead of us to contain the coronavirus and realize the full economic power of global reopening. Returning to normalcy is eagerly anticipated by consumers with considerable pent-up demand and increased disposable income.  
The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that U.S. personal savings averaged $3.5 trillion during the first 5 months of 2021, nearly 3x the level seen in 2019. With fiscal stimulus continuing to flow into the economy, consumers are both motivated and well funded to drive global economic activity. 
[Audio Gap] 
This unfulfilled demand will persist to drive strong industrial production and demand for our materials for quite some time.  
One example is that the average age of an automobile in the U.S. reached an all-time high of 12 years in 2021. Businesses and consumers will eventually need to replace this aging fleet of cars and trucks. Despite higher prices and supply chain constraints, demand for our products serving automotive manufacturing are forecast to increase a total of 10% in 2021 and an additional 11% during 2022.  
Strong U.S. household formation during the pandemic has evolved into a robust housing market. LyondellBasell benefits from both direct demand for building and construction materials as well as demand for our products used in the myriad of furniture, appliances and other goods that complete a new home.  
And as vaccinations facilitate improvements in global mobility, LyondellBasell's products will see increased demand from restocking and consumption by service, entertainment, travel and hospitality industries as well as increased demand for transportation fuels supplied by LyondellBasell's oxyfuels and refining businesses. In short, we remain confident that persistently high demand should support strong markets for our products through 2022.  
With that, I will turn the call over to Michael, who will describe our financial and segment results over the past quarter."

Please turn to Slide 7, and let me begin by highlighting our strong cash generation, which has been enhanced by our recent growth investments. In the second quarter, LyondellBasell generated $1.9 billion of cash from operating activities that contributed towards the more than $4 billion over the past 12 months.  
Our free operating cash flow yield has been 10.1% over the past 4 quarters and free operating cash flow for the second quarter improved by more than 80% relative to the second quarter of 2019. We expect continued improvement of our last 12 months cash flow performance as we move forward through each quarter of 2021. Let's turn to Slide 8 and review the details of our cash generation and deployment during the second quarter. 
As I have mentioned during previous calls, a strong and progressive dividend plays a fundamental role in our capital deployment strategy. In the second quarter, we expressed our confidence in our outlook by increasing the quarterly dividend by 7.6% to $1.13 per share. We continue to invest in maintenance and growth projects during the quarter with approximately $430 million in capital expenditures. Strong cash flow supported debt repayments of $1.3 billion, bringing our year-to-date debt reduction to $1.8 billion. We closed the second quarter with cash and liquid investments of $1.5 billion.  
Last week, S&P Global Ratings recognize the improvement in our metrics by upgrading our credit ratings and indicating a stable outlook. We expect that robust cash generation and an anticipated tax refund will enable continued progress on our goal to reduce our net debt by up to $4 billion during 2021 and further strengthen our investment-grade balance sheet.  
One modeling item of note. Our original full year net interest expense guidance of $430 million did not include extinguishment costs associated with our accelerated debt repayment program. As a result, our 2021 net interest expense will likely exceed this prior guidance.  
Please turn to Slide 9 to review our quarterly profitability. In the second quarter of 2021, LyondellBasell's business portfolio delivered record EBITDA of $3 billion. This was an improvement of more than $1.4 billion relative to the first quarter. Our results reflect robust demand for our products driven by the recovery in global economy and our growth investments. Markets remained tight during the second quarter as the industry returned to normal operation following first quarter disruptions from the winter storm that constrained production for LyondellBasell and nearly all of our competitors with operations in the state of Texas.  
Persistent consumer and industrial demand has met tight markets, leading to 7 consecutive months of North American polyethylene contract price increases totaling more than $900 per ton. We expect market conditions to remain robust and that continued progress in global reopening, sizable order backlogs and the increasing demand for transportation fuels will all support strong margins across LyondellBasell's businesses.  
Our previous quarterly EBITDA record set in the third quarter of 2015 was approximately $2.2 billion, with more than $140 million of EBITDA contributed by our Refining segment. Today, our growth investments are helping offset a challenging refining environment and enabling us to surpass the 2015 record. Our aim is to leverage our larger business portfolio to achieve improved results at all stages of the business cycle.  
Now let's review second quarter results for each of our segments. As mentioned, my discussion will describe our underlying business results, I will begin with our Olefins and Polyolefins – Americas on Slide 10. Strong demand, improved margins and our growth investments drove second quarter EBITDA to a record of $1.6 billion, $709 million higher than the first quarter.  
Olefins results increased by approximately $310 million compared to the first quarter due to higher margins and volumes. LyondellBasell's cracker operating rates increased to 93%, following the first quarter Texas weather events, about 5 points above the second quarter industry average. Margins improved primarily due to the absence of high cost incurred during the prior quarter's weather events.  
Polyolefin results increased by about $400 million during the second quarter as robust demand in tight markets drove higher prices and margins for polyethylene and polypropylene. We anticipate continued strength in demand and margins for our O&P and Americas businesses during the third quarter. While consultants are predicting some margin compression for ethylene, recent outages have caused prices to quickly rebound and demonstrated that markets remain relatively tight.  
High demand, low downstream inventories and customer backlogs are expected to continue and  and provide ongoing support for strong polymer margins. As of this week, our August order volumes for PE and PP in the Americas segment are stronger than any prior month in 2021. 
Now please turn to Slide 11 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. Similar to the Americas, robust demand and improving margins in our EAI markets drove second quarter EBITDA to a record $708 million, $296 million higher than the first quarter.  
Olefins results improved by $100 million as margins increased driven by higher ethylene and coproduct prices. Demand was robust during the quarter, and we operated our crackers at a rate of 96%, more than 10% above industry benchmarks.  
Combined polyolefin results increased approximately $180 million compared to the prior quarter. Strong polymer demand drove spread improvements with price increases for polyethylene and polypropylene outpacing monomer prices. Margin improvements were partially offset by a small decline in polyolefin volume. During the third quarter, we could see modest rebalancing of tight European markets as customers take downtime for summer holidays.  
Please turn to Slide 12 as we take a look at our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Robust demand expanded our margins and increased our sales volumes following the Texas weather events and some planned maintenance during the prior quarter. Second quarter EBITDA was $596 million, more than 3x higher than the prior quarter.  
Second quarter propylene oxide and derivative results increased by $170 million driven by record high margins. Intermediate Chemicals results increased by about $170 million, primarily due to higher product prices for most of the businesses. Oxyfuels and related products results increased by $70 million, driven by higher margins, benefiting from improved demand and higher gasoline prices. We expect continued strength in durable goods and improving transportation fuels demand to increase third quarter volumes for our I&D segment. Margins could slightly moderate if industry production rates remain strong.  
Please turn to Slide 13 and allow me to dive a little deeper into transportation trends that support our improving outlook for LyondellBasell's oxyfuels and refined products. Demand for transportation fuels are rebounding from pandemic close. Total gasoline and distillate demand in June was within 5% of pre-pandemic levels. Reduced demand in margins for refined products is mostly due to lagging demand for jet fuel associated with business and international travel. Jet fuel demand remains stubbornly below pre-pandemic levels.  
As vaccinations in global travel resumes through 2022 and 2023, we expect refining margins will improve and drive additional earnings power for LyondellBasell's Houston refinery. The chart on the left illustrates the Northwest Europe raw material margin for MTBE, which is an industry marker for our oxyfuels products sold into gasoline blending markets around the world.  
While Oxyfuels are typically a reliable performing business through the cycle, low demand for gasoline pushed this margin into breakeven or negative territory over the prior 4 quarters. Since the beginning of this year, global demand for gasoline and gasoline blending components such as MTBE and ETBE has improved, increasing the margin to an average of $167 per ton during the second quarter. This is a significant rebound and well within the historical range shown by the blue band on the chart. As we expected, faster recovery in gasoline markets has returned profitability [indiscernible]. 
Now let's move forward and review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 14. The margin improvement was offset by a decline in volumes as semiconductor shortages reduced demand for our polymers serving automotive and electronic end markets. Second quarter EBITDA was $129 million, $6 million lower than the first quarter.  
Compounding & Solutions results decreased by about $25 million as volumes decline for polymers supplied to the automotive sector, appliance manufacturing and other industries that were constrained by chip shortages. Advanced Polymer results increased by approximately $10 million due to improved polymer price spreads over propylene raw materials.  
In July, feedstock cost for our polypropylene compounds produced in Europe have increased and are likely to pressure margins during the third quarter. We only expect gradual volume recovery for compound supply to automotive and electronics applications as semiconductor supply constraints decrease over the coming quarters.  
Now let's turn to Slide 15 and discuss the result for our Refining segment. Improvements in the Maya 2-1-1 refining frack spread
[Audio Gap] 
and lower prices for refinery-grade propylene co-product. This resulted in second quarter EBITDA of negative $81 million, an improvement of $29 million relative to the first quarter of 2021. In the second quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 benchmark increased by $6.14 per barrel to $21.46 per barrel.  
The average crude throughput at the refinery increased to 248,000 barrels per day, an operating rate of 93%. In July, we continue to see improvements in refined product demand and we are running the refinery at nearly full rates. Strong demand for diesel and improving demand for gasoline is expected to improve refining margins and could enable our refinery to return to profitability before the end of 2021. And as mentioned, full margin recovery will require a stronger rebound in jet fuel demand.  
Please turn to Slide 16 as we review the results of our Technology segment. Increased licensing revenue was offset by a decline in catalyst margin, resulting in a second quarter EBITDA of $92 million, $2 million lower than the prior quarter. We expect that third quarter profitability for our technology business will be similar to the same quarter last year based on the anticipated timing of licensing revenue and catalyst demand.  
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob."

In the near to midterm, we are still in the early stages of the global economic recovery. And despite the challenges from variants, continued progress with vaccinations and reopening should continue to support robust demand and margins for our products. 
Pent-up demand is tangible, and consumers have ample liquidity to drive purchases of both services and manufactured goods as reopening proceeds globally. Low inventories due to supply constraints and logistics disruptions will only serve to extend tight market conditions. Downstream customer backlogs and persistent demand bode well for continued strength in LyondellBasell's order books. 
In polyethylene, strong U.S. and Latin American demand has overtaken volumes that previously flowed from the U.S. to export markets in Asia. As logistics constraints subside and U.S. PG exports to Asia resume, producers will need to refill a depleted supply chain of 500,000 tons or more that is not fully captured in industry statistics. In North America, we expect markets for PE and PP will remain tight into next year. 
Higher vaccination rates are expected to improve global mobility over the coming year. The return of international travel will drive further recovery in transportation fuels markets to increase profitability for our oxyfuels and refining businesses, providing additional earnings upside for LyondellBasell. 
Let me close with Slide 18. Our second quarter results provide clear evidence of LyondellBasell's progress in maximizing cash flow performance through all stages of the business cycle. We are leveraging our leading and advantaged positions across a larger asset base to deliver results that far exceed our previous benchmarks. 
In today's strong markets, our second quarter EBITDA results are 38% higher than our previous record. By 2023, we expect that our recent growth investments will provide an additional $1.5 billion of mid-cycle EBITDA earnings capability relative to 2017. Our value-driven growth investments should propel stronger performance in a variety of business environments. 
Our prudent financial strategy remains consistent. We have increased our quarterly dividend and remain confident in our capability to deliver on this commitment throughout business cycles. We are prioritizing deleveraging and our rapid progress on debt repayment will serve to further strengthen our investment-grade balance sheet. 
Capacity expansions are coming online in our industry during a period of extraordinary demand growth and enabling an orderly absorption of this new capacity into the market. Further investments in petrochemicals are proceeding at a manageable rate and recent project cancellations and delays demonstrate capital discipline by market participants. 
At LyondellBasell, we're focused on providing leadership for our industry to establish a more sustainable future with new circular business models. We will increase our capacity to serve the growing market demand for Circulen-branded polymers produced from recycled and renewable feedstocks as we work toward our goal of annually producing 2 million tons

of these products by 2030.

They are improving. 
One other comment about inventory is that in the U.S. in particular, we're not positioned to do a lot of exports. That will require another level of inventory, which we don't have today. So the inventory situation is improving, not back to historic levels. 
On July contract, discussions are still ongoing. Markets are very firm, tight. We still have hurricane season in front of us. We have a heavy maintenance schedule in the industry in Q3 and early Q4 in the U.S. So contract discussions are ongoing, and there are more announcements out there for August."

First of all, inventory at customers, it's difficult for us to have exact numbers on that. But I can tell you that when we've had some intermittent unplanned outages recently, we -- they seem to not have much inventory because for a day or 2 late, they're very concerned. So anecdotally, I would say there's not much inventory downstream, especially because there's this anticipation of pricing leveling off as well. And we've been talking about that for months now and prices continue to rise because of the persistent demand strength. So all of that says to me, customers are not holding an extraordinary amount of inventory. When we're late, they call us right away. 
Secondly, your question about imports. Historically and even today, imports because of long lead times and generally only the more generic grades are available for import, the imports tend to be limited. Furthermore, if you think about today, transportation costs, shipping costs and container costs from Asia to the U.S. basically wipe out the entire arbitrage that exists today in polyethylene price, for example. Shipping cost, including container cost, is 3 to 4x what it used to be pre-pandemic. So all of that limits the amount of imports that really come in and the customer's ability to import product."

Thank you for that question, P.J. There's a lot there. First of all, you're absolutely right.

Thank you for that question, P.J. There's a lot there. First of all, you're absolutely right. This debate of where we are in the cycle whether we're at elevated levels or not, I think there's a couple of points to be made. One is that what's lost in this debate is that LyondellBasell's mid-cycle earnings have stepped up. Through-the-cycle earnings power is up by $1 billion to $1.1 billion so far in 2021 compared to 2017. And when we have a full year of PO/TBA production in '23, that will add another $400 million to $500 million of EBITDA to our earnings power. 
I think that's very important in terms of through-the-cycle cash generation ability to pay dividend, fund buybacks in the future, all of that. We must not forget that while we continue to debate are we at peak or not. 
Secondly, in terms of capital allocation, our first priority is to continue to pay down debt. And Michael talked about that in the prepared remarks about our target of up to $4 billion of debt reduction this year. We think that's very achievable. We'll continue to update everyone on that. Once we're to that point where we've taken out of $4 billion of debt, then I think the whole range of sort of alternatives come into play, continue to strengthen the dividend, think about buybacks, look for deep value M&A. I think we've demonstrated that, that's our focus and stay within the lanes where we swim today. 
So we'll continue to look for that. In terms of green projects, we're still studying where we can get the most bang for the buck, if you will. And I suspect that our CapEx will reflect some of those green investments later in the decade, probably 2025 onwards. And I would suspect that will be for a total in the second half of 2021 somewhere in $2 billion to $3 billion range in terms of CapEx in the second half of the decade not annually, but total for the second half of the decade."

So first of all, historically, even pre-pandemic freight rates coming from Asia to the U.S. were always higher than freight rates going out of U.S. to Asia because of the backhaul sort of concept on product going out. Typically, we would pay about $40 per ton, excluding packaging, just freight to get polyethylene, for example, from the Gulf Coast to Asia.
Today, that's probably double. It's not really limited in terms of exports. Frankly, we just don't have enough production today to be able to export spot volume to Asia. We are doing some exports that are more contract-oriented down to Latin America. We have some contract commitments even in Asia that we continue to fulfill. 
But we're not quite back in that mode. Certainly, as a company, we're not where we're looking for spot volume going to Asia. And I think as the year progresses and some of these bottlenecks around shipping relieve themselves, I don't see that as being a challenge. And over time, as that happens, I think the price in China should start to come up as their ability to export finished goods improves. And I think the world will kind of equilibrate with China prices coming up as these shipping constraints relieve themselves."

Now we do have some other forces at play. We have feedstocks are coming up a bit with natural gas in the U.S. coming up. Frack spreads haven't really opened up, but feedstocks are coming up. But my sense is in this kind of market environment, there's some ability to pass some of that through. As a company, we have some planned and unplanned outages here in Q3.

And for the most part, we're managing to contract minimums with our customers. 
As some of these bottlenecks relieve themselves for auto production, that's just going to make the market tighter. And then appliances, those are big draws on polypropylene. So my outlook is that polypropylene is going to be tight through the rest of the year. And by the way, the other benefit that we're waiting to see is in our APS segment. With the auto sector being sluggish because of the chip shortage, we're not seeing the full earnings power of APS just yet, and that's a very significant part of the APS segment, our service at the automotive market.

On the August order book comment, I think it's just an indication of us having more volume to sell. We've been constrained all year. And as we try to inch our inventory back to more normal levels, we can with confidence take on more orders, we're still constrained. So we're not selling polyethylene unconstrained across the system. But there are some grades now where we have enough availability that if a customer wants a product, we're able to do it. 
But it's really grade by grade. In some areas, we're still at contract minimums. And so bottom line is Q3 U.S. polyolefins sales should be higher than Q2 as we produce more and sell more. And I hope that, that trend continues."

[Audio Gap] 
are very, very strong there. We could sell more if we had it, frankly. I expect that to continue, again, coming back to my earlier comments, about furniture shortages. That plays right into PO, also automotive because the seat cushions and all that come from urethanes. So we see a really good runway for propylene oxide going into the second half of the year and into even next year. Frankly, if the rate demand is growing, when our plant starts up, we have a decent chance at absorbing a good bit of it right away. And I think it will come on when it's needed. 
Likewise, in acetyls, continued strength from housing, and you see the paint market being very strong because of home improvement and people buying new houses and refurbishing them and so on. So I mean I don't see a let-up on either of those. Adding to that, Arun, our oxyfuels business has recovered nicely as we see more mobility around the world. And still, Europe is largely in lockdown. And I think the best profitability in oxyfuels is still in front of us. And I think that will help offset any moderation in the O&P area as we see the fuels improving in Q3, Q4 and into next year."

And as oil price rises and as prices go up globally on polyethylene, that JV tends to do very well. That's a big contributor to the increase in earnings from the existing JVs. 
And then the Sasol JV has done extremely well with the merchant ethylene that we sell from that and the ethane to polyethylene cash margins being where they are today. Between operating cash flow and the expected tax refund on that investment, we expect to recover or get back half of our investment in 2021. So that's been a big driver. And then incrementally, all the other JVs have contributed to the improvement. But I would say the Saudi JV and the Sasol JV were probably the largest contributor in the increase.

So I think the headline, there's a lot underneath the details in which product lines were higher or lower. My sense is that the fuels part of the business was still a bit weak in Q2, but the polymers and the PO was very strong in production in Q2 and certainly up compared to Q1. Going forward, you asked about which product lines have the most potential for spread and volume improvement. And definitely, it's in fuels. I do think there's incremental potential in spread improvement in the polymers area globally. But where I think we have the greatest opportunity for a step-up in volume and spread is in oxyfuels and in gasoline and distillate here in the U.S. And we hope that will be very meaningful as we work through Q3 and certainly into Q4."

Today, we will be discussing our business results while making reference to some forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, and the alternative measures are useful to investors. Nonetheless, the forward-looking statements are subject to significant risk and uncertainty. We encourage you to learn more about the factors that could lead our actual results to differ by reviewing the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our regulatory filings, which are also available at our investor website. 
Additional documents on our investor website provide reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with other disclosures, including the earnings release. A recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time today until November 30, by calling (877) 660-6853 in the United States and (201) 612-7415 outside the United States. The pass code for both numbers is 13723396. 
During today's call, we will focus on third quarter results, the current environment, our near-term outlook and provide an update on our growth initiatives. Before turning the call over to Bob, I would like to call your attention to the noncash lower up cost or market inventory adjustments, or LCM, that we have discussed on past calls. These adjustments are related to our use of last in, first out or LIFO accounting and the volatility in prices for our raw material and finished goods inventories. 
During the third quarter of 2020, we recognized a noncash impairment of $582 million that reflected our expectation for reduced profitability from our Houston refinery. Comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impacts of the refinery impairment and the LCM inventory adjustments. With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Bob."

Per our usual practice, we will review our results from the quarter. As I prepare to leave the company at the end of the year, I've taken some time to reflect on the strong company we have built and our outlook for the future. Without a doubt, LyondellBasell's future is very bright. Because of the efforts of our incredibly talented and hard-working global team, we've built a company that has proven it can perform under a range of conditions. 
During an event like a global pandemic, that no one could have predicted or imagined, we were able to fund our dividend with cash from operations and grow our company through accretive M&A. I'm confident that LyondellBasell will continue to deliver for its stakeholders in the future. This is a company that is focused on building value for the long term and one that is built to stand the test of time. 
With that said, let's review our third quarter results. Please turn to Slide 3. LyondellBasell's businesses are continuing to benefit from robust global demand and tight market conditions. In the third quarter, our company delivered $5.25 per share of earnings, more than 4x higher than the same quarter last year. EBITDA was approximately $2.7 billion, a year-over-year quarterly improvement of $1.8 billion. 
Efficient cash conversion generated $2.1 billion in cash from operating activities, a new quarterly record for our company. These results are indicative of strong markets, the discipline with which we approach running our business and the increased earnings power from our value-driven investments and accretive growth over the past several years. 
We remain focused on improving LyondellBasell's cash generation through all stages of the business cycle. Please turn to Slide 4 to review our quarterly profitability. While our portfolio delivered $2.7 billion of EBITDA, this quarter's results reflect a sequential decline of 11%. Increased costs for natural gas, ethane, naphtha and butane compressed margins for many products from the highs seen in the second quarter. This, however, does not change how we see the future. We continue to see very solid demand for our products and remain highly constructive on the outlook for our businesses as global reopening continues to play out over the coming quarters. 
We expect a combination of a well-funded economy and pent-up consumer demand for durable goods as well as the nondurable goods associated with travel, leisure and other in-person activities will continue to underpin attractive markets. In short, we remain confident that a reopening global economy and eventual normalization of global supply chains will support continued growth for our businesses over the coming quarters. 
Let's turn to Slide 5 and review our safety performance. Our year-to-date total recordable incident rate for employees and contractors rose to 0.24 during the third quarter. Much of this increase is associated with the tragic incident at our acetyls facility in La Porte, Texas during July. We remain committed to learning from this incident and incorporating the learnings from the investigations to help prevent such tragedies from ever happening again. 
Looking more closely at the chart, we are encouraged by the notable improvement in chemical industry safety performance during 2020. We are watching to see if this is a durable trend or perhaps a onetime benefit from reduced in-person work hours during the height of the pandemic. At LyondellBasell, continuous learning and a self-improving culture are key focus areas in our pursuit of goal 0 safety performance for both our employees and our contractors. 
On Slide 6, I would like to highlight LyondellBasell's increased commitments to help address the global challenge of climate change. In late September, we announced accelerated targets and a goal to achieve net 0 Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions from our global operations by 2050. We now aim to reduce absolute emissions from our global operations by 30% and relative to a 2020 baseline. 
We plan to achieve these goals by advancing progress on several fronts. First, we are improving energy efficiency in all our plants and reducing our need for high carbon content fuel sources, such as coal. We are already moving on this front. In September, we announced our plan to phase out coal from the power plant at our site in Wesseling, Germany. 
Second, we intend to procure at least 50% of our electricity from renewable sources by 2030. Third, we are focusing on minimizing flare emissions from our clients. particularly during shutdowns and start-up events. In addition, we're evaluating a portfolio of technology options across the company's manufacturing footprint, including sustainable hydrogen increased electrification and carbon capture for storage or utilization in our processes. 
We believe this strategy puts us on an achievable pathway toward our net 0 goal. In the near term, we do not expect significant increases in our overall capital budget as reduced spending associated with the completion of our PO/TBA project in 2022 will be offset by an increasing share of climate-related investment. With that, I will turn the call over to Michael, who will describe our financial and segment results in more detail."

Before I begin, I would like to share my sincere gratitude to Bob for his tireless work, inspirational energy and thought partnership in leading and growing LyondellBasell for nearly 12 years. We are all sad to see you go, Bob, but we will be eagerly watching your progress and wishing you continued success. 
Please turn to Slide 7, and let me begin by highlighting our strong cash generation, which has been bolstered by our recent growth investments. In the third quarter, LyondellBasell generated a record $2.1 billion of cash from operating activities that contributed towards the $5.4 billion of cash generated over the last 12 months. 
Our free operating cash flow for the third quarter improved by more than 10% relative to the second quarter, and our free operating cash flow yield was 15% over the last 12 months. We expect this chart will continue to improve during the fourth quarter as 2020 results drop off from our tailing performance. 
Let's turn to Slide 8 and review the details of our cash generation and deployment during the third quarter. As I have mentioned during previous calls, we are highly focused on shareholder returns. A strong and progressive dividend plays a fundamental role in our capital deployment strategy. In addition to our dividend, we also resumed share repurchases during the third quarter and reduced our share count by approximately $1 million. 
We continue to invest in maintenance and growth projects with more than $500 million in capital expenditures. Strong cash flows supported debt reduction of nearly $700 million, bringing our year-to-date debt reduction to $2.4 billion. We closed the third quarter with cash and liquid investments of $1.9 billion. 
In July, S&P Global Ratings recognized the improvement in our balance sheet by upgrading our credit ratings and indicating a stable outlook. During the fourth quarter, we expect that robust cash generation and an anticipated tax refund will enable continued progress on our goal to reduce debt by up to $4 billion during 2021, and further strengthen our investment-grade balance sheet. 
After the quarter closed, we repaid an additional $650 million of bonds in late October. We do not foresee the need for additional debt repayment in 2022. Confidence around our deleveraging targets enabled us to resume share repurchases in September and we continued to opportunistically repurchase shares during October. As of October 22, we have repurchased a total of 1.6 million shares. 
Now I would like to highlight the results for each of our segments on Slide 9. In the third quarter of 2021, LyondellBasell's business portfolio delivered EBITDA of $2.7 billion. Our results reflect strong margins supported by robust demand for our products and tight market conditions, offset by higher costs, primarily in our O&P Europe, Asia, International segment and our I&D segment. 
Let's begin the individual segment discussions on Slide 10 with the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins - Americas segment. Robust demand drove EBITDA to about $1.6 billion, slightly lower than the second quarter. Olefins results decreased approximately $75 million compared to the second quarter due to lower margins and volumes. Despite relatively stable benchmark ethylene margins, our margins declined as we purchased ethylene to supplement production and meet strong derivative demand. 
Volumes decreased due to unplanned maintenance, resulting in a cracker operating rate of 89%. Polyolefins results increased more than $75 million during the third quarter as robust demand in tight markets drove spreads higher with polyolefin prices increasing slightly more than monomer prices. In fact, our polypropylene spreads reached a historic high. 
We continue to see strong demand for our products as we begin the fourth quarter. However, higher energy and feedstock costs, along with typical seasonality demand softness toward the end of the year are likely to compress margins for our O&P Americas businesses. Now please turn to Slide 11 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia, International segment. 
Higher feedstock cost and lower seasonal demand during summer holidays reduced margins and volumes in our EAI markets resulting in a third quarter EBITDA of $474 million, $234 million lower than the second quarter. Olefins results declined about $50 million as margins decreased driven by higher feedstock costs despite the higher ethylene and co-product prices. We operated our crackers at a rate of 92% of capacity due to planned maintenance. 
Combined polyolefin results decreased approximately $120 million compared to the prior quarter. Lower seasonal demand drove declines in polyolefin price spreads relative to monomer cost and reduced volumes. Declining polyolefin spreads also affected our joint venture equity income by about $35 million. 
During the fourth quarter, we expect to see further margin declines from higher energy and feedstock costs along with end-of-year seasonality. Our ethylene volumes are expected to decline due to planned maintenance. 
Please turn to Slide 12 as we take a look at our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Rising feedstock and energy costs drove margin declines and most businesses resulted in third quarter EBITDA of $348 million, $248 million lower than the prior quarter. Results were impacted by approximately $25 million due to site closure costs associated with the exit of our ethanol business. 
Third quarter propylene oxide and derivatives results decreased about $15 million as margins declined slightly from the historical highs of the second quarter. Durable goods demand remained strong, resulting in increased volumes. Intermediate Chemicals results decreased approximately $140 million. Margins declined in most businesses, primarily styrene and volumes decreased as a result of downtime in our acetyls business. 
Oxyfuels and related products results decreased about $40 million as increased butane feedstock prices more than offset the increased volume from improved gasoline demand. In the fourth quarter, we expect volumes to increase with the restart of our La Porte acetyls facility and continued strength and demand for durable goods. Margins are likely to moderate with fourth quarter seasonality and higher raw material costs for our I&D segment. 
Now let's move forward and review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 13. Customer supply chain constraints continue to hinge results with third quarter EBITDA of $121 million, $8 million lower than the second quarter. Compounding and solutions results were relatively unchanged. 
Margins were higher but partially offset by a decrease in volume due to restricted production in downstream markets, including the automotive sector, appliance manufacturing and other industries affected by semiconductor shortages. Advanced Polymer results decreased about $10 million driven by lower margins and volumes primarily due to plant maintenance. We expect results will be similar in the fourth quarter as it will likely take several quarters before supply chain constraints begin to improve. 
Now let's turn to Slide 14 and discuss the results of our Refining segment. Margins improved significantly in the third quarter, resulting in an EBITDA improvement of $122 million to a positive $41 million. In the third quarter, prices for byproducts increased, costs for renewable identification number credits, or RINs, decreased and the Maya-2-11 benchmark increased by $1.65 per barrel to $23.11 per barrel. 
The average crude throughput at the refinery increased to 260,000 barrels per day, an operating rate of 97%. We Improved demand from increasing mobility should be supportive for our refining margins and could enable continued profitability during the fourth quarter. 
Let's finish the segment discussion on Slide 15 with the result of our Technology segment. Increased licensing revenue drove third quarter EBITDA to a record $155 million, $63 million higher than the prior quarter. We expect that fourth quarter profitability for our technology business will return to similar quarterly levels as the first half of this year based on the anticipated timing of licensing revenue and catalyst demand. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob."

Please turn to Slide 16 for a summary of the value-driven growth initiatives that our company has developed since 2018. Our approach is to pursue prudent and accretive investments that chart a clear path for increasing EBITDA. In 2018,",960,"Thank you, Michael. Please turn to Slide 16 for a summary of the value-driven growth initiatives that our company has developed since 2018. Our approach is to pursue prudent and accretive investments that chart a clear path for increasing EBITDA. In 2018, we expanded our compounding business by acquiring A. Schulman and forming the Advanced Polymer Solutions segment from both legacy and acquired businesses. 
With integration complete, we have a solid platform for future growth and synergies should become increasingly visible as volumes recover in the markets served by this segment. In the second quarter of 2020, we started a 500,000 ton per year polyethylene plant in Houston, utilizing our next-generation Hyperzone HDPE technology. 
At full nameplate capacity and average margins from 2017 to 2019, we estimate this asset is capable of generating $170 million of annual EBITDA. In September of 2020, we established a new integrated cracker joint venture in Northeastern China. This investment is capable of generating $150 million of annual EBITDA for our company again, based upon full capacity and historical industry margins. 
In December of 2020, we closed the transaction for the integrated polyethylene joint venture in Louisiana. At full capacity and historical margins, this investment is capable of contributing $330 million in EBITDA for our company. In our Intermediates and Derivatives segment, the combination of 2 new propylene oxide investments in China and Houston starting in 2022 and 2023 could together add almost $500 million of annual estimated EBITDA. Taken together, we estimate these initiatives could add up to $1.5 billion of EBITDA to our mid-cycle earnings. 
Slide 17 provides a historical view of LyondellBasell's profitability over the course of the first complete business cycle for our company. Over the period from 2011 to 2019, we delivered a little over an average of $6.5 billion of EBITDA, excluding LCM and impairment. In fact, we reached $8.1 billion in 2015 during my first year as CEO of our company. 
In today's strong market and with many of our growth initiatives providing strong contributions, our last 12-month performance was $8.6 billion, exceeding our previous record and reaching nearly 30% above the historical average. While no 2 cycles are exactly alike, our performance during prior business cycles provides valuable context on how these growth initiatives might perform and reposition LyondellBasell during the next cycle with a larger asset base. 
Let me summarize our view of current conditions and the outlook for our business with Slide 18. In the near to midterm, further progress with vaccination rollouts should continue to support solid demand and margin for our products. With 7 billion doses of vaccines administered worldwide, approximately 1/2 of the world's population has now received at least 1 dose of a COVID vaccine. 
New cases in the U.S. have fallen to less than half the level seen during the Delta-driven spike of August and September. We are keeping a watchful eye on rising case rates in the U.K. and parts of Europe, but most virus indicators are trending in a favorable direction. Over the coming months, margins are expected to face headwinds from typical fourth quarter seasonality and combined with increasing feedstock and energy prices, we anticipate some margin compression, but expect markets to remain relatively strong. Logistics constraints and the pace of vaccination are currently hindering demand. Eventually, consumers will have more options when purchasing a new car, back order furniture will become available, and all of us will find a way to resume traveling, whether for business or leisure. 
Pent-up demand is tangible and consumers have ample liquidity to drive purchases of both services and manufactured goods. Monetary stimulus may taper but the unprecedented levels of stimulus deployed during the pandemic will have lasting effects that are typically supportive for commodities. 
Let me close with Slide 19. As I think about the coming weeks and prepare to pass the baton to the next leader of LyondellBasell, I draw comfort from the knowledge that the broader team we have in place is incredibly talented and has created great momentum that will endure for many years. In the end, our assets don't run themselves and decisions don't get made by spreadsheets. I'm confident that this remarkable team will continue to take our company to greater heights. 
Our company has never forgotten our core values built upon safety, reliability and cost efficiency. These attributes form the basis for leading and advantaged positions in our industry. With these strong foundations in place, we are deploying our business model across a larger asset base with embedded growth through projects such as our PO/TBA facility and further expansion of our global joint venture partnerships. 
In tandem with our investment to reduce carbon emissions, we are also building innovative business models that will increase our utilization of plastic waste as a circular feedstock. My belief is that over the next decade, LyondellBasell will become a global market leader in the exciting and rapidly growing market for sustainable plastics. 
With strong markets and new sources of EBITDA, our team works diligently to maximize cash conversion and we have taken care to reinvest that hard-earned cash into accretive investments that add value and drive future growth. All of this work is underpinned by a disciplined financial strategy. We stand by our dual commitments to a growing dividend and an investment-grade credit rating through cycles. 
We are confident that we can complete our deleveraging and achieve our target of reducing debt by $4 billion before the end of this year. With strong cash flows and no need for further debt reduction, we expect to continue reinvesting in our company through the opportunistic repurchase of LyondellBasell shares. I hope you share my sincere enthusiasm about the future of our company. We are now pleased to take your questions."

We had a couple of very atypical unplanned outages that were quite large. First, we had the acetyls unplanned downtime due to the incident we had at Q3 volumes and margins, the volume loss and the Q3 margins, that outage impacted earnings by about $75 million. We also had a couple of larger atypical events in O&P Americas at Q3 margins that lost volume impacted earnings by about $200 million. So we could take 3 or 4 incidents and those outages reduced Q3 by about $275 million. Now there were other kind of normal unplanned outages that we have in any given quarter. But those -- it was quite an unusual quarter in that regard. As I think about next year, you said it well. I mean I think -- there is still a lot of constraints in terms of demand today. We still see a global supply chain that is not operating as smoothly as what we've seen in the past, chip shortages, shipping constraints whether it's high cost for containers or just the ships being in the wrong place. I think -- I believe firmly that, that has impacted exports of finished goods out of China, which have, in turn, reduced demand for plastics in China. So as we look into next year, I would expect that by the middle of the year, a lot of these issues should have normalized and we should see more typical global trade patterns and with a stronger durable goods market, especially for auto and appliances, those things that people have not had available to purchase, that should favor polypropylene, probably more differentially than polyethylene. So I think by mid next year, we should see operating rates sustained at over 90% and a lot of these constraints will have relieved themselves."

We turned to profit in Q3, as we mentioned during the prepared remarks. Q4 looks to be stronger than Q3. Of late, what we're seeing with high oil prices, we're seeing more Canadian sour crude coming down to the U.S., which is causing the light-heavy differential to widen. That favors our refinery. And I think that trend could continue for the next quarter at least. 
On the product side, distillate inventories are very low. Distillate cracks have expanded. We're seeing air travel get back to about 80% of pre-COVID levels in the U.S. miles driven are back to pre-COVID levels now. So all of the trends when you think about demand, like heavy differential, all indicate improvement sequentially from Q3 to Q4. And so we're pleased to be back in the black and refining. With regards to the process and the transaction. We're working through the process now, and our aim is to move towards the transaction in the coming quarter or 2. We still continue to believe that the best value for this -- that this refinery can create is by being part of the system where it can be optimized from crude purchasing to logistics, to the coproduct processing. We think that a 270,000 barrel a day refinery in the Houston Ship Channel is well placed and create tons of value as part of the system."

I think as you go quarter after quarter, all of the market forecasters have underestimated demand growth. And I think that will continue to play out. I mean think about we still have reopening ahead of us. There's a lot of buying power in the hand of consumers, highest historic savings rates in the U.S. and in many other regions around the world. You have still accommodative central bank policies, even if tapering starts, still have very low interest rate environment here and abroad. And so much pent-up demand from goods and services that we couldn't access because of shortages or because of limitations on travel. So I think this sort of scenario of moderating margins is based on continued strong demand and strengthening as reopening really takes hold and some of these supply chain constraints relieve themselves like the chip shortages. When you think about the impact in our compounding business because auto production is low, it's significant. And when those chips are available, we think that our polypropylene business our PO business and our compounding business will benefit materially from more automotive production. You asked about what could go wrong. I think in the near term, we'll have to watch energy prices. There could be points where we could see potentially spikes in energy price. But I think sustained high energy prices are unlikely because at some point, they'll be met with more supply. So I think that's what we have to watch. And the other is the picture in China remains a bit murky, and I'll try to address that through the upcoming questions."

So I don't profess to have the exact picture of what could happen, but I'll give you a few of my thoughts about what could happen. In terms of dual controls in the near term, you do see some lowering of petrochemical production. I think ultimately, that will require more imports, which benefits exporting regions like the U.S. whether it's in the I&D business or in the O&P business, I think that's a net positive. I think the reduction of coal use will likely turn off some of the CTO complexes requiring more imports of polyethylene and polypropylene favorable for global producers like us. The shipping constraints, I think, have been in that negative in the near term as they've not been producing for exports as much of finished goods. Two reasons. One is they can't get enough containers. Second, because shipping costs, in many cases are 10x when you consider both the sea freight plus the container cost, they're just not able to pass that kind of increase on. So I think as that normalizes, I would think that demand should increase in China as they're able to export more finished goods next year. And I think the longer-term outlook is that as there's less coal consumption, it seems to me that the amount of expansion that could take place in China could be less than what we've seen in the past. Certainly, MTO and CTO-based technology or based capacity will likely not be as robust as what we've seen in the last 10 years. So I think there are many bullish aspects to how this could play out. But I think it will be choppy over the next couple of quarters until we get back to something more normal."

And at the same time, we do have feedstock costs that have come up some here in the U.S. My sense is on the feedstock side that ethane is very abundant and available and what's setting the price for ethane as natural gas price. And it seems that natural gas prices kind of settled out here in the high $4, $5 per million BTU range, if that's our assumption and of course, we can have a spike here or there. But let's say, we get through the winter in that range and frac spreads are $0.05 to $0.07 a gallon for ethane. I think the cost side is kind of where we are, and there could be some moderation in margin. 15% feels heavy to me. I suspect that it will be something more modest than that."

So having said all of that, when you think about First of all, we've been consistent that we believe our CapEx will be about $2 billion per year through 2025. So the next 4 full years, we expect to be around $2 billion of CapEx. In the back half of the decade as we look to implement technologies like electric furnaces or whatever comes about, we think the CapEx could step up by about $0.5 billion a year in the back half of the decade.

Let me talk a little bit more broadly about energy prices as context, and then I'll get into the feedstock flexibility both here in Europe. First of all, I mean, as you look at kind of the outlook for oil prices, it's likely that oil prices will persist will be persistently high over the next 2, 3 years. We don't see large IOCs coming back to drill. The independents here are starting to drill more, but the very large companies who have presence in, for example, the Permian, we're not seeing drilling come back high oil prices are good for LyondellBasell. 
So I think over the long run, there will be plenty of ethane. I think ethane as there's more gas supply with more drilling ethane should be plentiful gas price should be kept in check, especially with feedstock flexibility, we'll have a chance to rotate to other feeds. In the near term, we recently still find ethane to be the favorite feed. Propane and butane prices have run quite a lot. So they've been really out of the mix. We have been cracking some gas oil and heavies as well. So think about like a barbell slate, light and heavy, but in the middle, we've not been cracking in the U.S. In Europe, because of high LPG prices, we've been cracking that mainly. And co-product values have been pretty good. I mean, Betadine has run well. propylene has come off some, but still at very healthy levels. So overall, propane, butane, I would expect will be out of the mix for most of the winter. And we'll focus on ethane and the heavy end here in the U.S. and naphtha in Europe."

And I actually think that our new capacity in '23 could come on at a time when the market desperately needs more bio and I think it could be absorbed very quickly. So we're very constructive PO next year. Acetyls continues to be strong. Our plant is back up and running as of early October, we're back to running at full rates. And we're enjoying the benefits of a very good market, and we think that will carry well into '22. On oxyfuels, demand is back, but unfortunately, the challenge today is higher butane price. So butane as a percent of crude oil is kind of around 90%. And likely through the winter months, we won't get much relief on that. But next year, as we get into spring and LPG prices moderate after we get through the winter season and the demand should continue to improve and be better as driving improves in Europe and other parts of the world. Think oxyfuels will get back to the typical contribution of $400 million to $450 million annually prior to the new projects starting up.

And that's driven by their own commitments to increase recycled content and packaging. So the entire value chain is pulling, starting with the brand owners, they're pulling more circular products. And I think that will just grow as the years progress. why I think we should read on circularity is that we have a strong technology base in polyolefins. We have polyolefins process technology, catalyst technology. Also, we're developing this Mortech technology, which is the molecular recycling. That pilot plant should be operational in the coming weeks. And I suspect by about March, April, we will know whether we have an investable technology. My sense is that we will -- the question will be to what degree can we get the yields that we want of paralysis oil.

And then if you look further out and you think about operating rates to more fully kind of answer your question, Beyond the couple of new projects that are coming in the U.S. and some pace of capacity in China, it seems to me that polyethylene and polypropylene operating rates likely reach some sort of a bottom in '22 or '23 and steadily increase.

And I'm proud of the employees who stuck through it through thick and thin. There are many, many people here who stayed during the Chapter 11 process and won their company back. And I'm really proud to have been a part of going from where we were back in March 2010 to where we are today. In terms of what's ahead, I think it's really about continuing to capture value from all these growth projects that we've implemented. We've invested around $9 billion in 5 or 6 discrete sort of initiatives, both organic and inorganic. And it provides an incredible runway for earnings growth. So I think it's really just capture the value from the growth that we've been through, continue to lean into circularity, focus on CO2 reduction and be value-minded when it comes to M&A, deep value like we have been and be okay with saying, no, when the deal doesn't make sense. So I think we've built an incredible cash machine here at LyondellBasell."

At least in the near term, that doesn't seem to be as beneficial. What's your view longer term LPG versus naphtha ratio? Where does that go? What does it do to the competitiveness of your business within Europe? And then the second one is, if carbon prices are just structurally going to be higher in Europe, whether that's natural gas or LPG coming in, what does that do to the competitiveness of the European petrochemical business. And should we look to see meaningful reductions in production there maybe over the next 5 years or so on the back of that?"

Both really great questions. on the European LPG competitiveness, I think this will ebb and flow. We've seen periods when LPG became expensive in Europe, we've seen when butane is traded at 45% of crude price. So I think that will continue. Part of the -- part of sort of the lower prices sort of scenario will be when U.S. exports of butane and propane increase has -- there's more oil production associated gas and the NGLs that come with that. So I think having flexibility benefits companies like us because it's so hard to predict what will be favored when. But if you have flexibility, you tend to do well in a range of environments. And I think our company has that both in the U.S. and in Europe. And your second question about competitiveness, in Europe and sort of the carbon initiatives. We there's a lot of legislation being considered. The way I think about it is that, first of all, relative competitiveness is really important. And I think within the region, we have 1 of the most competitive asset bases. We've built that through all of the work we did earlier in the last decade. Over time, you could see regulation that provides for border adjustments or things that will help protect the industrial economy in Europe. I think industrial employment is a very important part of the European economy. And I can't imagine that will just trade away. So I always ask my team to focus on regional competitiveness and make sure that we're at the most competitive end of the cost curve regionally."

Before we begin the discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com/investorrelations.
Today, we will be discussing our business results while making reference to some forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, and the alternative measures are useful to investors. Nonetheless, the forward-looking statements are subject to significant risk and uncertainty. We encourage you to learn more about the factors that could lead our actual results to differ by reviewing the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our regulatory filings, which are also available at our investor website.
Additional documents on our investor website provide reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with other disclosures, including the earnings release. A recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 1:00 p.m. Eastern Time today until November 30, by calling (877) 660-6853 in the United States and (201) 612-7415 outside the United States. The pass code for both numbers is 13723396.
During today's call, we will focus on third quarter results, the current environment, our near-term outlook and provide an update on our growth initiatives. Before turning the call over to Bob, I would like to call your attention to the noncash lower of cost or market inventory adjustments, or LCM, that we have discussed on past calls. These adjustments are related to our use of last in, first out or LIFO accounting and the volatility in prices for our raw material and finished goods inventories.
During the third quarter of 2020, we recognized a noncash impairment of $582 million that reflected our expectation for reduced profitability from our Houston refinery. Comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impacts of the refinery impairment and the LCM inventory adjustments. 
With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Bob."

I'm pleased to join for my 28th and last earnings call as CEO of LyondellBasell. Per our usual practice, we will review our results from the quarter.

Per our usual practice, we will review our results from the quarter. As I prepare to leave the company at the end of the year, I've taken some time to reflect on the strong company we have built and our outlook for the future. Without a doubt, LyondellBasell's future is very bright. 
Because of the efforts of our incredibly talented and hard-working global team, we've built a company that has proven it can perform under a range of conditions.  During an event like a global pandemic, that no one could have predicted or imagined, we were able to fund our dividend with cash from operations and grow our company through accretive M&A. I'm confident that LyondellBasell will continue to deliver for its stakeholders in the future. This is a company that is focused on building value for the long term and one that is built to stand the test of time.
With that said, let's review our third quarter results. Please turn to Slide 3. LyondellBasell's businesses are continuing to benefit from robust global demand and tight market conditions. In the third quarter, our company delivered $5.25 per share of earnings, more than 4x higher than the same quarter last year. EBITDA was approximately $2.7 billion, a year-over-year quarterly improvement of $1.8 billion.
Efficient cash conversion generated $2.1 billion in cash from operating activities, a new quarterly record for our company. These results are indicative of strong markets, the discipline with which we approach running our business and the increased earnings power from our value-driven investments and accretive growth over the past several years. We remain focused on improving LyondellBasell's cash generation through all stages of the business cycle. 
Please turn to Slide 4 to review our quarterly profitability. While our portfolio delivered $2.7 billion of EBITDA, this quarter's results reflect a sequential decline of 11%. Increased costs for natural gas, ethane, naphtha and butane compressed margins for many products from the highs seen in the second quarter. This, however, does not change how we see the future. We continue to see very solid demand for our products and remain highly constructive on the outlook for our businesses as global reopening continues to play out over the coming quarters.
We expect a combination of a well-funded economy and pent-up consumer demand for durable goods as well as the nondurable goods associated with travel, leisure and other in-person activities will continue to underpin attractive markets. In short, we remain confident that a reopening global economy and eventual normalization of global supply chains will support continued growth for our businesses over the coming quarters.
Let's turn to Slide 5 and review our safety performance. Our year-to-date total recordable incident rate for employees and contractors rose to 0.24 during the third quarter. Much of this increase is associated with the tragic incident at our acetyls facility in La Porte, Texas, during July. We remain committed to learning from this incident and incorporating the learnings from the investigations to help prevent such tragedies from ever happening again.
Looking more closely at the chart, we are encouraged by the notable improvement in chemical industry safety performance during 2020. We are watching to see if this is a durable trend or perhaps a onetime benefit from reduced in-person work hours during the height of the pandemic. At LyondellBasell, continuous learning and a self-improving culture are key focus areas in our pursuit of GoalZERO safety performance for both our employees and our contractors.  
On Slide 6, I would like to highlight LyondellBasell's increased commitments to help address the global challenge of climate change. In late September, we announced accelerated targets and a goal to achieve net 0 Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions from our global operations by 2050. We now aim to reduce absolute emissions from our global operations by 30% relative to a 2020 baseline. 
We plan to achieve these goals by advancing progress on several fronts. First, we are improving energy efficiency in all our plants and reducing our need for high carbon content fuel sources, such as coal. We are already moving on this front. In September, we announced our plan to phase out coal from the power plant at our site in Wesseling, Germany.
Second, we intend to procure at least 50% of our electricity from renewable sources by 2030. Third, we are focusing on minimizing flare emissions from our clients, particularly during shutdowns and start-up events. In addition, we're evaluating a portfolio of technology options across the company's manufacturing footprint, including sustainable hydrogen increased electrification and carbon capture for storage or reutilization in our processes.
We believe this strategy puts us on an achievable pathway toward our net 0 goal. In the near term, we do not expect significant increases in our overall capital budget as reduced spending associated with the completion of our PO/TBA project in 2022 will be offset by an increasing share of climate-related investment. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Michael, who will describe our financial and segment results in more detail."

Before I begin, I would like to share my sincere gratitude to Bob for his tireless work, inspirational energy and thought partnership in leading and growing LyondellBasell for nearly 12 years. We are all sad to see you go, Bob, but we will be eagerly watching your progress and wishing you continued success. 
Please turn to Slide 7, and let me begin by highlighting our strong cash generation, which has been bolstered by our recent growth investments. In the third quarter, LyondellBasell generated a record $2.1 billion of cash from operating activities that contributed towards the $5.4 billion of cash generated over the last 12 months. Our free operating cash flow for the third quarter improved by more than 10% relative to the second quarter, and our free operating cash flow yield was 15% over the last 12 months. We expect this chart will continue to improve during the fourth quarter as 2020 results drop off from our trailing performance. 
Let's turn to Slide 8 and review the details of our cash generation and deployment during the third quarter. As I have mentioned during previous calls, we are highly focused on shareholder returns. A strong and progressive dividend plays a fundamental role in our capital deployment strategy. In addition to our dividend, we also resumed share repurchases during the third quarter and reduced our share count by approximately 1 million.
We continue to invest in maintenance and growth projects with more than $500 million in capital expenditures. Strong cash flows supported debt reduction of nearly $700 million, bringing our year-to-date debt reduction to $2.4 billion. We closed the third quarter with cash and liquid investments of $1.9 billion.
In July, S&P Global Ratings recognized the improvement in our balance sheet by upgrading our credit ratings and indicating a stable outlook. During the fourth quarter, we expect that robust cash generation and an anticipated tax refund will enable continued progress on our goal to reduce debt by up to $4 billion during 2021, and further strengthen our investment-grade balance sheet.
After the quarter closed, we repaid an additional $650 million of bonds in late October. We do not foresee the need for additional debt repayment in 2022. Confidence around our deleveraging targets enabled us to resume share repurchases in September, and we continued to opportunistically repurchase shares during October. As of October 22, we have repurchased a total of 1.6 million shares.
Now I would like to highlight the results for each of our segments on Slide 9. In the third quarter of 2021, LyondellBasell's business portfolio delivered EBITDA of $2.7 billion. Our results reflect strong margins supported by robust demand for our products and tight market conditions, offset by higher costs, primarily in our O&P Europe, Asia, international segment and our I&D segment.
Let's begin the individual segment discussions on Slide 10 with the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins - Americas segment. Robust demand drove EBITDA to about $1.6 billion, slightly lower than the second quarter. Olefins results decreased approximately $75 million compared to the second quarter due to lower margins and volumes. Despite relatively stable benchmark ethylene margins, our margins declined as we purchased ethylene to supplement production and meet strong derivative demand. Volumes decreased due to unplanned maintenance, resulting in a cracker operating rate of 89%. 
Polyolefins results increased more than $75 million during the third quarter as robust demand in tight markets drove spreads higher with polyolefin prices increasing slightly more than monomer prices. In fact, our polypropylene spreads reached a historic high. 
We continue to see strong demand for our products as we begin the fourth quarter. However, higher energy and feedstock costs, along with typical seasonality demand softness toward the end of the year are likely to compress margins for our O&P-Americas businesses. 
Now please turn to Slide 11 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia, international segment. Higher feedstock cost and lower seasonal demand during summer holidays reduced margins and volumes in our EAI markets resulting in a third quarter EBITDA of $474 million, $234 million lower than the second quarter. Olefins results declined about $50 million as margins decreased driven by higher feedstock costs despite the higher ethylene and co-product prices. We operated our crackers at a rate of 92% of capacity due to planned maintenance. 
Combined polyolefin results decreased approximately $120 million compared to the prior quarter. Lower seasonal demand drove declines in polyolefin price spreads relative to monomer cost and reduced volumes. Declining polyolefin spreads also affected our joint venture equity income by about $35 million. 
During the fourth quarter, we expect to see further margin declines from higher energy and feedstock costs along with end-of-year seasonality. Our ethylene volumes are expected to decline due to planned maintenance. 
Please turn to Slide 12 as we take a look at our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Rising feedstock and energy costs drove margin declines in most businesses resulted in third quarter EBITDA of $348 million, $248 million lower than the prior quarter. Results were impacted by approximately $25 million due to site closure costs associated with the exit of our ethanol business.
Third quarter propylene oxide and derivatives results decreased about $15 million as margins declined slightly from the historical highs of the second quarter. Durable goods demand remained strong, resulting in increased volumes. Intermediate Chemicals results decreased approximately $140 million. Margins declined in most businesses, primarily styrene and volumes decreased as a result of downtime in our acetyls business. 
Oxyfuels and related products results decreased about $40 million as increased butane feedstock prices more than offset the increased volume from improved gasoline demand. In the fourth quarter, we expect volumes to increase with the restart of our La Porte acetyls facility and continued strength and demand for durable goods. Margins are likely to moderate with fourth quarter seasonality and higher raw material costs for our I&D segment.
Now let's move forward and review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 13. Customer supply chain constraints continue to hinge results with third quarter EBITDA of $121 million, $8 million lower than the second quarter. Compounding and solutions results were relatively unchanged. 
Margins were higher but partially offset by a decrease in volume due to restricted production in downstream markets, including the automotive sector, appliance manufacturing and other industries affected by semiconductor shortages. Advanced Polymer results decreased about $10 million driven by lower margins and volumes primarily due to plant maintenance. We expect results will be similar in the fourth quarter as it will likely take several quarters before supply chain constraints begin to improve. 
Now let's turn to Slide 14 and discuss the results of our Refining segment. Margins improved significantly in the third quarter, resulting in an EBITDA improvement of $122 million to a positive $41 million. In the third quarter, prices for byproducts increased, costs for renewable identification number credits, or RINs, decreased and the Maya 2-11 benchmark increased by $1.65 per barrel to $23.11 per barrel. 
The average crude throughput at the refinery increased to 260,000 barrels per day, an operating rate of 97%. Improved demand from increasing mobility should be supportive for our refining margins and could enable continued profitability during the fourth quarter. 
Let's finish the segment discussion on Slide 15 with the result of our Technology segment. Increased licensing revenue drove third quarter EBITDA to a record $155 million, $63 million higher than the prior quarter. We expect that fourth quarter profitability for our technology business will return to similar quarterly levels as the first half of this year based on the anticipated timing of licensing revenue and catalyst demand. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob."

Please turn to Slide 16 for a summary of the value-driven growth initiatives that our company has developed since 2018. Our approach is to pursue prudent and accretive investments that chart a clear path for increasing EBITDA. In 2018,",960,"Thank you, Michael. Please turn to Slide 16 for a summary of the value-driven growth initiatives that our company has developed since 2018. Our approach is to pursue prudent and accretive investments that chart a clear path for increasing EBITDA. In 2018, we expanded our compounding business by acquiring A. Schulman and forming the Advanced Polymer Solutions segment from both legacy and acquired businesses. 
With integration complete, we have a solid platform for future growth and synergies should become increasingly visible as volumes recover in the markets served by this segment. In the second quarter of 2020, we started a 500,000 ton per year polyethylene plant in Houston, utilizing our next-generation Hyperzone HDPE technology. At full nameplate capacity and average margins from 2017 to 2019, we estimate this asset is capable of generating $170 million of annual EBITDA. 
In September of 2020, we established a new integrated cracker joint venture in Northeastern China. This investment is capable of generating $150 million of annual EBITDA for our company, again based upon full capacity and historical industry margins. 
In December of 2020, we closed the transaction for the integrated polyethylene joint venture in Louisiana. At full capacity and historical margins, this investment is capable of contributing $330 million in EBITDA for our company. In our Intermediates and Derivatives segment, the combination of 2 new propylene oxide investments in China and Houston starting in 2022 and 2023 could together add almost $500 million of annual estimated EBITDA. Taken together, we estimate these initiatives could add up to $1.5 billion of EBITDA to our mid-cycle earnings. 
Slide 17 provides a historical view of LyondellBasell's profitability over the course of the first complete business cycle for our company. Over the period from 2011 to 2019, we delivered a little over an average of $6.5 billion of EBITDA, excluding LCM and impairment. In fact, we reached $8.1 billion in 2015 during my first year as CEO of our company. 
In today's strong market and with many of our growth initiatives providing strong contributions, our last 12-month performance was $8.6 billion, exceeding our previous record and reaching nearly 30% above the historical average. While no 2 cycles are exactly alike, our performance during prior business cycles provides valuable context on how these growth initiatives might perform and reposition LyondellBasell during the next cycle with a larger asset base. 
Let me summarize our view of current conditions and the outlook for our business with Slide 18. In the near to midterm, further progress with vaccination rollouts should continue to support solid demand and margin for our products. With 7 billion doses of vaccines administered worldwide, approximately 1/2 of the world's population has now received at least 1 dose of a COVID vaccine.
New cases in the U.S. have fallen to less than half the level seen during the delta-driven spike of August and September. We are keeping a watchful eye on rising case rates in the U.K. and parts of Europe, but most virus indicators are trending in the favorable direction. 
Over the coming months, margins are expected to face headwinds from typical fourth quarter seasonality and combined with increasing feedstock and energy prices, we anticipate some margin compression, but expect markets to remain relatively strong. Logistics constraints and the pace of vaccination are currently hindering demand. Eventually, consumers will have more options when purchasing a new car, back order furniture will become available, and all of us will find a way to resume traveling, whether for business or leisure.
Pent-up demand is tangible and consumers have ample liquidity to drive purchases of both services and manufactured goods. Monetary stimulus may taper but the unprecedented levels of stimulus deployed during the pandemic will have lasting effects that are typically supportive for commodities. 
Let me close with Slide 19. As I think about the coming weeks and prepare to pass the baton to the next leader of LyondellBasell, I draw comfort from the knowledge that the broader team we have in place is incredibly talented and has created great momentum that will endure for many years. In the end, our assets don't run themselves and decisions don't get made by spreadsheets. I'm confident that this remarkable team will continue to take our company to greater heights. 
Our company has never forgotten our core values built upon safety, reliability and cost efficiency. These attributes form the basis for leading and advantaged positions in our industry. With these strong foundations in place, we are deploying our business model across a larger asset base with embedded growth through projects such as our PO/TBA facility and further expansions of our global joint venture partnerships. 
In tandem with our investment to reduce carbon emissions, we are also building innovative business models that will increase our utilization of plastic waste as a circular feedstock. My belief is that over the next decade, LyondellBasell will become a global market leader in the exciting and rapidly growing market for sustainable plastics.
With strong markets and new sources of EBITDA, our team works diligently to maximize cash conversion and we have taken care to reinvest that hard-earned cash into accretive investments that add value and drive future growth. All of this work is underpinned by a disciplined financial strategy. We stand by our dual commitments to a growing dividend and an investment-grade credit rating through cycles. 
We are confident that we can complete our deleveraging and achieve our target of reducing debt by $4 billion before the end of this year. With strong cash flows and no need for further debt reduction, we expect to continue reinvesting in our company through the opportunistic repurchase of LyondellBasell shares. I hope you share my sincere enthusiasm about the future of our company.
We are now pleased to take your questions."

We had a couple of very atypical unplanned outages that were quite large. First, we had the acetyls unplanned downtime due to the incident we had. At Q3 volumes and margins, the volume lost and Q3 margins, that outage impacted earnings by about $75 million. 
We also had a couple of larger atypical events in O&P Americas at Q3 margins. That lost volume impacted earnings by about $200 million. So we could take 3 or 4 incidents and those outages reduced Q3 by about $275 million. Now there were other kind of normal unplanned outages that we have in any given quarter. But those -- it was quite an unusual quarter in that regards. 
As I think about next year, you said it well. I mean I think there is still a lot of constraints in terms of demand today. We still see a global supply chain that is not operating as smoothly as what we've seen in the past, chip shortages, shipping constraints whether it's high cost for containers or just the ships being in the wrong place. I think -- I believe firmly that, that has impacted exports of finished goods out of China, which have, in turn, reduced demand for plastics in China. 
So as we look into next year, I would expect that by the middle of the year, a lot of these issues should have normalized and we should see more typical global trade patterns and with a stronger durable goods market, especially for auto and appliances, those things that people have not had available to purchase, that should favor polypropylene, probably more differentially than polyethylene. So I think by mid next year, we should see operating rates sustained at over 90% and a lot of these constraints will have relieved themselves."

We turned to profit in Q3 as we mentioned during the prepared remarks. Q4 looks to be stronger than Q3. Of late, what we're seeing with high oil prices, we're seeing more Canadian sour crude coming down to the U.S., which is causing the light-heavy differential to widen. That favors our refinery. And I think that trend could continue for the next quarter at least. 
On the product side, distillate inventories are very low. Distillate cracks have expanded. We're seeing air travel get back to about 80% of pre-COVID levels in the U.S. Miles driven are back to pre-COVID levels now. So all of the trends when you think about demand, like heavy differential, all indicate improvement sequentially from Q3 to Q4. And so we're pleased to be back in the black in refining. 
With regards to the process and the transaction, we're working through the process now, and our aim is to move towards the transaction in the coming quarter or 2. We still continue to believe that the best value for this -- that this refinery can create is by being part of the system where it can be optimized from crude purchasing to logistics, to the coproduct processing. We think that a 270,000 barrel a day refinery in the Houston Ship Channel is well placed and create tons of value as part of the system."

And many of you will recall that I talked about demand being stronger for longer. I still believe that. I think as you go quarter after quarter, all of the market forecasters have underestimated demand growth. And I think that will continue to play out. I mean think about we still have reopening ahead of us. 
There's a lot of buying power in the hand of consumers, highest historic savings rates in the U.S. and in many other regions around the world. You have still accommodative central bank policies, even if tapering starts, still have very low interest rate environment here and abroad. And so much pent-up demand from goods and services that we couldn't access because of shortages or because of limitations on travel.
So I think this sort of scenario of moderating margins is based on continued strong demand and strengthening as reopening really takes hold and some of these supply chain constraints relieve themselves like the chip shortages. When you think about the impact in our compounding business because auto production is low, it's significant. And when those chips are available, we think that our polypropylene business, our PO business and our compounding business will benefit materially from more automotive production.
You asked about what could go wrong. I think in the near term, we'll have to watch energy prices. There could be points where we could see potentially spikes in energy price. But I think sustained high energy prices are unlikely because at some point, they'll be met with more supply. So I think that's what we have to watch. And the other is the picture in China remains a bit murky, and I'll try to address that through the upcoming questions."

So I don't profess to have the exact picture of what could happen, but I'll give you a few of my thoughts about what could happen. In terms of dual controls in the near term, you do see some lowering of petrochemical production. I think ultimately, that will require more imports, which benefits exporting regions like the U.S. whether it's in the I&D business or in the O&P business, I think that's a net positive. 
I think the reduction of coal use will likely turn off some of the CTO complexes requiring more imports of polyethylene and polypropylene favorable for global producers like us. The shipping constraints, I think, have been a net negative in the near term as they've not been producing for exports as much of finished goods. Two reasons. One is they can't get enough containers. Second, because shipping costs, in many cases are 10x when you consider both the sea freight plus the container cost, they're just not able to pass that kind of increase on. 
So I think as that normalizes, I would think that demand should increase in China as they're able to export more finished goods next year. And I think the longer-term outlook is that as there's less coal consumption, it seems to me that the amount of expansion that could take place in China could be less than what we've seen in the past. Certainly, MTO and CTO-based technology or based capacity will likely not be as robust as what we've seen in the last 10 years. So I think there are many bullish aspects to how this could play out. But I think it will be choppy over the next couple of quarters until we get back to something more normal."

And at the same time, we do have feedstock costs that have come up some here in the U.S. 
My sense is on the feedstock side that ethane is very abundant and available and what's setting the price for ethane is natural gas price. And it seems that natural gas prices kind of settled out here in the high $4, $5 per million BTU range. If that's our assumption and of course, we can have a spike here or there. But let's say, we get through the winter in that range and frac spreads are $0.05 to $0.07 a gallon for ethane. I think the cost side is kind of where we are, and there could be some moderation in margin. 15% feels heavy to me. I suspect that it will be something more modest than that."

So the next 4 full years, we expect to be around $2 billion of CapEx. In the back half of the decade as we look to implement technologies like electric furnaces or whatever comes about, we think the CapEx could step up by about $0.5 billion a year in the back half of the decade, so instead of 2%, 2.5% per year, maybe starting in '26.

Let me talk a little bit more broadly about energy prices as context, and then I'll get into the feedstock flexibility both here in Europe. First of all, I mean, as you look at kind of the outlook for oil prices, it's likely that oil prices will be persistently high over the next 2, 3 years. We don't see large IOCs coming back to drill. The independents here are starting to drill more, but the very large companies who have presence in, for example, the Permian, we're not seeing drilling come back. High oil prices are good for LyondellBasell. 
So I think over the long run, there will be plenty of ethane. I think ethane as there's more gas supply with more drilling ethane should be plentiful, gas price should be kept in check, especially with feedstock flexibility, we'll have a chance to rotate to other feeds. In the near term, we recently still find ethane to be the favorite feed. Propane and butane prices have run quite a lot. So they've been really out of the mix. 
We have been cracking some gas oil and heavies as well. So think about like a barbell slate, light and heavy, but in the middle, we've not been cracking in the U.S. In Europe, because of high LPG prices, we've been cracking naphtha mainly. And coproduct values have been pretty good. I mean betadine has run well. propylene has come off some, but still at very healthy levels. So overall, propane, butane, I would expect will be out of the mix for most of the winter. And we'll focus on ethane and the heavy end here in the U.S. and naphtha in Europe."

And I actually think that our new capacity in '23 could come on at a time when the market desperately needs more PO and I think it could be absorbed very quickly. So we're very constructive PO next year. Acetyls continues to be strong. Our plant is back up and running. As of early October, we're back to running at full rates.

But next year, as we get into spring and LPG prices moderate after we get through the winter season and the demand should continue to improve and be better as driving improves in Europe and other parts of the world, think oxyfuels will get back to the typical contribution of $400 million to $450 million annually prior to the new projects starting up. 
Styrene likely mixed. When there are outages, we see styrene get a bump. When everyone runs, styrene is kind of either side of breakeven. But I think the real kind of gems in the portfolio next year will be propylene oxide acetyls and oxyfuel is likely starting in the spring."

But are you -- is that an ethical issue or are you saying that because your customers are demanding it you have these Circulen products. And my question for you is, do you have significant demand for those products now that you can't meet the supply, how long before you might have pyrolysis-based production or renewable feedstock-based production? How far away is this? And is it meaningful?"

The first is the demand side and the second is playing to our strengths. On the demand side, absolutely, our customers are asking for more and more circular products in plastics each year, which the demand that we can't meet. And that's driven by their own commitments to increase recycled content and packaging. So the entire value chain is pulling, starting with the brand owners, they're pulling more circular products. 
And I think that will just grow as the years progress. Why I think we should read on circularity is that we have a strong technology base in polyolefins. We have polyolefins process technology, catalyst technology. Also, we're developing this MoReTec technology, which is the molecular recycling. That pilot plant should be operational in the coming weeks. And I suspect by about March, April, we will know whether we have an investable technology.
My sense is that we will. The question will be to what degree can we get the yields that we want of pyrolysis oil. Our current plan is by end of next year to be in a position to dedicate some of our CapEx to building a MoReTec plant either in the U.S. or in Europe. So I think it plays to our strengths and demand -- the demand pull is there from the brand owners."

So I think probably something around 12, 15 months of much, much lower activity. It has picked up in Q3, more polypropylene than polyethylene and quite a bit of it in China. I think that's a trend that we've seen. Having said that, pickup in demand in -- or activity in Q3, we're still not quite back to 2019 levels. So I think still modest. 
And as you think about where you're going with this question, John, is, what does it mean for supply 3, 4, 5 years out, I do think we're going to find a gap in supply, new supply 3 years from now because those decisions to expand were delayed or paused during the pandemic. And then if you look further out and you think about operating rates to more fully kind of answer your question, beyond the couple of new projects that are coming in the U.S. and some pace of capacity in China, it seems to me that polyethylene and polypropylene operating rates likely reach some sort of a bottom in '22 or '23 and steadily increase. And that bottom is very shallow, if not maybe kind of sideways from where we are today given our outlook on demand. So I think we do see operating rates increase as we move through into the middle of the decade."

On polypropylene, auto was weak, but packaging was quite strong, and we had a lot of kind of medical-related demand. So that held polypropylene. Now as we see auto come back, for our company, we have much more leverage to the auto recovery. If you think about our polypropylene sales to OEMs or Tier 2s plus what goes through compounding plus some of our polyethylene that goes into plastic fuel tanks, our company will benefit immensely from the chip shortage, hopefully alleviating as we go through the next few quarters. 
And I think you'll see that in the APS business, there should be a meaningful step up once we see auto come back. And as a result of all of that, I think PP business will remain tight. It's, frankly, pretty tight today and demand continues to be really strong."

So I think it's really just capture the value from the growth that we've been through, continue to lean into circularity, focus on CO2 reduction and be value-minded when it comes to M&A, deep value like we have been and be okay with saying, no, when the deal doesn't make sense.

Both really great questions. on the European LPG competitiveness, I think this will ebb and flow. We've seen periods when LPG became expensive in Europe, we've seen when butane is traded at 45% of crude price. So I think that will continue. Part of sort of the lower prices sort of scenario will be when U.S. exports of butane and propane increase has -- there's more oil production associated gas and the NGLs that come with that. 
So I think having flexibility benefits companies like us because it's so hard to predict what will be favored when. But if you have flexibility, you tend to do well in a range of environments. And I think our company has that both in the U.S. and in Europe. 
And your second question about competitiveness, in Europe and sort of the carbon initiatives. While there's a lot of legislation being considered, the way I think about it is that, first of all, relative competitiveness is really important. And I think within the region, we have 1 of the most competitive asset bases. We've built that through all of the work we did earlier in the last decade. 
Over time, you could see regulation that provides for border adjustments or things that will help protect the industrial economy in Europe. I think industrial employment is a very important part of the European economy. And I can't imagine that will just trade away. So I always ask my team to focus on regional competitiveness and make sure that we're at the most competitive end of the cost curve regionally."
