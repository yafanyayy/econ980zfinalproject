At Regeneron, we have done all we can to be part of the solution. And we'll spend quite a bit of time today trying to inform you of our efforts. 
On a more general note for the company that despite operating in unprecedented circumstances of a global pandemic, Regeneron delivered strong commercial and financial results while advancing our innovative R&D pipeline and joining the fight against COVID-19. Despite COVID-19, we never lost sight of our focus on the patients who count on us for our innovative medicines and novel medical break fees. For the full year 2020, we grew the top line by 30% and the bottom line by 28%. The with an increasingly diversified set of revenue and earnings streams. In fact, more than 80% of our top line growth came from products and revenues other than EYLEA. EYLEA Global net sales were nearly $8 billion and grew 5% compared to the prior year. In the U.S., sales were close to $5 billion and grew 7% versus the prior year. Rebounding strongly from April lows due to COVID-19 and outperforming the broader anti-VEGF category. EYLEA's efficacy, safety and convenience creates a high bar for current and potential future entries, leaving us confident in its durability for years to come. 
Next, our growth was also fueled by Dupixent, which sold more than $4 billion globally and grew 75% compared to the prior year. In the U.S. alone, more than 1 million prescriptions for Dupixent were written. Only 6% of eligible U.S. patients have been treated with Dupixent to date, leaving much more room to [ grow], with regulatory approvals in atopic dermatitis, asthma and chronic rhino-sinusitis with nasal polyposis and a late-stage development program across 8 additional disease types, Dupixent has the potential to transform the treatment of type 2 inflammatory diseases. 
In oncology, we are pleased that Libtayo remains the #1 treatment in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. In 2020, global net sales were approximately $348 million representing 80% on further market penetration in the U.S. and from launches around the world. 
Beyond Libtayo, we are emerging as a leader in the development of novel bispecific and other antibody treatments. We now have 12 oncology bodies in clinical development. Our ability to create a variety of rational combinations using our velocisuite antibody technologies positions us well to unlock the next wave of innovation in immuno-oncology. 
Regeneron also made strides against the infectious diseases in 2020 with the FDA approval of Inmazeb, a monoclonal antibody cocktail and the first ever treatment for Ebola virus infection. 
But nowhere has the power of R&D teams and technology has been more evident than in the discovery and development of our novel antibody cocktail against COVID-19, known as REGN-COV. In just 10 months, we went from program inception to clinically demonstrating profound antiviral activity as well as reduction of medical visits to receiving an emergency use authorization for REGN-COV in the United States. 
Most recently, we showed promising data that suggest REGN-COV reduces transmission of the virus and prevents infections in patients at high-risk of contracting the virus. 
Importantly, we announced a new supply agreement with the United States government for an additional 1.25 million treatment doses for up to 2.6 billion. Finally, we secured a strategic partnership with Roche to manufacture and commercialize REGN-COV globally. These achievements would not have been possible without decades of investment in our innovative antibody related technologies and our scientific talent who are a continual source of pride. 
Regeneron also completed shareholder-friendly actions in 2020, including restructuring our Praluent agreement with Sanofi and achieving profitability for the brand in the United States. 
We also executed the largest ever United States Healthcare equity offering with Sanofi's stake in our company. We leveraged our strong balance sheet and historically low interest rates to repurchase $5 billion of those shares, immediately reducing uncertainty and creating significant accretion for our shareholders. We are entering 2021 with strong momentum across our entire business. We expect a number of exciting catalysts this year, including a series of important launches for Libtayo in lung cancer and basal cell cancers. Dupixent data readouts and launches and milestones for other products that will further enhance our diversity of earnings and position us for sustained financial growth. 
We are encouraged by the progress we are making against COVID-19 and expect several near-term data readouts for our antibody cocktail that George will outline momentarily. 
Importantly, our pipeline continues to grow and advance across a wide variety of diseases. Our core business momentum, new launches and R&D advances positions Regeneron, to deliver significant and sustained growth for years to come. 
Now I will turn the podium over to George."

While the world -- with the world still in the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic, I will start with our efforts on REGN-COV, our antibody cocktail targeting the SARS-CoV-2 virus. 
Over the last few months, we have achieved several important milestones. On November 21, our antibody cocktail received FDA emergency use authorization for recently diagnosed, mild to moderate COVID-19 in high-risk patients. The EUA was granted based on the initial results in patients from our large study in the non-hospitalized setting. 
In December, we announced encouraging initial REGN-COV results in hospitalized patients on low flow oxygen. With the cocktail treatment successfully passing futility criteria to continue and being associated with the reduction in the risk of death or mechanical ventilation. 
Just last month, we released initial data with REGN-COV in the prevention setting, which showed 100% prevention of symptomatic COVID-19 infections and 100% reduction of the duration of high viral shedding when patients would be expected to be most infectious and capable of transmitting the virus. 
Importantly, these results were achieved using our lower subcutaneous dose, which should simplify 3. We expect important additional readouts over the next few months, in terms of confirmatory Phase III results in the prevention setting, in the outpatient setting, which includes an evaluation of our lower dose and in the hospitalized setting as part of our collaboration with the U.K. recovery study. These upcoming data sets are important for demonstrating efficacy across broader patient populations and supporting regulatory approvals worldwide. 
I want to address the important issue of emerging virus variants, which have dominated the news as they have the potential to evade both natural as well as vaccine derived immunity. We prospectively designed our cocktail with such variants in mind. In fact, as we published in Science Journal back in June, we anticipated the exact mutation that is raising concerns about resistance for the South African and Brazilian variants that have now also been seen in the United States. 
Because of our prospective recognition of the threats of variance,in our intelligent design approach, our current antibody cocktail is active against all these currently known virus variants as was recently independently confirmed multiple prominent academics. 
If needed, we also have a large antibody collection that could be ready to mix and match in new cocktails against potential future vial variants. We, of course, hope that vaccines will efficiently and rapidly create widespread immunity and this immunity will withstand the challenge of time and of emerging variants. However, even if the vaccine successfully provide widespread and long-lasting immunity according to the most optimistic time line, it is estimated that up to hundreds of thousands of individuals may tragically die until we reach that point. 
Moreover, emerging variants are posing a very real threat to both natural and vaccine-derived immunity. Recent data indicate vaccines may already be less than 50% effective against the new variants. With new mutations having the potential to further undermine vaccine immunity. We believe strategic deployment of antibody approaches, such as our REGN-COV antibody cocktail, could be targeted in such a way so as to reduce the loss of life over the next 6 months as well as to provide protection against the possibility of waning, vetting efficacy and ongoing disease prevalence. 
Moving to Dupixent in our immunology and inflammation portfolio. Dupixent is -- Dupixent has multiple trials and new potential indications that are progressing quickly. Most notably, our Phase III trial in eosinophilic esophagitis is now fully enrolled. Recall that we presented encouraging data from Part A of this study last year. 
As we outlined recently, Dupixent is also part of our two-pronged approach against chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, along with [indiscernible], our anti IL-33 antibody. The 2 Dupixent Phase III studies in type 2 COPD are ongoing and enrolling patients. Based on our proof-of-concept Phase II data that will be published later this year, we believe that blocking IL-33 could be useful for treating COPD in former smokers, where we have seen a 40% reduction in exacerbations. We and Sanofi have now started the first Phase III study of etokimab in this subset of COPD patients with a confirmatory Phase III study to begin imminently. 
Our hope for this broad program as Dupixent and etokimab can provide real benefits for the many patients suffering from COPD and with no biologics options to date. 
Dupixent is also part of multiple additional approaches to treat allergic diseases, in particular, in so-called efforts to desensitize individuals from food and inhaled allergens. 
As you know, millions are undergoing allergy desensitization each year, often with unsatisfying results even after years of allergy treatments. I am pleased to announce that the Phase II placebo-controlled trial of pediatric patients with peanut allergy met its primary and key secondary endpoints, showing that Dupixent, in combination with immune therapeutics oral immunotherapy, significantly improved desensitization peanut protein when compared to oral immunotherapy alone. These results, coupled with data later this year from a separate Phase II trial of Dupixent therapy in patients with peanut allergy will inform next steps in this setting and for other forms of allergy desensitization as well. 
We also have additional groundbreaking new approaches to allergy. We have created the first antibody-based therapeutics directed to allergens themselves with the idea that these antibodies can directly bind and neutralize the allergens. Our first 2 anti-allergen antibodies target cat allergy and bird allergy with birds being the major cause of seasonal allergies in the spring. And the therapies may be particularly important for patients with these and other allergies with concomitant asthma since these patients are not candidates for allergy desensitization. 
We will be presenting detailed data from proof-of-concept studies at upcoming meetings, showing that these anti-allergen antibodies have the potential to revolutionize the treatment paradigm. And our first Phase III field study in bird allergy is now open for enrollment and will be conducted throughout the allergy season, with results expected later this year. We are similarly planning a Phase III study in patients suffering from cat allergy to begin later this year. 
Next, I'd like to briefly discuss EYLEA. We appreciate that EYLEA has withstood near it attempts to challenge its leading efficacy and safety profile over the last decade as we have accumulated a real-world experience of over 30 million injections. And it is not clear that any near-term competitors have data suggesting important advantages. We would like to remind you that clinical trials have shown that substantial numbers of patients can be effectively treated at longer intervals with EYLEA. For example, the ALTERA study shows that about 40% of patients can be extended to a 16-week treatment interval. We are now enrolling our Phase III program with high-dose EYLEA, which we hope can deliver the same efficacy and safety to allow even more patients to be extended. 
Moving to our oncology efforts, and starting with Libtayo. In a matter of weeks, assuming positive FDA action, we expect 2 significant label expansions for Libtayo in non-small cell lung cancer and in basal cell carcinoma. Later this year, the independent data safety monitoring committee will be conducting interim analyses for our Libtayo chemotherapy combination study in lung cancer and for a monotherapy study in second-line cervical cancer. We continue to make progress with Libtayo as it is establishing itself as the leading immunotherapy for non-melanoma skin cancers, as we hope to make it a potential major new player in the lung cancer space, as we employ it as a foundational therapy to our oncology strategy for bringing novel combinations to the many cancers that are desperate for new treatments. 
This combination approach has a major focus on our bispecifics portfolio as we are emerging as leaders with both our CD 3 classes bispecifics as well as our so-called co-stim bispecifics. These 2 classes of bispecifics can be paired with each other as well as with Libtayo, and we are exceeding all these combinations and more. We presented update at the American Society of Hematology, or ASH, meeting in December on adrenoxidase, our CD20 by CD 3 bispecific, which continued to show high rates of durable responses in follicular and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. We are working with the update to determine the optimal dosing program protocol designed to further minimize already rare cytokine release syndrome events during the step-up dosing phase of this powerful agent. A subcutaneous formulation is under development as well. 
We also provided updates at ASH on our BCMA by CD3 bispecific for relapsed/refractory myeloma in our pivotal Phase II trial is enrolling well with full enrollment anticipated this year. Phase III trials for this program as well as studies of a subcutaneous formulation, are also on track to start this year as well. 
Our third CD3 bispecific in the clinic, REGN4018, our MUC16xCD3 bispecific continues in dose escalation trials for ovarian cancer where we are observing early efficacy signals. 
Our co-stim bispecifics are also progressing. Notably, our trial for our MUC16xCD28 co-stimulatory bispecific has just dosed its first patient and will continue in combination with Libtayo. Later this year, it will also be combined in patients with our MUC16xCD3 bispecific, making it our first clinical pairing of CD3 in co-stim bispecifics, which we will provide for a game-changing and generalizable approach to solid as well as hematologic tumors. 
Regarding the latter, we will soon be initiating trials of a co-stim bispecific to be paired with our CD20XCD3 bispecific for lymphoma. And later this year, of a different co-stim bispecific to be paired with our BCMAxCD3 bispecific in myeloma. Our PCMA co-stim bispecific is progressing in dose escalation trials with Libtayo for patients with prostate cancer. And we also have a costim targeting the EGF receptor that will allow for a variety of novel combinations as well. 
These combination programs pairing bispecs with each other and with our anti-PD-1 as the potential synergistically unleash the power of immuno-oncology more broadly than currently approved treatments. And thus, there is a lot of interest in the timing of the data releases from these early combination programs. We hope you appreciate the requirement for careful and deliberate dose escalation trials to ensure patient safety as these drugs are designed to activate patients' immune systems and involve novel and powerful pathways. Hence, while early results or top line data announcements are possible in 2021, readouts are equally possible to occur in 2022. 
Beyond oncology, I would like to highlight that next week, we expect approval for evinacumab, now known as [indiscernible] for homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. If approved, this addition to our portfolio builds upon our cardiometabolic expertise and has the potential to help patients suffering from this rare disease. 
Before I finish, I'd like to highlight that we continue to invest in our world-leading human sequencing efforts at the Regeneron Genetics Center, which is pivotal to identifying and validating targets for our new Genetics Medicines initiative, which we believe could be transformational not only for Regeneron, but for our entire industry and already involves important collaborations with partners such as Alnylam, Intellia, Decibel, Bluebird and others. 
To conclude, in 2020, we and our partners have introduced 9 new investigational therapies into the clinic, submitted marketing applications for 6 new indications and secured 2 new drug approvals or authorizations. We are proud of the remarkable accomplishments our Regeneron team has achieved in a difficult year, and we thank our many investigators and patients who have been essential to helping us with these accomplishments. 
With that, I'd like to turn it over to Marion."
33715,701650850,2194301,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2021",2021-02-05,"Earnings Calls","Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, George.

Our 2020 results, coupled with near-term launch opportunities posi",950,"Thank you, George. We ended 2020 with positive momentum across our commercial portfolio as our core products, EYLEA, Dupixent and Libtayo dealered strong performance in the fourth quarter. Our 2020 results, coupled with near-term launch opportunities position us for continued diversified growth in 2021. 
Beginning with EYLEA. Fourth quarter global net sales grew 10% year-over-year to $2.2 billion. As we reported last month, U.S. EYLEA net sales grew 10% year-over-year to $1.34 billion, the highest reported net sales since EYLEA's launch. EYLEA, again, outperformed the category with share gains from both branded and unbranded competition. EYLEA share of the branded category approached 75% for the quarter and EYLEA remains the #1 prescribed anti-VEGF therapy overall in wet AMD and diabetic eye disease. While volume in the overall anti-VEGF category declined in 2020, EYLEA was the only product in the category to grow. Patient volumes are now normalizing, EYLEA sets a high bar on efficacy, safety, dosing flexibility and real-world experience for current and future competition. The anti-VEGF category continues to be supported by the aging population and increasing prevalence of diabetes, realizing the full potential in diabetic eye disease remains a key initiative, representing a significant growth opportunity for EYLEA and is largely unpenetrated. We intend to initiate a direct-to-consumer campaign to create awareness for patients on the importance of vision care as part of managing their diabetes. 
In summary, EYLEA had an impressive quarter, and we remain confident in its outlook. Next, we recorded $146 million for our antibody cocktail REGN-COV in the fourth quarter where appropriate, we are deploying commercial efforts under the EUA to improve availability for this important treatment against COVID-19 for at-risk patients. We are indeed with all stakeholders to reduce bottlenecks and drive utilization rates higher. Regeneron is working to educate stakeholders, including patients on the urgency to treat at risk nonhospitalized patients within 10 days of receiving a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. Initiatives to reduce administrative burden and direct patients to treatment centers are beginning to yield encouraging results. Physicians using REGN-COV are providing very positive feedback on treatment results. 
Let me also briefly discuss another new medicine, evinacumab brand name Optiva. We're prepared for the February 11 PDUFA date for Optiva for the treatment of HOFH, a rare disease that affects approximately 1,300 patients in the U.S. There's high unmet need for these patients with this rare genetic condition as they struggle to keep their LDL-cholesterol levels under control. These patients face an increased risk of premature heart disease as early as 13 age years. We are leveraging our cardiometabolic expertise and existing commercial platform to drive take in this rare disease category. 
Turning now to Libtayo, where fourth quarter global net sales grew to $97 million, in the U.S., net sales were $74 million, driven by steady volume growth in advanced CSCC. We are nearing the potential approval of 2 additional indications for Libtayo in basal cell carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer both of which received priority reviews and have upcoming PDUFA dates. Our teams are eager and ready to launch once approved. 
For basal cell carcinoma, there are no FDA-approved treatment options once the patient progresses on or becomes intolerant to hedgehog inhibitors. Just as we did with CSCC, we will work to establish Libtayo as the standard of care in appropriate BCC patients. 
We also look forward to competing in non-small cell lung cancer where there's a large opportunity among patients with PD-L1 expression at least 50%. Libtayo has a favorable product profile, and a growing majority of treatment centers in oncologists have experienced using Libtayo in their CSCC patients. Physicians prefer choice and recent market research shows that nearly 2/3 of physicians are highly motivated to evaluate Libtayo for their lung cancer patients if approved. 
Additionally, we've built a highly experienced commercialization team with a significant launch experience with this class. If approved, we aim to rapidly increase market awareness of Libtayo as a compelling new anti-PD-1 monotherapy treatment option. 
Finally, moving to Dupixent. And global net sales in the fourth quarter were $1.17 billion, representing 56% growth compared to the prior year. In the U.S., broad-based growth across all approved indications [indiscernible] to net sales of $926 million. We continue to see strong prescription trends across all approved indications and weekly new patient shares have recently eclipsed pre-pandemic levels. 
Atopic dermatitis, the largest indication is a significant driver on Dupixent's rapid onset proven efficacy and well-established safety profile. Physicians continue to expand prescribing across both moderate and severe disease and in younger populations where safety is paramount. Despite the impressive launch growth trajectory, there remains significant opportunity as only a small percentage of the over 2 million biologic eligible patients in the U.S. have been prescribed Dupixent. 
Our initiatives aim to grow new patient starts as there is substantial opportunity for many more patients to benefit and support patients already on Dupixent to continue their treatment. 
Moving to asthma, Dupixent is performing well in this competitive market-based on its clinical efficacy and safety profile, which is compelling and differentiated to prescribers. Our market expansion efforts supporting HCPs and patients, including DTC, continue to have a meaningful impact on new initiations, and launch preparations are underway in pediatric -- in the pediatric asthma setting. 
For chronic [indiscernible] with nasal polyps, we see healthy demand and continued strong prescribing trends among ENTs and allergists. Dupixent is core to our diversified growth strategy where there remains substantial opportunity for future expansion. 
In closing, we ended 2020 with momentum, delivering strong performance across our business. With several near-term launches ahead, we have important opportunities to strengthen our thriving commercial portfolio and capitalize on growth. 
Now I'll turn the call to Bob."
33715,701650850,2194301,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2021",2021-02-05,"Earnings Calls","Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marion, and good morning and good afternoon, everybody.

My comments today on financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis where applicable. For the fourth quarter of 2020, Regeneron delivered again double-digit broad-based top and bottom line growth. Our revenue streams continue to diversify with significant growth attributions from Dupixent and REGN-COV as we invest in our best-in-class pipeline for sustained future growth. 
For the fourth quarter, total revenue grew 30% year-over-year to $2.4 billion driven by growth in U.S. EYLEA sales; higher collaboration revenues from our partners, Sanofi and Bayer; and sales of our REGN-COV antibody cocktail. Diluted net income per share grew 27% year-over-year to $9.53 on net income of $1.1 billion. 
Since Marion discussed our U.S. EYLEA results, I will start with our Bayer and Sanofi collaborations. Starting with the Bayer collaboration. Ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales reported to us by Bayer were $859 million for the fourth quarter of 2020, representing growth of 10% on a reported basis compared to the prior year. 
Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $361 million, of which we recorded $335 million for our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S. Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $317 million in the fourth quarter. Our share of the profits from the commercialization of non IO antibodies was $230 million, which compares favorably to profits of $104 million in the prior year. This growth was primarily driven by higher Dupixent profits. 
Other revenue increased to $123 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $96 million in the prior year. The primary driver is the recognition of $42 million from the U.S. government associated with reimbursements of REGN-COV development. As we said on the third quarter call, this line item continues to trend lower due to the wind down of development reimbursements from the U.S. government. 
In 2021, we expect to record approximately half of the $557 million recorded in other revenue for full year 2020. 
Moving on to our operating expenses. And starting with R&D. R&D increased 50% year-over-year to $675 million, primarily due to continued clinical development costs for our REGN-COV antibody cocktail and higher headcount to support our expanding pipeline. 
Next, SG&A expense increased 22% year-over-year to $381 million. The year-over-year increase was largely driven by increased headcount launch preparations for Libtayo and continued investments for growth in EYLEA. 
Cost of goods sold increased 79% from the prior year from $93 million to $166 million due to sales of REGN-COV and Praluent in the U.S. Cost of collaboration and contract manufacturing was $174 million compared to $113 million in the fourth quarter 2019, primarily due to increased sales of Dupixent. 
Additionally, in other operating income and expense, we recorded $145 million of income in the fourth quarter of 2020. This includes approximately $100 million of income related to higher recognition of upfront and milestone payments previously received from our collaborators with Sanofi, Teva and Mitsubishi Tanabe. 
Finally, in other income and expense, we recorded $2 million of expense compared to $25 million of income in the fourth quarter of 2019. This is driven by interest expense related to our $2 billion debt issuance in August 2020 and lower investment returns on our existing cash and marketable securities. 
Turning now to taxes. The effective tax rate was 7.7% in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to 10.6% in the fourth quarter of 2019. 
Shifting now to cash flow and the balance sheet. Full year 2020 Regeneron generated $2 billion in free cash flow and ended the year with cash and marketable securities less long-term debt of $4.7 billion. We also exhausted our inaugural $1 billion share repurchase program in the fourth quarter. As a result of our strong balance sheet and confidence in the growth trajectory of our business, we are announcing a new Board-authorized share repurchase program of $1.5 billion. This program is consistent with our capital allocation priorities of funding our broad R&D pipeline, investing in enabling and synergizing R&D business development opportunities and returning cash to our shareholders. 
With this new authorization, we will continue to be opportunistic buyers where we see dislocation between our stock price and our intrinsic valuation. Having reviewed our fourth quarter performance, I'd like to take some time to discuss the 2021 financial outlook. 
Starting with R&D guidance. We forecast our 2021 R&D expense to be in the range of $2.70 billion to $2.85 billion. We are continuing to advance programs in our diverse R&D portfolio with up to 7 INDs to enter the clinic in 2021, of which 6 were discovered in-house. This is in addition to INDs that entered the clinic in 2020, which George mentioned. 
Included in our R&D guidance and based on current plans, we expect to spend between $275 million and $350 million on the REGN-COV development program. We expect most of this REGN-COV spend to occur in the first half of the year. 
Next, we forecast our 2021 SG&A expense to be in the range of $1.50 billion to $1.63 billion, we continue to invest in multiple launches in 2021, including 2 new indications for Libtayo and efforts for REGN-COV. Also, as you heard from Marion, this increased spending will also be driven by a DTC campaign for EYLEA as we continue to see significant growth opportunity in diabetic eye disease. 
Next, we expect our 2021 chronic gross margin on a percentage of net product sales that we record to be between 87% and 89%. We expect 2021 cost of collaboration manufacturing to be in the range of $670 million to $750 million driven by continued growth in our Dupixent franchise. We forecast 2021 operating income and expense to be income of $150 million to $175 million. 
Finally, we expect our '21 non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 12% to 14%, inclusive of REGN-COV sales in the U.S., which are taxed at the U.S. statutory rate. 
I'd also like to review our current supply agreements with the U.S. government for REGN-COV. We expect to recognize the remainder of the $466 million initial U.S. government contract in the first quarter of 2021. 
We also announced last month a new agreement with the U.S. government for additional doses of REGN-COV. Right now, we expect to deliver approximately 750,000 doses by the agreed delivery date of June 30 this year at the contracted price of $2,100 per dose with the vast majority of these deliveries occurring in the second quarter. 
As George mentioned earlier, we are evaluating a lower 1.2 gram dose for REGN-COV. Should this lower treatment dose receive emergency use authorization or approval of the FDA, we aim to deliver up to 1.25 million doses by June 30, which is the maximum quantity that is authorized for purchase by the U.S. government under the supply agreement. 
Importantly, if the lower dose is approved, the pricing per dose does not change. Our ability to fulfill these finished doses is predicated on continued success in the manufacture of both product and access to third-party fill/finish capacity, which is under heavy demand from COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers. 
In conclusion, we are well positioned for significant growth with durable core products. Multiple near-term launches in specialized growth opportunities while investing in our R&D engine to drive sustainable long-term growth. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Justin."

There's been a lot of progress on both ends there. On the bottom end of the funnel, they have been best practices emerging, where people have linked directly no record algorithms to positive patients asking their doctor if they want to get a console to administer the cocktail, and they've administered lots and lots of doses of monoclonal antibodies. And there are these best practices are emerging around the country. On the top end, there is still some skepticism that the data is incomplete, that the data isn't robust enough. And we certainly would agree, we don't have the normal data standards that you might have for a full FDA approval, but we remind everybody that we are in the midst of a pandemic where thousands, hundreds of thousands of people are going to die and have died. And sometimes 1 has to look at the totality of the evidence and make decisions in that regard. So we continue on the top end education and the logistics on the bottom end.

I think that for patients with atopic dermatitis, there had been so little for so long that over the course of several years now, where Dupixent has been in the marketplace, the amazing efficacy, the safety profile, the convenience of use is something that has required a lot of market education and a lot of market understanding. And across the indications that we have in the U.S. today, there are about 2 million, 2.2 million actually eligible patients and only about 6% are getting treatment today. So while favorable results in the understanding of Dupixent with dermatologists, allergists, all of our prescribers and obviously in asthma, now with pulmonologists and allergists, for nasal polyps with the ENTs as well. This is a remarkable alternative across type 2 disease for approved indications today. But there's a lot of unmet need.

And so people think, oh, a pill, it's less serious and I think we have to do a lot of education to explain that these biologicals are actually more targeted, more natural, they can be a lot safer and go, they're more powerful, you don't have to think of them as more serious in a negative way. So I think there's a huge legacy of thinking of things like that, but the emerging data that's coming out now is going to help, I think, with these points that if you're suffering from a disease like atopic dermatitis, you want to be on a natural approach, targeted biological, something that has an exquisite safety profile like Dupixent."

I think that we're very excited about our entire allergy portfolio because we really think we have a collection of powerful but also groundbreaking new approaches. So as we all know, so many people, millions in the United States are taking, for example, multiple shots weekly to try to get desensitized or undergo these very long, prolonged oral approaches and so forth. Often with unsatisfying results even after years of [indiscernible]. So I think it's exciting as we announced that we were able to demonstrate a significant improvement in the amount of peanut tolerization that could occur in conjunction with the immune oral immunization, oral desensitization approach. And we think that this is going to prove to be generalizable across the board to many of these desensitization approaches where we hope that Dupixent will aid in making patients more desensitized, may be able to tolerate these regimens better as well as maybe improve more quickly. And that's one component of our allergy program. We're equally excited about a somewhat unrelated effort where we're the first people who are moving into the clinic antibodies is directly bind and neutralize allergens. I for one don't understand why this hasn't been done before. But our data, some of which we have talked about publicly and even published and some of which we will be presenting at upcoming meetings show that these are very powerful approaches from the first injection, almost at the first time measures, we're getting the sorts of improvements that you see cross studies resulting after years of desensitization therapy. And we're talking about 2 of the most important allergies, which are both associated with asthma in which settings because of safety concerns, desensitization approaches are not indicated. That is cat allergy and bird allergy. The results are really striking. We think this is an entirely new way to fight allergy, one in which you can almost see the benefit immediately. 
Once again, it's a very natural and biologic and targeted approach. There are millions of people who are affected by these. And I think knowing many of them having -- many of them in my family. I can tell you that they would -- if we really continue to show the sort of safety and efficacy that the initial studies are showing, I think a lot of people would welcome the opportunity to take the shot and have immediate benefit in terms of their serious allergies, and it's an entirely new approach. And all of these things are synergistic, of course. We can imagine many ways in which we can be combining and mixing and matching various parts of our portfolio, including things like Dupixent in these anti agents but with other approaches as well. So we really think that we may be at the door of a whole new era, a biologics approach to treating allergy, which I think can really change everything for so many people. And we know that according to the CDC, allergic diseases are now approaching and increasing in epidemic proportion. So there's a real need out there, and there's a real need for totally new approaches. And so we're very excited about them."

I remember, and it may have been you, but it probably was somebody else who asked us the question, why were we even bothering with Libtayo in non-small cell lung cancer because by the time you get it approved, there will be 10 others that are there. And I remember George answering that question saying, well, he's not so sure that there'll be 10 others. All antibodies aren't created equal, plus it would be a foundation for the rest of our business. And that wisdom has really panned out because if you look almost every day, there's another failure of a PD-L1 or inferior PD-1, it doesn't combine, right, all sorts of things. And there really is only 1 right now, 1 gold standard, which is KEYTRUDA. And obviously, we don't have any head-to-head data. But when you look at our data, it's really impressive data. And so we think that we should remind everybody that the questions that we got 5 or 10 years ago, why bother have sort of panned out more the way George had anticipated rather than maybe everybody else had.

I think George touched on it, but let me deal specifically as best we can for the product you referenced from Roche, which is a combination of anti-VEGF and anti ANG2. I might start out by saying, we have the greatest respect for Roche. Genentech, the group, we partner with them in our COVID global efforts, and we watch them really establish the anti-VEGF class with Lucentis. So we have tremendous respect for them. 
But I think when it comes to ANG2, history is a very important lesson here in that I was with George. I remember it, we were tracking, I was with George when one of his colleagues, they were working so hard to identify, purify and clone and sequence, this really important molecule that was seem to be a critical player in blood vessel formation and development, et cetera, and maybe the only real other critical factor other than VEGF. So George and his group discovered this molecule, and nobody would like to see it bear fruit in terms of the treatment. But the data that we have just don't support that. Our data, we look very carefully, we could not find the benefit of adding ANG2 to the amazing effect get with a highly potent anti-VEGF compound such as EYLEA. So when we look at the data you referred to, it's -- we haven't seen all the data, and we'll all look for it. But from what they've disclosed, somewhere in the 40s percent to be able to get to a 16-week regimen is what George referred to is exactly what EYLEA gets in the study. 
So we don't see so far any evidence, we'll look at the data. There's anything more there than high dose anti-VEGF therapy higher than Lucentis on a molar basis. And so we'll have to wait and see. But 1 has to remember also that safety George mentioned, we have 30 million injections under belt. That's a tremendous safety database. And you can see what happens that. There's been a reminder out there, just how important the safety side of this is. So we'll see. We have great respect for them, but we don't see any data right now to suggest ANG2 blockade is playing any differentiated role if any role at all. I don't know, George, if the discovery in ANG2, you want to comment further?"

As Len said, we discovered the entire family of the angiopoetin and we obviously made the first, and we think the best antibodies to get these factors. We tried them in combination studies. I think that there is no evidence at all for any of the faricimab data that there's any additional benefit vis-à-vis mechanism of action of the combined blockade of the angio potent 2. I think that it's sort of a regulatory trick to try to create a differentiated molecule, put both activities within one. We think it's a better, more convincing, frankly, safer approach to actually test, both blocking agents separately rather than combining them 1 molecule when there's no benefit other than pure regulatory tricks for combining them into 1 molecule. The way we think that the data looks right now, it looks as if this is nearly high dose Lucentis and the data that they've at least reported to date suggest similar data to what we see right now currently with EYLEA. As Len mentioned, we have studies that show that up to 40% of patients can achieve 16-week dosing. I think the important add on to it is, of course, is that we have our upcoming studies with high-dose EYLEA. 
So basically, what people are doing, they're taking other molecules, which didn't fare as well, and they're high dosing them, okay? We're taking EYLEA, and we're a high dosing it. And it's already starting at a place where it's duration and its efficacy and its safety seem to be leading with really no evidence that the competition has anything significantly different but now we're testing the higher dose to see whether we can make EYLEA even better while still delivering the same safety and efficacy. So we're pretty excited about that. 
And as I said, we see there's no evidence that any of the competitors are providing anything different at this point."

So as we've shown in some very high profile, papers and science translational. Basically, nature uses activate T cells to do their job, particularly, for example, to kill cells, they need signal 1 through the T cell receptor itself, which is a CD 3 is an important component of that. But they also need signal 2, which some people refer to as a co-stimulatory signal. And so by combining bispecifics that involve CD3 engagement and bispecifics that involve CD28 or cost inventory engagement you are simultaneously activating both signal 1 and signal 2. And we have shown rather compellingly in preclinical models. That this really accentuates and really dramatically increases the ability of T cells to kill the target itself. 
Let me we also remind you that the PD-1 and other checkpoint inhibitors provide a break. So you have signal 1 and signal 2, which are driving the cells to kill and then you can have a brake signal that acts through checkpoints such as PD-1. So combining all 3 or combining them in pair-wise faction, in [indiscernible] shows that you can just increase the amount of tumor-killing that you get us compared with having just one of the approaches. So we're just trying to understand what nature does and how nature optimizes the process and then mimic it with these natural approaches to biologics that can activate in a targeted fashion only on the tumor target cells, depending on how well the targeting is, signal 1, signal 2 while releasing the break. 
So the preclinical data is pretty compelling, and we can only hope that we approach it with what we're going to see in the clinic. And we do think that over the next year, it's going to be very interesting to see how these dose escalation trials play out."

But to your comment, what I hear about time coming from our physician prescribers and key opinion leaders is the remarkable safety profile based on a very specific mechanism of action and that confidence in being able to treat not only adults, but now the younger age groups where we have indications, for example, in atopic dermatitis not only for adolescent pediatric patients down to 6 years of age."

So I think that gradually with more confidence they're going to treat people who are on the more moderate side of things. That said, I think the point that the efficacy profile, but also the mechanism of action. The fact that you are probably in the long term, may be benefiting the patient in terms of slowing or preventing the ultimate atopic March that occurs in so many patients, demands that we figure out a way to take this product to earlier patients. Those will, however, require additional studies. We're trying to figure out the best way to do it, but I for one use it, for example, many more patients with much milder asthma or other mild forms of type 2 disease that we know in many patients is just going to get worse over time. We own these patients. We have to figure out through a clinical program, how to do the right studies, how to convince the FDA and how to move this treatment back towards these earlier patients."

At Regeneron, we have done all we can to be part of the solution. And we'll spend quite a bit of time today trying to inform you of our efforts.  
On a more general note for the company that despite operating in unprecedented circumstances of a global pandemic, Regeneron delivered strong commercial and financial results while advancing our innovative R&D pipeline and joining the fight against COVID-19. Despite COVID-19, we never lost sight of our focus on the patients who count on us for our innovative medicines and novel medical break fees. 
For the full year 2020, we grew the top line by 30% and the bottom line by 28% with an increasingly diversified set of revenue and earnings streams. In fact, more than 80% of our top line growth came from products and revenues other than EYLEA. 
EYLEA global net sales were nearly $8 billion and grew 5% compared to the prior year. In the U.S., sales were close to $5 billion and grew 7% versus the prior year, rebounding strongly from April lows due to COVID-19 and outperforming the broader anti-VEGF category. EYLEA's efficacy, safety and convenience creates a high bar for current and potential future entries, leaving us confident in its durability for years to come.  
Next, our growth was also fueled by Dupixent, which sold more than $4 billion globally and grew 75% compared to the prior year. In the U.S. alone, more than 1 million prescriptions for Dupixent were written. Only 6% of eligible U.S. patients have been treated with Dupixent to date, leaving much more room to grow. With regulatory approvals in atopic dermatitis, asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis and a late-stage development program across 8 additional disease types, Dupixent has the potential to transform the treatment of type 2 inflammatory diseases.  
In oncology, we are pleased that Libtayo remains the #1 treatment in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. In 2020, global net sales were approximately $348 million, representing growth of 80% on further market penetration in the U.S. and from launches around the world.  
Beyond Libtayo, we are emerging as a leader in the development of novel bispecific and other antibody treatments. We now have 12 oncology bodies in clinical development. Our ability to create a variety of rational combinations using our VelociSuite antibody technologies positions us well to unlock the next wave of innovation in immuno-oncology.  
Regeneron also made strides against the infectious diseases in 2020 with the FDA approval of Inmazeb, a monoclonal antibody cocktail and the first ever treatment for Ebola virus infection. But nowhere has the power of R&D teams and technology has been more evident than in the discovery and development of our novel antibody cocktail against COVID-19, known as REGEN-COV. In just 10 months, we went from program inception to clinically demonstrating profound antiviral activity as well as reduction of medical visits, to receiving an emergency use authorization for REGEN-COV in the United States. Most recently, we showed promising data that suggests REGEN-COV reduces transmission of the virus and prevents infections in patients at high risk of contracting the virus.  
Importantly, we announced a new supply agreement with the United States government for an additional 1.25 million treatment doses for up to $2.6 billion. Finally, we secured a strategic partnership with Roche to manufacture and commercialize REGEN-COV globally. These achievements would not have been possible without decades of investment in our innovative antibody-related technologies and our scientific talent, who are a continual source of pride.  
Regeneron also completed shareholder-friendly actions in 2020, including restructuring our Praluent agreement with Sanofi and achieving profitability for the brand in the United States. We also executed the largest-ever United States health care equity offering with Sanofi's stake in our company. We leveraged our strong balance sheet and historically low interest rates to repurchase $5 billion of those shares, immediately reducing uncertainty and creating significant accretion for our shareholders. 
We are entering 2021 with strong momentum across our entire business. We expect a number of exciting catalysts this year, including a series of important launches for Libtayo in lung cancer and basal cell cancers; Dupixent data readouts and launches; and milestones for other products that will further enhance our diversity of earnings and position us for sustained financial growth. 
We are encouraged by the progress we are making against COVID-19 and expect several near-term data readouts for our antibody cocktail that George will outline momentarily. Importantly, our pipeline continues to grow and advance across a wide variety of diseases. Our core business momentum, new launches and R&D advances positions Regeneron, to deliver significant and sustained growth for years to come.  
Now I will turn the podium over to George."

While the world -- with the world still in the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic, I will start with our efforts on REGEN-COV, our antibody cocktail targeting the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Over the last few months, we have achieved several important milestones. 
On November 21, our antibody cocktail received FDA emergency use authorization for recently diagnosed, mild to moderate COVID-19 in high-risk patients. The EUA was granted based on the initial results in patients from our large study in the non-hospitalized setting.  
In December, we announced encouraging initial REGEN-COV results in hospitalized patients on low flow oxygen, with the cocktail treatment successfully passing futility criteria to continue and being associated with the reduction in the risk of death or mechanical ventilation.  
Just last month, we released initial data with REGEN-COV in the prevention setting, which showed 100% prevention of symptomatic COVID-19 infections and 100% reduction of the duration of high viral shedding, when patients would be expected to be most infectious and capable of transmitting the virus.  
Importantly, these results were achieved using our lower subcutaneous dose, which should simplify delivery. We expect important additional readouts over the next few months in terms of confirmatory Phase III results in the prevention setting; in the outpatient setting, which includes an evaluation of our lower dose; and in the hospitalized setting as part of our collaboration with the U.K. RECOVERY study. These upcoming data sets are important for demonstrating efficacy across broader patient populations and supporting regulatory approvals worldwide.  
I want to address the important issue of emerging virus variants which have dominated the news as they have the potential to evade both natural as well as vaccine-derived immunity. We had prospectively designed our cocktail with such variants in mind. In fact, as we published in Science Journal back in June, we anticipated the exact mutation that is raising concerns about resistance for the South African and Brazilian variants that have now also been seen in the United States. Because of our prospective recognition of the threats of variants in our intelligent design approach, our current antibody cocktail is active against all these currently known virus variants as was recently independently confirmed multiple prominent academics. If needed, we also have a large antibody collection that could be ready to mix and match in new cocktails against potential future viral variants. 
We of course hope that vaccines will efficiently and rapidly create widespread immunity and this immunity will withstand the challenge of time and of emerging variants. However, even if the vaccine successfully provide widespread and long-lasting immunity according to the most optimistic time line, it is estimated that up to hundreds of thousands of individuals may tragically die until we reach that point. Moreover, emerging variants are posing a very real threat to both natural and vaccine-derived immunity. Recent data indicate vaccines may already be less than 50% effective against the new variants, with new mutations having the potential to further undermine vaccine immunity. 
We believe strategic deployment of antibody approaches, such as our REGEN-COV antibody cocktail, could be targeted in such a way so as to reduce the loss of life over the next 6 months as well as to provide protection against the possibility of waning vaccine efficacy and ongoing disease prevalence.  
Moving to Dupixent in our immunology and inflammation portfolio. Dupixent is a new -- Dupixent has multiple trials and new potential indications that are progressing quickly. Most notably, our Phase III trial in eosinophilic esophagitis is now fully enrolled. Recall that we presented encouraging data from Part A of this study last year.  
As we outlined recently, Dupixent is also part of our two-pronged approach against chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, along with itepekimab, our anti IL-33 antibody. The 2 Dupixent Phase III studies in type 2 COPD are ongoing and enrolling patients. Based on our proof-of-concept Phase II data that will be published later this year, we believe that blocking IL-33 could be useful for treating COPD in former smokers, where we have seen a 40% reduction in exacerbations. 
We and Sanofi have now started the first Phase III study of itepekimab in this subset of COPD patients with a confirmatory Phase III study to begin imminently. Our hope for this broad program is that Dupixent and itepekimab can provide real benefit for the many patients suffering from COPD and with no biologics options to date.  
Dupixent is also part of multiple additional approaches to treat allergic diseases, in particular, in so-called efforts to desensitize individuals from food and inhaled allergens. As you know, millions are undergoing allergy desensitization each year, often with unsatisfying results even after years of allergy treatments. I am pleased to announce that the Phase II placebo-controlled trial of pediatric patients with peanut allergy met its primary and key secondary endpoints, showing that Dupixent, in combination with Aimmune Therapeutics' oral immunotherapy, significantly improved desensitization to peanut protein when compared to oral immunotherapy alone. These results, coupled with data later this year from a separate Phase II trial of Dupixent therapy in patients with peanut allergy, will inform next steps in this setting and for other forms of allergy desensitization as well.  
We also have additional groundbreaking new approaches to allergy. We have created the first antibody-based therapeutics directed to allergens themselves with the idea that these antibodies can directly bind and neutralize the allergens. Our first 2 anti-allergy antibodies target cat allergy and birch allergy with birch being the major cause of seasonal allergies in the spring. And the therapies may be particularly important for patients with these and other allergies with concomitant asthma since these patients are not candidates for allergy desensitization.  
We will be presenting detailed data from proof-of-concept studies at upcoming meetings showing that these anti-allergen antibodies have the potential to revolutionize the treatment paradigm. And our first Phase III field study in birch allergy is now open for enrollment and will be conducted throughout the allergy season, with results expected later this year. We are similarly planning a Phase III study in patients suffering from cat allergy to begin later this year.  
Next, I'd like to briefly discuss EYLEA. We appreciate that EYLEA has withstood myriad attempts to challenge its leading efficacy and safety profile over the last decade as we have accumulated a real-world experience of over 30 million injections. And it is not clear that any near-term competitors have data suggesting important advantages. We would like to remind you that clinical trials have shown that substantial numbers of patients can be effectively treated at longer intervals with EYLEA. For example, the ALTAIR study shows that about 40% of patients can be extended to a 16-week treatment interval. We are now enrolling our Phase III program with high-dose EYLEA, which we hope can deliver the same efficacy and safety to allow even more patients to be extended.  
Moving to our oncology efforts, and starting with Libtayo. In a matter of weeks, assuming positive FDA action, we expect 2 significant label expansions for Libtayo in non-small cell lung cancer and in basal cell carcinoma. Later this year, the independent data safety monitoring committee will be conducting interim analyses for our Libtayo-chemotherapy combination study in lung cancer from -- and for a monotherapy study in second-line cervical cancer. We continue to make progress with Libtayo as it is establishing itself as the leading immunotherapy for non-melanoma skin cancers, as we hope to make it a potential major new player in the lung cancer space and as we employ it as a foundational therapy to our oncology strategy for bringing novel combinations to the many cancers that are desperate for new treatments.  
This combination approach has a major focus on our bispecifics portfolio as we are emerging as leaders with both our CD3 classes bispecifics as well as our so-called costim bispecifics. These 2 classes of bispecifics can be paired with each other as well as with Libtayo, and we are exceeding all these combinations and more. 
We presented update at the American Society of Hematology, or ASH meeting, in December on odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific, which continued to show high rates of durable responses in follicular and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. We are working with the FDA update to determine the optimal dosing program protocol designed to further minimize already rare cytokine release syndrome events during the step-up dosing phase of this powerful agent. A subcutaneous formulation is under development as well.  
We also provided updates at ASH on our BCMAxCD3 bispecific for relapsed/refractory myeloma. And our pivotal Phase II trial is enrolling well with full enrollment anticipated this year. Phase III trials for this program as well, as studies of a subcutaneous formulation, are also on track to start this year as well.  
Our third CD3 bispecific in the clinic, REGN4018, our MUC16xCD3 bispecific, continues in dose-escalation trials for ovarian cancer where we are observing early efficacy signals.  
Our costim bispecifics are also progressing. Notably, our trial for our MUC16xCD28 costimulatory bispecific has just dosed its first patient and will continue in combination with Libtayo. Later this year, it will also be combined in patients with our MUC16xCD3 bispecific, making it our first clinical pairing of CD3 in costim bispecifics, which we hope will provide for a game-changing and generalizable approach to solid as well as hematologic tumors. Regarding the latter, we will soon be initiating trials of a costim bispecific to be  paired with our CD20xCD3 bispecific for lymphoma; and later this year, of a different costim bispecific to be paired with our BCMAxCD3 bispecific in myeloma. Our [ PCMA ] costim bispecific is progressing in dose-escalation trials with Libtayo for patients with prostate cancer. And we also have a costim targeting the EGF receptor that will allow for a variety of novel combinations as well. 
These combination programs pairing bispecs with each other and with our anti-PD-1 has the potential synergistically unleash the power of immuno-oncology more broadly than currently approved treatments. And thus, there is a lot of interest in the timing of the data releases from these early combination programs. We hope you appreciate the requirement for careful and deliberate dose escalation trials to ensure patient safety as these drugs are designed to activate patients' immune systems and involve novel and powerful pathways. Hence, while early results or top line data announcements are possible in 2021, readouts are equally possible to occur in 2022. 
Beyond oncology, I would like to highlight that next week, we expect approval for evinacumab, now known as Evkeeza, for homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. If approved, this addition to our portfolio builds upon our cardiometabolic expertise and has the potential to help patients suffering from this rare disease. 
Before I finish, I'd like to highlight that we continue to invest in our world-leading human sequencing efforts at the Regeneron Genetics Center, which is pivotal to identifying and validating targets for our new genetics medicines initiative, which we believe could be transformational not only for Regeneron, but for our entire industry and already involves important collaborations with partners such as Alnylam, Intellia, Decibel, bluebird and others. 
To conclude, in 2020, we and our partners have introduced 9 new investigational therapies into the clinic, submitted marketing applications for 6 new indications and secured 2 new drug approvals or authorizations. We are proud of the remarkable accomplishments our Regeneron team has achieved in a difficult year, and we thank our many investigators and patients who have been essential to helping us with these accomplishments.

We ended 2020 with positive momentum across our commercial portfolio as our core products, EYLEA, Dupixent and Libtayo, delivered strong performance in the fourth quarter. Our 2020 results, coupled with near-term launch opportunities, p",947,"Thank you, George. We ended 2020 with positive momentum across our commercial portfolio as our core products, EYLEA, Dupixent and Libtayo, delivered strong performance in the fourth quarter. Our 2020 results, coupled with near-term launch opportunities, position us for continued diversified growth in 2021. 
Beginning with EYLEA. Fourth quarter global net sales grew 10% year-over-year to $2.2 billion. As we reported last month, U.S. EYLEA net sales grew 10% year-over-year to $1.34 billion, the highest reported net sales since EYLEA's launch. EYLEA again outperformed the category with share gains from both branded and unbranded competition. EYLEA share of the branded category approached 75% for the quarter and EYLEA remains the #1 prescribed anti-VEGF therapy overall in wet AMD and diabetic eye disease. While volume in the overall anti-VEGF category declined in 2020, EYLEA was the only product in the category to grow. Patient volumes are now normalizing. EYLEA sets a high bar on efficacy, safety, dosing flexibility and real-world experience for current and future competition. 
The anti-VEGF category continues to be supported by the aging population and increasing prevalence of diabetes. Realizing the full potential in diabetic eye disease remains a key initiative, representing a significant growth opportunity for EYLEA and is largely unpenetrated. We intend to initiate a direct-to-consumer campaign to create awareness for patients on the importance of vision care as part of managing their diabetes. In summary, EYLEA had an impressive quarter, and we remain confident in its outlook. 
Next, we recorded $146 million for our antibody cocktail, REGEN-COV, in the fourth quarter. Where appropriate, we are deploying commercial efforts under the EUA to improve availability for this important treatment against COVID-19 for at-risk patients. We are engaging with all stakeholders to reduce bottlenecks and drive utilization rates higher. Regeneron is working to educate stakeholders, including patients, on the urgency to treat at-risk nonhospitalized patients within 10 days of receiving a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. Initiatives to reduce administrative burden and direct patients to treatment centers are beginning to yield encouraging results. Physicians using REGEN-COV are providing very positive feedback on treatment results. 
Let me also briefly discuss another new medicine, evinacumab, brand name Evkeeza. We're prepared for the February 11 PDUFA date for Evkeeza for the treatment of HoFH, a rare disease that affects approximately 1,300 patients in the U.S. There's high unmet need for these patients with this rare genetic condition as they struggle to keep their LDL-cholesterol levels under control. These patients face an increased risk of premature heart disease as early as their teenage years. We are leveraging our cardiometabolic expertise and existing commercial platform to drive uptake in this rare disease category. 
Turning now to Libtayo, where fourth quarter global net sales grew to $97 million. In the U.S., net sales were $74 million, driven by steady volume growth in advanced CSCC. We are nearing the potential approval of 2 additional indications for Libtayo in basal cell carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer, both of which received priority reviews and have upcoming PDUFA dates. Our teams are eager and ready to launch once approved. 
For basal cell carcinoma, there are no FDA-approved treatment options once the patient progresses on or becomes intolerant to Hedgehog inhibitors. Just as we did with CSCC, we will work to establish Libtayo as the standard of care in appropriate BCC patients.  
We also look forward to competing in non-small cell lung cancer, where there's a large opportunity among patients with PD-L1 expressions at least 50%. Libtayo has a favorable product profile, and a growing majority of treatment centers and oncologists have experienced using Libtayo in their CSCC patients. Physicians prefer choice, and recent market research shows that nearly 2/3 of physicians are highly motivated to evaluate Libtayo for their lung cancer patients, if approved. 
Additionally, we've built a highly experienced commercialization team with significant launch experience with this class. If approved, we aim to rapidly increase market awareness of Libtayo as a compelling new anti-PD-1 monotherapy treatment option. 
Finally, moving to Dupixent. Global net sales in the fourth quarter were $1.17 billion, representing 56% growth compared to the prior year. In the U.S., broad-based growth across all approved indications contributed to net sales of $926 million. We continue to see strong prescription trends across all approved indications, and weekly new patient shares have recently eclipsed pre-pandemic levels. 
Atopic dermatitis, the largest indication, is a significant driver on Dupixent's rapid onset, proven efficacy and well-established safety profile. Physicians continue to expand prescribing across both moderate and severe disease and in younger populations where safety is paramount. Despite the impressive launch growth trajectory, there remains significant opportunity as only a small percentage of the over 2 million biologic-eligible patients in the U.S. have been prescribed Dupixent. Our initiatives aim to grow new patient starts as there is substantial opportunity for many more patients to benefit and support patients already on Dupixent to continue their treatment. 
Moving to asthma. Dupixent is performing well in this competitive market based on its clinical efficacy and safety profile, which is compelling and differentiated to prescribers. Our market expansion efforts supporting HCPs and patients, including DTC, continue to have a meaningful impact on new initiations. And launch preparations are underway in pediatric -- in the pediatric asthma setting. 
For chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, we see healthy demand and continued strong prescribing trends among ENTs and allergists. Dupixent is core to our diversified growth strategy, where there remains substantial opportunity for future expansion. 
In closing, we ended 2020 with momentum, delivering strong performance across our business. With several near-term launches ahead, we have important opportunities to strengthen our thriving commercial portfolio and capitalize on growth. 
Now I'll turn the call to Bob."
33715,701650850,2194423,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 05, 2021",2021-02-05,"Earnings Calls","Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marion, and good morning and good afternoon, everybody. My comments today on financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis where applicable. For the fourth quarter of 2020, Regeneron delivered again double-digit broad-based top and bot",1225,"Thanks, Marion, and good morning and good afternoon, everybody. My comments today on financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis where applicable. For the fourth quarter of 2020, Regeneron delivered again double-digit broad-based top and bottom line growth. Our revenue streams continue to diversify with significant growth contributions from Dupixent and REGEN-COV as we invest in our best-in-class pipeline for sustained future growth. 
For the fourth quarter, total revenue grew 30% year-over-year to $2.4 billion driven by: Growth in U.S. EYLEA sales; higher collaboration revenues from our partners, Sanofi and Bayer; and sales of our REGEN-COV antibody cocktail. Diluted net income per share grew 27% year-over-year to $9.53 on net income of $1.1 billion. 
Since Marion discussed our U.S. EYLEA results, I will start with our Bayer and Sanofi collaborations, starting with the Bayer collaboration. 
Ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales reported to us by Bayer were $859 million for the fourth quarter of 2020, representing growth of 10% on a reported basis compared to the prior year. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $361 million, of which we recorded $335 million for our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S. 
Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $317 million in the fourth quarter. Our share of the profits from the commercialization of non-IO antibodies was $230 million, which compares favorably to profits of $104 million in the prior year. This growth was primarily driven by higher Dupixent profits. 
Other revenue increased to $123 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $96 million in the prior year. The primary driver is the recognition of $42 million from the U.S. government associated with reimbursements of REGEN-COV development. As we said on the third quarter call, this line item continues to trend lower due to the wind down of development reimbursements from the U.S. government. In 2021, we expect to record approximately half of the $557 million recorded in other revenue for full year 2020. 
Moving on to our operating expenses, and starting with R&D. R&D increased 50% year-over-year to $675 million, primarily due to continued clinical development costs for our REGEN-COV antibody cocktail and higher headcount to support our expanding pipeline. Next, SG&A expense increased 22% year-over-year to $381 million. The year-over-year increase was largely driven by increased headcount, launch preparations for Libtayo and continued investments for growth in EYLEA. Cost of goods sold increased 79% from the prior year from $93 million to $166 million due to sales of REGEN-COV and Praluent in the U.S. Cost of collaboration and contract manufacturing was $174 million compared to $113 million in the fourth quarter 2019, primarily due to increased sales of Dupixent. 
Additionally, in other operating income and expense, we recorded $145 million of income in the fourth quarter of 2020. This includes approximately $100 million of income related to higher recognition of upfront and milestone payments previously received from our collaborators with Sanofi, Teva and Mitsubishi Tanabe. Finally, in other income and expense, we recorded $2 million of expense compared to $25 million of income in the fourth quarter of 2019. This is driven by interest expense related to our $2 billion debt issuance in August 2020 and lower investment returns on our existing cash and marketable securities. 
Turning now to taxes. The effective tax rate was 7.7% in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to 10.6% in the fourth quarter of 2019. 
Shifting now to cash flow and the balance sheet. For the full year 2020, Regeneron generated $2 billion in free cash flow and ended the year with cash and marketable securities, less long-term debt, of $4.7 billion. We also exhausted our inaugural $1 billion share repurchase program in the fourth quarter. 
As a result of our strong balance sheet and confidence in the growth trajectory of our business, we are announcing a new Board-authorized share repurchase program of $1.5 billion. This program is consistent with our capital allocation priorities of funding our broad R&D pipeline, investing in enabling and synergizing R&D business development opportunities and returning cash to our shareholders. With this new authorization, we will continue to be opportunistic buyers where we see dislocation between our stock price and our intrinsic valuation. 
Having reviewed our fourth quarter performance, I'd like to take some time to discuss the 2021 financial outlook, starting with R&D guidance. 
We forecast our 2021 R&D expense to be in the range of $2.7 billion to $2.85 billion. We are continuing to advance programs in our diverse R&D portfolio, with up to 7 INDs to enter the clinic in 2021, of which 6 were discovered in-house. This is in addition to INDs that entered the clinic in 2020 which George mentioned. Included in our R&D guidance and based on current plans, we expect to spend between $275 million and $350 million on the REGEN-COV development program. We expect most of this REGEN-COV spend to occur in the first half of the year. 
Next, we forecast our 2021 SG&A expense to be in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.63 billion. We continue to invest in multiple launches in 2021, including 2 new indications for Libtayo and efforts for REGEN-COV. Also, as you heard from Marion, this increased spending will also be driven by a DTC campaign for EYLEA as we continue to see significant growth opportunity in diabetic eye disease.
Next, we expect our 2021 product gross margin on a percentage of net product sales that we record to be between 87% and 89%. We expect 2021 cost of collaboration manufacturing to be in the range of $670 million to $750 million driven by continued growth in our Dupixent franchise. We forecast 2021 operating income and expense to be income of $150 million to $175 million. Finally, we expect our 2021 non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 12% to 14%, inclusive of REGEN-COV sales in the U.S. which are taxed at the U.S. statutory rate. 
I'd also like to review our current supply agreements with the U.S. government for REGEN-COV. We expect to recognize the remainder of the $466 million initial U.S. government contract in the first quarter of 2021. We also announced last month a new agreement with the U.S. government for additional doses of REGEN-COV. Right now, we expect to deliver approximately 750,000 doses by the agreed delivery date of June 30 this year at the contracted price of $2,100 per dose with the vast majority of these deliveries occurring in the second quarter. 
As George mentioned earlier, we are evaluating a lower 1.2-gram dose for REGEN-COV. Should this lower treatment dose receive emergency use authorization or approval of the FDA, we aim to deliver up to 1.25 million doses by June 30, which is the maximum quantity that is authorized for purchase by the U.S. government under the supply agreement. Importantly, if the lower dose is approved, the pricing per dose does not change. Our ability to fulfill these finished doses is predicated on continued success in the manufacture of bulk product and access to third-party fill/finish capacity, which is under heavy demand from COVID-19 vaccine manufacturers. 
In conclusion, we are well positioned for significant growth with durable core products, multiple near-term launches in specialized growth opportunities while investing in our R&D engine to drive sustainable long-term growth. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Justin."

The top end of the funnel being getting physicians to actually prescribe the product for the appropriate patients; and as well as at the bottom end of the funnel, which is -- gets quite narrow in some places, allowing people to easily get administered the product once the physician wants to treat the patient. 
There's been a lot of progress on both ends there. On the bottom end of the funnel, there have been best practices emerging, where people have linked directly medical record algorithms to positive patients, asking their doctor if they want to get a consult to administer the cocktail, and they've administered lots and lots of doses of monoclonal antibodies. And there -- these best practices are emerging around the country. 
On the top end, there is still some skepticism that the data is incomplete, that the data isn't robust enough. And we certainly would agree we don't have the normal data standards that you might have for a full FDA approval, but we remind everybody that we are in the midst of a pandemic where thousands, hundreds of thousands of people are going to die and have died. And sometimes, one has to look at the totality of the evidence and make decisions in that regard. 
So we continue on the top end education and the logistics on the bottom end. Marion might want to add something."

I think that for patients with atopic dermatitis, there had been so little for so long that over the course of several years now where Dupixent has been in the marketplace, the amazing efficacy, the safety profile, the convenience of use is something that has required a lot of market education and a lot of market understanding. And across the approved indications that we have in the U.S. today, there are about 2 million, 2.2 million actually eligible patients and only about 6% are getting treatment today. 
So while favorable results in the understanding of Dupixent with dermatologists, allergists, all of our prescribers; and obviously in asthma now with pulmonologists and allergists; for nasal polyps with the ENTs as well, this is a remarkable alternative across type 2 disease for approved indications today. But there's a lot of unmet need. And obviously, the future indications will take us into new populations and new prescribers."

And I think that most people -- or most sophisticated people are beginning to realize now that it's the biologicals, particularly a drug like Dupixent, which is more targeted, more natural and less prone to an assortment of both on-target and off-target toxicities. 
And so people think, oh, a pill, it's less serious, and I think we have to do a lot of education to explain that these biologicals are actually more targeted, more natural, they can be a lot safer. And though they're more powerful, you don't have to think of them as more serious in a negative way. So I think there's a huge legacy of thinking of things like that, but the emerging data that's coming out now is going to help, I think, with these points. That if you're suffering from a disease like atopic dermatitis, you want to be on a natural approach, targeted biological, something that has an exquisite safety profile like Dupixent."

I think that we're very excited about our entire allergy portfolio because we really think we have a collection of powerful but also groundbreaking new approaches. So as we all know, so many people, millions in the United States, are taking, for example, multiple shots weekly to try to get desensitized; or undergo these very long prolonged oral approaches and so forth, often with unsatisfying results, even after years of therapy. So I think it's exciting as we announced that we were able to demonstrate a significant improvement in the amount of peanut tolerization that could occur in conjunction with the Aimmune oral immunization -- oral desensitization approach. 
And we think that this is going to prove to be generalizable across the board to many of these desensitization approaches, where we hope that Dupixent will aid in making patients more desensitized, may be able to tolerate these regimens better as well as maybe improve more quickly. And that's one component of our allergy program. 
We're equally excited about a somewhat unrelated effort where we're the first people who are moving into the clinic antibodies that directly bind and neutralize allergens. I for one don't understand why this hasn't been done before. But our data, some of which we have talked about publicly and even published, and some of which we will be presenting at upcoming meetings, show that these are very powerful approaches. From the first injection, almost immediately at the first time measures, we're getting the sorts of improvements that you see across studies resulting after years of desensitization therapy. 
And we're talking about 2 of the most important allergies, which are both associated with asthma, in which settings because of safety concerns, desensitization approaches are not indicated. That is cat allergy and birch allergy. The results are really striking. We think this is an entirely new way to fight allergy, one in which you can almost see the benefit immediately. Once again, it's a very natural and biologic and targeted approach. 
There are millions of people who are affected by these. And I think knowing many of them having -- many of them in my family, I can tell you that they would -- if we really continue to show the sort of safety and efficacy that the initial studies are showing, I think a lot of people would welcome the opportunity to take the shot and have immediate benefit in terms of their serious allergies. And it's an entirely new approach. 
And all of these things are synergistic, of course. We can imagine many ways in which we can be combining and mixing and matching various parts of our portfolio, including things like Dupixent in these anti-allergens, but with other approaches as well. 
So we really think that we may be at the door of a whole new era, a biologics approach to treating allergy, which I think can really change everything for so many people. And we know that, according to the CDC, allergic diseases are now approaching and increasing in epidemic proportion. So there's a real need out there, and there's a real need for totally new approaches. And so we're very excited about them."

I want to just make one comment about that were coming in late and then say that we probably won't answer on launch plans. We have to get our final label, and we certainly don't want to tip off any of our competitors of what we're up to. But we're spending a lot of time, obviously, thinking about that. 
But let me just address one comment you made, which was that you said coming in late. I remember, and it may have been you, but it probably was somebody else who asked us the question, why were we even bothering with Libtayo in non-small cell lung cancer? Because by the time you get it approved, there will be 10 others that are there. And I remember George answering that question saying, well, he's not so sure that there will be 10 others. All antibodies aren't created equal, plus, it would be a foundation for the rest of our business. 
And that wisdom has really panned out because if you look almost every day, there's another failure of a PD-L1 or inferior PD-1, it doesn't combine right, all sorts of things. And there really is only one right now, one gold standard, which is KEYTRUDA. And obviously, we don't have any head-to-head data. But when you look at our data, it's really impressive data. And so we think that we should remind everybody that the questions that we got 5 or 10 years ago, why bother, have sort of panned out more the way George had anticipated rather than maybe everybody else had. 
As far as our specific launch plans, we'll ask you to stay tuned because we're working hard at preparing."

I think George touched on it, but let me deal specifically as best we can for the product you referenced from Roche, which is a combination of anti-VEGF and anti-Ang-2. I might start out by saying we have the greatest respect for Roche-Genentech, the group. We partner with them in our COVID global efforts and we watched them really establish the anti-VEGF class with Lucentis. So we have tremendous respect for them. 
But I think when it comes to Ang-2, history has a very important lesson here, in that I was with George, I remember it, we were [ tracking ]. I was with George, when one of his colleagues, they were working so hard to identify, purify and clone and sequence this really important molecule that was seen to be a critical player in blood vessel formation and development, et cetera, and maybe the only real other critical factor other than VEGF. So George and his group discovered this molecule, and nobody would like to see it bear fruit in terms of a treatment? But the data that we have just don't support that. Our data, we look very carefully, we could not find a benefit of adding Ang-2 to the amazing effect get with a highly potent anti-VEGF compound such as EYLEA. 
So when we look at the data you refer to, it's -- we haven't seen all the data, and we'll all look for it. But from what they've disclosed, somewhere in the 40s percent, to be able to get to a 16-week regimen is what George referred to is exactly what EYLEA gets in the ALTAIR study. So we don't see so far any evidence, we'll look at the data, that there's anything more there than high dose anti-VEGF therapy, higher than Lucentis on a molar basis. And so we'll have to wait and see. 
But one has to remember also that safety, George mentioned, we have 30 million injections under our belt. That's a tremendous, tremendous safety database. And you can see what happens. There's been a reminder out there just how important the safety side of this is. 
So we'll see. We have great respect for them. But we don't see any data right now to suggest Ang-2 blockade is playing any differentiated role, if any role at all. 
I don't know, George, if the discover or Ang-2, do you want to comment further?"

And we obviously made the first, and we think the best, antibodies against these factors. We tried them in combination studies. I think that there is no evidence at all from any of the faricimab data that there's any additional benefit vis-à-vis mechanism of action of the combined blockade of the angiopoietin-2. 
I think that it's sort of a regulatory trick to try to create a differentiated molecule, put both activities within one. We think it's a better, more convincing, frankly, safer approach to actually test both blocking agents separately rather than combining them in 1 molecule when there's no benefit other than pure regulatory tricks for combining them into 1 molecule. 
The way we think that the data looks right now, it looks as if this is merely high dose Lucentis, and the data that they've at least reported to date suggests similar data to what we see right now currently with EYLEA. As Len mentioned, we have studies that show that up to 40% of patients can achieve 16-week dosing. I think the important add on to it is, of course, is that we have our upcoming studies with high-dose EYLEA. 
So basically, what people are doing, they're taking other molecules which didn't fare as well, and they're high-dosing them, okay? We're taking EYLEA and we're a high dosing it. And it's already starting at a place where its duration and its efficacy and its safety seem to be leading, with really no evidence that the competition has anything significantly different. But now we're testing the higher dose to see whether we can make EYLEA even better while still delivering the same safety and efficacy. 
So we're pretty excited about that. And as we said, we see there's no evidence that any of the competitors are providing anything different at this point."

But just in terms of the costims. So as we've shown in some very high profile papers in Science and Science Translational. Basically, nature uses -- to activate T cells to do their job, particularly, for example, to kill cells, they need signal 1 through the T cell receptor itself, which is, a CD3 is an important component of that. But they also need signal 2, which some people refer to as a costimulatory signal. And so by combining bispecifics that involve CD3 engagement and bispecifics that involve CD28 or costimulatory engagement, you are simultaneously activating both signal 1 and signal 2. And we have shown rather compellingly in preclinical models that this really accentuates and really dramatically increases the ability of T cells to kill the target itself. 
Let me we also remind you that the PD-1 and other checkpoint inhibitors provide a brake. So you have signal 1 and signal 2 which are driving the cells to kill, and then you can have a brake signal that acts through checkpoints such as PD-1. So combining all 3 or combining them in pair-wise fashion, in animal models, shows that you can just increase the amount of tumor killing that you get us compared with having just one of the approaches. 
So we're just trying to understand what nature does and how nature optimizes the process and then mimic it with these natural approaches to biologics that can activate in a targeted fashion only on the tumor target cells, depending on how well the targeting is, signal 1, signal 2, while releasing the brake. So the preclinical data is pretty compelling, and we can only hope that we approach it with what we're going to see in the clinic. And we do think that, over the next year, it's going to be very interesting to see how these dose escalation trials play out."

It didn't take much market research to know how Dupixent was initially being used or how most drugs are used. Though it was approved, for example, in the moderate to severe population, atopic dermatitis, all physicians initially started with their toughest, their hardest, their more serious patients, before then gradually going backwards in the treatment paradigm. And that is one of the reasons why we're only penetrating about 6% of the moderate to severe population. So I think that, gradually with more confidence, they're going to treat people who are on the more moderate side of things. 
That said, I think the point that the efficacy profile, but also the mechanism of action. The fact that you are probably, in the long term, may be benefiting the patient in terms of slowing or preventing the ultimate atopic march that occurs in so many patients, demands that we figure out a way to take this product to earlier patients. Those will, however, require additional studies. 
We're trying to figure out the best way to do it, but I for one do think that, for example, many more patients with much milder asthma or other milder forms of type 2 disease, that we know in many patients is just going to get worse over time, we owe these patients. We have to figure out, through a clinical program, how to do the right studies, how to convince the FDA and how to move this treatment back towards these earlier patients."

We're off to a strong start in 2021, again delivering double-digit growth on the top and bottom lines. I'm immensely proud of all that Regeneron continues to accomplish in the fight against COVID and for patients suffering from a variety of diseases. Our performance highlights the continued evolution diversification and durability of our business as we enter a new phase of growth and new product launches. 
Strong performance begins with differentiated products that deliver real value for patients. Starting with EYLEA. Global net sales were nearly $2.2 billion, growing 17% compared to the prior year. In the U.S., sales grew 15%, reflecting continued positive momentum and execution on our strategy. We are confident in the EYLEA business and expect it will remain a key growth driver for Regeneron for years to come. 
We are also very pleased with the performance of Dupixent in the quarter, where global sales approached $1.3 billion and grew 48%. The brand is now annualizing sales in excess of $5 billion. Yet we believe there remains considerable room for further market growth and penetration in atopic dermatitis, asthma, and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis. 
With several additional potential indications in Phase III trials, such as eosinophilic esophagitis, and COPD, we are still in the early days of realizing the full potential of this unique pipeline and the product. In oncology, we are making steady progress with Libtayo as global net sales reached $101 million and grew 35% from the prior year. 
Importantly, in February, we secured 2 new FDA approvals for Libtayo in basal cell carcinoma and the non-small cell lung cancer, which we anticipate will help fuel a new period of growth for this product that is a foundation to our oncology strategy. While still in very early days with these new launches, we are seeing encouraging signals on a variety of leading indicators, from thought leaders, prescribers, payers and patients. 
And last but not least, we were able to deliver significant Phase III outcome data for our REGEN-COV program, aimed at treating and preventing COVID-19 infections. As George will outline momentarily, we have now shown that our antibody cocktail dramatically reduces hospitalizations or death in nonhospitalized COVID infected patients and reduces symptomatic infections when given as a preventative measure. 
We are seeking to update our emergency use authorization to affect these new data and uses as well as the lower 1.2 gram dose. Thinking longer-term for REGEN-COV, we see an ongoing global need for treatment and chronic prevention of COVID disease. Despite high rates of vaccination, it's estimated that tens of millions will remain unvaccinated in the U.S. alone. 
And of those who are vaccinated, significant numbers will not mount a protective response, such as those who are immunocompromised or immunosuppressed. It is important to recognize Regeneron's, and the biopharmaceutical industry at large, response and ongoing actions in combating COVID-19. Breakthrough vaccines and treatments are having a profound impact on the health and well-being of people in the United States and around the globe. 
In addition, safe and effective vaccines and treatments are enabling economic recovery. All of these critical benefits come as a result of the investments that have been made in technologies over decades by both the public and private sectors. These profound effects highlight the importance of a healthy biopharmaceutical industry that fully incentivizes innovation so that new solutions to emerging disease can rapidly be invented and deployed. 
We've also learned that these extraordinary approaches to preventing and treating COVID-19 can work only with people who actually receive the vaccines or drugs. For example, an internal health economic analysis projected that tens of thousands of lives in the United States could be saved over the next several months if REGEN-COV were fully deployed and given to all appropriate patients who are diagnosed with COVID-19 and at high-risk for hospitalization or death. 
And this is the case where cost to patients is not an issue as the government is providing the drug free of charge. Clearly, we have to better understand why a drug that has demonstrated overwhelming evidence for its ability to reduce hospitalizations or death by 70%, as an ample supply has been endorsed by the NIH, has been authorized under an EUA by the FDA and is free of charge to patients, is not being taken full advantage of. 
Regeneron is committed to collaborating with our health care partners to take optimal advantage of the REGEN-COV cocktail potential health benefits. Overall, we are pleased in all that Regeneron has accomplished in the first 3 months of the year and look forward to continued momentum and progress across our diverse pipeline in the months to come. Now I will turn the call over to George."

With COVID-19 still in the headlines, I will start with the monoclonal antibiotic treatment, the REGEN-COV cocktail.

With COVID-19 still in the headlines, I will start with the monoclonal antibiotic treatment, the REGEN-COV cocktail. We recently reported data from a large Phase III outcomes trial in the outpatient setting, confirming that REGEN-COV reduced the risk of hospitalization or death by 70% with both the 2.4 gram and the lower 1.2 gram doses. 
We are pleased that based on these data, the NIH guidelines were updated in early April to include a strong recommendation for monoclonal antibody combinations to treat out patients with mild or moderate COVID-19, as defined by the EUA criteria. We also recently reported data from a large 2-part Phase III trial of REGEN-COV, with Part A in the preventative setting in Part B in recently infected patients. In Part A of the trial, REGEN-COV prevented 81% of symptomatic COVID-19 infections, with 93% prevention after the first week. 
A supportive study in healthy volunteers that explored chronic dosing showed a similar 92% prevention of infection. Notably, these results were achieved with a convenient and subcutaneous formulation. Chronic prevention with our antibody cocktail may prove to be critical in the ongoing battle against this virus. Despite high rates of vaccination, it is estimated that tens of millions of Americans will remain unvaccinated, thus at risk for future infection. In addition, it is estimated that millions of Americans will not mount an adequate response to vaccines. 
For example, immunocompromised individuals or organ transplant patients, or who suffer from certain cancers such as lymphomas, leukemias and myelomas or an immunosuppressant therapies for their autoimmune diseases might all be candidates for chronic prevention using our antibody cocktail. 
Part B of this Phase III trial in recently infected patients showed that the subcutaneous administration of the 1.2 gram dose was also effective in reducing symptomatic disease and shortening disease duration. We are anticipating the existing EUA will be amended based upon the above data to include the 1.2 gram REGEN-COV dose to allow the cocktail to be used for prevention and to include the subcutaneous formulation for ease of use. 
We believe the current data is supportive of a potential formal BLA approvals by the FDA. I would like to remind everyone that outside of the United States, where some countries have an even more ongoing dire need for COVID-19 medicines, our partner, Roche, is rapidly expanding availability of the treatment. 
Last year, we anticipated that certain variants were likely to emerge and therefore designed our current cocktail to be active against these variants. Experimental evidence suggests that our cocktail is indeed active against all current variants of concern. Similarly, in the anticipation of future variants that may emerge, we are bringing additional antibodies to the clinic shortly. 
Moving on to EYLEA. A recent NIH sponsored protocol W trial in nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy patients confirm results of our own PANORAMA study. After 2 years, EYLEA reduced vision-threatening complications by 6% to 8% compared to a group of patients who delayed treatment. 
A recent Regeneron follow-up analysis in the similar designed PANORAMA trial found that delaying treatment resulted in 3x as many patients suffering prolonged vision loss compared to those receiving preventative EYLEA treatment during a 2-year period. A similar analysis has not yet been conducted for Protocol W. Protocol W is the second study in diabetic retinopathy showing benefit of a less frequent EYLEA dosing regimen. 
And we are planning on filing to expand the U.S. EYLEA label by adding the 16-week dosing interval for appropriate patients in the second half of this year. By year-end, we are expecting first data from the Phase II study testing a high dose of EYLEA in wet AMD. From these data, we can expect early reads on anatomic differences and drying between the higher and lower dose at 8, and potentially, 12-week intervals. 
While the study data will not be definitive on durability measures, the Phase II study will help provide insights on what we might expect from the Phase III studies, which are testing dosing intervals out to 12 and 16 weeks. Importantly, in the 106 patients dosed in the open-label Phase II study so far, we haven't seen any concerning safety signals. The Phase III studies in wet AMD and in DME are expected to be fully enrolled by the second half of this year. 
Moving on to Dupixent in our immunology and inflammation portfolio. Dozens of recent presentations at key dermatology meetings highlight the ever-increasing scope of Dupixent efficacy and safety in patients as young as 6 years old, including rapid itch relief, sustained improvement in disease severity and overall quality of life. 
Importantly, Dupixent is not immunosuppressive, nor have -- we have not seen an increased risk of serious infections with Dupixent. This mounting wall of data and physician experience fortifies our belief that Dupixent will remain the preferred choice for multiple Type 2 inflammatory diseases. In the first quarter, we submitted data to support the use of Dupixent in children 6 to 11 years old with moderate to severe asthma. 
The BLA supplement has an action data for October 21 this year. A similar application has been submitted in the EU we previously announced positive data in the part a part of our Phase III trial in esoteric esophagitis and parity of this trial is fully enrolled. In addition, 2 Phase III trials of Dupixent in type 2 COPD are actively enrolling patients. Our complementary program with our anti IL-33 antibody, itepekimab, in a different group of COPD patients former spokes is progressing with both Phase III trials now enrolling. 
We believe that this broad COPD program, including Dupixent and itepekimab, may provide real benefit for many patients. Turning now to our novel approach to treat allergy by using cocktails of monoclonal antibodies to directly bind and inactivate the allergy. These cocktails are designed to act immediately and to be long-lasting and to replace currently cumbersome approaches to allergy desensitization that involve years of multiple weekly injections. 
The anti -- Beth Levine antibody cocktail binds and inactivates the Beth Levine allergen that causes birch pollen allergy, one of the most common seasonal allergies that occur in the spring. Following Phase II data showing immediate and long-lasting effects against allergen challenge, we initiated a Phase III study and results are expected later this year. Assuming success in the current study, we're planning to conduct a second Phase III study during an upcoming birch pollen season. 
Regarding our similar [indiscernible] designed [indiscernible] antibody cocktail for cat allergy, Phase II data were presented earlier this year at a quad AI meeting showing that single administration of the antibody cocktail prevented early asthma reactions in allergic patients and prevented lung function decline upon cat allergen exposure when compared to placebo. 
Following this positive data update, the first Phase III trial in cat allergies planned for later this year. We're enthusiastic about these novel additions to our inflammation and the knowledge portfolio that could represent new groundbreaking ways to treat allergic diseases. Moving on to Libtayo and our oncology portfolio. In the first quarter, Libtayo was approved for the first-line treatment of certain patients with non-small cell lung cancer and for advanced basal cell carcinoma, each being crucial early milestones for our oncology strategy. 
In addition, a Phase III study, of Libtayo in second-line cervical cancer was stopped early for an overwhelmingly positive overall survival benefit, a first for any systemic treatment in these patients. These data will be shared at an upcoming medical meeting and regulatory submissions are planned for this year. 
Additionally, we look forward to sharing an expanded data set of cemiplimab, our anti-lag-3 program at the upcoming ASCO meeting. Cemiplimab is being studied in combination with Libtayo in first line melanoma. In the second half of this year, we anticipate results of an interim analysis for overall survival in our Phase III Libtayo lung cancer chemotherapy combination study. 
Moving on to our bispecific portfolio. In multiple myeloma, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific, for which we now hold exclusive development rights is continuing through dose escalation and dose expansion. We expect to initiate new combination studies in earlier lines of multiple myeloma later this year. Regeneron is uniquely positioned to mix and match multiple modalities and targets with the hope of increasing deep responses we are already observing with the CD3 bispecific. 
We are planning to add a costim bispecific to our arsenal of clinical stage multiple myeloma investigational therapies early next year. Moving to lymphoma. Responses to our CD20xCD3 bispecific odronextamab demonstrates increasing durability Regarding the partial clinical hold owners program, we have agreed to a path forward with the FDA, submitted the updated protocol and are expected to hear back on lifting the partial hold in the very near term. 
Enrollment of the follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cohorts of the Phase II pivotal INTENT trial should resume quickly thereafter. Additionally, testing of the odronextamab subcutaneous formulation will start later this year and the paired costim bispecific combination is also on track to initiate within the next 12 months. Regarding our solid tumor efforts with our bispecific, ovarian cancer is the first indication for which we are already clinically testing 2 different types of bispecifics for the appropriate tumor target, MUC16. Dose escalation of our MUC16xCD3 bispecific is ongoing, and we are hoping to share initial data next year, if not sooner. 
In the MUC16xCD28 costim study, patients are dosed in combination with Libtayo, and dose escalation is ongoing. Combination of the CD3 and CD28 costim bispecifics targeting MUC16 will start later this year, and it has the potential to be a game-changing strategy for treatment of these solid tumors. In prostate cancer, PSMAxCD28 and is in dose escalation studies with Libtayo, and we hope to share initial data next year or sooner. As seen in our other programs, we are planning on introducing a potentially complementary CD3 bispecific to the clinic later this year, rounding out a powerful and unique tool kit for prostate cancer, currently considered unresponsive to immunotherapy. 
Regarding our early efforts in lung cancer and other solid tumors, our EGFRxCD28 costim bispecific is in dose escalation phase, and patients are now dosed in combination -- are now being dosed in combination with Libtayo. Our MET X MET bispecific antibody is in the dose expansion state. Recall that this study is enrolling non-small cell lung cancer patients with a broad selection patients, including MET Exon 14 gene mutations, gene amplication and/or elevated MET protein expression. 
We believe our oncology portfolio is one of the most exciting in the field and has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of diverse, difficult-to-treat cancers. Finally, I would like to highlight our capabilities regarding the Regeneron genetic center and our genetics medicines efforts. In addition to being able to discover and validate targets that we can address with our Velocity antibody platform, we're working with our collaborators to develop 3 additional platforms that have the potential to generate new classes of genetics based medicines. 
First, gene editing. We are eager awaiting initial results from the first systemic based CRISPR approach to be announced midyear by our collaborator Intellia. If positive, these results will validate this gene editing platform for a host of genetic targets identified by the Regeneron Genetic center and being investigated under our collaboration with Intellia. 
Second, we are also excited about our Alnylam collaboration with its validated siRNA platform approach that consumably addressed complementary genetics targets. Our Alnylam, target ALN-HSD directed to HSD-17b13, a target discovered by the Regeneron Genetic Center, is now enrolling NASH patients. Additionally, we and Alnylam are collaborated in a series of follow-on targets. While the technology is currently validated for liver-directed therapeutic approaches, we are set to extend to eye and central nervous system targets. Our third genetic medicines approach involves viral gene therapy delivery and is another approach of significant interest excitement at Regeneron. 
Our first gene therapy program is in collaboration with decile focusing on targeting the ear. We in decile are planning to enter the clinic with DB-OTO next year. In addition to the AAVs targeting the year, we are developing a platform for use in multiple other tissues of interest. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Marion."

We're off to an exciting start in 2021. Our expanded commercial portfolio includes 3 recent product and indication launches, and we continue to grow our largest brands, EYLEA, Dupixent and Libtayo, based on competitive and differentiated profiles. Beginning with EYLEA, first quarter global net sales grew 17% year-over-year to nearly $2.2 billion. 
In the U.S., EYLEA net sales grew 15% year-over-year to $1.35 billion based on increased demand and a favorable comparison to the early weeks of the pandemic and the first quarter of 2020. EYLEA is capturing category growth and continues to be the preferred treatment option. In the branded anti-VEGF category, EYLEA has approximately 75% share and is approaching 50% of of the combined branded and unbranded category. 
EYLEA is differentiated by the combination of its efficacy, safety, dosing flexibility and range of indications in addition, physicians have considerable real-world experience with more than 40 million injections administered worldwide. Across the broader category, demand continues to improve in 2021 and as patient floor normalizes and new patient volume grows, we are confident in our near and longer-term outlook based on favorable patient demographics, physician preference for EYLEA, growth opportunities in diabetic eye disease and future opportunities with our high dose clinical program. 
Turning to Libtayo. First quarter global net sales grew to $101 million, with U.S. net sales of $69 million, the vast majority of first quarter sales were in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, where Libtayo is the #1 systemic treatment. We're excited by recent approvals in non-small cell lung cancer and basal cell carcinoma, or BCC, both of which represent meaningful growth opportunities for Libtayo. In April, we deployed our expanded and highly experienced field force across these indications to extend our Libtayo promotional impact. 
In lung cancer, we have heard from oncologists that Libtayo is highly competitive based on the strength of our compelling clinical data and overall value proposition. Early launch indicators are encouraging with uptake evidence at top academic and community-based practices. We're advancing formulary placement, securing favorable payer coverage decisions and growing overall market awareness. 
Importantly, Libtayo was rapidly included in the NCCN guidelines with a Category 1 preferred rating. The NCCN guidelines have also been updated to include Libtayo in BCC as the category IIa option, Libtayo is the only anti-PD-1 approved in advanced disease for this indication. Early feedback has been encouraging as physicians are eager to prescribe Libtayo based on its efficacy and tolerability. Hedgehog inhibitors despite being used as first-line treatment may not be suitable for patients for long-term or repeat use. Libtayo is an important new care alternative for BCC patients. 
In summary, our lung and BCC launches are progressing according to plan, and we are highly focused on ensuring that appropriate patients benefit from Libtayo. 
Turning now to Obtusa, which was also approved in the first quarter of 2021 and is in the initial launch phase. Obtusa represents a novel and effective treatment for patients with homozygous familial hypercholesteremia and is recognized by treating specialists as an improvement over the current standard of care. Patient demand is steadily building with multiple patients be initiated on therapy. 
Moving to Dupixent. Global net sales in the first quarter were $1.26 billion, representing 48% growth compared to the prior year. In the U.S., broad-based growth across all approved indications generated net sales of $962 million, with the new patient starts now higher than pre COVID levels. In atopic dermatitis, Dupixent's largest indication, prescribing continues to be strong across both moderate and severe disease and across age groups following our adolescent and pediatric launches. There's significant opportunity for continued growth based on remaining unmet need among eligible patients. 
Dupixent is the #1 dermatologist prescribed biologic based on the depth and breadth of its long-term efficacy and safety profile. Turning to asthma, where we are actively preparing to launch in pediatric patients as young as 6 years of age later this year. Among adolescents and adults, we continue to meaningfully expand the number of Dupixent patients initiations, driven by our extensive provider and patient educational efforts. 
In addition, demand is strong among ENTs and Allergists for patients with nasal polyps. Dupixent is the fastest-growing biologic in respiratory disease in our approved indications with substantial room for growth. I'd also like to highlight efforts supporting our antibody cocktail, REGEN-COV. In the first quarter, we recorded U.S. net sales of $262 million under the first contract with U.S. government. REGEN-COV is currently authorized under an EUA in patients based on age and risk factors, which represent close to 40% of all adults diagnosed with COVID-19. We're focused on reducing bottlenecks and increasing utilization, particularly in states with high infection rates. Efforts include direct support to key facilities, medical education about REGEN-COV, partnering with third-party stakeholders and educating consumers on the availability of antibody treatments. 
As George mentioned, we're preparing for a potential update of the REGEN-COV EUA to include prevention as we hope to be able to address an unmet need for millions of patients to maybe candidates for ongoing preventative treatment. Preventative therapy may also be important for those who have known COVID exposure and require very rapid protection. In summary, we delivered robust performance across our portfolio in the first quarter of the year. There's strong positive momentum from our in-line business, encouraging early signals from our recent launches and substantial opportunity for continued diversified growth. Now I'll turn the call over to Bob."

My comments today are on financial results, and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis where applicable. As Len stated, Regeneron is off to a strong start in 2021 as we continue to execute across the business, delivering double-digit top and bottom line growth in the first quarter. For the first quarter, total revenues grew 38% year-over-year to $2.5 billion, driven by growth in global EYLEA sales, increased Sanofi collaboration profitability driven by Dupixent and sales of our REGEN-COV antibody cocktail. 
Diluted net income per share grew 50% year-over-year to $9.89 on net income of $1.1 billion. Excluding revenues related to REGEN-COV, Regeneron achieved 20% total revenue growth versus the prior year. As you heard from Marion, we completed our initial contract to supply REGEN-COV to the U.S. government in the first quarter. Assuming that we secure an updated EUA for the 1.2 gram treatment dose, we expect to deliver at least 1 million doses of REGEN-COV at $2,100 per dose for our follow-on contract with the U.S. government in the second quarter. 
I will now move to collaboration revenues, which were $754 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $528 million in the first quarter of 2020. Starting with the Bayer collaboration. Ex U.S. EYLEA net product sales reported to us by Bayer were $824 million for the first quarter of 2021 and representing growth of 21% on a reported basis and 12% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $323 million of which we recorded $309 million for our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S. 
Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $365 million in the first quarter. Our share of the profits from the commercialization of DUPIXENT and KEVZARA was $261 million, which compares favorably to profits of $171 million in the prior year driven by Dupixent. We recorded initial gross collaboration revenues of $67 million for our share of gross profits from the distribution of the antibody cocktail by Roche outside of the U.S. Other revenue decreased to $50 million in the first quarter compared to $63 million in the prior year in 2021, we expect this line to be less than half of what we recorded in 2020 due to lower BARDA reimbursements for the Ebola and COVID-19 programs. 
Moving on to our operating expenses and starting with R&D. R&D increased 28% year-over-year to $673 million, primarily due to continued clinical development costs for our REGEN-COV antibody cocktail. Next, SG&A expense increased 16% year-over-year to $355 million. The year-over-year increase was driven by commercial investments for Libtayo costs related to the rollout of REGEN-COV and higher employee-related expenses. 
Cost of goods sold increased versus the prior year from $70 million to $173 million due to REGEN-COV manufacturing costs and Praluent manufacturing costs in the U.S., which were recorded by Sanofi in the first quarter of 2020. Additionally, in other income and expense, we recorded $4 million of expense compared to $25 million of income in the prior year. This is driven by interest expense related to our $2 billion debt issuance in August 2020 in lower investment returns on our existing cash and marketable securities. 
Finally, the effective tax rate was 10.5% in the first quarter of 2021 included in this rate is the benefit achieved by a reduction in uncertain tax position liabilities related to the IRS audits of the 2015 and 2016 tax years. Shifting now to cash flow and the balance sheet. In the first quarter of 2021, Regeneron generated $553 million in free cash flow and ended the quarter with net cash and marketable securities of $5.1 billion. 
In the first quarter, we utilized $323 million of our $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization, and we remain opportunistic buyers in the market. I would now like to provide select updates to our 2021 guidance. A complete summary of our latest full year guidance is available in our press release published earlier this morning. We are updating full year 2021 guidance for COCM to be in the range of $660 million to $730 million, the lower guidance range is related to the timing of contract manufacturing of Praluent for Sanofi. We are also updating guidance for our 2021 non-GAAP effective tax rate to be in the range of 13% to 15% and the increase from prior guidance is driven by higher forecasted delivery of REGEN-COV under our second U.S. government contract, which is taxed at the U.S. statutory rate. 
In conclusion, Regeneron is off to a strong start in 2021 and continues to execute across all aspects of the business. We are well positioned for the remainder of 2021 and continue to make those investments necessary to ensure long-term growth. With that, I would now like to turn the call back to Justin."

First, let me say that we are seeing tremendous experience with Dupixent in the marketplace today. And this obviously is across indications, including atopic dermatitis and also very importantly, across 8 categories, which demonstrate not only the efficacy, the speed of action, the safety, the tolerability, we pay really close attention to competitives coming into the marketplace. And certainly, in the case of the JAK inhibitors, we're well aware of the multiple delays. Also recent clinical data that is calling into question, issues of safety, especially at the higher doses. But even at the lower doses and the continuation of black box warnings, we hear from our key opinion leaders who use Dupixent and see it as their mainstay of therapy currently and going forward with great confidence in the safety profile. 
This is a chronic therapy. And certainly, the risk of hematologic effects, malignancies, infection and so on are just not something that is tolerable for these patients when they have a tremendous alternative. So I think we feel very confident in our competitive profile going forward. And also remind that Dupixent, obviously, based on its mode of action, has great efficacy across type 2 disease and other indications. Patients do sometimes have concomitant conditions so on balance, we'll stay very close to this and to our key opinion leaders and specialists, who are very, very confident in the profile of Dupixent."

With the agent on the efficacy side and not have any significant concerns on the safety side. The other point in terms of the penetration, even if you look at how these markets have evolved, when more agents have come on for rheumatoid arthritis and for psoriasis. 
The penetration is so low here that even with competition, there is room for market growth rather than direct fighting it out in terms of a fixed amount of market share. So we expect our profile safety, as Marion says, to be really paramount in treating physicians' minds. And we do think the low level of penetration thus far does leave room for growth nonetheless."

So our checks indicate there's a lot of interest in Ad with regard to add on therapy. And that there's a lot of Dupixent patients who may not be necessarily optimally managed but are not exactly failing. So there's a lot of interest, I guess, with maybe looking at a topical JAK or some other therapy. Just kind of curious if you guys have thought about maybe proactively looking at some common work just to sort of ensure that Dupixent maintains its role as a core?"

But in terms of the commercial side of this, when you talk the kind of patients we're treating moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. They have lesions of a large fraction of their body. I can't remember exactly what it was in our trials. But what we're seeing out there commercially is large fractions of the body are affected by this disease. And so I think that adding topicals, perhaps, but people are actually trying to get away from trying to get away from having to lather up over their entire body. 
The other thing about Dupixent that we can never forget is that the broad aspects of approvals across lots of allergic diseases and with a growing number is very important because these diseases do tend to run in groups. There are many people who have asthma and atopic dermatitis or asthma and nasal polyposis or atopic dermatitis and other allergic diseases, which we're studying. 
So I think that our broad profile across lots of other diseases is also going to give us a very strong competitive position."

We did have a favorable outcome with regards to uncertain tax positions that we were able to reverse which kind of drove a little lower in the quarter on that front. 
On operating margins, Jeff, I guess the one piece that's not so transparent to everybody is we're still incurring a lot of R&D as it pertains to REGEN-COV with regards to the trials, the enrollment numbers. So I don't want people to come away and say, as a result of the Roche benefit we got in the REGEN-COV product sales that without that the margins wouldn't have been as good, but we did incur a lot of expenses pertaining to that, that aren't within the R&D line that we just don't specifically talk about. The business on its own, excluding REGEN-COV was 20% top line and 35% EBIT, okay? So again, it shows you the underlying strength, as you've heard from Len at the very beginning of his words in terms of how we're performing. We think the operating margin is -- can continue to stay at that and improve at that level. I mean, certainly, it's the leverage on Dupixent, right, to the extent -- you saw that Sanofi did a terrific job ex U.S. where we're starting to get a little momentum in terms of ex U.S. sales. So to the extent that, that will continue to play out, we'll continue to get good operating margins associated with that, and then that will drive our overall margins."

I think the net conclusion on the key opinion leaders that I spoke to in the retinal community was that they didn't see an obvious benefit to the product and perhaps even questions in matching the safety, durability and clinical profile of Eylea cross indications. 
I'll mention that certainly with EYLEA, one of important attribute is the ability to treat and extend therapy. And there are some elements of that clinical trial design that constrained EYLEA's dosing interval. We actually hear on a regular basis that one of the reasons why EYLEA is performing so well in the first quarter of 2021 and frankly, performed so well last year is because of its efficacy and the ability to treat and extend for patients.

We're off to a strong start in 2021, again delivering double-digit growth on the top and bottom lines. I'm immensely proud of all that Regeneron continues to accomplish in the fight against COVID and for patients suffering from a variety of diseases. Our performance highlights the continued evolution diversification and durability of our business as we enter a new phase of growth and new product launches. 
Strong performance begins with differentiated products that deliver real value for patients. Starting with EYLEA. Global net sales were nearly $2.2 billion, growing 17% compared to the prior year. In the U.S., sales grew 15%, reflecting continued positive momentum and execution on our strategy. We are confident in the EYLEA business and expect it will remain a key growth driver for Regeneron for years to come. 
We are also very pleased with the performance of Dupixent in the quarter, where global sales approached $1.3 billion and grew 48%. The brand is now annualizing sales in excess of $5 billion. Yet we believe there remains considerable room for further market growth and penetration in atopic dermatitis, asthma, and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis. 
With several additional potential indications in Phase III trials, such as eosinophilic esophagitis, and COPD, we are still in the early days of realizing the full potential of this unique pipeline in the product. In oncology, we are making steady progress with Libtayo as global net sales reached $101 million and grew 35% from the prior year. 
Importantly, in February, we secured 2 new FDA approvals for Libtayo in basal cell carcinoma and the non-small cell lung cancer, which we anticipate will help fuel a new period of growth for this product that is a foundation to our oncology strategy. While still in very early days with these new launches, we are seeing encouraging signals on a variety of leading indicators, from thought leaders, prescribers, payers and patients. 
And last but not least, we were able to deliver significant Phase III outcome data for our REGEN-COV program, aimed at treating and preventing COVID-19 infections. As George will outline momentarily, we have now shown that our antibody cocktail dramatically reduces hospitalizations or death in non-hospitalized COVID infected patients and reduces symptomatic infections when given as a preventative measure. 
We are seeking to update our emergency use authorization to affect these new data and uses as well as the lower 1.2 gram dose. Thinking longer-term for REGEN-COV, we see an ongoing global need for treatment and chronic prevention of COVID disease. Despite high rates of vaccination, it's estimated that tens of millions will remain unvaccinated in the U.S. alone. 
And of those who are vaccinated, significant numbers will not mount a protective response, such as those who are immunocompromised or immunosuppressed. It is important to recognize Regeneron's, and the bio-pharmaceutical industry at large, response and ongoing actions in combating COVID-19. Breakthrough vaccines and treatments are having a profound impact on the health and well-being of people in the United States and around the globe. 
In addition, safe and effective vaccines and treatments are enabling economic recovery. All of these critical benefits come as a result of the investments that have been made in technologies over decades by both the public and private sectors. These profound effects highlight the importance of a healthy bio-pharmaceutical industry that fully incentivizes innovation so that new solutions to emerging disease can rapidly be invented and deployed. 
We've also learned that these extraordinary approaches to preventing and treating COVID-19 can work only with people who actually receive the vaccines or drugs. For example, an internal health economic analysis projected that tens of thousands of lives in the United States could be saved over the next several months if REGEN-COV were fully deployed and given to all appropriate patients who are diagnosed with COVID-19 and at high-risk for hospitalization or death. 
And this is the case where cost to patients is not an issue as the government is providing the drug free of charge. Clearly, we have to better understand why a drug that has demonstrated overwhelming evidence for its ability to reduce hospitalizations or death by 70%, is an ample supply, has been endorsed by the NIH, has been authorized under an EUA by the FDA and is free of charge to patients, is not being taken full advantage of. 
Regeneron is committed to collaborating with our health care partners to take optimal advantage of the REGEN-COV cocktail potential health benefits. Overall, we are pleased in all that Regeneron has accomplished in the first 3 months of the year and look forward to continued momentum and progress across our diverse pipeline in the months to come. Now I will turn the call over to George."
33715,710499570,2273777,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 06, 2021",2021-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Len.

With COVID-19 still in the headlines, I will start with the monoclonal antibiotic treatment, the REGEN-COV cocktail. We recently reported data from a large Phase III outcomes trial in the outpatient setting, confirming that REGEN-COV reduced the risk of hospitalization or death by 70% with both the 2.4 gram and the lower 1.2 gram doses. 
We are pleased that based on these data, the NIH guidelines were updated in early April to include a strong recommendation for monoclonal antibody combinations to treat out patients with mild or moderate COVID-19, as defined by the EUA criteria. We also recently reported data from a large 2-part Phase III trial of REGEN-COV, with Part A in the preventative setting in Part B in recently infected patients. In Part A of the trial, REGEN-COV prevented 81% of symptomatic COVID-19 infections, with 93% prevention after the first week. 
A supportive study in healthy volunteers that explored chronic dosing showed a similar 92% prevention of infection. Notably, these results were achieved with a convenient and subcutaneous formulation. Chronic prevention with our antibody cocktail may prove to be critical in the ongoing battle against this virus. Despite high rates of vaccination, it is estimated that tens of millions of Americans will remain unvaccinated, thus at risk for future infection. In addition, it is estimated that millions of Americans will not mount an adequate response to vaccines. 
For example, immunocompromised individuals or organ transplant patients, or who suffer from certain cancers such as lymphomas, leukemias and myelomas or an immunosuppressant therapies for their autoimmune diseases might all be candidates for chronic prevention using our antibody cocktail. 
Part B of this Phase III trial in recently infected patients showed that the subcutaneous administration of the 1.2 gram dose was also effective in reducing symptomatic disease and shortening disease duration. We are anticipating the existing EUA will be amended based upon the above data to include the 1.2 gram REGEN-COV dose to allow the cocktail to be used for prevention and to include the subcutaneous formulation for ease of use. 
We believe the current data is supportive of a potential formal BLA approvals by the FDA. I would like to remind everyone that outside of the United States, where some countries have an even more ongoing dire need for COVID-19 medicines, our partner, Roche, is rapidly expanding availability of the treatment. 
Last year, we anticipated that certain variants were likely to emerge and therefore designed our current cocktail to be active against these variants. Experimental evidence suggests that our cocktail is indeed active against all current variants of concern. Similarly, in the anticipation of future variants that may emerge, we are bringing additional antibodies to the clinic shortly. 
Moving on to EYLEA. A recent NIH sponsored protocol W trial in non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy patients confirm results of our own PANORAMA study. After 2 years, EYLEA reduced vision-threatening complications by 6% to 8% compared to a group of patients who delayed treatment. 
A recent Regeneron follow-up analysis in the similar designed PANORAMA trial found that delaying treatment resulted in 3x as many patients suffering prolonged vision loss compared to those receiving preventative EYLEA treatment during a 2-year period. A similar analysis has not yet been conducted for Protocol W. Protocol W is the second study in diabetic retinopathy showing benefit of a less frequent EYLEA dosing regimen. 
And we are planning on filing to expand the U.S. EYLEA label by adding the 16-week dosing interval for appropriate patients in the second half of this year. By year-end, we are expecting first data from the Phase II study testing a high dose of EYLEA in wet AMD. From these data, we can expect early reads on anatomic differences and drying between the higher and lower dose at 8, and potentially, 12-week intervals. 
While the study data will not be definitive on durability measures, the Phase II study will help provide insights on what we might expect from the Phase III studies, which are testing dosing intervals out to 12 and 16 weeks. Importantly, in the 106 patients dosed in the open-label Phase II study so far, we haven't seen any concerning safety signals. The Phase III studies in wet AMD and in DME are expected to be fully enrolled by the second half of this year. 
Moving on to Dupixent in our immunology and inflammation portfolio. Dozens of recent presentations at key dermatology meetings highlight the ever-increasing scope of Dupixent efficacy and safety in patients as young as 6 years old, including rapid itch relief, sustained improvement in disease severity and overall quality of life. 
Importantly, Dupixent is not immunosuppressive, nor have -- we have not seen an increased risk of serious infections with Dupixent. This mounting wall of data and physician experience fortifies our belief that Dupixent will remain the preferred choice for multiple Type 2 inflammatory diseases. In the first quarter, we submitted data to support the use of Dupixent in children 6 to 11 years old with moderate to severe asthma. 
The BLA supplement has an action data for October 21 this year. A similar application has been submitted in the EU we previously announced positive data in the part A part of our Phase III trial in esoteric esophagitis and part B of this trial is fully enrolled. In addition, 2 Phase III trials of Dupixent in type 2 COPD are actively enrolling patients. Our complementary program with our anti IL-33 antibody, itepekimab, in a different group of COPD patients former spokes is progressing with both Phase III trials now enrolling. 
We believe that this broad COPD program, including Dupixent and itepekimab, may provide real benefit for many patients. Turning now to our novel approach to treat allergy by using cocktails of monoclonal antibodies to directly bind and inactivate the allergen. These cocktails are designed to act immediately and to be long-lasting and to replace currently cumbersome approaches to allergy desensitization that involve years of multiple weekly injections. 
The anti -- Beth Levine antibody cocktail binds and inactivates the Beth Levine allergen that causes birch pollen allergy, one of the most common seasonal allergies that occur in the spring. Following Phase II data showing immediate and long-lasting effects against allergen challenge, we initiated a Phase III study and results are expected later this year. Assuming success in the current study, we're planning to conduct a second Phase III study during an upcoming birch pollen season. 
Regarding our similarly designed Fel d 1 antibody cocktail for cat allergy, Phase II data were presented earlier this year at a quad AI meeting showing that single administration of the antibody cocktail prevented early asthma reactions in allergic patients and prevented lung function decline upon cat allergen exposure when compared to placebo. 
Following this positive data update, the first Phase III trial in cat allergies planned for later this year. We're enthusiastic about these novel additions to our inflammation and the knowledge portfolio that could represent new groundbreaking ways to treat allergic diseases. Moving on to Libtayo and our oncology portfolio. In the first quarter, Libtayo was approved for the first-line treatment of certain patients with non-small cell lung cancer and for advanced basal cell carcinoma, each being crucial early milestones for our oncology strategy. 
In addition, a Phase III study, of Libtayo in second-line cervical cancer was stopped early for an overwhelmingly positive overall survival benefit, a first for any systemic treatment in these patients. These data will be shared at an upcoming medical meeting and regulatory submissions are planned for this year. 
Additionally, we look forward to sharing an expanded data set of cemiplimab, our anti-lag-3 program at the upcoming ASCO meeting. Cemiplimab is being studied in combination with Libtayo in first line melanoma. In the second half of this year, we anticipate results of an interim analysis for overall survival in our Phase III Libtayo lung cancer chemotherapy combination study. 
Moving on to our bispecific portfolio. In multiple myeloma, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific, for which we now hold exclusive development rights is continuing through dose escalation and dose expansion. We expect to initiate new combination studies in earlier lines of multiple myeloma later this year. Regeneron is uniquely positioned to mix and match multiple modalities and targets with the hope of increasing deep responses we are already observing with the CD3 bispecific. 
We are planning to add a co-stim bispecific to our arsenal of clinical stage multiple myeloma investigational therapies early next year. Moving to lymphoma. Responses to our CD20xCD3 bispecific odronextamab demonstrates increasing durability Regarding the partial clinical hold on this program, we have agreed to a pass forward with the FDA, submitted the updated protocol and are expected to hear back on lifting the partial hold in the very near term. 
Enrollment of the follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cohorts of the Phase II pivotal INTENT trial should resume quickly thereafter. Additionally, testing of the odronextamab subcutaneous formulation will start later this year and the paired co-stim bispecific combination is also on track to initiate within the next 12 months.
Regarding our solid tumor efforts with our bispecific, ovarian cancer is the first indication for which we are already clinically testing 2 different types of bispecifics for the appropriate tumor target, MUC16. Dose escalation of our MUC16xCD3 bispecific is ongoing, and we are hoping to share initial data next year, if not sooner. 
In the MUC16xCD28 co-stim study, patients are dosed in combination with Libtayo, and dose escalation is ongoing. Combination of the CD3 and CD28 co-stim bispecifics targeting MUC16 will start later this year, and it has the potential to be a game-changing strategy for treatment of these solid tumors. In prostate cancer, PSMAxCD28 and is in dose escalation studies with Libtayo, and we hope to share initial data next year or sooner. As seen in our other programs, we are planning on introducing a potentially complementary CD3 bispecific to the clinic later this year, rounding out a powerful and unique tool kit for prostate cancer, currently considered unresponsive to immunotherapy. 
Regarding our early efforts in lung cancer and other solid tumors, our EGFRxCD28 co-stim bispecific is in dose escalation phase, and patients are now dosed in combination -- are now being dosed in combination with Libtayo. Our MET X MET bispecific antibody is in the dose expansion state. Recall that this study is enrolling non-small cell lung cancer patients with a broad selection of patients, including MET Exon 14 gene mutations, gene amplication and/or elevated MET protein expression. 
We believe our oncology portfolio is one of the most exciting in the field and has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of diverse, difficult-to-treat cancers. Finally, I would like to highlight our capabilities regarding the Regeneron genetic center and our genetics medicines efforts. In addition to being able to discover and validate targets that we can address with our Velocity antibody platform, we're working with our collaborators to develop 3 additional platforms that have the potential to generate new classes of genetics based medicines. 
First, gene editing. We are eager awaiting initial results from the first systemic based CRISPR approach to be announced midyear by our collaborator Intellia. If positive, these results will validate this gene editing platform for a host of genetic targets identified by the Regeneron Genetic center and being investigated under our collaboration with Intellia. 
Second, we are also excited about our Alnylam collaboration with its validated siRNA platform approach that consumably addressed complementary genetics targets. Our Alnylam, target ALN-HSD directed to HSD-17b13, a target discovered by the Regeneron Genetic Center, is now enrolling NASH patients. Additionally, we and Alnylam are collaborated in a series of follow-on targets. While the technology is currently validated for liver-directed therapeutic approaches, we are set to extend to eye and central nervous system targets. Our third genetic medicines approach involves viral gene therapy delivery and is another approach of significant interest and excitement at Regeneron. 
Our first gene therapy program is in collaboration with decibel focusing on targeting the ear. We in decile are planning to enter the clinic with DB-OTO next year. In addition to the AAVs targeting the year, we are developing a platform for use in multiple other tissues of interest. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Marion."

We're off to an exciting start in 2021. Our expanded commercial portfolio includes 3 recent product and indication launches, and we continue to grow our largest brands, EYLEA, Dupixent and Libtayo, based on competitive and differentiated profiles. Beginning with EYLEA, first quarter global net sales grew 17% year-over-year to nearly $2.2 billion. 
In the U.S., EYLEA net sales grew 15% year-over-year to $1.35 billion based on increased demand and a favorable comparison to the early weeks of the pandemic and the first quarter of 2020. EYLEA is capturing category growth and continues to be the preferred treatment option. In the branded anti-VEGF category, EYLEA has approximately 75% share and is approaching 50% of the combined branded and unbranded category. 
EYLEA is differentiated by the combination of its efficacy, safety, dosing flexibility and range of indications in addition, physicians have considerable real-world experience with more than 40 million injections administered worldwide. Across the broader category, demand continues to improve in 2021 and as patient floor normalizes and new patient volume grows, we are confident in our near and longer-term outlook based on favorable patient demographics, physician preference for EYLEA, growth opportunities in diabetic eye disease and future opportunities with our high dose clinical program. 
Turning to Libtayo. First quarter global net sales grew to $101 million, with U.S. net sales of $69 million, the vast majority of first quarter sales were in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, where Libtayo is the #1 systemic treatment. We're excited by recent approvals in non-small cell lung cancer and basal cell carcinoma, or BCC, both of which represent meaningful growth opportunities for Libtayo. In April, we deployed our expanded and highly experienced field force across these indications to extend our Libtayo promotional impact. 
In lung cancer, we have heard from oncologists that Libtayo is highly competitive based on the strength of our compelling clinical data and overall value proposition. Early launch indicators are encouraging with uptake evidence at top academic and community-based practices. We're advancing formulary placement, securing favorable payer coverage decisions and growing overall market awareness. 
Importantly, Libtayo was rapidly included in the NCCN guidelines with a Category 1 preferred rating. The NCCN guidelines have also been updated to include Libtayo in BCC as the category IIa option, Libtayo is the only anti-PD-1 approved in advanced disease for this indication. Early feedback has been encouraging as physicians are eager to prescribe Libtayo based on its efficacy and tolerability. Hedgehog inhibitors despite being used as first-line treatment may not be suitable for patients for long-term or repeat use. Libtayo is an important new care alternative for BCC patients. 
In summary, our lung and BCC launches are progressing according to plan, and we are highly focused on ensuring that appropriate patients benefit from Libtayo. 
Turning now to Obtusa, which was also approved in the first quarter of 2021 and is in the initial launch phase. Obtusa represents a novel and effective treatment for patients with homozygous familial hypercholesteremia and is recognized by treating specialists as an improvement over the current standard of care. Patient demand is steadily building with multiple patients be initiated on therapy. 
Moving to Dupixent. Global net sales in the first quarter were $1.26 billion, representing 48% growth compared to the prior year. In the U.S., broad-based growth across all approved indications generated net sales of $962 million, with the new patient starts now higher than pre COVID levels. In atopic dermatitis, Dupixent's largest indication, prescribing continues to be strong across both moderate and severe disease and across age groups following our adolescent and pediatric launches. There's significant opportunity for continued growth based on remaining unmet need among eligible patients. 
Dupixent is the #1 dermatologist prescribed biologic based on the depth and breadth of its long-term efficacy and safety profile. Turning to asthma, where we are actively preparing to launch in pediatric patients as young as 6 years of age later this year. Among adolescents and adults, we continue to meaningfully expand the number of Dupixent patients initiations, driven by our extensive provider and patient educational efforts. 
In addition, demand is strong among ENTs and Allergists for patients with nasal polyps. Dupixent is the fastest-growing biologic in respiratory disease in our approved indications with substantial room for growth. I'd also like to highlight efforts supporting our antibody cocktail, REGEN-COV. In the first quarter, we recorded U.S. net sales of $262 million under the first contract with U.S. government. 
REGEN-COV is currently authorized under an EUA in patients based on age and risk factors, which represent close to 40% of all adults diagnosed with COVID-19. We're focused on reducing bottlenecks and increasing utilization, particularly in states with high infection rates. Efforts include direct support to key facilities, medical education about REGEN-COV, partnering with third-party stakeholders and educating consumers on the availability of antibody treatments. 
As George mentioned, we're preparing for a potential update of the REGEN-COV EUA to include prevention as we hope to be able to address an unmet need for millions of patients to maybe candidates for ongoing preventative treatment. Preventative therapy may also be important for those who have known COVID exposure and require very rapid protection.
In summary, we delivered robust performance across our portfolio in the first quarter of the year. There's strong positive momentum from our in-line business, encouraging early signals from our recent launches and substantial opportunity for continued diversified growth. Now I'll turn the call over to Bob."

As Len stated, Regeneron is off to a strong start in 2021 as we continue",815,"Thanks, Mary, and good morning and afternoon to everyone listening to the call. My comments today are on financial results, and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis where applicable. As Len stated, Regeneron is off to a strong start in 2021 as we continue to execute across the business, delivering double-digit top and bottom line growth in the first quarter. For the first quarter, total revenues grew 38% year-over-year to $2.5 billion, driven by growth in global EYLEA sales, increased Sanofi collaboration profitability driven by Dupixent and sales of our REGEN-COV antibody cocktail. 
Diluted net income per share grew 50% year-over-year to $9.89 on net income of $1.1 billion. Excluding revenues related to REGEN-COV, Regeneron achieved 20% total revenue growth versus the prior year. As you heard from Marion, we completed our initial contract to supply REGEN-COV to the U.S. government in the first quarter. Assuming that we secure an updated EUA for the 1.2 gram treatment dose, we expect to deliver at least 1 million doses of REGEN-COV at $2,100 per dose for our follow-on contract with the U.S. government in the second quarter. 
I will now move to collaboration revenues, which were $754 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $528 million in the first quarter of 2020. Starting with the Bayer collaboration. Ex U.S. EYLEA net product sales reported to us by Bayer were $824 million for the first quarter of 2021 and representing growth of 21% on a reported basis and 12% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $323 million of which we recorded $309 million for our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S. 
Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $365 million in the first quarter. Our share of the profits from the commercialization of DUPIXENT and KEVZARA was $261 million, which compares favorably to profits of $171 million in the prior year driven by Dupixent. We recorded initial gross collaboration revenues of $67 million for our share of gross profits from the distribution of the antibody cocktail by Roche outside of the U.S. Other revenue decreased to $50 million in the first quarter compared to $63 million in the prior year. In 2021, we expect this line to be less than half of what we recorded in 2020 due to lower BARDA reimbursements for the Ebola and COVID-19 programs. 
Moving on to our operating expenses and starting with R&D. R&D increased 28% year-over-year to $673 million, primarily due to continued clinical development costs for our REGEN-COV antibody cocktail. Next, SG&A expense increased 16% year-over-year to $355 million. The year-over-year increase was driven by commercial investments for Libtayo costs related to the rollout of REGEN-COV and higher employee-related expenses. 
Cost of goods sold increased versus the prior year from $70 million to $173 million due to REGEN-COV manufacturing costs and Praluent manufacturing costs in the U.S., which were recorded by Sanofi in the first quarter of 2020. Additionally, in other income and expense, we recorded $4 million of expense compared to $25 million of income in the prior year. This is driven by interest expense related to our $2 billion debt issuance in August 2020 in lower investment returns on our existing cash and marketable securities. 
Finally, the effective tax rate was 10.5% in the first quarter of 2021 included in this rate is the benefit achieved by a reduction in uncertain tax position liabilities related to the IRS audits of the 2015 and 2016 tax years. Shifting now to cash flow and the balance sheet. In the first quarter of 2021, Regeneron generated $553 million in free cash flow and ended the quarter with net cash and marketable securities of $5.1 billion. 
In the first quarter, we utilized $323 million of our $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization, and we remain opportunistic buyers in the market. I would now like to provide select updates to our 2021 guidance. A complete summary of our latest full year guidance is available in our press release published earlier this morning. 
We are updating full year 2021 guidance for COCM to be in the range of $660 million to $730 million, the lower guidance range is related to the timing of contract manufacturing of Praluent for Sanofi. We are also updating guidance for our 2021 non-GAAP effective tax rate to be in the range of 13% to 15% and the increase from prior guidance is driven by higher forecasted delivery of REGEN-COV under our second U.S. government contract, which is taxed at the U.S. statutory rate. 
In conclusion, Regeneron is off to a strong start in 2021 and continues to execute across all aspects of the business. We are well positioned for the remainder of 2021 and continue to make those investments necessary to ensure long-term growth. With that, I would now like to turn the call back to Justin."

First, let me say that we are seeing tremendous experience with Dupixent in the marketplace today. And this obviously is across indications, including atopic dermatitis and also very importantly, across age categories, which demonstrate not only the efficacy, the speed of action, the safety, the tolerability, we pay really close attention to competitives coming into the marketplace. And certainly, in the case of the JAK inhibitors, we're well aware of the multiple delays. 
Also recent clinical data that is calling into question, issues of safety, especially at the higher doses. But even at the lower doses and the continuation of black box warnings, we hear from our key opinion leaders who use Dupixent and see it as their mainstay of therapy currently and going forward with great confidence in the safety profile. 
This is a chronic therapy. And certainly, the risk of hematologic effects, malignancies, infection and so on are just not something that is tolerable for these patients when they have a tremendous alternative. So I think we feel very confident in our competitive profile going forward. And also remind that Dupixent, obviously, based on its mode of action, has great efficacy across type 2 disease and other indications. Patients do sometimes have concomitant conditions so on balance, we'll stay very close to this and to our key opinion leaders and specialists, who are very, very confident in the profile of Dupixent."

One is the safety will be particularly concerning, I think, for the long-term treatment of children. And so I think the safety profile that Dupixent has shown is really, frankly, it's almost in parallel in terms of what you can do with the agent on the efficacy side and not have any significant concerns on the safety side. The other point in terms of the penetration, even if you look at how these markets have evolved, when more agents have come on for rheumatoid arthritis and for psoriasis. 
The penetration is so low here that even with competition, there is room for market growth rather than direct fighting it out in terms of a fixed amount of market share. So we expect our profile safety, as Marion says, to be really paramount in treating physicians' minds. And we do think the low level of penetration thus far does leave room for growth nonetheless."

But in terms of the commercial side of this, when you talk the kind of patients we're treating moderate to severe atopic dermatitis. They have lesions of a large fraction of their body. I can't remember exactly what it was in our trials. But what we're seeing out there commercially is large fractions of the body are affected by this disease. And so I think that adding topicals, perhaps, but people are actually trying to get away from having to lather up over their entire body. 
The other thing about Dupixent that we can never forget is that the broad aspects of approvals across lots of allergic diseases and with a growing number is very important because these diseases do tend to run in groups. There are many people who have asthma and atopic dermatitis or asthma and nasal polyposis or atopic dermatitis and other allergic diseases, which we're studying. 
So I think that our broad profile across lots of other diseases is also going to give us a very strong competitive position."

We did have a favorable outcome with regards to uncertain tax positions that we were able to reverse which kind of drove a little lower in the quarter on that front. 
On operating margins, Geoff, I guess the one piece that's not so transparent to everybody is we're still incurring a lot of R&D as it pertains to REGEN-COV with regards to the trials, the enrollment numbers. So I don't want people to come away and say, as a result of the Roche benefit we got in the REGEN-COV product sales that without that the margins wouldn't have been as good, but we did incur a lot of expenses pertaining to that, that aren't within the R&D line that we just don't specifically talk about. 
The business on its own, excluding REGEN-COV was 20% top line and 35% EBIT, okay? So again, it shows you the underlying strength, as you've heard from Len at the very beginning of his words in terms of how we're performing. We think the operating margin is -- can continue to stay at that and improve at that level. I mean, certainly, it's the leverage on Dupixent, right, to the extent -- you saw that Sanofi did a terrific job ex U.S. where we're starting to get a little momentum in terms of ex U.S. sales. So to the extent that, that will continue to play out, we'll continue to get good operating margins associated with that, and then that will drive our overall margins."

I'll mention that certainly with EYLEA, one of important attribute is the ability to treat and extend therapy. And there are some elements of that clinical trial design that constrained EYLEA's dosing interval. We actually hear on a regular basis that one of the reasons why EYLEA is performing so well in the first quarter of 2021 and frankly, performed so well last year is because of its efficacy and the ability to treat and extend for patients.

And then at the same time, recognizing Dupixent safety profile. So at the same time, we take care of the asthma, and as Len mentioned before, the possibility of concomitant disease is associated with type 2 disease. So we do feel that this will be a very important indication launch. We look forward to it. And this again confirms the efficacy and the safety of Dupixent."

And remember that we launched in atopic dermatitis several years before we did in the asthma marketplace, both are growing very, very strongly. 
And certainly, as we look at the future potential for Dupixent in atopic dermatitis, we have a long way to go. There's still tremendous unmet need across all age groups, the youngest patients, adolescents and adults. And then the asthma marketplace as well. It's important to note that today, about 75% of the patients in asthma going on Dupixent are biologic naive. So we're getting these new starts. 
There's tremendous opportunity and Dupixent has been one of the growers of the overall asthma biologics marketplace. As mentioned in the -- in response to the earlier question, we look forward to, with an FDA approval, to launch in pediatrics later this year, but among adults and adolescents there's still tremendous opportunity in asthma as well.

We're off to a strong start in 2021, again delivering double-digit growth on the top and bottom lines. I'm immensely proud of all that Regeneron continues to accomplish in the fight against COVID and for patients suffering from a variety of diseases. Our performance highlights the continued evolution, diversification and durability of our business as we enter a new phase of growth and new product launches. 
Strong performance begins with differentiated products that deliver real value for patients. Starting with EYLEA. Global net sales were nearly $2.2 billion, growing 17% compared to the prior year. In the U.S., sales grew 15%, reflecting continued positive momentum and execution on our strategy. We are confident in the EYLEA business and expect it will remain a key growth driver for Regeneron for years to come. 
We are also very pleased with the performance of Dupixent in the quarter, where global sales approached $1.3 billion and grew 48%. The brand is now annualizing sales in excess of $5 billion. Yet we believe there remains considerable room for further market growth and penetration in atopic dermatitis, asthma, and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis. 
With several additional potential indications in Phase III trials, such as eosinophilic esophagitis, and COPD, we are still in the early days of realizing the full potential of this unique pipeline in the product. In oncology, we are making steady progress with Libtayo as global net sales reached $101 million and grew 35% from the prior year. 
Importantly, in February, we secured 2 new FDA approvals for Libtayo in basal cell carcinoma and in non-small cell lung cancer, which we anticipate will help fuel a new period of growth for this product that is a foundation to our oncology strategy. While still in very early days with these new launches, we are seeing encouraging signals on a variety of leading indicators, from thought leaders, prescribers, payers and patients. 
And last but not least, we were able to deliver significant Phase III outcome data for our REGEN-COV program, aimed at treating and preventing COVID-19 infections. As George will outline momentarily, we have now shown that our antibody cocktail dramatically reduces hospitalizations or death in non-hospitalized COVID infected patients and reduces symptomatic infections when given as a preventative measure. 
We are seeking to update our emergency use authorization to reflect these new data and uses as well as the lower 1.2 gram dose. Thinking longer-term for REGEN-COV, we see an ongoing global need for treatment and chronic prevention of COVID disease. Despite high rates of vaccination, it's estimated that tens of millions will remain unvaccinated in the U.S. alone. 
And of those who are vaccinated, significant numbers will not mount a protective response, such as those who are immunocompromised or immunosuppressed. It is important to recognize Regeneron's, and the bio-pharmaceutical industry at large, response and ongoing actions in combating COVID-19. Breakthrough vaccines and treatments are having a profound impact on the health and well-being of people in the United States and around the globe. 
In addition, safe and effective vaccines and treatments are enabling economic recovery. All of these critical benefits come as a result of the investments that have been made in technologies over decades by both the public and private sectors. These profound effects highlight the importance of a healthy bio-pharmaceutical industry that fully incentivizes innovation so that new solutions to emerging disease can rapidly be invented and deployed. 
We've also learned that these extraordinary approaches to preventing and treating COVID-19 can work only with people who actually receive the vaccines or drugs. For example, an internal health economic analysis projected that tens of thousands of lives in the United States could be saved over the next several months if REGEN-COV were fully deployed and given to all appropriate patients who are diagnosed with COVID-19 and at high-risk for hospitalization or death. 
And this is the case where cost to patients is not an issue as the government is providing the drug free of charge. Clearly, we have to better understand why a drug that has demonstrated overwhelming evidence for its ability to reduce hospitalizations or death by 70%, is in ample supply, has been endorsed by the NIH, has been authorized under an EUA by the FDA and is free of charge to patients, is not being taken full advantage of. 
Regeneron is committed to collaborating with our health care partners to take optimal advantage of the REGEN-COV cocktail potential health benefits. Overall, we are pleased in all that Regeneron has accomplished in the first 3 months of the year and look forward to continued momentum and progress across our diverse pipeline in the months to come. Now I will turn the call over to George."
33715,710499570,2305545,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 06, 2021",2021-05-06,"Earnings Calls","Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Len.

With COVID-19 still in the headlines, I will start with our monoclonal antibiotic treatment, REGEN-COV cocktail. We recently reported data from a large Phase III outcomes trial in the outpatient setting, confirming that REGEN-COV reduced the risk of hospitalization or death by 70% with both the 2.4 gram and the lower 1.2 gram doses. 
We are pleased that based on these data, the NIH guidelines were updated in early April to include a strong recommendation for monoclonal antibody combinations to treat out patients with mild or moderate COVID-19, as defined by the EUA criteria. We also recently reported data from a large 2-part Phase III trial of REGEN-COV, with Part A in the preventative setting and Part B in recently infected patients. In Part A of the trial, REGEN-COV prevented 81% of symptomatic COVID-19 infections, with 93% prevention after the first week. 
A supportive study in healthy volunteers that explored chronic dosing showed a similar 92% prevention of infection. Notably, these results were achieved with a convenient and subcutaneous formulation. Chronic prevention with our antibody cocktail may prove to be critical in the ongoing battle against this virus. Despite high rates of vaccination, it is estimated that tens of millions of Americans will remain unvaccinated, thus at risk for future infection. In addition, it is estimated that millions of Americans will not mount an adequate response to vaccines. 
For example, immunocompromised individuals or organ transplant patients, or who suffer from certain cancers such as lymphomas, leukemias and myelomas or an immunosuppressant therapies for their autoimmune diseases might all be candidates for chronic prevention using our antibody cocktail. 
Part B of this Phase III trial in recently infected patients showed that the subcutaneous administration of the 1.2 gram dose was also effective in reducing symptomatic disease and shortening disease duration. We are anticipating the existing EUA will be amended based upon the above data to include the 1.2 gram REGEN-COV dose to allow the cocktail to be used for prevention and to include the subcutaneous formulation for ease of use. 
We believe the current data is supportive of a potential formal BLA approvals by the FDA. I would like to remind everyone that outside of the United States, where some countries have an even more ongoing dire need for COVID-19 medicines, our partner, Roche, is rapidly expanding availability of the treatment. 
Last year, we anticipated that certain variants were likely to emerge and therefore designed our current cocktail to be active against these variants. Experimental evidence suggests that our cocktail is indeed active against all current variants of concern. Similarly, in the anticipation of future variants that may emerge, we are bringing additional antibodies to the clinic shortly. 
Moving on to EYLEA. A recent NIH sponsored Protocol W trial in non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy patients confirm results of our own PANORAMA study. After 2 years, EYLEA reduced vision-threatening complications by 6% to 8% compared to a group of patients who delayed treatment. 
A recent Regeneron follow-up analysis in the similar designed PANORAMA trial found that delaying treatment resulted in 3x as many patients suffering prolonged vision loss compared to those receiving preventative EYLEA treatment during a 2-year period. A similar analysis has not yet been conducted for Protocol W. Protocol W is the second study in diabetic retinopathy showing benefit of a less frequent EYLEA dosing regimen. 
And we are planning on filing to expand the U.S. EYLEA label by adding the 16-week dosing interval for appropriate patients in the second half of this year. By year-end, we are expecting first data from the Phase II study testing a high dose of EYLEA in wet AMD. From these data, we can expect early reads on anatomic differences and drying between the higher and lower dose at 8, and potentially, 12-week intervals. 
While the study data will not be definitive on durability measures, the Phase II study will help provide insights on what we might expect from the Phase III studies, which are testing dosing intervals out to 12 and 16 weeks. Importantly, in the 106 patients dosed in the open-label Phase II study so far, we haven't seen any concerning safety signals. The Phase III studies in wet AMD and in DME are expected to be fully enrolled by the second half of this year. 
Moving on to Dupixent in our immunology and inflammation portfolio. Dozens of recent presentations at key dermatology meetings highlight the ever-increasing scope of Dupixent efficacy and safety in patients as young as 6 years old, including rapid itch relief, sustained improvement in disease severity and overall quality of life. 
Importantly, Dupixent is not immunosuppressive, nor have -- we have not seen an increased risk of serious infections with Dupixent. This mounting wall of data and physician experience fortifies our belief that Dupixent will remain the preferred choice for multiple Type 2 inflammatory diseases. In the first quarter, we submitted data to support the use of Dupixent in children 6 to 11 years old with moderate to severe asthma. 
The BLA supplement has an FDA action date of October 21 of this year. A similar application has been submitted in the EU. We previously announced positive data in the part A part of our Phase III trial in eosinophilic esophagitis and part B of this trial is fully enrolled. In addition, 2 Phase III trials of Dupixent in type 2 COPD are actively enrolling patients. Our complementary program with our anti IL-33 antibody, itepekimab, in a different group of COPD patients former smokers is progressing with both Phase III trials now enrolling. 
We believe that this broad COPD program, including Dupixent and itepekimab, may provide real benefit for many patients. Turning now to our novel approach to treat allergy by using cocktails of monoclonal antibodies to directly bind and inactivate the allergen. These cocktails are designed to act immediately and to be long-lasting and to replace currently cumbersome approaches to allergy desensitization that involve years of multiple weekly injections. 
The anti -- [ Beth Levine ] antibody cocktail binds and inactivates the [ Beth Levine ] allergen that causes birch pollen allergy, one of the most common seasonal allergies that occur in the spring. Following Phase II data showing immediate and long-lasting effects against allergen challenge, we initiated a Phase III study and results are expected later this year. Assuming success in the current study, we're planning to conduct a second Phase III study during an upcoming birch pollen season. 
Regarding our similarly designed Fel d 1 antibody cocktail for cat allergy, Phase II data were presented earlier this year at a AAAAI meeting showing that single administration of the antibody cocktail prevented early asthma reactions in allergic patients and prevented lung function decline upon cat allergen exposure when compared to placebo. 
Following this positive data update, the first Phase III trial in cat allergies planned for later this year. We're enthusiastic about these novel additions to our inflammation and immunology portfolio that could represent new groundbreaking ways to treat allergic diseases. Moving on to Libtayo and our oncology portfolio. In the first quarter, Libtayo was approved for the first-line treatment of certain patients with non-small cell lung cancer and for advanced basal cell carcinoma, each being crucial early milestones for our oncology strategy. 
In addition, a Phase III study, of Libtayo in second-line cervical cancer was stopped early for an overwhelmingly positive overall survival benefit, a first for any systemic treatment in these patients. These data will be shared at an upcoming medical meeting and regulatory submissions are planned for this year. 
Additionally, we look forward to sharing an expanded data set of [ cemiplimab ], our anti-lag-3 program at the upcoming ASCO meeting. [ Cemiplimab ] is being studied in combination with Libtayo in first line melanoma. In the second half of this year, we anticipate results of an interim analysis for overall survival in our Phase III Libtayo lung cancer chemotherapy combination study. 
Moving on to our bispecific portfolio. In multiple myeloma, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific, for which we now hold exclusive development rights is continuing through dose escalation and dose expansion. We expect to initiate new combination studies in earlier lines of multiple myeloma later this year. Regeneron is uniquely positioned to mix and match multiple modalities and targets with the hope of increasing deep responses we are already observing with the CD3 bispecific. 
We are planning to add a co-stim bispecific to our arsenal of clinical stage multiple myeloma investigational therapies early next year. Moving to lymphoma. Responses to our CD20xCD3 bispecific odronextamab demonstrates increasing durability Regarding the partial clinical hold on this program, we have agreed to a path forward with the FDA, submitted the updated protocol and are expected to hear back on lifting the partial hold in the very near term. 
Enrollment of the follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cohorts of the Phase II pivotal INTENT trial should resume quickly thereafter. Additionally, testing of the odronextamab subcutaneous formulation will start later this year and the paired co-stim bispecific combination is also on track to initiate within the next 12 months.
Regarding our solid tumor efforts with our bispecific, ovarian cancer is the first indication for which we are already clinically testing 2 different types of bispecifics for the appropriate tumor target, MUC16. Dose escalation of our MUC16xCD3 bispecific is ongoing, and we are hoping to share initial data next year, if not sooner. 
In the MUC16xCD28 co-stim study, patients are dosed in combination with Libtayo, and dose escalation is ongoing. Combination of the CD3 and CD28 co-stim bispecifics targeting MUC16 will start later this year, and it has the potential to be a game-changing strategy for treatment of these solid tumors. In prostate cancer, PSMAxCD28 is in dose escalation studies with Libtayo, and we hope to share initial data next year or sooner. As seen in our other programs, we are planning on introducing a potentially complementary CD3 bispecific to the clinic later this year, rounding out a powerful and unique tool kit for prostate cancer, currently considered unresponsive to immunotherapy. 
Regarding our early efforts in lung cancer and other solid tumors, our EGFRxCD28 co-stim bispecific is in dose escalation phase, and patients are now dosed in combination -- are now being dosed in combination with Libtayo. Our MET X MET bispecific antibody is in the dose expansion state. Recall that this study is enrolling non-small cell lung cancer patients with a broad selection of patients, including MET exon 14 gene mutations, gene amplication and/or elevated MET protein expression. 
We believe our oncology portfolio is one of the most exciting in the field and has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of diverse, difficult-to-treat cancers. Finally, I would like to highlight our capabilities regarding the Regeneron genetic center and our genetics medicines efforts. In addition to being able to discover and validate targets that we can address with our VelociGene antibody platform, we're working with our collaborators to develop 3 additional platforms that have the potential to generate new classes of genetics-based medicines. 
First, gene editing. We are eagerly awaiting initial results from the first systemic based CRISPR approach to be announced midyear by our collaborator Intellia. If positive, these results will validate this gene editing platform for a host of genetic targets identified by the Regeneron Genetic center and being investigated under our collaboration with Intellia. 
Second, we are also excited about our Alnylam collaboration with its validated siRNA platform approach that consumably address complementary genetics targets. Our Alnylam, target ALN-HSD directed to HSD-17B13, a target discovered by the Regeneron Genetic Center, is now enrolling NASH patients. Additionally, we and Alnylam are collaborating on a series of follow-on targets. While the technology is currently validated for liver-directed therapeutic approaches, we are set to extend to eye and central nervous system targets. Our third genetic medicines approach involves viral gene therapy delivery and is another approach of significant interest and excitement at Regeneron. 
Our first gene therapy program is in collaboration with Decibel focusing on targeting the ear. We and Decile are planning to enter the clinic with DB-OTO next year. In addition to the AAVs targeting the year, we are developing a platform for use in multiple other tissues of interest. With that, I would like to turn the call over to Marion."

We're off to an exciting start in 2021. Our expanded commercial portfolio includes 3 recent product and indication launches, and we continue to grow our largest brands, EYLEA, Dupixent and Libtayo, based on competitive and differentiate",904,"Thank you, George. We're off to an exciting start in 2021. Our expanded commercial portfolio includes 3 recent product and indication launches, and we continue to grow our largest brands, EYLEA, Dupixent and Libtayo, based on competitive and differentiated profiles. Beginning with EYLEA, first quarter global net sales grew 17% year-over-year to nearly $2.2 billion. 
In the U.S., EYLEA net sales grew 15% year-over-year to $1.35 billion based on increased demand and a favorable comparison to the early weeks of the pandemic and the first quarter of 2020. EYLEA is capturing category growth and continues to be the preferred treatment option. In the branded anti-VEGF category, EYLEA has approximately 75% share and is approaching 50% of the combined branded and unbranded category. 
EYLEA is differentiated by the combination of its efficacy, safety, dosing flexibility and range of indications. In addition, physicians have considerable real-world experience with more than 40 million injections administered worldwide. Across the broader category, demand continues to improve in 2021 and as patient floor normalizes and new patient volume grows, we are confident in our near and longer-term outlook based on favorable patient demographics, physician preference for EYLEA, growth opportunities in diabetic eye disease and future opportunities with our high dose clinical program. 
Turning to Libtayo. First quarter global net sales grew to $101 million, with U.S. net sales of $69 million, the vast majority of first quarter sales were in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, where Libtayo is the #1 systemic treatment. We're excited by recent approvals in non-small cell lung cancer and basal cell carcinoma, or BCC, both of which represent meaningful growth opportunities for Libtayo. In April, we deployed our expanded and highly experienced field force across these indications to extend our Libtayo promotional impact. 
In lung cancer, we have heard from oncologists that Libtayo is highly competitive based on the strength of our compelling clinical data and overall value proposition. Early launch indicators are encouraging with uptake evidence at top academic and community-based practices. We're advancing formulary placement, securing favorable payer coverage decisions and growing overall market awareness. 
Importantly, Libtayo was rapidly included in the NCCN guidelines with a Category 1 preferred rating. The NCCN guidelines have also been updated to include Libtayo in BCC as the category IIa option, Libtayo is the only anti-PD-1 approved in advanced disease for this indication. Early feedback has been encouraging as physicians are eager to prescribe Libtayo based on its efficacy and tolerability. Hedgehog inhibitors despite being used as first-line treatment may not be suitable for patients for long-term or repeat use. Libtayo is an important new care alternative for BCC patients. 
In summary, our lung and BCC launches are progressing according to plan, and we are highly focused on ensuring that appropriate patients benefit from Libtayo. 
Turning now to Obtusa, which was also approved in the first quarter of 2021 and is in the initial launch phase. Obtusa represents a novel and effective treatment for patients with homozygous familial hypercholesteremia and is recognized by treating specialists as an improvement over the current standard of care. Patient demand is steadily building with multiple patients already initiated on therapy. 
Moving to Dupixent. Global net sales in the first quarter were $1.26 billion, representing 48% growth compared to the prior year. In the U.S., broad-based growth across all approved indications generated net sales of $962 million, with the new patient starts now higher than pre-COVID levels. In atopic dermatitis, Dupixent's largest indication, prescribing continues to be strong across both moderate and severe disease and across age groups following our adolescent and pediatric launches. There's significant opportunity for continued growth based on remaining unmet need among eligible patients. 
Dupixent is the #1 dermatologist prescribed biologic based on the depth and breadth of its long-term efficacy and safety profile. Turning to asthma, where we are actively preparing to launch in pediatric patients as young as 6 years of age later this year. Among adolescents and adults, we continue to meaningfully expand the number of Dupixent patients' initiations, driven by our extensive provider and patient educational efforts. 
In addition, demand is strong among ENTs and Allergists for patients with nasal polyps. Dupixent is the fastest-growing biologic in respiratory disease in our approved indications with substantial room for growth. I'd also like to highlight efforts supporting our antibody cocktail, REGEN-COV. In the first quarter, we recorded U.S. net sales of $262 million under the first contract with U.S. government. 
REGEN-COV is currently authorized under an EUA in patients based on age and risk factors, which represent close to 40% of all adults diagnosed with COVID-19. We're focused on reducing bottlenecks and increasing utilization, particularly in states with high infection rates. Efforts include direct support to key facilities, medical education about REGEN-COV, partnering with third-party stakeholders and educating consumers on the availability of antibody treatments. 
As George mentioned, we're preparing for a potential update of the REGEN-COV EUA to include prevention as we hope to be able to address an unmet need for millions of patients who may be candidates for ongoing preventative treatment. Preventative therapy may also be important for those who have known COVID exposure and require very rapid protection.
In summary, we delivered robust performance across our portfolio in the first quarter of the year. There's strong positive momentum from our in-line business, encouraging early signals from our recent launches and substantial opportunity for continued diversified growth. Now I'll turn the call over to Bob."

My comments today are on financial results, and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis where applicable. As Len stated, Regeneron is off to a strong start in 2021 as we continue",813,"Thanks, Mary, and good morning and afternoon to everyone listening to the call. My comments today are on financial results, and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis where applicable. As Len stated, Regeneron is off to a strong start in 2021 as we continue to execute across the business, delivering double-digit top and bottom line growth in the first quarter. For the first quarter, total revenues grew 38% year-over-year to $2.5 billion, driven by growth in global EYLEA sales, increased Sanofi collaboration profitability driven by Dupixent and sales of our REGEN-COV antibody cocktail. 
Diluted net income per share grew 50% year-over-year to $9.89 on net income of $1.1 billion. Excluding revenues related to REGEN-COV, Regeneron achieved 20% total revenue growth versus the prior year. As you heard from Marion, we completed our initial contract to supply REGEN-COV to the U.S. government in the first quarter. Assuming that we secure an updated EUA for the 1.2 gram treatment dose, we expect to deliver at least 1 million doses of REGEN-COV at $2,100 per dose for our follow-on contract with the U.S. government in the second quarter. 
I will now move to collaboration revenues, which were $754 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $528 million in the first quarter of 2020. Starting with the Bayer collaboration. Ex U.S. EYLEA net product sales reported to us by Bayer were $824 million for the first quarter of 2021 representing growth of 21% on a reported basis and 12% on a constant currency basis compared to the prior year. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $323 million of which we recorded $309 million for our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S. 
Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $365 million in the first quarter. Our share of the profits from the commercialization of Dupixent and Kevzara was $261 million, which compares favorably to profits of $171 million in the prior year driven by Dupixent. We recorded initial gross collaboration revenues of $67 million for our share of gross profits from the distribution of the antibody cocktail by Roche outside of the U.S. Other revenue decreased to $50 million in the first quarter compared to $63 million in the prior year. In 2021, we expect this line to be less than half of what we recorded in 2020 due to lower BARDA reimbursements for the Ebola and COVID-19 programs. 
Moving on to our operating expenses and starting with R&D. R&D increased 28% year-over-year to $673 million, primarily due to continued clinical development costs for our REGEN-COV antibody cocktail. Next, SG&A expense increased 16% year-over-year to $355 million. The year-over-year increase was driven by commercial investments for Libtayo, costs related to the rollout of REGEN-COV and higher employee-related expenses. 
Cost of goods sold increased versus the prior year from $70 million to $173 million due to REGEN-COV manufacturing costs and Praluent manufacturing costs in the U.S., which were recorded by Sanofi in the first quarter of 2020. Additionally, in other income and expense, we recorded $4 million of expense compared to $25 million of income in the prior year. This is driven by interest expense related to our $2 billion debt issuance in August 2020 and lower investment returns on our existing cash and marketable securities. 
Finally, the effective tax rate was 10.5% in the first quarter of 2021.  Included in this rate is the benefit achieved by a reduction in uncertain tax position liabilities related to the IRS audits of the 2015 and 2016 tax years. Shifting now to cash flow and the balance sheet. In the first quarter of 2021, Regeneron generated $553 million in free cash flow and ended the quarter with net cash and marketable securities of $5.1 billion. 
In the first quarter, we utilized $323 million of our $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization, and we remain opportunistic buyers in the market. I would now like to provide select updates to our 2021 guidance. A complete summary of our latest full year guidance is available in our press release published earlier this morning. 
We are updating full year 2021 guidance for COCM to be in the range of $660 million to $730 million, the lower guidance range is related to the timing of contract manufacturing of Praluent for Sanofi. We are also updating guidance for our 2021 non-GAAP effective tax rate to be in the range of 13% to 15%. The increase from prior guidance is driven by higher forecasted delivery of REGEN-COV under our second U.S. government contract, which is taxed at the U.S. statutory rate. 
In conclusion, Regeneron is off to a strong start in 2021 and continues to execute across all aspects of the business. We are well positioned for the remainder of 2021 and continue to make those investments necessary to ensure long-term growth. With that, I would now like to turn the call back to Justin."

First, let me say that we are seeing tremendous experience with Dupixent in the marketplace today. And this obviously is across indications, including atopic dermatitis and also very importantly, across age categories, which demonstrate not only the efficacy, the speed of action, the safety, the tolerability, we pay really close attention to competitives coming into the marketplace. And certainly, in the case of the JAK inhibitors, we're well aware of the multiple delays. 
Also recent clinical data that is calling into question, issues of safety, especially at the higher doses. But even at the lower doses and the continuation of black box warnings, we hear from our key opinion leaders who use Dupixent and see it as their mainstay of therapy currently and going forward with great confidence in the safety profile. 
This is a chronic therapy. And certainly, the risk of hematologic effects, malignancies, infection and so on are just not something that is tolerable for these patients when they have a tremendous alternative. So I think we feel very confident in our competitive profile going forward. And also remind that Dupixent, obviously, based on its mode of action, has great efficacy across type 2 disease and other indications. Patients do sometimes have concomitant conditions so on balance, we'll stay very close to this and to our key opinion leaders and specialists, who are very, very confident in the profile of Dupixent."

The other point in terms of the penetration, even if you look at how these markets have evolved, when more agents have come on for rheumatoid arthritis and for psoriasis. 
The penetration is so low here that even with competition, there is room for market growth rather than direct fighting it out in terms of a fixed amount of market share. So we expect our profile safety, as Marion says, to be really paramount in treating physicians' minds. And we do think the low level of penetration thus far does leave room for growth nonetheless."

And so I think that adding topicals, perhaps, but people are actually trying to get away from having to lather up over their entire body. 
The other thing about Dupixent that we can never forget is that the broad aspects of approvals across lots of allergic diseases and with a growing number is very important because these diseases do tend to run in groups. There are many people who have asthma and atopic dermatitis or asthma and nasal polyposis or atopic dermatitis and other allergic diseases, which we're studying. 
So I think that our broad profile across lots of other diseases is also going to give us a very strong competitive position."

We did have a favorable outcome with regards to uncertain tax positions that we were able to reverse which kind of drove a little lower in the quarter on that front. 
On operating margins, Geoff, I guess the one piece that's not so transparent to everybody is we're still incurring a lot of R&D as it pertains to REGEN-COV with regards to the trials, the enrollment numbers. So I don't want people to come away and say, as a result of the Roche benefit we got in the REGEN-COV product sales that without that the margins wouldn't have been as good, but we did incur a lot of expenses pertaining to that, that aren't within the R&D line that we just don't specifically talk about. 
The business on its own, excluding REGEN-COV was 20% top line and 35% EBIT, okay? So again, it shows you the underlying strength, as you've heard from Len at the very beginning of his words in terms of how we're performing.

I mean, certainly, it's the leverage on Dupixent, right, to the extent -- you saw that Sanofi did a terrific job ex U.S. where we're starting to get a little momentum in terms of ex U.S. sales. So to the extent that, that will continue to play out, we'll continue to get good operating margins associated with that, and then that will drive our overall margins."

It's great that we have the capability for George and the BD team to go out and get other technologies, whether it be the Intellia driven technology on CRISPR, or Alnylam and the like. And we're continuing to play heavy in that space, and we need to make sure that things we go after are most likely going to be early stage. We're not looking for kind of transformative kind of M&A deals on that front as of right now, and we continue to stay hungry in that place with the right opportunities. 
And then as you saw, we did $325 million of share buybacks. We have a $1.5 billion program that we authorized in January. We are opportunistic buyers when we think the intrinsic value of where we see it compared to where the market is currently playing, we are going to take advantage of that -- of that delta, and we did such that in the first quarter, and we're continuing to do that on that front.

And still at the stage where the clinical data is being reviewed. As I mentioned to some of you who are in the last call, as we look at the clinical profile today of faricimab, we do not see a threat to EYLEA. Certainly, some of the recent data had some questions on clinical profile and certainly, with an increase in IOI rate question on the safety profile. I think the net conclusion on the key opinion leaders that I spoke to in the retinal community was that they didn't see an obvious benefit to the product and perhaps even questions in matching the safety, durability and clinical profile of Eylea across indications. 
I'll mention that certainly with EYLEA, one of important attribute is the ability to treat and extend therapy. And there are some elements of that clinical trial design that constrained EYLEA's dosing interval. We actually hear on a regular basis that one of the reasons why EYLEA is performing so well in the first quarter of 2021 and frankly, performed so well last year is because of its efficacy and the ability to treat and extend for patients. 
We remain very confident in EYLEA's profile against the competitive product you mentioned."

About 25% in respiratory disease, both asthma and nasal polyps, asthma, of course, being the larger of the 2 in respiratory disease. Both are growing very, very strongly. And remember that we launched in atopic dermatitis several years before we did in the asthma marketplace, both are growing very, very strongly. 
And certainly, as we look at the future potential for Dupixent in atopic dermatitis, we have a long way to go. There's still tremendous unmet need across all age groups, the youngest patients, adolescents and adults. And then the asthma marketplace as well. It's important to note that today, about 75% of the patients in asthma going on Dupixent are biologic naive. So we're getting these new starts. 
There's tremendous opportunity and Dupixent has been one of the growers of the overall asthma biologics marketplace. As mentioned in the -- in response to the earlier question, we look forward to, with an FDA approval, to launch in pediatrics later this year, but among adults and adolescents there's still tremendous opportunity in asthma as well.

We had an outstanding performance across the enterprise in the second quarter. Not only did our base business performed exceptionally well with strong growth from EYLEA, PIXENT and Libtayo, but we also delivered 1.25 million doses of Regeneron for the United States government, fulfilling the entire supply contract with BARDA. We also continue to advance multiple programs across our innovative R&D pipeline with several important readouts. 
Starting with EYLEA. Global net sales were over $2.3 billion growing 33% compared to the prior year, reflecting recovery from the COVID pandemic impact on the second quarter of 2020. In the U.S., sales grew 28% EYLEA continues to set a high bar in terms of efficacy, safety and convenience. 
Dupixent also performed exceptionally well this quarter with global sales of $1.5 billion and growth of 59%. This quarter also marks the first time we and Sanofi exceeded $1 billion in U.S. Dupixent quarterly net sales. There remains considerable room for further growth from our in-line indications as well as from potential new opportunities, such as in chronic spontaneous urticaria with CSU where last week, we announced positive Phase III study results. 
We have additional Phase III readouts in [indiscernible], eosinophilic esophagitis and pediatric atopic dermatitis later this year, which could advance our conviction of Dupixent is a pipeline in a product to address numerous inflammatory diseases. 
In oncology, the entire global net sales were $117 million and grew 46% with meaningful growth contributions from both inside and outside the United States. We also announced this morning that in a large [indiscernible] pivotal study in non-small cell lung cancer, Libtayo, combined with standard chemotherapy reduced the risk of death by nearly 30% and compared to chemotherapy alone. We are eager to share these data with regulatory agencies, which if approved, would dramatically increase the number of lung cancer eligible patients who could be treated with Libtayo. 
We also begin to see meaningful results from our Regeneron Genetics medicines pipeline. With our collaborators at Intellia, we showed the first ever proof-of-concept in vivo genome editing with NTLA-2001, investigation of CRISPR therapy for transthyretin amyloidosis or ATTR amyloidosis. This proof-of-concept study utilizing systemically administered CRISPR technology for genome modification suggests this approach could have broad applicability across a wide range of diseases. 
Beyond Intellia, our collaborations with Alnylam and [indiscernible] are helping to form a whole new pipeline for next-generation therapies beyond our broad and diverse antibody pipeline. The second quarter represented another landmark in our efforts to combat COVID-19, which unfortunately, despite considerable rates of vaccination, continues to be a major global health service with rising cases and emerging variants. 
In addition to fulfilling our entire supply contract with the United States government, we were able to secure emergency use authorization updates for our lower 1.2 gram subcutaneous dose as well as for post-exposure prophylaxis for certain appropriate patients who are at high risk for disease. Utilization is increasing ready and currently more than 50,000 doses ordered per week. We also announced that the U.K. recovery study showed a 20% reduction in risk of death in hospitalized patients would not mounted their own immune response. 
With these results, together with supporting data from Regeneron study in hospitalized patients that George will discuss momentarily, REGEN-COV has the potential if so authorized to be the first treatment be using a wide spectrum of COVID-19 disease settings from prevention through the hospitalized setting. 
In summary, our core business is strong and continues to diversify, and our innovative pipeline continues to advance, positioning Regeneron well long-term growth. 
Now I will turn the call over to George."
33715,1673288768,2364421,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2021",2021-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Len. We have a lot to talk about this morning, which is all possible because of our Regeneron colleagues who have been working nonstop throughout this pandemic.

We have a lot to talk about this morning, which is all possible because of our Regeneron colleagues who have been working nonstop throughout this pandemic. And unfortunately, the world is still in the throes of this global COVID-19 pandemic. As the number of infected individuals in the United States are climbing again with nearly 100,000 Americans becoming infected every day. Therefore, I will start with Regeneron with REGEN-COV, our monoclonal antibody cocktail for COVID-19. 
In June, the REGEN-COV Emergency Use Authorization, or EUA, was updated to include the lower 1.2 gram REGEN-COV dose with both intravenous and subcutaneous administration for nonhospitalized patients. This EUA was supported by Phase III data showing that the 1.2 gram dose reduce risk of hospitalization or death by 70%. Just last week, the EUA was further expanded to include utilization in post-exposure prophylaxis for COVID-19 in certain populations, and also allows for repeated monthly dosing of REGEN-COV for high-risk patients, such as the immunocompromised who are at high risk of ongoing exposure to infected individuals in the same institutional setting. 
This latest authorization makes REGEN-COV the only treatment that is available for both treating infected individuals and also preventing infection in certain settings. We would like to emphasize that REGEN-COV is not a substitute for vaccination. 
Still under review by the FDA are additional data, which we believe could broaden the prevention application to pre-exposure prophylaxis as well as to extend the treatment paradigm to hospitalized patients. The details of Part A of our Phase III prophylaxis study in which we assessed efficacy and safety of subcutaneous REGEN-COV in preventing infection among previously uninfected individuals has just been published today in the New England Journal of Medicine. 
We believe there is enormous unmet need to try to protect immunocomprised individuals who have not responded to the vaccine and we hope that the FDA will agree that our data will support an authorization in this pre-exposure prophylaxis setting. 
For hospitalized patients, we recently reported that REGEN-COV tested as part of the Oxford University Phase III RECOVERY study met its primary outcome, reducing risk of death by 20% in hospitalized COVID-19 patients lacking immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Data from our own smaller study in hospitalized COVID-19 patients showed similar conclusions with 35% reduction in overall mortality in this study, which was limited to earlier-stage hospitalized patients with no oxygen or low oxygen support. These collective data from recovery and from our study in hospitalized patients have been shared with regulators. 
In addition, we are on track to complete the REGEN-COV BLA submissions in the second half of 2021. Outside of the United States, our collaborator Roche obtained emergency or temporary pandemic use authorizations for our COVID-19 antibody cocktail, known as [indiscernible] outside the United States in more than 20 countries across the European Union, India, Switzerland and Canada, with more authorizations expected soon. Japan was the first country to grant formal regulatory approval to our antibody cocktail for COVID-19. 
Finally, REGEN-COV retains potent activity against all known variants of interest, including the Delta variant. For patients at high risk of serious consequences, including many with an inadequate response to vaccines, REGEN-COV could be an important option to patients and their physicians for the foreseeable future. 
Moving on to ophthalmology. In the coming months, we expect data from the Phase II study of high dose of libracept in wet AMD. This readout will consist of efficacy assessments on drawing in other anatomical measures as well as safety on the 8-milligram and the currently approved 2-milligram of libracept dose and an 8-week dosing interval. In the 106 patients dosed in the open-label Phase II to date, we have not seen any concerning safety signals. While the smaller study will not be definitive on durability measures, the Phase II data will help provide insights into the larger Phase III studies, which are testing high-dose aflibercept dosing intervals out to 12 and 16 weeks. I'm pleased to announce that the Phase III studies in DME and AMD have completed enrollment, allowing for Phase III data next year. 
Moving on to Dupixent in our immunology and inflammation portfolio. Just last week, we announced that a Phase III trial in chronic spontaneous urticaria, where CSU, met primary and all key 24-week secondary endpoints, showing Dupixent reduced itch and hive activity scores by nearly half. This is the fifth disease in which Dupixent demonstrated positive pivotal trial results and efficacy in this disease raises the possibility of IL-4 and IL-13 and are critical drivers in diseases not traditionally sought to be driven by type 2 inflammation. 
We plan to report results from a second trial in CSU patients who are not benefiting from the approved standard of care biologic in early 2022. This positive readout in CSU is continuing to build on Dupixent's efficacy and safety demonstrated across other inflammatory diseases. In the upcoming months, we also expect results from our confirmatory Phase IIIb study in adult and adolescent patients with eosinophilic esophagitis as well as readout of a Phase III study in [indiscernible]. Thus far, Dupixent is approved in patients as young as 6 years old in atopic dermatitis and 12 years old in asthma. Later this year, we will report data from a Phase III study in preschool children as young as 6 months up to 5 years of age suffering from atopic dermatitis. In asthma, we anticipate a regulatory decision in October for children aged 6 to 11 years old in the United States. 
Moving to our anti interleukin-33 antibody, [indiscernible]. Results of the Phase II study in COPD patients were recently published in Lancet Respiratory Medicine. All the trial exhibited strong trends in its primary endpoint of exacerbation reduction in the overall population, which did not meet statistical significance, a prespecified subgroup analysis of former smokers with COPD is what accounted for the overall benefit with no negative subset in the remaining population. In the prespecified former smoker subgroup, [ Itupikumab ] demonstrated a 42% reduction in exacerbations and improvement in lung function of 0.09 liters compared to placebo with both endpoints reaching nominal statistical significance. 
Moreover, the publication includes genetic analyses that support a protective role for interleukin-33 in COPD. Based on these results, we and Sanofi are assessing the potential of [indiscernible] in 2 Phase III studies focus on the former smoker population with COPD. 
I should also remind you that we have 2 ongoing studies we face 2 ongoing Phase III studies with Dupixent in a complementary COPD population. We are also progressing our novel approaches to treat allergies by using cocktails of monoclonal antibodies to directly bind and inactivate allergens, which have produced robust results in Phase II studies. Results of the initial Phase III study of our antibody cocktail against virtue allergy caused by the Bet v 1 allogen are expected later this year. The first Phase III study of an antibody cocktail for cat allergy caused by the FELv1 allogen, is now open for enrollment. 
We are enthusiastic about these innovative additions to our inflammation and immunology portfolio. In oncology, following its recent approvals in the United States or certain first-line non-small cell lung cancer in certain advanced basal cell carcinoma patients, Libtayo was subsequently approved in the EU for these settings. Furthermore, compelling overall survival data in second-line cervical cancer patients were presented at an ESMO virtual planar in May with the regulatory submissions to the FDA and EMA planned for this year. 
For lung cancer, we are pleased to report today that in our Phase III trial comparing with Tylus standard chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone the independent data monitoring committee recommended halting the trial for efficacy at the second interim analysis. Libtayo plus chemotherapy significantly improved overall survival as well as progression-free surveil compared to chemotherapy alone in first-line locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. 
With these data, Libtayo is now the second PD-1 targeting antibody that has been able to demonstrate significant overall survival benefit both as a monotherapy as well as in combination with chemotherapy for treating advanced lung cancer. With this validation, Libtayo provides an important foundation for a broad and multifaceted approach to address the great unmet need that patients with cancer in general and lung cancer, in particular, still face. 
In addition to our Libtayo monotherapy and chemo combination opportunities in lung cancer, we are developing several bispecifics. Our EGFR by CD28 costim and Libtayo combination is in dose escalation for lung and other advanced cancers. Our MET X MET bispecific antibody is enrolling non-small cell lung cancer patients with a broad selection of patients, including MET exon 14 gene mutation, gene amplification and/or elevated MET protein expression. 
And as we introduced at our ASCO investor event, our first antibody drug conjugate MET X MET ADC, is poised to enter the clinic in the coming months with a focus on patients with net overexpressing cancers, including lung cancer, where MET over expression occurs in as many as 25% patients. 
In terms of building on the potential of [indiscernible] with combinations in skin cancer, we recently announced new clinical data for the combination with limb our LAG-3 inhibitor, in advanced melanoma at the ASCO annual meeting in June. The combination demonstrated a 67% response rate in PD-1 or PDL-1 naive patients with potential for a more favorable safety profile than with anti-CTLA-4 PD-1 combinations. We plan to initiate a Phase III study of [indiscernible] and Libtayo as a first-line treatment for advanced melanoma in 2022. 
Ovarian cancer is the first tumor type for which we are clinically testing 3 powerful combinant approaches. First, our MUX16xC3 bispecific with Libtayo, where we hope to share initial data next year. Next, our MUX16xCD28 costim bispecific with Libtayo. And third, our novel combination of the CD3 and costim bispecifics for which we have now dosed the first patient. 
This latter combination of 2 bispecifics of 2 different classes has potential to be a novel and disruptive approach for the treatment of solid tumors. Rounding out my commentary in solid tumors, our PSMAxCD28 program in prostate cancer continues in dose escalation with Libtayo, and we hope to share initial data next year. 
As we mentioned previously, we are planning on introducing a PSMAxCD3 bispecific to the clinic later this year, providing another unique experimental combination for prostate cancer treatment. The tumor viewed as nonresponsive currently to available immunotherapies. 
Moving on to hematologic cancers and starting with lymphoma. Odronextamab, our CD23 bispecific has demonstrated encouraging efficacy and durability of responses in hard-to-treat patient emulations. We have resumed enrollment in our potentially pivotal Phase II program in follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, with lifting of the partial clinical hold following protocol amendments for a modified step-up dosing protocol. 
Later this year, we plan to initiate testing of the exome subcutaneous formulation. And next year, we plan to initiate the Phase III program as well as combination trials with our lymphoma-specific costim bispecific. 
In multiple myeloma, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific is on track to complete enrollment potentially pivotal Phase II study next year. We will also initiate studies evaluating a subcutaneous formulation in combinations with standard of care. With our unique position to mix and match multiple modalities and targets with the goal of deepening the responses we are already observing with our BCMAxCD3 bispecific we are on track to start a combination study with a costim bispecific for multiple myeloma next year. 
I would like to conclude with our Regeneron Genetic Medicines efforts. As you know, these efforts start with our Regeneron Genetics Center and its ability to genetically identify and validate new disease targets and is coupled with emerging gene-based therapeutic solutions to address these targets, including CRISPR-based technologies with our collaborator Intellia, siRNA technologies with Alnylam as well as viral gene debility technologies we are developing in-house. 
The Regeneron Genetics Center continues to emerge as a world leader in human sequencing and in defining genetic variants that can either be protective or causative for human disease. Most recently identifying a major new gene target that protects against obesity as described in a high-profile publication in [indiscernible] last month. For this newly discovered target, we are deploying several strategies to develop new classes of potential therapeutics to fight obesity and potentially type 2 diabetes. 
In terms of progress with our gene-based therapeutic approaches, together with the Intellia, we recently announced positive clinical data for the first ever systemically delivered CRISPR-based gene knockout in human patients. In the first 6 patients with transthyretin amyloidosis with TTR amyloidosis, a single systemic treatment led to dose-dependent reduction in the disease-causing protein with no serious adverse events observed through day 28. This proof of asset clinical data increases the probability of success for both our knockout as well as our insertion CRISPR-based programs, unlocking the potential of many future possibilities for Intellia and Regeneron. Currently, we're evaluating more than 20 preclinical programs under this collaboration, and Regeneron has the rights to develop up to 15 in vivo products with Intellia. 
Regarding our efforts with Alnylam, on an siRNA for a novel NASH target identified by the Regeneron Genetic Center, we are hoping to see initial healthy volunteer data by the end of this year. This 2-part first-in-human study is now enrolling NASH patients. We are currently evaluating about 20 preclinical programs under this collaboration and Regeneron has rights to develop up to 30 products with Alnylam. 
With that brief glimpse into the future of genetic medicines, I would like to turn the call over to Marion."

Our business performance in the second quarter reflects robust momentum, competitive strength and focused execution across our commercial portfolio. Our in-line medicines continue to thrive, and our ongoing launches are progressing to plan, providing a platform for spend growth. 
First, I will highlight our efforts supporting REGEN-COV, our COVID-19 antibody cocktail, which is available under emergency use authorization by the FDA. In the second quarter, U.S. net sales were $2.6 billion as a result of fulfilling our second contract with the U.S. government. There is significant ongoing need for effective treatments against COVID-19. As Len said, REGEN-COV utilization has recently accelerated and is now trending well over 50,000 doses ordered weekly. 
Uptake is driven by growing recognition of the importance of antibody cocktail treatment, focused educational efforts and competitive dynamics favoring REGEN-COV. We continue to work closely with all key stakeholders to increase REGEN-COV utilization and support hospitals and administration sites to reduce bottlenecks. 
The REGEN-COV antibody cocktail is both FDA authorized and NIH recommended and retains potency against known variants. We've also expanded our efforts following the recent post-exposure prophylaxis authorization, the first for an antibody therapy in this setting. 
Beyond REGEN-COV, our [indiscernible] portfolio performed very well in the second quarter. Starting with EYLEA. Second quarter global net sales grew 33% year-over-year to over $2.3 billion. In the U.S., EYLEA net sales grew 28% year-over-year to $1.42 billion, driven by underlying demand, category share gains and a favorable comparison versus the second quarter of 2020. EYLEA is the anti-VEGF category growth leader and preferred treatment option. 
As a reminder, EYLEA sets a high bar for efficacy and safety with more than 40 million injections administered worldwide, in a therapeutic category where patient vision and well-being are paramount. EYLEA continues to capture market and competitive share securing nearly 50% of the overall category and 75% of the branded category. 
Overall demand is improving with increased patient flow and return to pre-pandemic levels of new patient visits. Patients who may have delayed seeing the retina specialists are now seeking treatment. 
With this backdrop, we are accelerating promotional efforts to address the significant unmet needs in diabetic eye disease. We are confident in Regeneron's ongoing leadership position in retinal diseases, based on EYLEA's competitive advantages and future opportunities, including our high-dose program. 
Turning to Libtayo, where second quarter global net sales grew to $117 million, and the U.S. net sales grew 23% to $78 million. As expected, at this early stage of new indication launches, the vast majority of sales come from advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, where Libtayo is the #1 systemic treatment despite new in-class competition. 
Our launches in both advanced non-small cell lung cancer and basal cell carcinoma or BCC are progressing to plan. In BCC, Libtayo brand awareness is high among treating oncologists. We are encouraged by meaningful patient starts in the second quarter as Libtayo becomes a standard of care. 
We're also making considerable progress in lung cancer where efforts are focused on establishing Libtayo in our monotherapy indication and will be an important foundation for our potential future chemotherapy combination launch, which will be based on the data announced today. Our expanded field force is now fully deployed and securing early successes with treating physicians. 
We're raising brand awareness, progressing formulary positioning and payer coverage, lung cancer thought leaders recognized Libtayo's clinical differentiation, highlighting the rapid response rates and efficacy in patients with clinically stable brain metastases or high PD-L1 expression. In this highly competitive market, we remain focused on differentiating Libtayo and increasing physician experience. Today's exciting chemotherapy combination news has the potential to [indiscernible] expand the patient opportunity for Libtayo in non-small cell lung cancer. 
Turning now to FTSE, which was launched earlier this year in ultra-rare homozygous familial hypercholesteremia. Key thought leaders recognize the benefits of Atiza which delivers an efficacy, safety and tolerability in a market where many patients have struggled to stay on therapy in the face of life-threatening LDL-cholesterol levels. We're encouraged by early initiations across switch and new-to-category patients and can see a future where [indiscernible] becomes the standard of care. 
Moving to Dupixent. Global net sales in the second quarter were $1.5 billion, growing 59% compared to the prior year. In the U.S., net sales grew 49% to $1.15 billion driven by broad-based growth across all approved indications. New patient starts are steadily growing and are above pre-COVID levels. In atopic dermatitis, prescribing trends are strong across a spectrum of moderate to severe disease including adolescent and pediatric patients. There is significant and sustained growth opportunity for Dupixent in a market where it is the #1 dermatologist prescribed biologic. 
This is based on its well-established efficacy and safety profile, broad label for patients is dealing is 6 years old and unmatched real-world physician and patient experience. In addition, as George outlined, we see an exciting future opportunities in dermatology, starting with CSU. Dupixent is the leading biologic and respiratory disease poised to capture meaningful growth now and in the future. our asthma results outpace recent competitive biologic launches. Launch preparations are underway in the pediatric asthma setting the first regulatory approval expected in the U.S. this October. 
In nasal polyps, there's high demand among ants and allergists with patients initiated regardless of prior surgery. In summary, we delivered strong performance across our brands with current and potential future launches on track to deliver sustained growth. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Bob."
33715,1673288768,2364421,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2021",2021-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marion, and good morning and afternoon to everyone listening to the call.

My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis where applicable. In the second quarter, our core business continued to deliver impressive year-over-year growth bolstered by strong execution across the company to deliver the full $1.25 million dose contract to the U.S. government for [indiscernible]. 
For the second quarter, total revenues grew 163% year-over-year to $5.1 billion. Excluding revenues related to the COVID-19 antibody cocktail, total revenue grew 22% versus the prior year. Total diluted net income per share grew 260% year-over-year to $25.80 on net income of $2.9 billion. 
In the second quarter, we recognized $2.6 billion of U.S. REGEN-COV sales, representing the vast majority of revenue related to the delivery of 1.25 million doses to the U.S. government. Due to revenue recognition rules, a residual $34 million of net product sales for doses delivered under this contract will be recorded in the third quarter. Given the delivery of these doses to the U.S. government and current utilization rates we anticipate the current U.S. government supply will be exhausted by the end of the year. We do not expect to record substantial additional sales this year in the U.S. in less the number of cases and related utilization continue to increase exponentially. 
I will now move to collaboration revenues, which were $955 million in the second quarter of 2021 as compared to $513 million second quarter of 2020. Let me begin with the Roche collaboration. Ex U.S. sales of the COVID antibody cocktail known as Ronapreve, outside of the U.S. were $470 million as reported to us by Roche, we recorded $168 million in Roche collaboration revenue for our share of profits from Roche's sale of Ronapreve, which is now available or approved in more than 20 countries. With new COVID cases on the rise globally, we expect the Ronapreve will continue to be a meaningful revenue contributor in 2021. 
With regard to our Bayer collaboration. Ex U.S. EYLEA net product sales reported to us by Bayer were $904 million for the second quarter of 2021, representing growth of 41% on a reported basis and 31% on a constant currency basis as a result of broad market recovery and a favorable comparison versus the prior year. 
Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $349 million, of which we recorded $335 million for our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S. 
Finally, total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $438 million in the second quarter of 2021. Our share of the profits from the commercialization of Dupixent and Kevzara was $328 million, which nearly doubled when compared to profits of $172 million in the prior year. [indiscernible] was $46 million in the second quarter compared to $212 million in the prior year. The decrease is primarily related to nonrecurring reinforce from BARDA in 2020 for development of COVID-19 and an Ebola treatments. We continue to expect 2021 other revenue to be less than half of what was recorded in 2020 on a full year basis. 
Moving on to our operating expenses. R&D increased 11% year-over-year to $643 million, primarily due to continued clinical development costs for our REGEN-COV antibody cocktail and higher headcount to support our expanding pipeline. 
Next, SG&A expense increased 21% year-over-year to $365 million due to costs related to COVID-19 related activities, launch investments for Libtayo, growth initiatives for EYLEA and higher headcount. Cost of goods sold increased versus the prior year from $93 million to $514 million, primarily due to REGEN-COV manufacturing costs. Finally, effective tax rate was 17% in the second quarter of 2021, reflecting the impact of REGEN-COV sales, which are taxed at the U.S. statutory rate. 
Shifting to cash flow and the balance sheet. In the second quarter of 2021, Regeneron generated $478 million in free cash flow and ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities less debt of $5.1 billion. We received the full $2.625 billion of cash associated with completion of our second REGEN-COV contract with the U.S. government in July. As the business continues its strong performance, we are reiterating our capital allocation priorities of investing in internal R&D, funding strategic external R&D partnerships and returning cash to shareholders. 
Accordingly, in July, we announced a new $1.8 billion expansion of our Tarrytown facilities, primarily directed toward additional internal R&D operations and capabilities. We also continue to advance our next-generation technology partnerships with companies like Intellia and Alnylam, which are beginning to bear fruit as targets get selected and programs move forward into development. Finally, in the second quarter, we repurchased $289 million of our shares, and we remain opportunistic buyers in the market. 
To conclude, I'd like to provide select updates to our 2021 guidance. A complete summary of our latest full year guidance is available in our press release published earlier this morning. We are updating our full year 2021 guidance for SG&A to be in the range of $1.54 billion to $1.62 billion. The change is related to increased efforts in the second half for REGEN-COV. 
We are also revising our full year 2021 guidance for R&D to be in the range of $2.65 billion to $2.75 billion. The change is driven by lower-than-expected spend on REGEN-COV. 
Finally, we now expect our full year 2021 non-GAAP effective tax rate guidance to be in the range of 14% to 16%, driven by higher sales of REGEN-COV, which, as I said, are taxed at the U.S. statutory rate. In conclusion, Regeneron performed exceptionally well in the second quarter with the core business continuing on a strong growth trajectory as we invest in our diverse and differentiated pipeline for long-term sustainable growth. 
With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Justin."

I think it's important to note, as you said, it's very difficult to compare across studies, done years apart. And especially when we allowed classes of patients that were not previously allowed in other studies and so forth. 
As you pointed out, the median survival numbers are right on top of each other. But as you also pointed out, we had 2 different subtypes in this study. I can comment in our preliminary analysis, and these remain to be fully validated and so forth. 1 of the subtypes our hazard ratio was better than what was observed with the KEYTRUDA study and the other one, it was worse. It's important to point out that these things bounce around in these cross-study comparisons. As you know, in other settings, which you try to do cross country -- cross-study comparisons, for example, when you compare our monotherapy results in the greater than 50% PDL population. It looks like our numbers are substantially better in the skin and particularly the CSCC comparisons they're better. 
So these things bounce around. It's always hard to do these things. But I think the important thing to point out is that in this field in lung cancer, very few have hit in both monotherapy greater than 50% and in chemo combination all comers. I remind you that Opdivo Jens and most of the PD-L1s did. So right now, the only 2 PD-1 antibodies that standalone, having demonstrated overall survival benefit, both in the monotherapy setting as well as now in the chemo combination setting. And I think this really well positioned Libtayo and across all the studies, I think it's -- the definitive conclusion is that it's a very active molecule that looks at least as active as any other agents out there."

As you said, we think that the immunocompromised population which as I'm sure you all know, represents 3% to 4% of the U.S. population, that several million individuals, a variety of studies are showing that somewhere around 50% or more of these individuals do not respond after 2 or even after 3 attempts with the vaccine. And so these people are left without their own antibodies to protect them. 
So it's a huge unmet need setting where these individuals will not be protected. And as we're all seeing that it's very unlikely that we will be eliminating spread of infections through breakthrough infections, whether it was symptomatic or otherwise throughout the population for these individuals to be able to live normal lives they're going to need protection. 
And we believe that the most powerful protection is essentially providing them with these surrogate antibodies that our antibody cocktail provides. We already have very strong data, we believe, to support the notion that this agent can be used in chronic prevention settings, and we do intend to continue to explore future study opportunities where we can further enhance on the already existing data that shows that after the first week or so, we seem to obtain similar upwards of 90% protection against infection in individuals who do not have their own antibodies and are being exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. I think that, that is very strong data that bodes very well that this is potentially to be a very important treatment, particularly for these immunocompromised individuals who do not have antibodies on their own."

I think a lot of that is going to depend upon the government's assessment of what they think is the most efficient way to get people to use the product. There's been a tremendous acceleration in use our penetration in terms of addressing what we would say, estimated eligible patients has gone up dramatically to somewhere in the low single digits to almost 25% to 30% more recently in terms of eligible patients getting monoclonals. 
If that trend continues along with the trend of unfortunately, more cases, obviously, we're going to have to go with the direction that the government wants another contract or actual switchover. Capacity, of course, is always an issue, but we think we're sort of well positioned to continue to supply similar amounts that we've been able to supply and we'll have to look at -- and these demands can change pretty rapidly.

So early days, we are right on track with where we expected to be, but there's a lot more potential and a lot more work to do."

So that if we can actually stop or reverse the inflammatory response to the steatosis that will be an entirely different and also potentially complementary approach to what anything that anybody else is doing right now. 
I think the genetics very strongly point to that. That's what it actually shows that this genetic target affects and that's what the protective mutations are actually showing. So we're excited about looking at this opportunity, whether we can halt or even reverse inflammatory signals, inflammatory processes and thus, actual progression of the disease irregardless of steatosis."

We had an outstanding performance across the enterprise in the second quarter. Not only did our base business performed exceptionally well with strong growth from EYLEA, Dupixent and Libtayo, but we also delivered 1.25 million doses of REGEN-COV for the United States government, fulfilling the entire supply contract with BARDA. 
We also continue to advance multiple programs across our innovative R&D pipeline with several important readout.
Starting with EYLEA. Global net sales were over $2.3 billion growing 33% compared to the prior year, reflecting recovery from the COVID pandemic impact on the second quarter of 2020. In the U.S., sales grew 28%. EYLEA continues to set a high bar in terms of efficacy, safety and convenience.
Dupixent also performed exceptionally well this quarter with global sales of $1.5 billion and growth of 59%. This quarter also marks the first time we and Sanofi exceeded $1 billion in U.S. Dupixent quarterly net sales. There remains considerable room for further growth from our in-line indications as well as from potential new opportunities, such as in chronic spontaneous urticaria or CSU, where last week, we announced positive Phase III study results.
We have additional Phase III readouts in prurigo nodularis, eosinophilic esophagitis and pediatric atopic dermatitis later this year, which could advance our conviction of Dupixent is a pipeline in a product who address numerous inflammatory diseases.
In oncology, Libtayo global net sales were $117 million and grew 46% with meaningful growth contributions from both inside and outside the United States. We also announced this morning that in a large Phase III pivotal study in non-small cell lung cancer, Libtayo, combined with standard chemotherapy reduced the risk of death by nearly 30% compared to chemotherapy alone. We are eager to share these data with regulatory agencies, which if approved, would dramatically increase the number of lung cancer eligible patients who could be treated with Libtayo.
We also began to see meaningful results from our Regeneron Genetics Medicines pipeline. With our collaborators at Intellia, we showed the first ever proof-of-concept in vivo genome editing with NTLA-2001, investigational CRISPR therapy for transthyretin amyloidosis or ATTR amyloidosis. This proof-of-concept study utilizing systemically administered CRISPR technology for genome modification suggests this approach could have broad applicability across a wide range of diseases.
Beyond Intellia, our collaborations with Alnylam and Decibel are helping to form a whole new pipeline for next-generation therapies beyond our broad and diverse antibody pipeline. 
The second quarter represented another landmark in our efforts to combat COVID-19, which unfortunately, despite considerable rates of vaccination, continues to be a major global health concern with rising cases and emerging variants.  In addition to fulfilling our entire supply contract with the United States government, we were able to secure Emergency Use Authorization updates for our lower 1.2 gram subcutaneous dose as well as for post-exposure prophylaxis for certain appropriate patients who are at high risk for disease. Utilization is increasing rapidly at currently more than 50,000 doses ordered per week. 
We also announced that the U.K. RECOVERY study showed a 20% reduction in risk of death in hospitalized patients who had not mounted their own immune response.
With these results, together with supporting data from Regeneron study in hospitalized patients that George will discuss momentarily, REGEN-COV has the potential, if so authorized, to be the first treatment be used in a wide spectrum of COVID-19 disease settings from prevention through the hospitalized setting.
In summary, our core business is strong and continues to diversify, and our innovative pipeline continues to advance, positioning Regeneron well for long-term growth.
Now I will turn the call over to George."

We have a lot to talk about this morning, which is all possible because of our Regeneron colleagues who have been working nonstop throughout this pandemic.

We have a lot to talk about this morning, which is all possible because of our Regeneron colleagues who have been working nonstop throughout this pandemic. And unfortunately, the world is still in the throes of this global COVID-19 pandemic. As the numbers of infected individuals in the United States are climbing again with nearly 100,000 Americans becoming infected every day. Therefore, I will start with Regeneron -- with REGEN-COV, our monoclonal antibody cocktail for COVID-19.
In June, the REGEN-COV Emergency Use Authorization, or EUA, was updated to include the lower 1.2 gram REGEN-COV dose with both intravenous and subcutaneous administration for nonhospitalized patients. This EUA was supported by Phase III data showing that the 1.2 gram dose reduce risk of hospitalization or death by 70%. Just last week, the EUA was further expanded to include utilization in post-exposure prophylaxis for COVID-19 in certain populations, and also allows for repeated monthly dosing of REGEN-COV for high-risk patients, such as the immunocompromised who are at high risk of ongoing exposure to infected individuals in the same institutional setting.
This latest authorization makes REGEN-COV the only treatment that is available for both treating infected individuals and also preventing infection in certain settings. We would like to emphasize that REGEN-COV is not a substitute for vaccination.
Still under review by the FDA, our additional data, which we believe could broaden the prevention application to pre-exposure prophylaxis as well as to extend the treatment paradigm to hospitalized patients. The details of Part A of our Phase III prophylaxis study in which we assessed efficacy and safety of subcutaneous REGEN-COV in preventing infection among previously uninfected individuals has just been published today in the New England Journal of Medicine.
We believe there is enormous unmet need to try to protect immunocompromised individuals who have not responded to the vaccine and we hope that the FDA will agree that our data will support an authorization in this pre-exposure prophylaxis setting.
 
For hospitalized patients, we recently reported that REGEN-COV tested as part of the Oxford University Phase III RECOVERY study met its primary outcome, reducing risk of death by 20% in hospitalized COVID-19 patients lacking immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Data from our own smaller study in hospitalized COVID-19 patients showed similar conclusions with 35% reduction in overall mortality in this study, which was limited to earlier-stage hospitalized patients with no oxygen or low oxygen support. These collective data from RECOVERY and from our study in hospitalized patients have been shared with regulators.
In addition, we are on track to complete the REGEN-COV BLA submissions in the second half of 2021. 
Outside of the United States, our collaborator Roche obtained emergency or temporary pandemic use authorizations for our COVID-19 antibody cocktail, known as Ronapreve outside the United States in more than 20 countries across the European Union, India, Switzerland and Canada, with more authorizations expected soon. Japan was the first country to grant formal regulatory approval to our antibody cocktail for COVID-19.
Finally, REGEN-COV retains potent activity against all known variants of interest, including the Delta variant. For patients at high risk of serious consequences, including many with an inadequate response to vaccines, REGEN-COV could be an important option to patients and their physicians for the foreseeable future.
Moving on to ophthalmology. In the coming months, we expect data from the Phase II study of high dose of aflibercept in wet AMD. This readout will consist of efficacy assessments on drawing in other anatomical measures as well as safety on the 8-milligram and the currently approved 2-milligram of aflibercept dose at an 8-week dosing interval. 
In the 106 patients dosed in the open-label Phase II to date, we have not seen any concerning safety signals. While this smaller study will not be definitive on durability measures, the Phase II data will help provide insights into the larger Phase III studies, which are testing high-dose aflibercept dosing intervals out to 12 and 16 weeks. I'm pleased to announce that the Phase III studies in DME and AMD have completed enrollment, allowing for Phase III data next year.
Moving on to Dupixent in our immunology and inflammation portfolio. Just last week, we announced that a Phase III trial in chronic spontaneous urticaria or CSU, met primary and all key 24-week secondary endpoints, showing Dupixent reduced itch and hive activity scores by nearly half. This is the fifth disease in which Dupixent demonstrated positive pivotal trial results and efficacy in this disease raises the possibility of IL-4 and IL-13 are critical drivers in diseases not traditionally thought to be driven by Type 2 inflammation.
We plan to report results from a second trial in CSU patients who are not benefiting from the approved standard of care biologic in early 2022. This positive readout in CSU is continuing to build on Dupixent's efficacy and safety demonstrated across other inflammatory diseases. In the upcoming months, we also expect results from our confirmatory Phase IIIB study in adult and adolescent patients with eosinophilic esophagitis as well as readout of a Phase III study in prurigo nodularis. Thus far, Dupixent is approved in patients as young as 6 years old in atopic dermatitis and 12 years old in asthma. 
Later this year, we will report data from a Phase III study in preschool children as young as 6 months up to 5 years of age suffering from atopic dermatitis. In asthma, we anticipate a regulatory decision in October for children aged 6 to 11 years old in the United States.
Moving to our anti-interleukin-33 antibody, itepekimab. Results of the Phase II study in COPD patients were recently published in Lancet Respiratory Medicine. While the trial exhibited strong trends in its primary endpoint of exacerbation reduction in the overall population, which did not meet statistical significance, a pre-specified subgroup analysis of former smokers with COPD is what accounted for the overall benefit with no negative subset in the remaining population. In the pre-specified former smoker subgroup, itepekimab demonstrated a 42% reduction in exacerbations and improvement in lung function of 0.09 liters compared to placebo with both endpoints reaching nominal statistical significance.
Moreover, the publication includes genetic analyses that support a protective role for interleukin-33 in COPD. Based on these results, we and Sanofi are assessing the potential of itepekimab in 2 Phase III studies focused on the former smoker population with COPD. I should also remind you that we have 2 ongoing studies - 2 ongoing Phase III studies with Dupixent in a complementary COPD population.
We are also progressing our novel approaches to treat allergies by using cocktails of monoclonal antibodies to directly bind and inactivate allergens, which have produced robust results in Phase II studies. Results of the initial Phase III study of our antibody cocktail against birch  allergy caused by the Bet v 1 allergen are expected later this year. The first Phase III study of an antibody cocktail for cat allergy caused by Fel d 1allergen, is now open for enrollment. We are enthusiastic about these innovative additions to our inflammation and immunology portfolio. 
In oncology, following its recent approvals in the United States for certain first-line non-small cell lung cancer in certain advanced basal cell carcinoma patients, Libtayo was subsequently approved in the EU for these settings. Furthermore, compelling overall survival data in second-line cervical cancer patients were presented at an ESMO Virtual Plenary in May with the regulatory submissions to the FDA and EMA planned for this year.
For lung cancer, we are pleased to report today that in our Phase III trial comparing Libtayo plus standard chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone the independent data monitoring committee recommended halting the trial for efficacy at the second interim analysis. Libtayo plus chemotherapy significantly improved overall survival as well as progression-free survival compared to chemotherapy alone in first-line locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.
With these data, Libtayo is now the second PD-1 targeting antibody that has been able to demonstrate significant overall survival benefit both as a monotherapy as well as in combination with chemotherapy for treating advanced lung cancer. With this validation, Libtayo provides an important foundation for a broad and multifaceted approach to address the great unmet need that patients with cancer in general and lung cancer, in particular, still face.
In addition to our Libtayo monotherapy and chemo combination opportunities in lung cancer, we are developing several bispecifics. Our EGFRxCD28 co-stim and Libtayo combination is in dose escalation for lung and other advanced cancers. Our MET X MET bispecific antibody is enrolling non-small cell lung cancer patients with a broad selection of patients, including MET Exon 14  gene mutation, gene amplification and/or elevated MET protein expression.
And as we introduced at our ASCO investor event, our first antibody drug conjugate MET X MET ADC, is poised to enter the clinic in the coming months with a focus on patients with MET Overexpressing cancers, including lung cancer, where MET Overexpression occurs in as many as 25% of patients.
In terms of building on the potential of Libtayo with combinations in skin cancer, we recently announced new clinical data for the combination of Libtayo with fianlimab our LAG-3 inhibitor, in advanced melanoma at the ASCO annual meeting in June. The combination demonstrated a 67% response rate in PD-1 or PDL-1 naive patients with potential for a more favorable safety profile than with the anti-CTLA-4 PD-1 combinations. We plan to initiate a Phase III study of fianlimab and Libtayo as a first-line treatment for advanced melanoma in 2022.
Ovarian cancer is the first tumor type for which we are clinically testing 3 powerful combination approaches. First, our MUC16xCD3 bispecific with Libtayo, where we hope to share initial data next year. Next, our MUC16xCD28 co-stim bispecific with Libtayo. And third, our novel combination of the CD3 and co-stim bispecifics for which we have now dosed the first patient.
This latter combination of 2 bispecifics of 2 different classes has potential to be a novel and disruptive approach for the treatment of solid tumors. Rounding out my commentary in solid tumors, our PSMAxCD28 program in prostate cancer continues in dose escalation with Libtayo, and we hope to share initial data next year.
As we mentioned previously, we are planning on introducing a PSMAxCD3 bispecific to the clinic later this year, providing another unique experimental combination for prostate cancer treatment. The tumor viewed as nonresponsive currently to available immunotherapies.
Moving on to hematologic cancers and starting with lymphoma. Odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific has demonstrated encouraging efficacy and durability of responses in hard-to-treat patient populations. We have resumed enrollment in our potentially pivotal Phase II program in follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, with lifting of the partial clinical hold following protocol amendments for a modified step-up dosing protocol.
Later this year, we plan to initiate testing of the odronextamab subcutaneous formulation. And next year, we plan to initiate the Phase III program as well as combination trials with our lymphoma-specific co-stim bispecific.
In multiple myeloma, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific is on track to complete enrollment in potentially pivotal Phase II study next year. We will also initiate studies evaluating a subcutaneous formulation in combinations with standard of care. 
With our unique position to mix and match multiple modalities and targets with the goal of deepening the responses we are already observing with our BCMAxCD3 bispecific, we are on track to start a combination study with a co-stim bispecific for multiple myeloma next year.
I would like to conclude with our Regeneron Genetic Medicines efforts. As you know, these efforts start with our Regeneron Genetics Center and its ability to genetically identify and validate new disease targets and is coupled with emerging gene-based therapeutic solutions to address these targets, including CRISPR-based technologies with our collaborator Intellia, siRNA technologies with Alnylam as well as viral gene delivery technologies we are developing in-house.
The Regeneron Genetics Center continues to emerge as a world leader in human sequencing and in defining genetic variants that can either be protective or causative for human disease. Most recently identifying a major new gene target that protects against obesity as described in a high-profile publication in Science last month. For this newly discovered target, we are deploying several strategies to develop new classes of potential therapeutics to fight obesity and potentially type 2 diabetes.
In terms of progress with our gene-based therapeutics approaches, together with the Intellia, we recently announced positive clinical data for the first ever systemically delivered CRISPR-based gene knockout in human patients. 
In the first 6 patients with transthyretin amyloidosis with TTR amyloidosis, a single systemic treatment led to dose-dependent reduction in the disease-causing protein with no serious adverse events observed through day 28. This proof-of-concept clinical data increases the probability of success for both our knockout as well as our Insertion CRISPR-based programs, unlocking the potential of many future possibilities for Intellia and Regeneron. 
Currently, we're evaluating more than 20 preclinical programs under this collaboration, and Regeneron has the rights to develop up to 15 in vivo products with Intellia.
Regarding our efforts with Alnylam, on an siRNA for a novel NASH target identified by the Regeneron Genetic Center, we are hoping to see initial healthy volunteer data by the end of this year. This 2-part first-in-human study is now enrolling NASH patients. We are currently evaluating about 20 preclinical programs under this collaboration and Regeneron has rights to develop up to 30 products with Alnylam.
With that brief glimpse into the future of Genetics Medicines, I would like to turn the call over to Marion."

Our business performance in the second quarter reflects robust momentum, competitive strength and focused execution across our commercial portfolio. Our in-line medicines continue to thrive, and our ongoing launches are progressing to",909,"Thank you, George. Our business performance in the second quarter reflects robust momentum, competitive strength and focused execution across our commercial portfolio. 
Our in-line medicines continue to thrive, and our ongoing launches are progressing to plan, providing a platform for diversified growth.
First, I will highlight our efforts supporting REGEN-COV, our COVID-19 antibody cocktail, which is available under Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA. In the second quarter, U.S. net sales were $2.6 billion as a result of fulfilling our second contract with the U.S. government. There is significant ongoing need for effective treatments against COVID-19. As Len said, REGEN-COV utilization has recently accelerated and is now trending well over 50,000 doses ordered weekly. Uptake is driven by growing recognition of the importance of antibody cocktail treatment, focused educational efforts and competitive dynamics favoring REGEN-COV. We continue to work closely with all key stakeholders to increase REGEN-COV utilization and support hospitals and administration sites to reduce bottlenecks.
The REGEN-COV antibody cocktail is both FDA authorized and NIH recommended and retains potency against known variants. We've also expanded our efforts following the recent post-exposure prophylaxis authorization, the first for an antibody therapy in this setting.
Beyond REGEN-COV, our core portfolio performed very well in the second quarter. Starting with EYLEA. Second quarter global net sales grew 33% year-over-year to over $2.3 billion. In the U.S., EYLEA net sales grew 28% year-over-year to $1.42 billion, driven by underlying demand, category share gains and a favorable comparison versus the second quarter of 2020. EYLEA is the anti-VEGF category growth leader and preferred treatment option.
As a reminder, EYLEA sets a high bar for efficacy and safety with more than 40 million injections administered worldwide, in a therapeutic category where patient vision and well-being are paramount. EYLEA continues to capture market and competitive share securing nearly 50% of the overall category and 75% of the branded category.
Overall demand is improving with increased patient flow and return to pre-pandemic levels of new patient visits. Patients who may have delayed seeing the retina specialists are now seeking treatment.
With this backdrop, we are accelerating promotional efforts to address the significant unmet needs in diabetic eye disease. We are confident in Regeneron's ongoing leadership position in retinal diseases, based on EYLEA's competitive advantages and future opportunities, including our high-dose program.
Turning to Libtayo, where second quarter global net sales grew to $117 million, and the U.S. net sales grew 23% to $78 million. As expected, at this early stage of new indication launches, the vast majority of sales come from advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, where Libtayo is the #1 systemic treatment despite new in-class competition. 
Our launches in both advanced non-small cell lung cancer and basal cell carcinoma or BCC are progressing to plan. In BCC, Libtayo brand awareness is high among treating oncologists. We are encouraged by meaningful patient starts in the second quarter as Libtayo becomes a standard of care.
We're also making considerable progress in lung cancer where efforts are focused on establishing Libtayo in our monotherapy indication and will be important foundation for our potential future chemotherapy combination launch, which will be based on the data announced today. Our expanded field force is now fully deployed and securing early successes with treating physicians.
We're raising brand awareness, progressing formulary positioning and payer coverage. Lung cancer thought leaders recognized Libtayo's clinical differentiation, highlighting the rapid response rates and efficacy in patients with clinically stable brain metastases or high PD-L1 expression. In this highly competitive market, we remain focused on differentiating Libtayo and increasing physician experience. Today's exciting chemotherapy combination news has the potential to dramatically expand the patient opportunity for Libtayo in non-small cell lung cancer.
Turning now to Obtusa, which was launched earlier this year in ultra-rare homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Key thought leaders recognized the benefits of Obtusa, which delivers an efficacy, safety and tolerability in a market where many patients have struggled to stay on therapy in the face of life-threatening LDL-cholesterol levels. We're encouraged by early initiations across switch and new-to-category patients and can see a future where Obtusa becomes the standard of care.
Moving to Dupixent. Global net sales in the second quarter were $1.5 billion, growing 59% compared to the prior year. In the U.S., net sales grew 49% to $1.15 billion driven by broad-based growth across all approved indications. New patient starts are steadily growing and are above pre-COVID levels. 
In atopic dermatitis, prescribing trends are strong across a spectrum of moderate to severe disease including adolescent and pediatric patients. There is significant and sustained growth opportunity for Dupixent in a market where it is the #1 dermatologist prescribed biologic. This is based on its well-established efficacy and safety profile, broad label for patients as young as 6 years old and unmatched real-world physician and patient experience. In addition, as George outlined, we see an exciting future opportunities in dermatology, starting with CSU. 
Dupixent is the leading biologic in respiratory disease poised to capture meaningful growth now and in the future. Our asthma results outpaced recent competitive biologic launches. Launch preparations are underway in the pediatric asthma setting with the first regulatory approval expected in the U.S. this October.
In nasal polyps, there's high demand among ENTs and allergists with patients initiated regardless of prior surgery. In summary, we delivered strong performance across our brands with current and potential future launches on track to deliver sustained growth.
Now I'll turn the call over to Bob."

My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis where applicable. 
In the second quarter, our core business continued to deliver impressive year-over-year growth bolstered by strong execution across the company to deliver the full 1.25 million dose contract to the U.S. government for REGEN-COV.
For the second quarter, total revenues grew 163% year-over-year to $5.1 billion. Excluding revenues related to the COVID-19 antibody cocktail, total revenue grew 22% versus the prior year. Total diluted net income per share grew 260% year-over-year to $25.80 on net income of $2.9 billion. 
In the second quarter, we recognized $2.6 billion of U.S. REGEN-COV sales, representing the vast majority of revenue related to the delivery of 1.25 million doses to the U.S. government. Due to revenue recognition rules, a residual $34 million of net product sales for doses delivered under this contract will be recorded in the third quarter. Given the delivery of these doses to the U.S. government in current utilization rates, we anticipate the current U.S. government supply will be exhausted by the end of the year. We do not expect to record substantial additional sales this year in the U.S. unless the number of cases and related utilization continue to increase exponentially.
I will now move to collaboration revenues, which were $955 million in the second quarter of 2021 as compared to $513 million second quarter of 2020. 
Let me begin with the Roche collaboration. Ex U.S. sales of the COVID antibody cocktail known as Ronapreve, outside of the U.S. were $470 million as reported to us by Roche. We recorded $168 million in Roche collaboration revenue for our share of profits from Roche's sale of Ronapreve, which is now available or approved in more than 20 countries. With new COVID cases on the rise globally, we expect the Ronapreve will continue to be a meaningful revenue contributor in 2021.
With regard to our Bayer collaboration. Ex U.S. EYLEA net product sales, reported to us by Bayer, were $904 million for the second quarter of 2021, representing growth of 41% on a reported basis and 31% on a constant currency basis as a result of broad market recovery and a favorable comparison versus the prior year.
Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $349 million, of which we recorded $335 million for our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S.
Finally, total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $438 million in the second quarter of 2021. Our share of the profits from the commercialization of Dupixent and Kevzara was $328 million, which nearly doubled when compared to profits of $172 million in the prior year. 
Other revenue was $46 million in the second quarter compared to $212 million in the prior year. The decrease is primarily related to nonrecurring reimbursements from BARDA in 2020 for development of COVID-19 and Ebola treatments. We continue to expect 2021 other revenue to be less than half of what was recorded in 2020 on a full year basis.
Moving on to our operating expenses. R&D increased 11% year-over-year to $643 million, primarily due to continued clinical development costs for our REGEN-COV antibody cocktail and higher headcount to support our expanding pipeline.
Next, SG&A expense increased 21% year-over-year to $365 million due to costs related to COVID-19 related activities, launch investments for Libtayo, growth initiatives for EYLEA and higher headcount. 
Cost of goods sold increased versus the prior year from $93 million to $514 million, primarily due to REGEN-COV manufacturing costs. 
Finally, the effective tax rate was 17% in the second quarter of 2021, reflecting the impact of REGEN-COV sales, which are taxed at the U.S. statutory rate.
Shifting to cash flow and the balance sheet. In the second quarter of 2021, Regeneron generated $478 million in free cash flow and ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities less debt of $5.1 billion. We received the full $2.625 billion of cash associated with completion of our second REGEN-COV contract with the U.S. government in July. As the business continues its strong performance, we are reiterating our capital allocation priorities of investing in internal R&D, funding strategic external R&D partnerships and returning cash to shareholders.
Accordingly, in July, we announced the new $1.8 billion expansion of our Tarrytown facilities, primarily directed toward additional internal R&D operations and capabilities. We also continue to advance our next-generation technology partnerships with companies like Intellia and Alnylam, which are beginning to bear fruit as targets get selected and programs move forward into development. 
Finally, in the second quarter, we repurchased $289 million of our shares, and we remain opportunistic buyers in the market.
To conclude, I'd like to provide select updates to our 2021 guidance. A complete summary of our latest full year guidance is available in our press release published earlier this morning. We are updating our full year 2021 guidance for SG&A to be in the range of $1.54 billion to $1.62 billion. The change is related to increased efforts in the second half for REGEN-COV.
We are also revising our full year 2021 guidance for R&D to be in the range of $2.65 billion to $2.75 billion. The change is driven by lower-than-expected spend on REGEN-COV.
Finally, we now expect our full year 2021 non-GAAP effective tax rate guidance to be in the range of 14% to 16%, driven by higher sales of REGEN-COV, which, as I said, are taxed at the U.S. statutory rate. 
In conclusion, Regeneron performed exceptionally well in the second quarter with the core business continuing on a strong growth trajectory as we invest in our diverse and differentiated pipeline for long-term sustainable growth.
With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Justin."

I think it's important to note, as you said, it's very difficult to compare across studies, done years apart. And especially when we allowed classes of patients that were not previously allowed in other studies and so forth. 
As you pointed out, the median survival numbers are right on top of each other. But as you also pointed out, we had 2 different subtypes in this study. I can comment in our preliminary analysis, and these remain to be fully validated and so forth. 1 of the subtypes our hazard ratio was better than what was observed with the KEYTRUDA study and the other 1, it was worse. It's important to point out that these things bounce around in these cross-study comparisons. As you know, in other settings, if try to do cross country -- cross-study comparisons, for example, when you compare our monotherapy results in the greater than 50% PDL population, it looks like our numbers are substantially better in the skin and particularly with the CSCC comparisons they're better.
So these things bounce around. It's always hard to do these things. But I think the important thing to point out is that in this field in lung cancer, very few have hit in both monotherapy greater than 50% and in chemo combination all comers. I remind you that Opdivo did and most of the PD-L1s did. So right now, there is only 2 PD-1 antibodies that standalone, having demonstrated overall survival benefit, both in the monotherapy setting as well as now in the chemo combination setting. I think this really well positions Libtayo and across all the studies, I think it's -- the definitive conclusion is that it's a very active molecule that looks at least as active as any other agents out there."

As you said, we think that the immunocompromised population which, as I'm sure you all know, represents 3% to 4% of the U.S. population, that several million individuals, a variety of studies are showing that somewhere around 50% or more of these individuals do not respond after 2 or even after 3 attempts with the vaccine. And so these people are left without their own antibodies to protect them.
So it's a huge unmet need setting where these individuals will not be protected. And as we're all seeing that it's very unlikely that we will be eliminating spread of infections through breakthrough infections, whether it was symptomatic or otherwise throughout the population for these individuals to be able to live normal lives they're going to need protection.
And we believe that the most powerful protection is essentially providing them with these surrogate antibodies that our antibody cocktail provides. We already have very strong data, we believe, to support the notion that this agent can be used in chronic prevention settings, and we do intend to continue to explore future study opportunities where we can further enhance on the already existing data that shows that after the first week or so, we seem to obtain similar upwards of 90% protection against infection in individuals who do not have their own antibodies and are being exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. I think that is very strong data that bodes very well that this is potentially to be a very important treatment, particularly for these immunocompromised individuals who do not have antibodies of their own."

The contract we have is been fulfilled. And so the government is going to need to decide whether or not they want to have another contract or they want us to switch over to a commercial model, which could occur before or after a regular approval as it did with Remdesivir.
I think a lot of that is going to depend upon the government's assessment of what they think is the most efficient way to get people to use that product. There's been a tremendous acceleration in use. Our penetration in terms of addressing what we would say, estimated eligible patients has gone up dramatically to somewhere in the low single digits to almost 25% to 30% more recently in terms of eligible patients getting monoclonals.
If that trend continues along with the trend of unfortunately, more cases, obviously, we're going to have to go with the direction that the government wants another contract or a commericial switchover. Capacity, of course, is always an issue, but we think we're sort of well positioned to continue to supply similar amounts that we've been able to supply and we'll have to look at -- and these demands continued pretty rapidly. And of course, we do have our partner, Roche, who's got capacity that we can perhaps turn to. So a lot of moving parts, Yaron. And the most important of which is what is the shape of the current surge in the pandemic."

I'll comment, we are still the standard of care in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. That was a very effective launch. We now have a competitor in that indication, but we retain our leadership.
The basal cell carcinoma launch is also going well. And certainly, the efficacy and tolerability, safety of Libtayo is paramount for those patients, and we offer an alternative where the specialists in that area do believe Libtayo as evolving to become the standard of care. It's early days in lung. I think our team is doing a really good job. And when we talk to the opinion leaders, they're most excited, as I mentioned, about our rapid action, our efficacy, even in those patients with stable brain metastases and with the high expression PD-L1 patients.

I think the genetics very strongly point to that. That's what it actually shows that this genetic target affects and that's what the protective mutations are actually showing.

We had an outstanding performance across the enterprise in the second quarter. Not only did our base business performed exceptionally well with strong growth from EYLEA, Dupixent and Libtayo",609,"Thank you, Justin, and thanks to everyone joining today's call. We had an outstanding performance across the enterprise in the second quarter. Not only did our base business performed exceptionally well with strong growth from EYLEA, Dupixent and Libtayo but we also delivered 1.25 million doses of REGEN-COV for the United States government, fulfilling the entire supply contract with BARDA. 
We also continue to advance multiple programs across our innovative R&D pipeline with several important readout.
Starting with EYLEA. Global net sales were over $2.3 billion, growing 33% compared to the prior year, reflecting recovery from the COVID pandemic impact on the second quarter of 2020. In the U.S., sales grew 28%. EYLEA continues to set a high bar in terms of efficacy, safety and convenience.
Dupixent also performed exceptionally well this quarter with global sales of $1.5 billion and growth of 59%. This quarter also marks the first time we and Sanofi exceeded $1 billion in U.S. Dupixent quarterly net sales. There remains considerable room for further growth from our in-line indications as well as from potential new opportunities, such as in chronic spontaneous urticaria, or CSU, where last week we announced positive Phase III study results.
We have additional Phase III readouts in prurigo nodularis, eosinophilic esophagitis and pediatric atopic dermatitis later this year, which could advance our conviction of Dupixent as a pipeline in a product to address numerous inflammatory diseases.
In oncology, Libtayo global net sales were $117 million and grew 46% with meaningful growth contributions from both inside and outside the United States. We also announced this morning that in a large Phase III pivotal study in non-small cell lung cancer, Libtayo, combined with standard chemotherapy, reduced the risk of death by nearly 30% compared to chemotherapy alone. We are eager to share these data with regulatory agencies, which, if approved, would dramatically increase the number of lung cancer eligible patients who could be treated with Libtayo.
We also began to see meaningful results from our Regeneron Genetics Medicines pipeline. With our collaborators at Intellia, we showed the first ever proof-of-concept in vivo genome editing with NTLA-2001, investigational CRISPR therapy for transthyretin amyloidosis, or ATTR amyloidosis. This proof-of-concept study utilizing systemically administered CRISPR technology for genome modification suggests this approach could have broad applicability across a wide range of diseases.
Beyond Intellia, our collaborations with Alnylam and Decibel are helping to form a whole new pipeline for next-generation therapies beyond our broad and diverse antibody pipeline. 
The second quarter represented another landmark in our efforts to combat COVID-19, which unfortunately, despite considerable rates of vaccination, continues to be a major global health concern with rising cases and emerging variants.  In addition to fulfilling our entire supply contract with the United States government, we were able to secure Emergency Use Authorization updates for our lower 1.2-gram subcutaneous dose as well as for post-exposure prophylaxis for certain appropriate patients who are at high risk for disease. Utilization is increasing rapidly at currently more than 50,000 doses ordered per week. 
We also announced that the U.K. RECOVERY study showed a 20% reduction in risk of death in hospitalized patients who had not mounted their own immune response.
With these results, together with supporting data from Regeneron study in hospitalized patients that George will discuss momentarily, REGEN-COV has the potential, if so authorized, to be the first treatment to be used in a wide spectrum of COVID-19 disease settings from prevention through the hospitalized setting.
In summary, our core business is strong and continues to diversify, and our innovative pipeline continues to advance, positioning Regeneron well for long-term growth.
Now I will turn the call over to George."
33715,1673288768,2368929,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2021",2021-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Len. We have a lot to talk about this morning, which is all possible because of our Regeneron colleagues who have been working nonstop throughout this pandemic.

We have a lot to talk about this morning, which is all possible because of our Regeneron colleagues who have been working nonstop throughout this pandemic. And unfortunately, the world is still in the throes of this global COVID-19 pandemic as the numbers of infected individuals in the United States are climbing again with nearly 100,000 Americans becoming infected every day. Therefore, I will start with Regeneron -- with REGEN-COV, our monoclonal antibody cocktail for COVID-19.
In June, the REGEN-COV Emergency Use Authorization, or EUA, was updated to include the lower 1.2-gram REGEN-COV dose with both intravenous and subcutaneous administration for nonhospitalized patients. This EUA was supported by Phase III data showing that the 1.2-gram dose reduced risk of hospitalization or death by 70%. Just last week, the EUA was further expanded to include utilization in post-exposure prophylaxis for COVID-19 in certain populations, and also allows for repeated monthly dosing of REGEN-COV for high-risk patients, such as the immunocompromised who are at high risk of ongoing exposure to infected individuals in the same institutional setting.
This latest authorization makes REGEN-COV the only treatment that is available for both treating infected individuals and also preventing infection in certain settings. We would like to emphasize that REGEN-COV is not a substitute for vaccination.
Still under review by the FDA, our additional data, which we believe could broaden the prevention application to pre-exposure prophylaxis as well as to extend the treatment paradigm to hospitalized patients. The details of Part A of our Phase III prophylaxis study in which we assessed efficacy and safety of subcutaneous REGEN-COV in preventing infection among previously uninfected individuals has just been published today in the New England Journal of Medicine.
We believe there is enormous unmet need to try to protect immunocompromised individuals who have not responded to the vaccine and we hope that the FDA will agree that our data will support an authorization in this pre-exposure prophylaxis setting.
 
For hospitalized patients, we recently reported that REGEN-COV, tested as part of the Oxford University Phase III RECOVERY study, met its primary outcome, reducing risk of death by 20% in hospitalized COVID-19 patients lacking immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Data from our own smaller study in hospitalized COVID-19 patients showed similar conclusions with 35% reduction in overall mortality in this study, which was limited to earlier-stage hospitalized patients with no oxygen or low oxygen support. These collective data from RECOVERY and from our study in hospitalized patients have been shared with regulators.
In addition, we are on track to complete the REGEN-COV BLA submissions in the second half of 2021. 
Outside of the United States, our collaborator Roche obtained emergency or temporary pandemic use authorizations for our COVID-19 antibody cocktail, known as Ronapreve outside the United States in more than 20 countries across the European Union, India, Switzerland and Canada, with more authorizations expected soon. Japan was the first country to grant formal regulatory approval to our antibody cocktail for COVID-19.
Finally, REGEN-COV retains potent activity against all known variants of interest, including the Delta variant. For patients at high risk of serious consequences, including many with an inadequate response to vaccines, REGEN-COV could be an important option to patients and their physicians for the foreseeable future.
Moving on to ophthalmology. In the coming months, we expect data from the Phase II study of high dose aflibercept in wet AMD. This readout will consist of efficacy assessments on drawing in other anatomical measures as well as safety on the 8-milligram and the currently approved 2-milligram aflibercept dose at an 8-week dosing interval. 
In the 106 patients dosed in the open-label Phase II to date, we have not seen any concerning safety signals. While this smaller study will not be definitive on durability measures, the Phase II data will help provide insights into the larger Phase III studies, which are testing high-dose aflibercept dosing intervals out to 12 and 16 weeks. I'm pleased to announce that the Phase III studies in DME and AMD have completed enrollment, allowing for Phase III data next year.
Moving on to Dupixent in our immunology and inflammation portfolio. Just last week, we announced that a Phase III trial in chronic spontaneous urticaria, or CSU, met primary and all key 24-week secondary endpoints, showing Dupixent reduced itch and hive activity scores by nearly half. This is the fifth disease in which Dupixent demonstrated positive pivotal trial results, and efficacy in this disease raises the possibility that IL-4 and IL-13 are critical drivers in diseases not traditionally thought to be driven by type 2 inflammation.
We plan to report results from a second trial in CSU patients who are not benefiting from the approved standard of care biologic in early 2022. This positive readout in CSU is continuing to build on Dupixent's efficacy and safety demonstrated across other inflammatory diseases. In the upcoming months, we also expect results from our confirmatory Phase IIIb study in adult and adolescent patients with eosinophilic esophagitis as well as readout of a Phase III study in prurigo nodularis. Thus far, Dupixent is approved in patients as young as 6 years old in atopic dermatitis and 12 years old in asthma. 
Later this year, we will report data from a Phase III study in preschool children as young as 6 months up to 5 years of age suffering from atopic dermatitis. In asthma, we anticipate a regulatory decision in October for children aged 6 to 11 years old in the United States.
Moving to our anti-interleukin-33 antibody, itepekimab. Results of the Phase II study in COPD patients were recently published in Lancet Respiratory Medicine. While the trial exhibited strong trends in its primary endpoint of exacerbation reduction in the overall population, which did not meet statistical significance, a pre-specified subgroup analysis of former smokers with COPD is what accounted for the overall benefit with no negative subset in the remaining population. In the pre-specified former smoker subgroup, itepekimab demonstrated a 42% reduction in exacerbations and improvement in lung function of 0.09 liters compared to placebo with both endpoints reaching nominal statistical significance.
Moreover, the publication includes genetic analyses that support a protective role for interleukin-33 in COPD. Based on these results, we and Sanofi are assessing the potential of itepekimab in 2 Phase III studies focused on the former smoker population with COPD. I should also remind you that we have 2 ongoing studies with phase -- 2 ongoing Phase III studies with Dupixent in a complementary COPD population.
We are also progressing our novel approaches to treat allergies by using cocktails of monoclonal antibodies to directly bind and inactivate allergens, which have produced robust results in Phase II studies. Results of the initial Phase III study of our antibody cocktail against birch allergy caused by the Bet v 1 allergen are expected later this year. The first Phase III study of an antibody cocktail for cat allergy caused by Fel d 1 allergen is now open for enrollment. We are enthusiastic about these innovative additions to our inflammation and immunology portfolio. 
In oncology, following its recent approvals in the United States for certain first-line non-small cell lung cancer in certain advanced basal cell carcinoma patients, Libtayo was subsequently approved in the EU for these settings. Furthermore, compelling overall survival data in second-line cervical cancer patients were presented at an ESMO Virtual Plenary in May with the regulatory submissions to the FDA and EMA planned for this year.
For lung cancer, we are pleased to report today that in our Phase III trial comparing Libtayo plus standard chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone, the independent data monitoring committee recommended halting the trial for efficacy at the second interim analysis. Libtayo plus chemotherapy significantly improved overall survival as well as progression-free survival compared to chemotherapy alone in first-line locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.
With these data, Libtayo is now the second PD-1 targeting antibody that has been able to demonstrate significant overall survival benefit both as a monotherapy as well as in combination with chemotherapy for treating advanced lung cancer. With this validation, Libtayo provides an important foundation for a broad and multifaceted approach to address the great unmet need that patients with cancer in general and lung cancer, in particular, still face.
In addition to our Libtayo monotherapy and chemo combination opportunities in lung cancer, we are developing several bispecifics. Our EGFRxCD28 co-stim and Libtayo combination is in dose escalation for lung and other advanced cancers. Our MET X MET bispecific antibody is enrolling non-small cell lung cancer patients with a broad selection of patients, including MET Exon 14  gene mutation, gene amplification and/or elevated MET protein expression.
And as we introduced at our ASCO investor event, our first antibody drug conjugate, MET X MET ADC, is poised to enter the clinic in the coming months with a focus on patients with MET Overexpressing cancers, including lung cancer, where MET Overexpression occurs in as many as 25% of patients.
In terms of building on the potential of Libtayo with combinations in skin cancer, we recently announced new clinical data for the combination of Libtayo with fianlimab, our LAG-3 inhibitor, in advanced melanoma at the ASCO annual meeting in June. The combination demonstrated a 67% response rate in PD-1 or PD-L1 naive patients with potential for a more favorable safety profile than with the anti-CTLA-4 PD-1 combinations. We plan to initiate a Phase III study of fianlimab and Libtayo as a first-line treatment for advanced melanoma in 2022.
Ovarian cancer is the first tumor type for which we are clinically testing 3 powerful combination approaches. First, our MUC16xCD3 bispecific with Libtayo, where we hope to share initial data next year. Next, our MUC16xCD28 co-stim bispecific with Libtayo. And third, our novel combination of the CD3 and co-stim bispecifics for which we have now dosed the first patient.
This latter combination of 2 bispecifics of 2 different classes has potential to be a novel and disruptive approach for the treatment of solid tumors. Rounding out my commentary in solid tumors, our PSMAxCD28 program in prostate cancer continues in dose escalation with Libtayo, and we hope to share initial data next year.
As we mentioned previously, we are planning on introducing a PSMAxCD3 bispecific to the clinic later this year, providing another unique experimental combination for prostate cancer treatment. The tumor viewed as nonresponsive currently to available immunotherapies.
Moving on to hematologic cancers, and starting with lymphoma. Odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific, has demonstrated encouraging efficacy and durability of responses in hard-to-treat patient populations. We have resumed enrollment in our potentially pivotal Phase II program in follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, with lifting of the partial clinical hold following protocol amendments for a modified step-up dosing protocol.
Later this year, we plan to initiate testing of the odronextamab subcutaneous formulation. And next year, we plan to initiate the Phase III program as well as combination trials with our lymphoma-specific co-stim bispecific.
In multiple myeloma, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific is on track to complete enrollment in a potentially pivotal Phase II study next year. We will also initiate studies evaluating a subcutaneous formulation in combinations with standard of care. 
With our unique position to mix and match multiple modalities and targets with the goal of deepening the responses we are already observing with our BCMAxCD3 bispecific, we are on track to start a combination study with a co-stim bispecific for multiple myeloma next year.
I would like to conclude with our Regeneron Genetics Medicines efforts. As you know, these efforts start with our Regeneron Genetics Center and its ability to genetically identify and validate new disease targets and is coupled with emerging gene-based therapeutic solutions to address these targets, including CRISPR-based technologies with our collaborator Intellia, siRNA technologies with Alnylam as well as viral gene delivery technologies we are developing in-house.
The Regeneron Genetics Center continues to emerge as a world leader in human sequencing and in defining genetic variants that can either be protective or causative for human disease, most recently identifying a major new gene target that protects against obesity as described in a high-profile publication in Science last month. For this newly discovered target, we are deploying several strategies to develop new classes of potential therapeutics to fight obesity and potentially type 2 diabetes.
In terms of progress with our gene-based therapeutics approaches, together with the Intellia, we recently announced positive clinical data for the first ever systemically delivered CRISPR-based gene knockout in human patients. 
In the first 6 patients with transthyretin amyloidosis, or TTR amyloidosis, a single systemic treatment led to dose-dependent reduction in the disease-causing protein with no serious adverse events observed through day 28. This proof-of-concept clinical data increases the probability of success for both our knockout as well as our Insertion CRISPR-based programs, unlocking the potential of many future possibilities for Intellia and Regeneron. 
Currently, we're evaluating more than 20 preclinical programs under this collaboration, and Regeneron has the rights to develop up to 15 in vivo products with Intellia.
Regarding our efforts with Alnylam, on an siRNA for a novel NASH target identified by the Regeneron Genetics Center, we are hoping to see initial healthy volunteer data by the end of this year. This 2-part first-in-human study is now enrolling NASH patients. We are currently evaluating about 20 preclinical programs under this collaboration, and Regeneron has rights to develop up to 30 products with Alnylam.
With that brief glimpse into the future of Genetics Medicines, I would like to turn the call over to Marion."

Our business performance in the second quarter reflects robust momentum, competitive strength and focused execution across our commercial portfolio. Our in-line medicines continue to thrive, and our ongoing launches are progressing to",908,"Thank you, George. Our business performance in the second quarter reflects robust momentum, competitive strength and focused execution across our commercial portfolio. 
Our in-line medicines continue to thrive, and our ongoing launches are progressing to plan, providing a platform for diversified growth.
First, I will highlight our efforts supporting REGEN-COV, our COVID-19 antibody cocktail, which is available under Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA. In the second quarter, U.S. net sales were $2.6 billion as a result of fulfilling our second contract with the U.S. government. There is significant ongoing need for effective treatments against COVID-19. As Len said, REGEN-COV utilization has recently accelerated and is now trending well over 50,000 doses ordered weekly. Uptake is driven by growing recognition of the importance of antibody cocktail treatment, focused educational efforts and competitive dynamics favoring REGEN-COV. We continue to work closely with all key stakeholders to increase REGEN-COV utilization and support hospitals and administration sites to reduce bottlenecks.
The REGEN-COV antibody cocktail is both FDA authorized and NIH recommended and retains potency against known variants. We've also expanded our efforts following the recent post-exposure prophylaxis authorization, the first for an antibody therapy in this setting.
Beyond REGEN-COV, our core portfolio performed very well in the second quarter. Starting with EYLEA. Second quarter global net sales grew 33% year-over-year to over $2.3 billion. In the U.S., EYLEA net sales grew 28% year-over-year to $1.42 billion driven by underlying demand, category share gains and a favorable comparison versus the second quarter of 2020. EYLEA is the anti-VEGF category growth leader and preferred treatment option.
As a reminder, EYLEA sets a high bar for efficacy and safety with more than 40 million injections administered worldwide, in a therapeutic category where patient vision and well-being are paramount. EYLEA continues to capture market and competitive share, securing nearly 50% of the overall category and 75% of the branded category.
Overall demand is improving with increased patient flow and return to pre-pandemic levels of new patient visits. Patients who may have delayed seeing the retina specialists are now seeking treatment.
With this backdrop, we are accelerating promotional efforts to address the significant unmet needs in diabetic eye disease. We are confident in Regeneron's ongoing leadership position in retinal diseases based on EYLEA's competitive advantages and future opportunities, including our high-dose program.
Turning to Libtayo, where second quarter global net sales grew to $117 million and the U.S. net sales grew 23% to $78 million. As expected, at this early stage of new indication launches, the vast majority of sales come from advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, where Libtayo is the #1 systemic treatment despite new in-class competition. 
Our launches in both advanced non-small cell lung cancer and basal cell carcinoma, or BCC, are progressing to plan. In BCC, Libtayo brand awareness is high among treating oncologists. We are encouraged by meaningful patient starts in the second quarter as Libtayo becomes a standard of care.
We're also making considerable progress in lung cancer where efforts are focused on establishing Libtayo in our monotherapy indication and will be important foundation for our potential future chemotherapy combination launch, which will be based on the data announced today. Our expanded field force is now fully deployed and securing early successes with treating physicians.
We're raising brand awareness, progressing formulary positioning and payer coverage. Lung cancer thought leaders recognized Libtayo's clinical differentiation, highlighting the rapid response rates and efficacy in patients with clinically stable brain metastases or high PD-L1 expression. In this highly competitive market, we remain focused on differentiating Libtayo and increasing physician experience. Today's exciting chemotherapy combination news has the potential to dramatically expand the patient opportunity for Libtayo in non-small cell lung cancer.
Turning now to Evkeeza, which was launched earlier this year in ultra-rare homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Key thought leaders recognized the benefits of Evkeeza, which delivers on efficacy, safety and tolerability in a market where many patients have struggled to stay on therapy in the face of life-threatening LDL cholesterol levels. We're encouraged by early initiations across switch and new-to-category patients and can see a future where Evkeeza becomes the standard of care.
Moving to Dupixent. Global net sales in the second quarter were $1.5 billion, growing 59% compared to the prior year. In the U.S., net sales grew 49% to $1.15 billion driven by broad-based growth across all approved indications. New patient starts are steadily growing and are above pre-COVID levels. 
In atopic dermatitis, prescribing trends are strong across a spectrum of moderate-to-severe disease, including adolescent and pediatric patients. There is significant and sustained growth opportunity for Dupixent in a market where it is the #1 dermatologist prescribed biologic. This is based on its well-established efficacy and safety profile, broad label for patients as young as 6 years old and unmatched real-world physician and patient experience. In addition, as George outlined, we see an exciting future opportunities in dermatology, starting with CSU. 
Dupixent is the leading biologic in respiratory disease poised to capture meaningful growth now and in the future. Our asthma results outpaced recent competitive biologic launches. Launch preparations are underway in the pediatric asthma setting with the first regulatory approval expected in the U.S. this October.
In nasal polyps, there's high demand among ENTs and allergists with patients initiated regardless of prior surgery. 
In summary, we delivered strong performance across our brands with current and potential future launches on track to deliver sustained growth.
Now I'll turn the call over to Bob."

My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis where applicable. 
In the second quarter, our core business continued to deliver impressive year-over-year growth bolstered by strong execution across the company to deliver the full 1.25 million dose contract to the U.S. government for REGEN-COV.
For the second quarter, total revenues grew 163% year-over-year to $5.1 billion. Excluding revenues related to the COVID-19 antibody cocktail, total revenue grew 22% versus the prior year. Total diluted net income per share grew 260% year-over-year to $25.80 on net income of $2.9 billion. 
In the second quarter, we recognized $2.6 billion of U.S. REGEN-COV sales, representing the vast majority of revenue related to the delivery of 1.25 million doses to the U.S. government. Due to revenue recognition rules, a residual $34 million of net product sales for doses delivered under this contract will be recorded in the third quarter. Given the delivery of these doses to the U.S. government and current utilization rates, we anticipate the current U.S. government's supply will be exhausted by the end of the year. We do not expect to record substantial additional sales this year in the U.S. unless the number of cases and related utilization continue to increase exponentially.
I will now move to collaboration revenues, which were $955 million in the second quarter of 2021 as compared to $513 million second quarter of 2020. 
Let me begin with the Roche collaboration. Ex U.S. sales of the COVID antibody cocktail known as Ronapreve outside of the U.S. were $470 million as reported to us by Roche. We recorded $168 million in Roche collaboration revenue for our share of profits from Roche's sale of Ronapreve, which is now available or approved in more than 20 countries. With new COVID cases on the rise globally, we expect the Ronapreve will continue to be a meaningful revenue contributor in 2021.
With regard to our Bayer collaboration, ex U.S. EYLEA net product sales, reported to us by Bayer, were $904 million for the second quarter of 2021, representing growth of 41% on a reported basis and 31% on a constant currency basis as a result of broad market recovery and a favorable comparison versus the prior year.
Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $349 million, of which we recorded $335 million for our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S.
Finally, total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $438 million in the second quarter of 2021. Our share of the profits from the commercialization of Dupixent and Kevzara was $328 million, which nearly doubled when compared to profits of $172 million in the prior year. 
Other revenue was $46 million in the second quarter compared to $212 million in the prior year. The decrease is primarily related to nonrecurring reimbursements from BARDA in 2020 for development of COVID-19 and Ebola treatments. We continue to expect 2021 other revenue to be less than half of what was recorded in 2020 on a full year basis.
Moving on to our operating expenses. R&D increased 11% year-over-year to $643 million, primarily due to continued clinical development costs for our REGEN-COV antibody cocktail and higher headcount to support our expanding pipeline.
Next, SG&A expense increased 21% year-over-year to $365 million due to costs related to COVID-19 related activities, launch investments for Libtayo, growth initiatives for EYLEA and higher headcount. 
Cost of goods sold increased versus the prior year from $93 million to $514 million primarily due to REGEN-COV manufacturing costs. 
Finally, the effective tax rate was 17% in the second quarter of 2021, reflecting the impact of REGEN-COV sales, which were taxed at the U.S. statutory rate.
Shifting to cash flow and the balance sheet. In the second quarter of 2021, Regeneron generated $478 million in free cash flow and ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities less debt of $5.1 billion. We received the full $2.625 billion of cash associated with completion of our second REGEN-COV contract with the U.S. government in July. As the business continues its strong performance, we are reiterating our capital allocation priorities of investing in internal R&D, funding strategic external R&D partnerships and returning cash to shareholders.
Accordingly, in July, we announced the new $1.8 billion expansion of our Tarrytown facilities primarily directed toward additional internal R&D operations and capabilities. We also continue to advance our next-generation technology partnerships with companies like Intellia and Alnylam, which are beginning to bear fruit as targets get selected and programs move forward into development. 
Finally, in the second quarter, we repurchased $289 million of our shares, and we remain opportunistic buyers in the market.
To conclude, I'd like to provide select updates to our 2021 guidance. A complete summary of our latest full year guidance is available in our press release published earlier this morning. We are updating our full year 2021 guidance for SG&A to be in the range of $1.54 billion to $1.62 billion. The change is related to increased efforts in the second half for REGEN-COV.
We are also revising our full year 2021 guidance for R&D to be in the range of $2.65 billion to $2.75 billion. The change is driven by lower-than-expected spend on REGEN-COV.
Finally, we now expect our full year 2021 non-GAAP effective tax rate guidance to be in the range of 14% to 16% driven by higher sales of REGEN-COV, which, as I said, are taxed at the U.S. statutory rate. 
In conclusion, Regeneron performed exceptionally well in the second quarter with the core business continuing on a strong growth trajectory as we invest in our diverse and differentiated pipeline for long-term sustainable growth.
With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Justin."

I think it's important to note, as you said, it's very difficult to compare cross studies done years apart and especially when we allowed classes of patients that were not previously allowed in other studies and so forth. 
As you pointed out, the median survival numbers are right on top of each other. But as you also point out, we had 2 different subtypes in this study. I can comment in our preliminary analyses, and these remain to be fully validated and so forth. In one of the subtypes, our hazard ratio was better than what was observed with the Keytruda study and the other one, it was worse. It's important to point out that these things bounce around in these cross-study comparisons. As you know, in other settings, if try to do cross country -- cross-study comparisons, for example, when you compare our monotherapy results in the greater than 50% PDL population, it looks like our numbers are substantially better in the skin and particularly with the CSCC comparisons they're better. So these things bounce around. It's always hard to do these things. 
But I think the important thing to point out is that in this field in lung cancer, very few have hit in both monotherapy greater than 50% and in chemo combination all comers. I remind you that Opdivo gained than most of the PD-L1s did. So right now, there is only 2 PD-1 antibodies that standalone, having demonstrated overall survival benefit, both in the monotherapy setting as well as now in the chemo combination setting. I think this really well positions Libtayo and across all the studies, I think it's -- the definitive conclusion is that it's a very active molecule that looks at least as active as any other agents out there."

As you said, we think that the immunocompromised population which, as I'm sure you all know, represents 3% to 4% of the U.S. population, that several million individuals, a variety of studies are showing that somewhere around 50% or more of these individuals do not respond after 2 or even after 3 attempts with the vaccine. And so these people are left without their own antibodies to protect them.
So it's a huge unmet need setting where these individuals will not be protected. And as we're all seeing that it's very unlikely that we will be eliminating spread of infections through breakthrough infections, whether it was symptomatic or otherwise throughout the population and for these individuals to be able to live normal lives, they're going to need protection.
And we believe that the most powerful protection is essentially providing them with these surrogate antibodies that our antibody cocktail provides. We already have very strong data, we believe, to support the notion that this agent can be used in chronic prevention settings, and we do intend to continue to explore future study opportunities where we can further enhance on the already existing data that shows that after the first week or so, we seem to obtain somewhere upwards of 90% protection against infection in individuals who do not have their own antibodies and are being exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. I think that is very strong data that bodes very well that this is in -- potential to be a very important treatment, particularly for these immunocompromised individuals who do not have antibodies of their own."

The contract we have has been fulfilled. And so the government is going to need to decide whether or not they want to have another contract or they want us to switch over to a commercial model, which could occur before or after a regular approval as it did with Remdesivir.
I think a lot of that is going to depend upon the government's assessment of what they think is the most efficient way to get people to use that product. There's been a tremendous acceleration in use. Our penetration in terms of addressing what we would say, estimated eligible patients has gone up dramatically to somewhere in the low single digits to almost 25% to 30% more recently in terms of eligible patients getting monoclonals.
If that trend continues along with the trend of unfortunately, more cases, obviously, we're going to have to go with the direction that the government wants, another contract or a commericial switchover. Capacity, of course, is always an issue, but we think we're sort of well positioned to continue to supply similar amounts that we've been able to supply and we'll have to look at -- and these demands continued pretty rapidly.

So we're really excited about the chemotherapy combination data that was shared today. And in fact, if I quantify it, that indication in terms of patient potential is about 4x the size of the mono indication. But what we're doing today in the market commercially is certainly foundational to Libtayo and our oncology portfolio more broadly. I'll comment, we are still the standard of care in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. That was a very effective launch. We now have a competitor in that indication, but we retain our leadership.
The basal cell carcinoma launch is also going well. And certainly, the efficacy and tolerability, safety of Libtayo is paramount for those patients, and we offer an alternative where the specialists in that area do believe Libtayo as evolving to become the standard of care. It's early days in lung. I think our team is doing a really good job. And when we talk to the opinion leaders, they're most excited, as I mentioned, about our rapid action, our efficacy, even in those patients with stable brain metastases and with the high expression PD-L1 patients. So early days, we are right on track with where we expected to be, but there's a lot more potential and a lot more work to do."

I think the genetics very strongly point to that. That's what it actually shows that this genetic target affects and that's what the protective mutations are actually showing. So we're excited about looking at this opportunity, whether we can halt or even reverse inflammatory signals, inflammatory processes and thus, actual progression of the disease irregardless of steatosis."

So if you take, for example, that maybe it was 100,000 new cases, maybe 70,000 of them would be eligible. So that gives you an idea. I was just looking, Mike, at this to see what our repeat orders were. And the vast, vast majority, I think it's around or above 90% of the institutions ordering have -- are repeat orders, meaning that they're not people just stocking the stuff to have it around.

So obviously, those are -- chances of success are greatly bolstered by what we've seen with these first-in-human results. But we also have, I think, just as if not even more exciting, a CRISPR-based gene insertion program that we're very excited about. And since it depends on essentially overlapping technologies, this program and its chance of success has greatly been increased based on the results we've seen to date.
So we think that with the fact that we have so many programs ongoing in our collaboration with Intellia, more than 20 programs under evaluation, and we have the ability to move forward quite a few of these, we're very excited that this could really change the practice of medicine and really bring CRISPR-based gene therapy to patients into the world.

We had an outstanding performance across the enterprise in the second quarter. Not only did our base business performed exceptionally well with strong growth from EYLEA, Dupixent and Libtayo but we also delivered 1.25 million doses of REGEN-COV for the United States government, fulfilling the entire supply contract with BARDA. 
We also continue to advance multiple programs across our innovative R&D pipeline with several important readout.
Starting with EYLEA. Global net sales were over $2.3 billion, growing 33% compared to the prior year, reflecting recovery from the COVID pandemic impact on the second quarter of 2020. In the U.S., sales grew 28%. EYLEA continues to set a high bar in terms of efficacy, safety and convenience.
Dupixent also performed exceptionally well this quarter with global sales of $1.5 billion and growth of 59%. This quarter also marks the first time we and Sanofi exceeded $1 billion in U.S. Dupixent quarterly net sales. There remains considerable room for further growth from our in-line indications as well as from potential new opportunities, such as in chronic spontaneous urticaria, or CSU, where last week we announced positive Phase III study results.
We have additional Phase III readouts in prurigo nodularis, eosinophilic esophagitis and pediatric atopic dermatitis later this year, which could advance our conviction of Dupixent as a pipeline in a product to address numerous inflammatory diseases.
In oncology, Libtayo global net sales were $117 million and grew 46% with meaningful growth contributions from both inside and outside the United States. We also announced this morning that in a large Phase III pivotal study in non-small cell lung cancer, Libtayo, combined with standard chemotherapy, reduced the risk of death by nearly 30% compared to chemotherapy alone. We are eager to share these data with regulatory agencies, which, if approved, would dramatically increase the number of lung cancer eligible patients who could be treated with Libtayo.
We also began to see meaningful results from our Regeneron Genetics Medicines pipeline. With our collaborators at Intellia, we showed the first ever proof-of-concept in vivo genome editing with NTLA-2001, investigational CRISPR therapy for transthyretin amyloidosis, or ATTR amyloidosis. This proof-of-concept study utilizing systemically administered CRISPR technology for genome modification suggests this approach could have broad applicability across a wide range of diseases.
Beyond Intellia, our collaborations with Alnylam and Decibel are helping to form a whole new pipeline for next-generation therapies beyond our broad and diverse antibody pipeline. 
The second quarter represented another landmark in our efforts to combat COVID-19, which unfortunately, despite considerable rates of vaccination, continues to be a major global health concern with rising cases and emerging variants.  In addition to fulfilling our entire supply contract with the United States government, we were able to secure Emergency Use Authorization updates for our lower 1.2-gram subcutaneous dose as well as for post-exposure prophylaxis for certain appropriate patients who are at high risk for disease. Utilization is increasing rapidly at currently more than 50,000 doses ordered per week. 
We also announced that the U.K. RECOVERY study showed a 20% reduction in risk of death in hospitalized patients who had not mounted their own immune response.
With these results, together with supporting data from Regeneron study in hospitalized patients that George will discuss momentarily, REGEN-COV has the potential, if so authorized, to be the first treatment to be used in a wide spectrum of COVID-19 disease settings from prevention through the hospitalized setting.
In summary, our core business is strong and continues to diversify, and our innovative pipeline continues to advance, positioning Regeneron well for long-term growth.
Now I will turn the call over to George."

We have a lot to talk about this morning, which is all possible because of our Regeneron colleagues who have been working nonstop throughout this pandemic. And unfortunately, the world is still in the throes of this global COVID-19 pandemi",2252,"Thank you, Len. We have a lot to talk about this morning, which is all possible because of our Regeneron colleagues who have been working nonstop throughout this pandemic. And unfortunately, the world is still in the throes of this global COVID-19 pandemic as the numbers of infected individuals in the United States are climbing again with nearly 100,000 Americans becoming infected every day. Therefore, I will start with Regeneron -- with REGEN-COV, our monoclonal antibody cocktail for COVID-19.
In June, the REGEN-COV Emergency Use Authorization, or EUA, was updated to include the lower 1.2-gram REGEN-COV dose with both intravenous and subcutaneous administration for nonhospitalized patients. This EUA was supported by Phase III data showing that the 1.2-gram dose reduced risk of hospitalization or death by 70%. Just last week, the EUA was further expanded to include utilization in post-exposure prophylaxis for COVID-19 in certain populations, and also allows for repeated monthly dosing of REGEN-COV for high-risk patients, such as the immunocompromised who are at high risk of ongoing exposure to infected individuals in the same institutional setting.
This latest authorization makes REGEN-COV the only treatment that is available for both treating infected individuals and also preventing infection in certain settings. We would like to emphasize that REGEN-COV is not a substitute for vaccination.
Still under review by the FDA, our additional data, which we believe could broaden the prevention application to pre-exposure prophylaxis as well as to extend the treatment paradigm to hospitalized patients. The details of Part A of our Phase III prophylaxis study in which we assessed efficacy and safety of subcutaneous REGEN-COV in preventing infection among previously uninfected individuals has just been published today in the New England Journal of Medicine.
We believe there is enormous unmet need to try to protect immunocompromised individuals who have not responded to the vaccine and we hope that the FDA will agree that our data will support an authorization in this pre-exposure prophylaxis setting.
 
For hospitalized patients, we recently reported that REGEN-COV, tested as part of the Oxford University Phase III RECOVERY study, met its primary outcome, reducing risk of death by 20% in hospitalized COVID-19 patients lacking immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Data from our own smaller study in hospitalized COVID-19 patients showed similar conclusions with 35% reduction in overall mortality in this study, which was limited to earlier-stage hospitalized patients with no oxygen or low oxygen support. These collective data from RECOVERY and from our study in hospitalized patients have been shared with regulators.
In addition, we are on track to complete the REGEN-COV BLA submissions in the second half of 2021. 
Outside of the United States, our collaborator Roche obtained emergency or temporary pandemic use authorizations for our COVID-19 antibody cocktail, known as Ronapreve outside the United States in more than 20 countries across the European Union, India, Switzerland and Canada, with more authorizations expected soon. Japan was the first country to grant formal regulatory approval to our antibody cocktail for COVID-19.
Finally, REGEN-COV retains potent activity against all known variants of interest, including the Delta variant. For patients at high risk of serious consequences, including many with an inadequate response to vaccines, REGEN-COV could be an important option to patients and their physicians for the foreseeable future.
Moving on to ophthalmology. In the coming months, we expect data from the Phase II study of high dose aflibercept in wet AMD. This readout will consist of efficacy assessments on drawing in other anatomical measures as well as safety on the 8-milligram and the currently approved 2-milligram aflibercept dose at an 8-week dosing interval. 
In the 106 patients dosed in the open-label Phase II to date, we have not seen any concerning safety signals. While this smaller study will not be definitive on durability measures, the Phase II data will help provide insights into the larger Phase III studies, which are testing high-dose aflibercept dosing intervals out to 12 and 16 weeks. I'm pleased to announce that the Phase III studies in DME and AMD have completed enrollment, allowing for Phase III data next year.
Moving on to Dupixent in our immunology and inflammation portfolio. Just last week, we announced that a Phase III trial in chronic spontaneous urticaria, or CSU, met primary and all key 24-week secondary endpoints, showing Dupixent reduced itch and hive activity scores by nearly half. This is the fifth disease in which Dupixent demonstrated positive pivotal trial results, and efficacy in this disease raises the possibility that IL-4 and IL-13 are critical drivers in diseases not traditionally thought to be driven by type 2 inflammation.
We plan to report results from a second trial in CSU patients who are not benefiting from the approved standard of care biologic in early 2022. This positive readout in CSU is continuing to build on Dupixent's efficacy and safety demonstrated across other inflammatory diseases. In the upcoming months, we also expect results from our confirmatory Phase IIIb study in adult and adolescent patients with eosinophilic esophagitis as well as readout of a Phase III study in prurigo nodularis. Thus far, Dupixent is approved in patients as young as 6 years old in atopic dermatitis and 12 years old in asthma. 
Later this year, we will report data from a Phase III study in preschool children as young as 6 months up to 5 years of age suffering from atopic dermatitis. In asthma, we anticipate a regulatory decision in October for children aged 6 to 11 years old in the United States.
Moving to our anti-interleukin-33 antibody, itepekimab. Results of the Phase II study in COPD patients were recently published in Lancet Respiratory Medicine. While the trial exhibited strong trends in its primary endpoint of exacerbation reduction in the overall population, which did not meet statistical significance, a pre-specified subgroup analysis of former smokers with COPD is what accounted for the overall benefit with no negative subset in the remaining population. In the pre-specified former smoker subgroup, itepekimab demonstrated a 42% reduction in exacerbations and improvement in lung function of 0.09 liters compared to placebo with both endpoints reaching nominal statistical significance.
Moreover, the publication includes genetic analyses that support a protective role for interleukin-33 in COPD. Based on these results, we and Sanofi are assessing the potential of itepekimab in 2 Phase III studies focused on the former smoker population with COPD. I should also remind you that we have 2 ongoing studies with phase -- 2 ongoing Phase III studies with Dupixent in a complementary COPD population.
We are also progressing our novel approaches to treat allergies by using cocktails of monoclonal antibodies to directly bind and inactivate allergens, which have produced robust results in Phase II studies. Results of the initial Phase III study of our antibody cocktail against birch allergy caused by the Bet v 1 allergen are expected later this year. The first Phase III study of an antibody cocktail for cat allergy caused by Fel d 1 allergen is now open for enrollment. We are enthusiastic about these innovative additions to our inflammation and immunology portfolio. 
In oncology, following its recent approvals in the United States for certain first-line non-small cell lung cancer in certain advanced basal cell carcinoma patients, Libtayo was subsequently approved in the EU for these settings. Furthermore, compelling overall survival data in second-line cervical cancer patients were presented at an ESMO Virtual Plenary in May with the regulatory submissions to the FDA and EMA planned for this year.
For lung cancer, we are pleased to report today that in our Phase III trial comparing Libtayo plus standard chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone, the independent data monitoring committee recommended halting the trial for efficacy at the second interim analysis. Libtayo plus chemotherapy significantly improved overall survival as well as progression-free survival compared to chemotherapy alone in first-line locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.
With these data, Libtayo is now the second PD-1 targeting antibody that has been able to demonstrate significant overall survival benefit both as a monotherapy as well as in combination with chemotherapy for treating advanced lung cancer. With this validation, Libtayo provides an important foundation for a broad and multifaceted approach to address the great unmet need that patients with cancer in general and lung cancer, in particular, still face.
In addition to our Libtayo monotherapy and chemo combination opportunities in lung cancer, we are developing several bispecifics. Our EGFRxCD28 co-stim and Libtayo combination is in dose escalation for lung and other advanced cancers. Our MET X MET bispecific antibody is enrolling non-small cell lung cancer patients with a broad selection of patients, including MET Exon 14  gene mutation, gene amplification and/or elevated MET protein expression.
And as we introduced at our ASCO investor event, our first antibody drug conjugate, MET X MET ADC, is poised to enter the clinic in the coming months with a focus on patients with MET Overexpressing cancers, including lung cancer, where MET Overexpression occurs in as many as 25% of patients.
In terms of building on the potential of Libtayo with combinations in skin cancer, we recently announced new clinical data for the combination of Libtayo with fianlimab, our LAG-3 inhibitor, in advanced melanoma at the ASCO annual meeting in June. The combination demonstrated a 67% response rate in PD-1 or PD-L1 naive patients with potential for a more favorable safety profile than with the anti-CTLA-4 PD-1 combinations. We plan to initiate a Phase III study of fianlimab and Libtayo as a first-line treatment for advanced melanoma in 2022.
Ovarian cancer is the first tumor type for which we are clinically testing 3 powerful combination approaches. First, our MUC16xCD3 bispecific with Libtayo, where we hope to share initial data next year. Next, our MUC16xCD28 co-stim bispecific with Libtayo. And third, our novel combination of the CD3 and co-stim bispecifics for which we have now dosed the first patient.
This latter combination of 2 bispecifics of 2 different classes has potential to be a novel and disruptive approach for the treatment of solid tumors. Rounding out my commentary in solid tumors, our PSMAxCD28 program in prostate cancer continues in dose escalation with Libtayo, and we hope to share initial data next year.
As we mentioned previously, we are planning on introducing a PSMAxCD3 bispecific to the clinic later this year, providing another unique experimental combination for prostate cancer treatment. The tumor viewed as nonresponsive currently to available immunotherapies.
Moving on to hematologic cancers, and starting with lymphoma. Odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific, has demonstrated encouraging efficacy and durability of responses in hard-to-treat patient populations. We have resumed enrollment in our potentially pivotal Phase II program in follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, with lifting of the partial clinical hold following protocol amendments for a modified step-up dosing protocol.
Later this year, we plan to initiate testing of the odronextamab subcutaneous formulation. And next year, we plan to initiate the Phase III program as well as combination trials with our lymphoma-specific co-stim bispecific.
In multiple myeloma, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific is on track to complete enrollment in a potentially pivotal Phase II study next year. We will also initiate studies evaluating a subcutaneous formulation in combinations with standard of care. 
With our unique position to mix and match multiple modalities and targets with the goal of deepening the responses we are already observing with our BCMAxCD3 bispecific, we are on track to start a combination study with a co-stim bispecific for multiple myeloma next year.
I would like to conclude with our Regeneron Genetics Medicines efforts. As you know, these efforts start with our Regeneron Genetics Center and its ability to genetically identify and validate new disease targets and is coupled with emerging gene-based therapeutic solutions to address these targets, including CRISPR-based technologies with our collaborator Intellia, siRNA technologies with Alnylam as well as viral gene delivery technologies we are developing in-house.
The Regeneron Genetics Center continues to emerge as a world leader in human sequencing and in defining genetic variants that can either be protective or causative for human disease, most recently identifying a major new gene target that protects against obesity as described in a high-profile publication in Science last month. For this newly discovered target, we are deploying several strategies to develop new classes of potential therapeutics to fight obesity and potentially type 2 diabetes.
In terms of progress with our gene-based therapeutics approaches, together with the Intellia, we recently announced positive clinical data for the first ever systemically delivered CRISPR-based gene knockout in human patients. 
In the first 6 patients with transthyretin amyloidosis, or TTR amyloidosis, a single systemic treatment led to dose-dependent reduction in the disease-causing protein with no serious adverse events observed through day 28. This proof-of-concept clinical data increases the probability of success for both our knockout as well as our Insertion CRISPR-based programs, unlocking the potential of many future possibilities for Intellia and Regeneron. 
Currently, we're evaluating more than 20 preclinical programs under this collaboration, and Regeneron has the rights to develop up to 15 in vivo products with Intellia.
Regarding our efforts with Alnylam, on an siRNA for a novel NASH target identified by the Regeneron Genetics Center, we are hoping to see initial healthy volunteer data by the end of this year. This 2-part first-in-human study is now enrolling NASH patients. We are currently evaluating about 20 preclinical programs under this collaboration, and Regeneron has rights to develop up to 30 products with Alnylam.
With that brief glimpse into the future of Genetics Medicines, I would like to turn the call over to Marion."

Our business performance in the second quarter reflects robust momentum, competitive strength and focused execution across our commercial portfolio. Our in-line medicines continue to thrive, and our ongoing launches are progressing to",908,"Thank you, George. Our business performance in the second quarter reflects robust momentum, competitive strength and focused execution across our commercial portfolio. 
Our in-line medicines continue to thrive, and our ongoing launches are progressing to plan, providing a platform for diversified growth.
First, I will highlight our efforts supporting REGEN-COV, our COVID-19 antibody cocktail, which is available under Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA. In the second quarter, U.S. net sales were $2.6 billion as a result of fulfilling our second contract with the U.S. government. There is significant ongoing need for effective treatments against COVID-19. As Len said, REGEN-COV utilization has recently accelerated and is now trending well over 50,000 doses ordered weekly. Uptake is driven by growing recognition of the importance of antibody cocktail treatment, focused educational efforts and competitive dynamics favoring REGEN-COV. We continue to work closely with all key stakeholders to increase REGEN-COV utilization and support hospitals and administration sites to reduce bottlenecks.
The REGEN-COV antibody cocktail is both FDA authorized and NIH recommended and retains potency against known variants. We've also expanded our efforts following the recent post-exposure prophylaxis authorization, the first for an antibody therapy in this setting.
Beyond REGEN-COV, our core portfolio performed very well in the second quarter. Starting with EYLEA. Second quarter global net sales grew 33% year-over-year to over $2.3 billion. In the U.S., EYLEA net sales grew 28% year-over-year to $1.42 billion driven by underlying demand, category share gains and a favorable comparison versus the second quarter of 2020. EYLEA is the anti-VEGF category growth leader and preferred treatment option.
As a reminder, EYLEA sets a high bar for efficacy and safety with more than 40 million injections administered worldwide, in a therapeutic category where patient vision and well-being are paramount. EYLEA continues to capture market and competitive share, securing nearly 50% of the overall category and 75% of the branded category.
Overall demand is improving with increased patient flow and return to pre-pandemic levels of new patient visits. Patients who may have delayed seeing the retina specialists are now seeking treatment.
With this backdrop, we are accelerating promotional efforts to address the significant unmet needs in diabetic eye disease. We are confident in Regeneron's ongoing leadership position in retinal diseases based on EYLEA's competitive advantages and future opportunities, including our high-dose program.
Turning to Libtayo, where second quarter global net sales grew to $117 million and the U.S. net sales grew 23% to $78 million. As expected, at this early stage of new indication launches, the vast majority of sales come from advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, where Libtayo is the #1 systemic treatment despite new in-class competition. 
Our launches in both advanced non-small cell lung cancer and basal cell carcinoma, or BCC, are progressing to plan. In BCC, Libtayo brand awareness is high among treating oncologists. We are encouraged by meaningful patient starts in the second quarter as Libtayo becomes a standard of care.
We're also making considerable progress in lung cancer where efforts are focused on establishing Libtayo in our monotherapy indication and will be important foundation for our potential future chemotherapy combination launch, which will be based on the data announced today. Our expanded field force is now fully deployed and securing early successes with treating physicians.
We're raising brand awareness, progressing formulary positioning and payer coverage. Lung cancer thought leaders recognized Libtayo's clinical differentiation, highlighting the rapid response rates and efficacy in patients with clinically stable brain metastases or high PD-L1 expression. In this highly competitive market, we remain focused on differentiating Libtayo and increasing physician experience. Today's exciting chemotherapy combination news has the potential to dramatically expand the patient opportunity for Libtayo in non-small cell lung cancer.
Turning now to Evkeeza, which was launched earlier this year in ultra-rare homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Key thought leaders recognized the benefits of Evkeeza, which delivers on efficacy, safety and tolerability in a market where many patients have struggled to stay on therapy in the face of life-threatening LDL cholesterol levels. We're encouraged by early initiations across switch and new-to-category patients and can see a future where Evkeeza becomes the standard of care.
Moving to Dupixent. Global net sales in the second quarter were $1.5 billion, growing 59% compared to the prior year. In the U.S., net sales grew 49% to $1.15 billion driven by broad-based growth across all approved indications. New patient starts are steadily growing and are above pre-COVID levels. 
In atopic dermatitis, prescribing trends are strong across a spectrum of moderate-to-severe disease, including adolescent and pediatric patients. There is significant and sustained growth opportunity for Dupixent in a market where it is the #1 dermatologist prescribed biologic. This is based on its well-established efficacy and safety profile, broad label for patients as young as 6 years old and unmatched real-world physician and patient experience. In addition, as George outlined, we see an exciting future opportunities in dermatology, starting with CSU. 
Dupixent is the leading biologic in respiratory disease poised to capture meaningful growth now and in the future. Our asthma results outpaced recent competitive biologic launches. Launch preparations are underway in the pediatric asthma setting with the first regulatory approval expected in the U.S. this October.
In nasal polyps, there's high demand among ENTs and allergists with patients initiated regardless of prior surgery. 
In summary, we delivered strong performance across our brands with current and potential future launches on track to deliver sustained growth.
Now I'll turn the call over to Bob."
33715,1673288768,2368940,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2021",2021-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marion, and good morning and afternoon to everyone listening to the call. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis where applicable. In the second quarter, our core business continued to deliver",961,"Thanks, Marion, and good morning and afternoon to everyone listening to the call. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis where applicable. 
In the second quarter, our core business continued to deliver impressive year-over-year growth bolstered by strong execution across the company to deliver the full 1.25 million dose contract to the U.S. government for REGEN-COV.
For the second quarter, total revenues grew 163% year-over-year to $5.1 billion. Excluding revenues related to the COVID-19 antibody cocktail, total revenue grew 22% versus the prior year. Total diluted net income per share grew 260% year-over-year to $25.80 on net income of $2.9 billion. 
In the second quarter, we recognized $2.6 billion of U.S. REGEN-COV sales, representing the vast majority of revenue related to the delivery of 1.25 million doses to the U.S. government. Due to revenue recognition rules, a residual $34 million of net product sales for doses delivered under this contract will be recorded in the third quarter. Given the delivery of these doses to the U.S. government and current utilization rates, we anticipate the current U.S. government's supply will be exhausted by the end of the year. We do not expect to record substantial additional sales this year in the U.S. unless the number of cases and related utilization continue to increase exponentially.
I will now move to collaboration revenues, which were $955 million in the second quarter of 2021 as compared to $513 million second quarter of 2020. 
Let me begin with the Roche collaboration. Ex U.S. sales of the COVID antibody cocktail known as Ronapreve outside of the U.S. were $470 million as reported to us by Roche. We recorded $168 million in Roche collaboration revenue for our share of profits from Roche's sale of Ronapreve, which is now available or approved in more than 20 countries. With new COVID cases on the rise globally, we expect the Ronapreve will continue to be a meaningful revenue contributor in 2021.
With regard to our Bayer collaboration, ex U.S. EYLEA net product sales, reported to us by Bayer, were $904 million for the second quarter of 2021, representing growth of 41% on a reported basis and 31% on a constant currency basis as a result of broad market recovery and a favorable comparison versus the prior year.
Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $349 million, of which we recorded $335 million for our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S.
Finally, total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $438 million in the second quarter of 2021. Our share of the profits from the commercialization of Dupixent and Kevzara was $328 million, which nearly doubled when compared to profits of $172 million in the prior year. 
Other revenue was $46 million in the second quarter compared to $212 million in the prior year. The decrease is primarily related to nonrecurring reimbursements from BARDA in 2020 for development of COVID-19 and Ebola treatments. We continue to expect 2021 other revenue to be less than half of what was recorded in 2020 on a full year basis.
Moving on to our operating expenses. R&D increased 11% year-over-year to $643 million, primarily due to continued clinical development costs for our REGEN-COV antibody cocktail and higher headcount to support our expanding pipeline.
Next, SG&A expense increased 21% year-over-year to $365 million due to costs related to COVID-19 related activities, launch investments for Libtayo, growth initiatives for EYLEA and higher headcount. 
Cost of goods sold increased versus the prior year from $93 million to $514 million primarily due to REGEN-COV manufacturing costs. 
Finally, the effective tax rate was 17% in the second quarter of 2021, reflecting the impact of REGEN-COV sales, which were taxed at the U.S. statutory rate.
Shifting to cash flow and the balance sheet. In the second quarter of 2021, Regeneron generated $478 million in free cash flow and ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities less debt of $5.1 billion. We received the full $2.625 billion of cash associated with completion of our second REGEN-COV contract with the U.S. government in July. As the business continues its strong performance, we are reiterating our capital allocation priorities of investing in internal R&D, funding strategic external R&D partnerships and returning cash to shareholders.
Accordingly, in July, we announced the new $1.8 billion expansion of our Tarrytown facilities primarily directed toward additional internal R&D operations and capabilities. We also continue to advance our next-generation technology partnerships with companies like Intellia and Alnylam, which are beginning to bear fruit as targets get selected and programs move forward into development. 
Finally, in the second quarter, we repurchased $289 million of our shares, and we remain opportunistic buyers in the market.
To conclude, I'd like to provide select updates to our 2021 guidance. A complete summary of our latest full year guidance is available in our press release published earlier this morning. We are updating our full year 2021 guidance for SG&A to be in the range of $1.54 billion to $1.62 billion. The change is related to increased efforts in the second half for REGEN-COV.
We are also revising our full year 2021 guidance for R&D to be in the range of $2.65 billion to $2.75 billion. The change is driven by lower-than-expected spend on REGEN-COV.
Finally, we now expect our full year 2021 non-GAAP effective tax rate guidance to be in the range of 14% to 16% driven by higher sales of REGEN-COV, which, as I said, are taxed at the U.S. statutory rate. 
In conclusion, Regeneron performed exceptionally well in the second quarter with the core business continuing on a strong growth trajectory as we invest in our diverse and differentiated pipeline for long-term sustainable growth.
With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Justin."

I think it's important to note, as you said, it's very difficult to compare cross studies done years apart and especially when we allowed classes of patients that were not previously allowed in other studies and so forth. 
As you pointed out, the median survival numbers are right on top of each other. But as you also point out, we had 2 different subtypes in this study. I can comment in our preliminary analyses, and these remain to be fully validated and so forth. In one of the subtypes, our hazard ratio was better than what was observed with the Keytruda study and the other one, it was worse. It's important to point out that these things bounce around in these cross-study comparisons. As you know, in other settings, if try to do cross country -- cross-study comparisons, for example, when you compare our monotherapy results in the greater than 50% PDL population, it looks like our numbers are substantially better in the skin and particularly with the CSCC comparisons they're better. So these things bounce around. It's always hard to do these things. 
But I think the important thing to point out is that in this field in lung cancer, very few have hit in both monotherapy greater than 50% and in chemo combination all comers. I remind you that Opdivo gained than most of the PD-L1s did. So right now, there is only 2 PD-1 antibodies that standalone, having demonstrated overall survival benefit, both in the monotherapy setting as well as now in the chemo combination setting. I think this really well positions Libtayo and across all the studies, I think it's -- the definitive conclusion is that it's a very active molecule that looks at least as active as any other agents out there."

As you said, we think that the immunocompromised population which, as I'm sure you all know, represents 3% to 4% of the U.S. population, that several million individuals, a variety of studies are showing that somewhere around 50% or more of these individuals do not respond after 2 or even after 3 attempts with the vaccine. And so these people are left without their own antibodies to protect them.
So it's a huge unmet need setting where these individuals will not be protected. And as we're all seeing that it's very unlikely that we will be eliminating spread of infections through breakthrough infections, whether it was symptomatic or otherwise throughout the population and for these individuals to be able to live normal lives, they're going to need protection.
And we believe that the most powerful protection is essentially providing them with these surrogate antibodies that our antibody cocktail provides. We already have very strong data, we believe, to support the notion that this agent can be used in chronic prevention settings, and we do intend to continue to explore future study opportunities where we can further enhance on the already existing data that shows that after the first week or so, we seem to obtain somewhere upwards of 90% protection against infection in individuals who do not have their own antibodies and are being exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. I think that is very strong data that bodes very well that this is in -- potential to be a very important treatment, particularly for these immunocompromised individuals who do not have antibodies of their own."

The contract we have has been fulfilled. And so the government is going to need to decide whether or not they want to have another contract or they want us to switch over to a commercial model, which could occur before or after a regular approval as it did with Remdesivir.
I think a lot of that is going to depend upon the government's assessment of what they think is the most efficient way to get people to use that product. There's been a tremendous acceleration in use. Our penetration in terms of addressing what we would say, estimated eligible patients has gone up dramatically to somewhere in the low single digits to almost 25% to 30% more recently in terms of eligible patients getting monoclonals.
If that trend continues along with the trend of unfortunately, more cases, obviously, we're going to have to go with the direction that the government wants, another contract or a commericial switchover. Capacity, of course, is always an issue, but we think we're sort of well positioned to continue to supply similar amounts that we've been able to supply and we'll have to look at -- and these demands continued pretty rapidly. And of course, we do have our partner, Roche, who's got capacity that we can perhaps turn to. So a lot of moving parts, Yaron.

I'll comment, we are still the standard of care in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. That was a very effective launch. We now have a competitor in that indication, but we retain our leadership.
The basal cell carcinoma launch is also going well. And certainly, the efficacy and tolerability, safety of Libtayo is paramount for those patients, and we offer an alternative where the specialists in that area do believe Libtayo as evolving to become the standard of care. It's early days in lung. I think our team is doing a really good job. And when we talk to the opinion leaders, they're most excited, as I mentioned, about our rapid action, our efficacy, even in those patients with stable brain metastases and with the high expression PD-L1 patients.

We had an outstanding performance across the enterprise in the second quarter. Not only did our base business performed exceptionally well with strong growth from EYLEA, Dupixent and Libtayo",609,"Thank you, Justin, and thanks to everyone joining today's call. We had an outstanding performance across the enterprise in the second quarter. Not only did our base business performed exceptionally well with strong growth from EYLEA, Dupixent and Libtayo but we also delivered 1.25 million doses of REGEN-COV for the United States government, fulfilling the entire supply contract with BARDA. 
We also continue to advance multiple programs across our innovative R&D pipeline with several important readout.
Starting with EYLEA. Global net sales were over $2.3 billion, growing 33% compared to the prior year, reflecting recovery from the COVID pandemic impact on the second quarter of 2020. In the U.S., sales grew 28%. EYLEA continues to set a high bar in terms of efficacy, safety and convenience.
Dupixent also performed exceptionally well this quarter with global sales of $1.5 billion and growth of 59%. This quarter also marks the first time we and Sanofi exceeded $1 billion in U.S. Dupixent quarterly net sales. There remains considerable room for further growth from our in-line indications as well as from potential new opportunities, such as in chronic spontaneous urticaria, or CSU, where last week we announced positive Phase III study results.
We have additional Phase III readouts in prurigo nodularis, eosinophilic esophagitis and pediatric atopic dermatitis later this year, which could advance our conviction of Dupixent as a pipeline in a product to address numerous inflammatory diseases.
In oncology, Libtayo global net sales were $117 million and grew 46% with meaningful growth contributions from both inside and outside the United States. We also announced this morning that in a large Phase III pivotal study in non-small cell lung cancer, Libtayo, combined with standard chemotherapy, reduced the risk of death by nearly 30% compared to chemotherapy alone. We are eager to share these data with regulatory agencies, which, if approved, would dramatically increase the number of lung cancer eligible patients who could be treated with Libtayo.
We also began to see meaningful results from our Regeneron Genetics Medicines pipeline. With our collaborators at Intellia, we showed the first ever proof-of-concept in vivo genome editing with NTLA-2001, investigational CRISPR therapy for transthyretin amyloidosis, or ATTR amyloidosis. This proof-of-concept study utilizing systemically administered CRISPR technology for genome modification suggests this approach could have broad applicability across a wide range of diseases.
Beyond Intellia, our collaborations with Alnylam and Decibel are helping to form a whole new pipeline for next-generation therapies beyond our broad and diverse antibody pipeline. 
The second quarter represented another landmark in our efforts to combat COVID-19, which unfortunately, despite considerable rates of vaccination, continues to be a major global health concern with rising cases and emerging variants.  In addition to fulfilling our entire supply contract with the United States government, we were able to secure Emergency Use Authorization updates for our lower 1.2-gram subcutaneous dose as well as for post-exposure prophylaxis for certain appropriate patients who are at high risk for disease. Utilization is increasing rapidly at currently more than 50,000 doses ordered per week. 
We also announced that the U.K. RECOVERY study showed a 20% reduction in risk of death in hospitalized patients who had not mounted their own immune response.
With these results, together with supporting data from Regeneron study in hospitalized patients that George will discuss momentarily, REGEN-COV has the potential, if so authorized, to be the first treatment to be used in a wide spectrum of COVID-19 disease settings from prevention through the hospitalized setting.
In summary, our core business is strong and continues to diversify, and our innovative pipeline continues to advance, positioning Regeneron well for long-term growth.
Now I will turn the call over to George."
33715,1673288768,2372217,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2021",2021-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Len. We have a lot to talk about this morning, which is all possible because of our Regeneron colleagues who have been working nonstop throughout this pandemic. And unfortunately, the world is still in the throes of this global COVID-19 pandemi",2252,"Thank you, Len. We have a lot to talk about this morning, which is all possible because of our Regeneron colleagues who have been working nonstop throughout this pandemic. And unfortunately, the world is still in the throes of this global COVID-19 pandemic as the numbers of infected individuals in the United States are climbing again with nearly 100,000 Americans becoming infected every day. Therefore, I will start with Regeneron -- with REGEN-COV, our monoclonal antibody cocktail for COVID-19.
In June, the REGEN-COV Emergency Use Authorization, or EUA, was updated to include the lower 1.2-gram REGEN-COV dose with both intravenous and subcutaneous administration for nonhospitalized patients. This EUA was supported by Phase III data showing that the 1.2-gram dose reduced risk of hospitalization or death by 70%. Just last week, the EUA was further expanded to include utilization in post-exposure prophylaxis for COVID-19 in certain populations, and also allows for repeated monthly dosing of REGEN-COV for high-risk patients, such as the immunocompromised who are at high risk of ongoing exposure to infected individuals in the same institutional setting.
This latest authorization makes REGEN-COV the only treatment that is available for both treating infected individuals and also preventing infection in certain settings. We would like to emphasize that REGEN-COV is not a substitute for vaccination.
Still under review by the FDA, our additional data, which we believe could broaden the prevention application to pre-exposure prophylaxis as well as to extend the treatment paradigm to hospitalized patients. The details of Part A of our Phase III prophylaxis study in which we assessed efficacy and safety of subcutaneous REGEN-COV in preventing infection among previously uninfected individuals has just been published today in the New England Journal of Medicine.
We believe there is enormous unmet need to try to protect immunocompromised individuals who have not responded to the vaccine and we hope that the FDA will agree that our data will support an authorization in this pre-exposure prophylaxis setting.
 
For hospitalized patients, we recently reported that REGEN-COV, tested as part of the Oxford University Phase III RECOVERY study, met its primary outcome, reducing risk of death by 20% in hospitalized COVID-19 patients lacking immune response to SARS-CoV-2. Data from our own smaller study in hospitalized COVID-19 patients showed similar conclusions with 35% reduction in overall mortality in this study, which was limited to earlier-stage hospitalized patients with no oxygen or low oxygen support. These collective data from RECOVERY and from our study in hospitalized patients have been shared with regulators.
In addition, we are on track to complete the REGEN-COV BLA submissions in the second half of 2021. 
Outside of the United States, our collaborator Roche obtained emergency or temporary pandemic use authorizations for our COVID-19 antibody cocktail, known as Ronapreve outside the United States in more than 20 countries across the European Union, India, Switzerland and Canada, with more authorizations expected soon. Japan was the first country to grant formal regulatory approval to our antibody cocktail for COVID-19.
Finally, REGEN-COV retains potent activity against all known variants of interest, including the Delta variant. For patients at high risk of serious consequences, including many with an inadequate response to vaccines, REGEN-COV could be an important option to patients and their physicians for the foreseeable future.
Moving on to ophthalmology. In the coming months, we expect data from the Phase II study of high dose aflibercept in wet AMD. This readout will consist of efficacy assessments on drawing in other anatomical measures as well as safety on the 8-milligram and the currently approved 2-milligram aflibercept dose at an 8-week dosing interval. 
In the 106 patients dosed in the open-label Phase II to date, we have not seen any concerning safety signals. While this smaller study will not be definitive on durability measures, the Phase II data will help provide insights into the larger Phase III studies, which are testing high-dose aflibercept dosing intervals out to 12 and 16 weeks. I'm pleased to announce that the Phase III studies in DME and AMD have completed enrollment, allowing for Phase III data next year.
Moving on to Dupixent in our immunology and inflammation portfolio. Just last week, we announced that a Phase III trial in chronic spontaneous urticaria, or CSU, met primary and all key 24-week secondary endpoints, showing Dupixent reduced itch and hive activity scores by nearly half. This is the fifth disease in which Dupixent demonstrated positive pivotal trial results, and efficacy in this disease raises the possibility that IL-4 and IL-13 are critical drivers in diseases not traditionally thought to be driven by type 2 inflammation.
We plan to report results from a second trial in CSU patients who are not benefiting from the approved standard of care biologic in early 2022. This positive readout in CSU is continuing to build on Dupixent's efficacy and safety demonstrated across other inflammatory diseases. In the upcoming months, we also expect results from our confirmatory Phase IIIb study in adult and adolescent patients with eosinophilic esophagitis as well as readout of a Phase III study in prurigo nodularis. Thus far, Dupixent is approved in patients as young as 6 years old in atopic dermatitis and 12 years old in asthma. 
Later this year, we will report data from a Phase III study in preschool children as young as 6 months up to 5 years of age suffering from atopic dermatitis. In asthma, we anticipate a regulatory decision in October for children aged 6 to 11 years old in the United States.
Moving to our anti-interleukin-33 antibody, itepekimab. Results of the Phase II study in COPD patients were recently published in Lancet Respiratory Medicine. While the trial exhibited strong trends in its primary endpoint of exacerbation reduction in the overall population, which did not meet statistical significance, a pre-specified subgroup analysis of former smokers with COPD is what accounted for the overall benefit with no negative subset in the remaining population. In the pre-specified former smoker subgroup, itepekimab demonstrated a 42% reduction in exacerbations and improvement in lung function of 0.09 liters compared to placebo with both endpoints reaching nominal statistical significance.
Moreover, the publication includes genetic analyses that support a protective role for interleukin-33 in COPD. Based on these results, we and Sanofi are assessing the potential of itepekimab in 2 Phase III studies focused on the former smoker population with COPD. I should also remind you that we have 2 ongoing studies with phase -- 2 ongoing Phase III studies with Dupixent in a complementary COPD population.
We are also progressing our novel approaches to treat allergies by using cocktails of monoclonal antibodies to directly bind and inactivate allergens, which have produced robust results in Phase II studies. Results of the initial Phase III study of our antibody cocktail against birch allergy caused by the Bet v 1 allergen are expected later this year. The first Phase III study of an antibody cocktail for cat allergy caused by Fel d 1 allergen is now open for enrollment. We are enthusiastic about these innovative additions to our inflammation and immunology portfolio. 
In oncology, following its recent approvals in the United States for certain first-line non-small cell lung cancer in certain advanced basal cell carcinoma patients, Libtayo was subsequently approved in the EU for these settings. Furthermore, compelling overall survival data in second-line cervical cancer patients were presented at an ESMO Virtual Plenary in May with the regulatory submissions to the FDA and EMA planned for this year.
For lung cancer, we are pleased to report today that in our Phase III trial comparing Libtayo plus standard chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone, the independent data monitoring committee recommended halting the trial for efficacy at the second interim analysis. Libtayo plus chemotherapy significantly improved overall survival as well as progression-free survival compared to chemotherapy alone in first-line locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer.
With these data, Libtayo is now the second PD-1 targeting antibody that has been able to demonstrate significant overall survival benefit both as a monotherapy as well as in combination with chemotherapy for treating advanced lung cancer. With this validation, Libtayo provides an important foundation for a broad and multifaceted approach to address the great unmet need that patients with cancer in general and lung cancer, in particular, still face.
In addition to our Libtayo monotherapy and chemo combination opportunities in lung cancer, we are developing several bispecifics. Our EGFRxCD28 co-stim and Libtayo combination is in dose escalation for lung and other advanced cancers. Our MET X MET bispecific antibody is enrolling non-small cell lung cancer patients with a broad selection of patients, including MET Exon 14  gene mutation, gene amplification and/or elevated MET protein expression.
And as we introduced at our ASCO investor event, our first antibody drug conjugate, MET X MET ADC, is poised to enter the clinic in the coming months with a focus on patients with MET Overexpressing cancers, including lung cancer, where MET Overexpression occurs in as many as 25% of patients.
In terms of building on the potential of Libtayo with combinations in skin cancer, we recently announced new clinical data for the combination of Libtayo with fianlimab, our LAG-3 inhibitor, in advanced melanoma at the ASCO annual meeting in June. The combination demonstrated a 67% response rate in PD-1 or PD-L1 naive patients with potential for a more favorable safety profile than with the anti-CTLA-4 PD-1 combinations. We plan to initiate a Phase III study of fianlimab and Libtayo as a first-line treatment for advanced melanoma in 2022.
Ovarian cancer is the first tumor type for which we are clinically testing 3 powerful combination approaches. First, our MUC16xCD3 bispecific with Libtayo, where we hope to share initial data next year. Next, our MUC16xCD28 co-stim bispecific with Libtayo. And third, our novel combination of the CD3 and co-stim bispecifics for which we have now dosed the first patient.
This latter combination of 2 bispecifics of 2 different classes has potential to be a novel and disruptive approach for the treatment of solid tumors. Rounding out my commentary in solid tumors, our PSMAxCD28 program in prostate cancer continues in dose escalation with Libtayo, and we hope to share initial data next year.
As we mentioned previously, we are planning on introducing a PSMAxCD3 bispecific to the clinic later this year, providing another unique experimental combination for prostate cancer treatment. The tumor viewed as nonresponsive currently to available immunotherapies.
Moving on to hematologic cancers, and starting with lymphoma. Odronextamab, our CD20xCD3 bispecific, has demonstrated encouraging efficacy and durability of responses in hard-to-treat patient populations. We have resumed enrollment in our potentially pivotal Phase II program in follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, with lifting of the partial clinical hold following protocol amendments for a modified step-up dosing protocol.
Later this year, we plan to initiate testing of the odronextamab subcutaneous formulation. And next year, we plan to initiate the Phase III program as well as combination trials with our lymphoma-specific co-stim bispecific.
In multiple myeloma, our BCMAxCD3 bispecific is on track to complete enrollment in a potentially pivotal Phase II study next year. We will also initiate studies evaluating a subcutaneous formulation in combinations with standard of care. 
With our unique position to mix and match multiple modalities and targets with the goal of deepening the responses we are already observing with our BCMAxCD3 bispecific, we are on track to start a combination study with a co-stim bispecific for multiple myeloma next year.
I would like to conclude with our Regeneron Genetics Medicines efforts. As you know, these efforts start with our Regeneron Genetics Center and its ability to genetically identify and validate new disease targets and is coupled with emerging gene-based therapeutic solutions to address these targets, including CRISPR-based technologies with our collaborator Intellia, siRNA technologies with Alnylam as well as viral gene delivery technologies we are developing in-house.
The Regeneron Genetics Center continues to emerge as a world leader in human sequencing and in defining genetic variants that can either be protective or causative for human disease, most recently identifying a major new gene target that protects against obesity as described in a high-profile publication in Science last month. For this newly discovered target, we are deploying several strategies to develop new classes of potential therapeutics to fight obesity and potentially type 2 diabetes.
In terms of progress with our gene-based therapeutics approaches, together with the Intellia, we recently announced positive clinical data for the first ever systemically delivered CRISPR-based gene knockout in human patients. 
In the first 6 patients with transthyretin amyloidosis, or TTR amyloidosis, a single systemic treatment led to dose-dependent reduction in the disease-causing protein with no serious adverse events observed through day 28. This proof-of-concept clinical data increases the probability of success for both our knockout as well as our Insertion CRISPR-based programs, unlocking the potential of many future possibilities for Intellia and Regeneron. 
Currently, we're evaluating more than 20 preclinical programs under this collaboration, and Regeneron has the rights to develop up to 15 in vivo products with Intellia.
Regarding our efforts with Alnylam, on an siRNA for a novel NASH target identified by the Regeneron Genetics Center, we are hoping to see initial healthy volunteer data by the end of this year. This 2-part first-in-human study is now enrolling NASH patients. We are currently evaluating about 20 preclinical programs under this collaboration, and Regeneron has rights to develop up to 30 products with Alnylam.
With that brief glimpse into the future of Genetics Medicines, I would like to turn the call over to Marion."

Our business performance in the second quarter reflects robust momentum, competitive strength and focused execution across our commercial portfolio. Our in-line medicines continue to thrive, and our ongoing launches are progressing to",908,"Thank you, George. Our business performance in the second quarter reflects robust momentum, competitive strength and focused execution across our commercial portfolio. 
Our in-line medicines continue to thrive, and our ongoing launches are progressing to plan, providing a platform for diversified growth.
First, I will highlight our efforts supporting REGEN-COV, our COVID-19 antibody cocktail, which is available under Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA. In the second quarter, U.S. net sales were $2.6 billion as a result of fulfilling our second contract with the U.S. government. There is significant ongoing need for effective treatments against COVID-19. As Len said, REGEN-COV utilization has recently accelerated and is now trending well over 50,000 doses ordered weekly. Uptake is driven by growing recognition of the importance of antibody cocktail treatment, focused educational efforts and competitive dynamics favoring REGEN-COV. We continue to work closely with all key stakeholders to increase REGEN-COV utilization and support hospitals and administration sites to reduce bottlenecks.
The REGEN-COV antibody cocktail is both FDA authorized and NIH recommended and retains potency against known variants. We've also expanded our efforts following the recent post-exposure prophylaxis authorization, the first for an antibody therapy in this setting.
Beyond REGEN-COV, our core portfolio performed very well in the second quarter. Starting with EYLEA. Second quarter global net sales grew 33% year-over-year to over $2.3 billion. In the U.S., EYLEA net sales grew 28% year-over-year to $1.42 billion driven by underlying demand, category share gains and a favorable comparison versus the second quarter of 2020. EYLEA is the anti-VEGF category growth leader and preferred treatment option.
As a reminder, EYLEA sets a high bar for efficacy and safety with more than 40 million injections administered worldwide, in a therapeutic category where patient vision and well-being are paramount. EYLEA continues to capture market and competitive share, securing nearly 50% of the overall category and 75% of the branded category.
Overall demand is improving with increased patient flow and return to pre-pandemic levels of new patient visits. Patients who may have delayed seeing the retina specialists are now seeking treatment.
With this backdrop, we are accelerating promotional efforts to address the significant unmet needs in diabetic eye disease. We are confident in Regeneron's ongoing leadership position in retinal diseases based on EYLEA's competitive advantages and future opportunities, including our high-dose program.
Turning to Libtayo, where second quarter global net sales grew to $117 million and the U.S. net sales grew 23% to $78 million. As expected, at this early stage of new indication launches, the vast majority of sales come from advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, where Libtayo is the #1 systemic treatment despite new in-class competition. 
Our launches in both advanced non-small cell lung cancer and basal cell carcinoma, or BCC, are progressing to plan. In BCC, Libtayo brand awareness is high among treating oncologists. We are encouraged by meaningful patient starts in the second quarter as Libtayo becomes a standard of care.
We're also making considerable progress in lung cancer where efforts are focused on establishing Libtayo in our monotherapy indication and will be important foundation for our potential future chemotherapy combination launch, which will be based on the data announced today. Our expanded field force is now fully deployed and securing early successes with treating physicians.
We're raising brand awareness, progressing formulary positioning and payer coverage. Lung cancer thought leaders recognized Libtayo's clinical differentiation, highlighting the rapid response rates and efficacy in patients with clinically stable brain metastases or high PD-L1 expression. In this highly competitive market, we remain focused on differentiating Libtayo and increasing physician experience. Today's exciting chemotherapy combination news has the potential to dramatically expand the patient opportunity for Libtayo in non-small cell lung cancer.
Turning now to Evkeeza, which was launched earlier this year in ultra-rare homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Key thought leaders recognized the benefits of Evkeeza, which delivers on efficacy, safety and tolerability in a market where many patients have struggled to stay on therapy in the face of life-threatening LDL cholesterol levels. We're encouraged by early initiations across switch and new-to-category patients and can see a future where Evkeeza becomes the standard of care.
Moving to Dupixent. Global net sales in the second quarter were $1.5 billion, growing 59% compared to the prior year. In the U.S., net sales grew 49% to $1.15 billion driven by broad-based growth across all approved indications. New patient starts are steadily growing and are above pre-COVID levels. 
In atopic dermatitis, prescribing trends are strong across a spectrum of moderate-to-severe disease, including adolescent and pediatric patients. There is significant and sustained growth opportunity for Dupixent in a market where it is the #1 dermatologist prescribed biologic. This is based on its well-established efficacy and safety profile, broad label for patients as young as 6 years old and unmatched real-world physician and patient experience. In addition, as George outlined, we see an exciting future opportunities in dermatology, starting with CSU. 
Dupixent is the leading biologic in respiratory disease poised to capture meaningful growth now and in the future. Our asthma results outpaced recent competitive biologic launches. Launch preparations are underway in the pediatric asthma setting with the first regulatory approval expected in the U.S. this October.
In nasal polyps, there's high demand among ENTs and allergists with patients initiated regardless of prior surgery. 
In summary, we delivered strong performance across our brands with current and potential future launches on track to deliver sustained growth.
Now I'll turn the call over to Bob."
33715,1673288768,2372217,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2021",2021-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Marion, and good morning and afternoon to everyone listening to the call. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis where applicable. In the second quarter, our core business continued to deliver",961,"Thanks, Marion, and good morning and afternoon to everyone listening to the call. My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis where applicable. 
In the second quarter, our core business continued to deliver impressive year-over-year growth bolstered by strong execution across the company to deliver the full 1.25 million dose contract to the U.S. government for REGEN-COV.
For the second quarter, total revenues grew 163% year-over-year to $5.1 billion. Excluding revenues related to the COVID-19 antibody cocktail, total revenue grew 22% versus the prior year. Total diluted net income per share grew 260% year-over-year to $25.80 on net income of $2.9 billion. 
In the second quarter, we recognized $2.6 billion of U.S. REGEN-COV sales, representing the vast majority of revenue related to the delivery of 1.25 million doses to the U.S. government. Due to revenue recognition rules, a residual $34 million of net product sales for doses delivered under this contract will be recorded in the third quarter. Given the delivery of these doses to the U.S. government and current utilization rates, we anticipate the current U.S. government's supply will be exhausted by the end of the year. We do not expect to record substantial additional sales this year in the U.S. unless the number of cases and related utilization continue to increase exponentially.
I will now move to collaboration revenues, which were $955 million in the second quarter of 2021 as compared to $513 million second quarter of 2020. 
Let me begin with the Roche collaboration. Ex U.S. sales of the COVID antibody cocktail known as Ronapreve outside of the U.S. were $470 million as reported to us by Roche. We recorded $168 million in Roche collaboration revenue for our share of profits from Roche's sale of Ronapreve, which is now available or approved in more than 20 countries. With new COVID cases on the rise globally, we expect the Ronapreve will continue to be a meaningful revenue contributor in 2021.
With regard to our Bayer collaboration, ex U.S. EYLEA net product sales, reported to us by Bayer, were $904 million for the second quarter of 2021, representing growth of 41% on a reported basis and 31% on a constant currency basis as a result of broad market recovery and a favorable comparison versus the prior year.
Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $349 million, of which we recorded $335 million for our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S.
Finally, total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $438 million in the second quarter of 2021. Our share of the profits from the commercialization of Dupixent and Kevzara was $328 million, which nearly doubled when compared to profits of $172 million in the prior year. 
Other revenue was $46 million in the second quarter compared to $212 million in the prior year. The decrease is primarily related to nonrecurring reimbursements from BARDA in 2020 for development of COVID-19 and Ebola treatments. We continue to expect 2021 other revenue to be less than half of what was recorded in 2020 on a full year basis.
Moving on to our operating expenses. R&D increased 11% year-over-year to $643 million, primarily due to continued clinical development costs for our REGEN-COV antibody cocktail and higher headcount to support our expanding pipeline.
Next, SG&A expense increased 21% year-over-year to $365 million due to costs related to COVID-19 related activities, launch investments for Libtayo, growth initiatives for EYLEA and higher headcount. 
Cost of goods sold increased versus the prior year from $93 million to $514 million primarily due to REGEN-COV manufacturing costs. 
Finally, the effective tax rate was 17% in the second quarter of 2021, reflecting the impact of REGEN-COV sales, which were taxed at the U.S. statutory rate.
Shifting to cash flow and the balance sheet. In the second quarter of 2021, Regeneron generated $478 million in free cash flow and ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities less debt of $5.1 billion. We received the full $2.625 billion of cash associated with completion of our second REGEN-COV contract with the U.S. government in July. As the business continues its strong performance, we are reiterating our capital allocation priorities of investing in internal R&D, funding strategic external R&D partnerships and returning cash to shareholders.
Accordingly, in July, we announced the new $1.8 billion expansion of our Tarrytown facilities primarily directed toward additional internal R&D operations and capabilities. We also continue to advance our next-generation technology partnerships with companies like Intellia and Alnylam, which are beginning to bear fruit as targets get selected and programs move forward into development. 
Finally, in the second quarter, we repurchased $289 million of our shares, and we remain opportunistic buyers in the market.
To conclude, I'd like to provide select updates to our 2021 guidance. A complete summary of our latest full year guidance is available in our press release published earlier this morning. We are updating our full year 2021 guidance for SG&A to be in the range of $1.54 billion to $1.62 billion. The change is related to increased efforts in the second half for REGEN-COV.
We are also revising our full year 2021 guidance for R&D to be in the range of $2.65 billion to $2.75 billion. The change is driven by lower-than-expected spend on REGEN-COV.
Finally, we now expect our full year 2021 non-GAAP effective tax rate guidance to be in the range of 14% to 16% driven by higher sales of REGEN-COV, which, as I said, are taxed at the U.S. statutory rate. 
In conclusion, Regeneron performed exceptionally well in the second quarter with the core business continuing on a strong growth trajectory as we invest in our diverse and differentiated pipeline for long-term sustainable growth.
With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Justin."

I think it's important to note, as you said, it's very difficult to compare cross studies done years apart and especially when we allowed classes of patients that were not previously allowed in other studies and so forth. 
As you pointed out, the median survival numbers are right on top of each other. But as you also point out, we had 2 different subtypes in this study. I can comment in our preliminary analyses, and these remain to be fully validated and so forth. In one of the subtypes, our hazard ratio was better than what was observed with the Keytruda study and the other one, it was worse. It's important to point out that these things bounce around in these cross-study comparisons. As you know, in other settings, if try to do cross country -- cross-study comparisons, for example, when you compare our monotherapy results in the greater than 50% PDL population, it looks like our numbers are substantially better in the skin and particularly with the CSCC comparisons they're better. So these things bounce around. It's always hard to do these things. 
But I think the important thing to point out is that in this field in lung cancer, very few have hit in both monotherapy greater than 50% and in chemo combination all comers. I remind you that Opdivo gained than most of the PD-L1s did. So right now, there is only 2 PD-1 antibodies that standalone, having demonstrated overall survival benefit, both in the monotherapy setting as well as now in the chemo combination setting. I think this really well positions Libtayo and across all the studies, I think it's -- the definitive conclusion is that it's a very active molecule that looks at least as active as any other agents out there."

As you said, we think that the immunocompromised population which, as I'm sure you all know, represents 3% to 4% of the U.S. population, that several million individuals, a variety of studies are showing that somewhere around 50% or more of these individuals do not respond after 2 or even after 3 attempts with the vaccine. And so these people are left without their own antibodies to protect them.
So it's a huge unmet need setting where these individuals will not be protected. And as we're all seeing that it's very unlikely that we will be eliminating spread of infections through breakthrough infections, whether it was symptomatic or otherwise throughout the population and for these individuals to be able to live normal lives, they're going to need protection.
And we believe that the most powerful protection is essentially providing them with these surrogate antibodies that our antibody cocktail provides. We already have very strong data, we believe, to support the notion that this agent can be used in chronic prevention settings, and we do intend to continue to explore future study opportunities where we can further enhance on the already existing data that shows that after the first week or so, we seem to obtain somewhere upwards of 90% protection against infection in individuals who do not have their own antibodies and are being exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. I think that is very strong data that bodes very well that this is in -- potential to be a very important treatment, particularly for these immunocompromised individuals who do not have antibodies of their own."

The contract we have has been fulfilled. And so the government is going to need to decide whether or not they want to have another contract or they want us to switch over to a commercial model, which could occur before or after a regular approval as it did with Remdesivir.
I think a lot of that is going to depend upon the government's assessment of what they think is the most efficient way to get people to use that product. There's been a tremendous acceleration in use. Our penetration in terms of addressing what we would say, estimated eligible patients has gone up dramatically to somewhere in the low single digits to almost 25% to 30% more recently in terms of eligible patients getting monoclonals.
If that trend continues along with the trend of unfortunately, more cases, obviously, we're going to have to go with the direction that the government wants, another contract or a commericial switchover. Capacity, of course, is always an issue, but we think we're sort of well positioned to continue to supply similar amounts that we've been able to supply and we'll have to look at -- and these demands continued pretty rapidly.

So we're really excited about the chemotherapy combination data that was shared today. And in fact, if I quantify it, that indication in terms of patient potential is about 4x the size of the mono indication. But what we're doing today in the market commercially is certainly foundational to Libtayo and our oncology portfolio more broadly. I'll comment, we are still the standard of care in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. That was a very effective launch. We now have a competitor in that indication, but we retain our leadership.
The basal cell carcinoma launch is also going well. And certainly, the efficacy and tolerability, safety of Libtayo is paramount for those patients, and we offer an alternative where the specialists in that area do believe Libtayo as evolving to become the standard of care. It's early days in lung. I think our team is doing a really good job. And when we talk to the opinion leaders, they're most excited, as I mentioned, about our rapid action, our efficacy, even in those patients with stable brain metastases and with the high expression PD-L1 patients. So early days, we are right on track with where we expected to be, but there's a lot more potential and a lot more work to do."

I think the genetics very strongly point to that. That's what it actually shows that this genetic target affects and that's what the protective mutations are actually showing. So we're excited about looking at this opportunity, whether we can halt or even reverse inflammatory signals, inflammatory processes and thus, actual progression of the disease irregardless of steatosis."

He is quick to point out to me that when he joined the company, the stock was only around $300. And now he says it's significantly higher. Justin, we thank you for your great service.
Turning to our [indiscernible] we turned in another strong performance in the third quarter, which was marked by significant double-digit top and bottom line growth and continued operating leverage. This was more possible as a result of the truly exceptional execution by our colleagues across the entire company from production, commercial and support teams despite the challenges that we all faced imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Our core business of EYLEA, DUPIXENT and Libtayo, all contributed solid underlying growth. Additionally, we secured a third supply agreement with the United States government for REGEN-COV, our investigational antibody cocktail for treating and preventing COVID-19 in certain populations with initial deliveries fueling additional growth momentum in the quarter.
In R&D, our broad and growing pipeline, which now includes more than 30 clinical stage candidates with many more expected to enter the clinic in short order continues to advance new innovations to secure our long-term growth potential. [indiscernible], our pipeline continues to be largely composed and comprised of internal innovation. But increasingly, it is supplemented by external relationships that bring in novel modalities, including CRISPR and siRNA, creating unique treatment options and combination approaches as George will outline momentarily.
In the third quarter, [indiscernible], global net sales of EYLEA were $2.4 billion, growing 15% compared to the prior year. U.S. EYLEA sales grew 12%, reflecting recovery of the anti-VEGF category and share gains as the leading anti-VEGF treatment for retinal diseases. We see the strength of EYLEA an opportunity for steady growth continuing despite potential upcoming competition from which we currently do not see any disruptive or game-changing new engines to the anti-VEGF space for treating retinal diseases.
DUPIXENT continues to be remarkable in delivering commercially and clinically across a wide spectrum of type 2 inflammatory diseases. In the third quarter, global net sales grew 55% to $1.7 billion. Growth contributions from inside and outside of the United States continue to improve operating leverage in our alliance with Sanofi.
Moreover, we announced positive results from 4 Phase III registrational studies in recent months, 1 in very young children with atopic dermatitis, and 3 in the potential new indications of eosinophilic esophagitis, prurigo nodularis and chronic spontaneous urticaria.
In October, the FDA expanded our asthma label to include children aged 6 to 11, a testament to not only the efficacy, but also the safety of DUPIXENT in the chronic treatment of type 2 inflammatory diseases. With several other disease opportunities in clinical development, such as COPD, the expansion possibilities are significant for this remarkable medicine that is already changing the lives of hundreds of thousands of patients.
In oncology, Libtayo Global net sales were $120 million, and grew 24%. Despite the challenges imposed on the oncology market by COVID-19, we're working hard as the leader in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and progressing in our basal cell carcinoma and lung cancer launches. We are also preparing for a potential launch in 2022 in the much larger opportunity of Libtayo combined with chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer.
REGEN-COV continues to grow in importance with increased utilization in the treatment of COVID-19. The FDA has accepted under priority review our biologic license application for the treatment and prophylaxis of COVID-19 in certain patients. We are also on a view to expand the emergency use authorization for REGEN-COV in certain hospitalized patients and for pre-exposure prophylaxis.
Outside of the United States, our antibody cocktail has received a full approval in Japan, is conditionally approved in Australia and the U.K., and has emergency or temporary pandemic clause currently in place in more than 40 other countries.
REGEN-COV has the potential for a broad range of prevention and treatment applications from preexposure prophylaxis to treatment of infected hospitalized. Given the anticipation of new COVID infections over time, increased utilization of REGEN-COV in appropriate cases and the need for prophylaxis in immunocompromised individuals, we anticipate an ongoing role for REGEN-COV. If global demand [indiscernible] we have the capacity to produce between 4 million to 5 million 1.2 gram doses in 2022, excluding any further supply contributions from Roche.
To conclude, as we close out 2021, our growth momentum is strong and our outlook for continued growth fueled by the breadth and depth of our pipeline is bright. Now I will turn the call over to George."

I'll pick up where you left me with the REGEN-COV story. As Len mentioned, our robust COVID-19 development program involving more than 25,000 people to date has provided compelling evidence that REGEN-COV has the potential to be used for various prevention and treatment applications from pre-exposure prophylaxis to treating hospitalized patients.
In the United States, REGEN-COV is currently authorized under an EUA and also being reviewed for full FDA approval for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 in certain patients with an action date of April 13, 2022. At Regeneron, we all appreciate that widespread vaccination is the best way to broadly protect as many people as possible from COVID-19. But recent research also reveals some important gaps in coverage provided by the vaccines, leaving some individuals uniquely vulnerable, particularly the several million immunocompromised in the United States alone who remain prisoners of the pandemic. 
First, many of the immunocompromised compilation respond sub-optimally or not at all to vaccination, even after booster shots. Second, breakthrough infections in the general population still occur after vaccination, meaning that immunocompromised people will continue to be at risk and countering infected individuals even within a highly vaccinated population. Therefore, we believe that REGEN-COV could be of particular importance for these immunocompromised individuals who remain unprotected and also are at highest risk for developing the most severe COVID-19 disease. This includes people with certain hematologic cancers, for example, lymphomas, leukemias and myeloma and people who take certain immunosuppressive medicines for diseases such as multiple sclerosis, in rheumatoid arthritis, advanced recipients and for those with primary immunodeficiencies.
In the United [indiscernible] Generon submitted data and a request to the FDA to ban the existing emergency use authorization of REGEN-COV to include chronic prevention back in April. Further reflecting Regeneron's commitment to the immunocompromised, we recently began a big trial to optimize Regeneron this population, including evaluation of extended dose.
Our current REGEN-COV cocktail retains potent activity against all known variants of interest, including the Delta variant. However, the virus continues to mutate and evolve. And thus, as we have previously discussed, we are advancing a novel anti-spike protein antibody cocktail into clinical development. We have done so proactively in the case of a novel innovative antibody cocktail that retains potency against new potential variants in the future.
Moving to ophthalmology. We reported encouraging top line data of high-dose aflibercept in the Phase II candela study in wet AMD. The small proof-of-concept study met its primary efficacy endpoint, a higher proportion of patients in the 8-milligram aflibercept group had no retinal fluid compared to patients treated with the currently approved 2-milligram EYLEA dose at week 16.
There were no safety signals observed in the comparison to the currently approved EYLEA 2-milligram dose, 2 large Phase III trials in wet AMD and DME, evaluating the high dose aflibercept in dosing intervals of every 12 weeks and every 16 weeks are fully enrolled and are expected to report results in the second half of 2022. These Phase III data will be crucial to understanding overall efficacy, safety and convenience, high dose aflibercept.
Moving on to Dupixent. The remarkable clinical success of Dupixent across so many different allergic or type 2 inflammatory diseases, validates our early and long-standing hypothesis that these conditions are all driven by overactivation of the same fundamental immunologic pathway that is the IBOR 13 pathway, which is effectively blocked by DUPIXENT. Whether the disease manifests as asthma or chronic rhinositis with nasal polyps in the airways as atopic dermatitis or prurigo nodularis in the skin, eosinophilic esophagitis in the GI tract, our clinical have demonstrated an important impact of Dupixent on these many conditions that initially did not seem related. In only the past few months, Dupixent demonstrated positive results in 4 separate pivotal studies. This is a tremendous stemming from the vision and dedication of our team and it's great news for patients suffering from these type 2 inflammatory diseases.
In a recent Phase III trial in atopic dermatitis in infants and children as young as 6 months of age, Dupixent met all primary and secondary endpoints as well as a lower observed rate of skin infections in the Dupixent group compared to placebo.
Detailed results from this trial will be presented at a future medical meeting, and data will be submitted to the FDA by the end of this year. These data reinforce the well-established efficacy and safety profile of Dupixent with over 0.5 million patients treated to date. We also reported Phase III data with Dupixent in eosinophilic esophagitis, or EoE, a progressive disease that damages of the esophagus and impairs the ability to swell. More than 1/3 of the patients in our trial had manifestations of this disease so severe that they previously had to undergo endoscopic dilation of the esophagus for symptomatic relief. In our study, patients taking weekly Dupixent had an approximate 24-point improvement on the 0.84 dysphagia symptom questionnaire, representing a 64% improvement compared to a 14-point improvement for placebo.
This update reinforced previously reported Phase III results for which the 52-week follow-up results were recently presented at the United European Gastroenterology Week Virtual 2021 Congress. Completion of our regulatory filing for EoE and adolescents and adults is planned for early 2022. We also recently reported positive results for Dupixent from our Phase III trial in yet another inflammatory skin condition known as prurigo nodularis, an underdiagnosed disease characterized by extreme itch and skin nodules. The trial met its primary and all key secondary endpoints in comparison to placebo, including reduction in itch from baseline at 12 and 24 weeks, achieving clear screens in quality of life. A second trial in foregonigelaris is fully enrolled and is expected to read out in the first half of '22 with regulatory [indiscernible] for the same year.
If all these exciting Phase III data lead to regulatory approvals, Dupixent would be approved for 6 different allergic or type 2 inflammatory disease indications, including patients as young as 6 months.
Moving to Libtayo in oncology. Positive Phase III data of Libtayo in combination with chemotherapy in first-line advanced non-small cell lung cancer were presented at the ESMO 21 meeting. These data mark as 1 of only 2 PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors to demonstrate positive Phase III results in non-small cell lung cancer, irrespective of histology, both as monotherapy and in combination [indiscernible] These Libtayo studies were conducted in a patient population that included difficult-to-treat disease characteristics that reflects everyday clinical practice. We are rapidly progressing towards regulatory submission for the tyochemotherapy combination across histologies and PD-L1 expression levels, which could unlock an opportunity to help a larger population of lung cancer patients.
Turning to hematology. At the upcoming American Society of Hematology Inc. for ASH, we will provide to our developing hematology portfolio. The oral presentation will provide a data update for our potential stational first-in-human trial of ReGen 5458, our BCMA by CD3 bispecific antibody testing patients with heavily pretreated multiple myeloma. [indiscernible] 5458 to be a major advance in treatment of patients who have failed several prior lines of therapy, but the potential for BCMA-targeted bispecific is not limited to this patient population. We will discuss our data and further development plans at our virtual ASH Investor event scheduled for Monday, December 13, starting argenextamab, or CPI bispecific. We are pleased with our -- with recruitment in our potentially pivotal trial since the partial clinical hole was lifted earlier this year. Exploration of subcutaneous formulation of odronextamab is on track to start by the end of this year. We are planning to initiate broader Phase III programs in 2022.
Our bispecific development program for solid tumors is progressing with our unique approaches, including the MUC16 by CD3 bispecific as monotherapy in ovarian cancer as well as in combination with Libtayo or with our MUC16 by CD28 costed. In addition, we expect to have initial data with our PSMA by CD20 [indiscernible] in patients with prostate cancer in '22.
We are also excited about our EGFR by CD20 multiple EGF high cancer settings, including lung cancer as well as our clinical stage met by net bispecific and our met by met antibody drug conjugate, presenting a new in the realm of drug conjugate linked to our potentially best bispecific antibodies.
In conclusion for oncology, we are approaching an important new phase for Regeneron. We have several novel Phase I/II program development with more expected in the coming months. The large Phase III studies plan such as our LAG-3 liquidation for first-line advanced melanoma against the pembrolizumab monotherapy comparator as well as large registrational programs for our hematology oncology bispecifics. We're excited about the potential that these important investments in our portfolio may bring to patients.
I would like to conclude with our Regeneron Genetics medicines in our collaboration updates. We are uniquely positioned to combine products of our established biologics portfolio in emerging findings medicine efforts. As part of our collaboration with Alnylam, we are looking forward to multiple updates on our C5 program. We already mentioned ASH meeting, we will show first in human data for our C5 antibody, pozelimab, in combination with the C5 inhibiting siRNA, sendisiran. We will present initial results in healthy volunteers, which supports development of this first-of-its-kind combination of an antibody siRNA therapeutic.
Early data on siRNA therapy mediated CFE did not achieve complete terminal complement blockade, which is necessary for adequate disease control or paroxysm and external hematuria. Adding the antibody specific for the same target protein could provide patients with a lower dose therapy and a more convenient extended dosing regimen while providing more complete C5 inhibition, resulting in better efficacy and less breakthrough hemolysis.
We have also recently initiated a Phase III study testing the C5 antibody and siRNA combination in myasthenia gravis. For PNH, starting next year, we are planning to test our combo in both naive and switch patients tested against standard of care therapies, including ravulizumab and eculizumab. This study has the potential to show a true benefit of the combination approach for the treatment of this disease.
Also in collaboration with Alnylam, some of our initial genetic target discoveries are reaching the stage of clinical readouts for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, a disease where finding compelling treatment options has been difficult. We're using the siRNA approach to silence the gene we identified as a potential target. Recall, we discovered that people with a protective HSD17B13 gene variant have a 30% to 70% lower odds of chronic liver disease. Our [indiscernible] show initial healthy volunteer safety data for the Alnylam HSD, the HSD17B13 targeting sRNA their upcoming R&D Day later this month.
Finally, in October, the Regeneron Genetics Center published a manuscript in nature, which highlighted achievement of the milestone of sequencing almost 0.5 million exomes from the U.K. Biobank database. This nature paper for the first time describes rare variants of genes that could be potential drug targets for diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, asthma and others.
And with that, I will turn the call over to Marion."

Our third quarter business performance demonstrates the strength of our commercial portfolio. We are executing well on our in-line brands and are maximizing opportunity to diversified and sustainable growth through ongoing launches.Fi",798,"Thank you, George. Our third quarter business performance demonstrates the strength of our commercial portfolio. We are executing well on our in-line brands and are maximizing opportunity to diversified and sustainable growth through ongoing launches.
First, I will highlight recent achievements with REGEN-COV, our COVID antibody cocktail, which on the U.S. under emergency use authorization by the FDA. In the third quarter, U.S. net sales were $677 million, primarily based on the initial deliveries of our third government agreement, which was announced in mid-September. Demand for REGEN-COV accelerated sharply over the third quarter as this promising treatment option continues to help fight the surge in COVID-19 cases. REGEN-COV is increasingly seen as standard of care for outpatient treatment and post-exposure prophylaxis in appropriate patients. Our field educators continue to support key stakeholders in health care systems and administration sites.
While COVID cases have thankfully decreased over the last several weeks, demand for REGEN-COV remains high with many patients receiving treatment. REGEN-COV has broad therapeutic application in current and potential future integrations across the spectrum of disease from pre-exposure prevention to hospitalization. We look forward to the FDA's decision on our application for a full approval expected in April of '22.
Beyond REGEN-COV, we delivered strong growth from our core business in the third quarter. Starting with EYLEA, third quarter global net sales grew 15% a year to more than $2.4 billion. In the U.S., net sales grew 12% year-over-year to nearly $1.5 billion based on category recovery and EYLEA's competitor share gains. EYLEA secured nearly 50% of the overall category and over 75% of medical grade based on our overall platform of efficacy and convenience.
There are positive early indicators from our unbranded direct-to-consumer campaign that educates patients with diabetic eye disease on the importance of Vision Care. Retina specialists have applauded our efforts encouraging diabetic patients to seek treatment to prevent irreversible vision loss.
EYLEA's competitive profile, coupled with favorable underlying demographic trends give us confidence in Regeneron's ongoing leadership position in retinal diseases. 
Turning to Libtayo. Global net sales were $120 million. In the U.S., net sales reached $78 million despite continued COVID impacts on new patient starts. With new indication launches at early stages, the vast majority of sales came from advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, or CSCC, where Libtayo is the #1 systemic treatment. Building on our success in CSCC, we are quickly establishing Libtayo standard of care in advanced basal cell carcinoma for patients in the second-line setting or were a [indiscernible] is not appropriate. In lung cancer, we are working to secure a physician experience with Libtayo as a competitive monotherapy treatment option. We look forward to the potential chemotherapy combination approval, which would unlock the much larger group of first-line patients eligible for anti-PD-1.
Briefly turning to [indiscernible] which is now being used to treat more patients than the prior standard of care we continue to see initiations in both switch and new-to-category patients, illustrating how our innovative patient identification efforts can be used to support those with HoFH and in the future, other rare diseases.
And finally, to Dupixent, in the third quarter, global net sales grew 55% year-over-year to $1.7 billion and U.S. net sales grew 48% to $1.3 billion. This growth was driven across all approved indications, with new patient starts above pre-COVID levels. In atopic dermatitis, prescribing trends are strong and quadrum of moderate to severe disease, including adolescent and pediatric patients. Dupixent continues to capture market growth based on well-established efficacy and safety, breadth of current indications and unmatched physician and patient experience. There continues to be substantial potential growth in atopic dermatitis, including in children as young as 6 months in age and more broadly in dermatology with new potential chronic spontaneous [indiscernible] and prior nodularis.
In respiratory disease, Dupixent continues to surpass recent competitive biologic launches [indiscernible] we see ongoing potential to differentiate Dupixent through its competitive profile and label expansion as the market recovers from COVID, when asthma-related emergency room visits were down nearly 50%. Our launch in pediatric asthma is underway, extending this treatment option to 75,000 children in the U.S. who suffer from this often debilitating disease.
Dupixent's label was also recently updated to include an additional marker of type 2 inflammation called Pheno, which extends the eligible population beyond those with high eosinophilic levels. In addition, Dupixent can be prescribed for steroid-dependent asthma regardless of eosinophil levels.
In nasal pulps, we continue to see growth with Dupixent leading the market despite new competition. Dupixent continues to be the preferred choice of ENTs and allergists regardless of prior surgery.
In summary, our commercial team continues to deliver strong growth across the portfolio with differentiated brands, ongoing and potential future launches, we remain on track for long-term growth. Now, over to Bob."

My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis where applicable. In the third quarter, Regeneron once again delivered strong top and bottom line growth on increasingly diversified revenue streams with contributions from REGEN-COV in our robust core business.
For the third quarter, total revenues grew 51% year-over-year to $3.5 billion. Total net income per share grew 84% year-over-year to $15.37 on net income of $1.8 billion. Excluding revenues related to the COVID-19 antibody cocktail, total revenues grew 18% versus the prior year.
Starting with REGEN-COV. In the third quarter, we recognized $177 million of U.S. net sales, which consist largely of the initial deliveries of approximately 1,000 doses to the U.S. government under the new 1.4 million dose contract as announced in September. Our collaborator, Roche, record sales of the COVID-19 antibody cocktail known as Ronaprive, outside the U.S. In accordance with our Roche agreement, as a true for global profits, we recorded an additional $127 million as Roche collaboration revenue.
In the fourth quarter, we expect to deliver approximately 800,000 doses of REGEN-COV in the U.S. Out of which, Roche will supply approximately half of these doses. We will record all REGEN-COV U.S. net product sales and the mix of market by Roche and Regeneron, the true-up payment for global profits is expected to result in 0 Roche collaboration revenues in the fourth quarter. The remaining doses from the U.S. government contract are expected to be delivered in the first quarter of 2022.
I will now move to our Bayer collaboration. Ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales reported to us by Bayer worth $931 million for the third quarter of 2021, representing growth of 19% on a reported basis and 18% on a constant currency basis. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $365 million, of which we recorded $351 million for our share of [indiscernible] EYLEA sales outside the U.S.
Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $582 million in the third quarter of 2021. Our share of the profits from the commercialization of Dupixent and KEVZARA was $387 million, which compares favorably to our share of profits of $213 million in the prior year. We also recognized a $50 million sales milestone payment related to achievement of $1.5 billion of ex-U.S. sales for the collaboration on a rolling 12-month basis.
Moving on to operating expenses. R&D decreased slightly to $592 million, primarily due to lower spending of REGEN-COV development as compared to the third quarter of 2020.
Next, SG&A expense increased 34% year-over-year to $391 million, primarily due to costs related to growth initiatives for EYLEA and higher headcount. Goods sold increase versus the prior year from $122 million to $200 million, primarily due to REGEN-COV manufacturing costs. Cost of collaboration manufacturing increased 50% year-over-year to $214 million, driven by higher production to support the growing Dupixent sales. Finally, the effective tax rate was 10.8% in the third quarter of 2021.
Shifting to cash flow on the balance sheet date, Regeneron has generated $4.3 billion in free cash flow and ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities less debt of $8.7 billion. We continue to utilize our strong balance sheet in accordance with our capital allocation priorities of investing in internal R&D, funding strategic external R&D partnerships and returning cash to shareholders. Accordingly, in the third quarter, we repurchased approximately $191 million of our shares.
To conclude, I'd like to provide select updates to our 2021 guidance. A complete summary of our latest full year guidance is available in our press release published earlier this morning.
With our -- we are updating our 2021 gross margin guidance to be approximately 88%. This estimate is inclusive of an expected payment to Roche as a true-up of global profits for the COVID-19 antibody cocktail, which will be reported as good sold. As a result, we expect our gross margin percentage in the fourth quarter to be the lowest of the year.
We are also updating our 2021 R&D guidance to be in the range of $2.55 billion to $2.6 billion. The change to the guidance range is related to updating updated phasing of expenses and lower spend on REGEN-COV. Looking ahead, we will continue to make investments into both our commercial business and our broad pipeline for long-term growth. In particular, we expect to advance critically important development programs in 2022, including the late-stage studies for the LAG-3 Libtayo combo, BCMA by CD3 and along with branded comparators, as George mentioned earlier, in advancing programs with our collaborators.
In conclusion, we're pleased with the third quarter as we invest in our robust pipeline to drive sustained long-term growth. I will now turn the call back to Justin."

So it's to be prepared for that possibility that as the virus continues to evolve, we might need a cocktail that might not be sensitive to the same mutations as the first cocktail. But the current cocktail is still active against the variants of concern.
Yes. There's a lot of questions in terms of how to design the study, where to do it, depending on rates of hospitalization and rates of infection. So these are the complications that we've had to navigate throughout this pandemic, as you might remember. And throughout this pandemic, we have managed to carry out the largest COVID-19 program for treatment and for prevention using antibodies.

Nor have they satisfied to many people's satisfaction, the safety concerns around using ImmunoGen that perhaps okay for short term.
But when you're getting into longer-term prophylaxis of the immunocompromised, which is where George mentioned, we have a lot of work ongoing. It's really important to remember that we expect to have -- our molecules should be able to be given quite less frequently, I think one might expect because you're looking at a places mode.

What we've managed to do is starting with our Regeneron Genetics Center is create what we believe is perhaps the world's most powerful technology to identify new genetic targets based on our sequencing of almost 2 million individuals, all linked to electronic digital records. That allows us to understand, we think, more powerfully than anybody else, the role of genetic variation, both in disease protection and causation, which have led to a whole series of new disease targets for both protection and causation. And for those, some of those are addressable by biologics and they're part of our existing approaches with biologics, but we had to use new approaches. And for those purposes, we started creating some of these important outside alliances and collaborations with companies like Alnylam for the siRNA approaches, we talked a little bit about and with Intellia with CRISPR-based approaches.
Many of these, we've been able to build and create and take them to another level based on our very productive collaborations with these 2 great companies that we're now collaborating with. And we also invested enormously internally in terms of building our own RP approaches. So we believe that we have positioned ourselves to become leaders for the foreseeable future over the next decade or so in the genetic medicine space, it's becoming an increasingly important and larger part of our portfolio. It's almost a whole separate company, we believe, in terms of the opportunities and the value that it generates. While we're maintaining our leadership position with biologics, not only with classical antibodies but also with bispecifics and all sorts of engineered formats of biologics. So I think it's been a tremendous job by our entire team and organization to essentially create this entirely new capability."

Our first CRISPR results which were the first obtained by anybody in history in terms of using a systemic CRISPR-based therapy to actually modify genes in human beings. It was an incredibly successful study that we did in collaboration with Intellia. It was the first-ever systemic investigational CRISPR-based gene knockout approach. And in the first set of patients that we treated, we show that a CRISPR-based therapy led to very dramatic and dose-dependent reductions in the target protein coming from the target gene. I think that the world viewed this as incredibly exciting data.
I believe we announced it in June of '21. And I think it's just the beginning of a very large program. We have about 20 preclinical programs now under evaluation that will be rolling out in terms of going into the clinic and producing clinical results over the next couple of years."

So [indiscernible] with how that launch is going early days.
Most important, however, is our lung launch. The initial launch we have in monotherapy is understandably for a smaller target group of patients. We do believe, however, though, the experience that physicians are gaining with Libtayo in first-line monotherapy treatment is very, very important and bodes well for when we hopefully have the larger indication approved for chemo combo. And that is mirror is a much larger population of patients, perhaps 4- to 5-fold more patients, and we certainly look forward to potentially being able to launch that larger indication in lung."

So now our wet AMD treatment is under 60% of the total utilization of EYLEA in the U.S. marketplace.
The specific growth on diabetic eye disease by  indication, it's difficult to give you the exact breakdown, but we are very optimistic on even the early efforts we see in market based on our new unbranded direct-to-consumer TV campaign, which is really educating diabetic patients broadly on the importance of having their vision checked, making sure it's part of the regular check-in as patients with diabetes have other areas that they standardly review and make sure of their care. Eye disease has often been neglected with very disastrous situations of vision loss that can't be corrected. So we see that as a really important area and one that will fuel diabetic eye disease treatment broadly.

And that -- those are all moving along forward and we think a very exciting fashion as we've discussed.
Another key area that you just opened up, which is still preclinically, but we're hoping to eventually move into the clinic is targeting the eye targets with siRNAs. And that's really a very important area for us, and it was a very important separate part of the entire Alnylam collaboration.
And the third really critical foundational part of our collaboration with Alnylam involved using SRIs to target targets in the brain. And that's also moving forward in a very exciting fashion, and we'll be talking a lot more about that going forward.

So we're very excited, but we're not letting him go until his replacement is fully in place. So you may hear more from Justin in this role what you may not. He -- Justin has done a remarkable job. He is quick to point out to me that when he joined the company, the stock was only around $300. And now he says it's significantly higher. Justin, we thank you for your great service. 
Turning to our business, we turned in another strong performance in the third quarter, which was marked by significant double-digit top and bottom line growth and continued operating leverage. This was more possible as a result of the truly exceptional execution by our colleagues across the entire company from R&D to production, commercial and support teams despite the challenges that we all faced imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Our core business of EYLEA, Dupixent and Libtayo, all contributed solid underlying growth. Additionally, we secured a third supply agreement with the United States government for REGEN-COV, our investigational antibody cocktail for treating and preventing COVID-19 in certain populations with initial deliveries fueling additional growth momentum in the quarter. 
In R&D, our broad and growing pipeline, which now includes more than 30 clinical stage candidates with many more expected to enter the clinic in short order continues to advance new innovations to secure our long-term growth potential. Importantly, our pipeline continues to be largely composed and comprised of internal innovation. But increasingly, it is supplemented by external relationships that bring in novel modalities, including CRISPR and siRNA, creating unique treatment options and combination approaches as George will outline momentarily. 
In the third quarter, beginning with EYLEA, global net sales of EYLEA were $2.4 billion, growing 15% compared to the prior year. U.S. EYLEA sales grew 12%, reflecting recovery of the anti-VEGF category and share gains as the leading anti-VEGF treatment for retinal diseases. We see the strength of EYLEA an opportunity for steady growth continuing despite potential upcoming competition from which we currently do not see any disruptive or game-changing new engines to the anti-VEGF space for treating retinal diseases. 
Dupixent continues to be remarkable in delivering commercially and clinically across a wide spectrum of type 2 inflammatory diseases. In the third quarter, global net sales grew 55% to $1.7 billion. Growth contributions from inside and outside of the United States continued to improve operating leverage in our alliance with Sanofi. 
Moreover, we announced positive results from 4 Phase III registrational studies in recent months, 1 in very young children with atopic dermatitis, and 3 in the potential new indications of eosinophilic esophagitis, prurigo nodularis and chronic spontaneous urticaria. 
In October, the FDA expanded our asthma label to include children aged 6 to 11, a testament to not only the efficacy, but also the safety of Dupixent in the chronic treatment of type 2 inflammatory diseases. With several other disease opportunities in clinical development, such as COPD, the expansion possibilities are significant for this remarkable medicine that is already changing the lives of hundreds of thousands of patients. 
In Oncology, Libtayo global net sales were $120 million and grew 24%. Despite the challenges imposed on the Oncology market by COVID-19, we're working hard as the leader in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and progressing in our basal cell carcinoma and lung cancer launches. We are also preparing for a potential launch in 2022 in the much larger opportunity of Libtayo combined with chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer. 
REGEN-COV continues to grow in importance with increased utilization in the treatment of COVID-19. The FDA has accepted under priority review our biologic license application for the treatment and prophylaxis of COVID-19 in certain patients. We are also on review to expand the emergency use authorization for REGEN-COV in certain hospitalized patients and for pre-exposure prophylaxis. 
Outside of the United States, our antibody cocktail has received a full approval in Japan, is conditionally approved in Australia and the U.K., and has emergency or temporary pandemic authorizations currently in place in more than 40 other countries. 
REGEN-COV has the potential for a broad range of prevention and treatment applications from preexposure prophylaxis to treatment of infected hospitalized patients. Given the anticipation of new COVID infections over time, increased utilization of REGEN-COV in appropriate cases and the need for prophylaxis in immunocompromised individuals, we anticipate an ongoing role for REGEN-COV. If global demand warrants, we have the capacity to produce between 4 million to 5 million 1.2 gram doses in 2022, excluding any further supply contributions from Roche. 
To conclude, as we close out 2021, our growth momentum is strong and our outlook for continued growth fueled by the breadth and depth of our pipeline is bright. Now I will turn the call over to George."

As Len mentioned, our robust COVID-19 development program involving more than 25,000 people to date has provided compelling evidence that REGEN-COV has the potential to be used for v",1884,"Thank you, Len. I'll pick up where you left me with the REGEN-COV story. As Len mentioned, our robust COVID-19 development program involving more than 25,000 people to date has provided compelling evidence that REGEN-COV has the potential to be used for various prevention and treatment applications from pre-exposure prophylaxis to treating hospitalized patients. In the United States, REGEN-COV is currently authorized under an EUA and also being reviewed for full FDA approval for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 in certain patients with an action date of April 13, 2022. At Regeneron, we all appreciate that widespread vaccination is the best way to broadly protect as many people as possible from COVID-19. But recent research also reveals some important gaps in coverage provided by the vaccines, leaving some individuals uniquely vulnerable, particularly the several million immunocompromised people in the United States alone who remain prisoners of the pandemic.  
First, many of the immunocompromised population respond sub-optimally or not at all to vaccination, even after booster shots. Second, breakthrough infections in the general population still occur after vaccination, meaning that immunocompromised people will continue to be at risk of encountering infected individuals even within a highly vaccinated population. Therefore, we believe that REGEN-COV could be of particular importance for these immunocompromised individuals who remain unprotected and also are at highest risk for developing the most severe COVID-19 disease. This includes people with certain hematologic cancers, for example, lymphomas, leukemias and myeloma and people who take certain immunosuppressive medicines for diseases such as multiple sclerosis, in rheumatoid arthritis, for organ transplant recipients and for those with primary immunodeficiencies. 
In the United States, Regeneron submitted data and a request to the FDA to expand the existing emergency use authorization of REGEN-COV to include chronic prevention back in April. Further reflecting Regeneron's commitment to the immunocompromised, we recently began a big trial to optimize REGEN-COV prophylaxis in this population, including evaluation of extended dose. 
Our current REGEN-COV cocktail retains potent activity against all known variants of interest, including the Delta variant. However, the virus continues to mutate and evolve. And thus, as we have previously discussed, we are advancing a novel anti-spike protein antibody cocktail into clinical development. We have done so proactively in the case of a novel innovative antibody cocktail that retains potency against new potential variants as required in the future. 
Moving to Ophthalmology. We reported encouraging top line data of high-dose aflibercept in the Phase II CANDELA study in wet AMD. The small proof-of-concept study met its primary efficacy endpoint, a higher proportion of patients in the 8-milligram aflibercept group had no retinal fluid compared to patients treated with the currently approved 2-milligram EYLEA dose at week 16. 
There were no safety signals observed in the comparison to the currently approved EYLEA 2-milligram dose, 2 large Phase III trials in wet AMD and DME, evaluating the high dose of aflibercept in dosing intervals of every 12 weeks and every 16 weeks are fully enrolled and are expected to report results in the second half of 2022. These Phase III data will be crucial to understanding overall efficacy, safety and convenience of high dose aflibercept. 
Moving on to Dupixent. The remarkable clinical success of Dupixent across so many different allergic or type 2 inflammatory diseases, validates our early and long-standing hypothesis that these conditions are all driven by overactivation of the same fundamental immunologic pathway that is the interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 pathway, which is effectively blocked by Dupixent whether the disease manifests as asthma or chronic [ rhinositis ] with nasal polyps in the airways as atopic dermatitis or prurigo nodularis in the skin, as the eosinophilic esophagitis in the GI tract. Our clinical data have demonstrated an important impact of Dupixent on these many conditions that initially did not seem related. In only the past few months, Dupixent demonstrated positive results in 4 separate pivotal studies. This is a tremendous accomplishment stemming from the vision and dedication of our team and it's great news for patients suffering from these type 2 inflammatory diseases. 
In a recent Phase III trial in atopic dermatitis in infants and children as young as 6 months of age, Dupixent met all primary and secondary endpoints as well as a lower observed rate of skin infections in the Dupixent group compared to placebo. 
Detailed results from this trial will be presented at a future medical meeting, and data will be submitted to the FDA by the end of this year. These data reinforce the well-established efficacy and safety profile of Dupixent with over 0.5 million patients treated to date. We also reported recent Phase III data with Dupixent in eosinophilic esophagitis or EoE, a progressive disease that damages the esophagus and impairs the ability to swallow. More than 1/3 of the patients in our trial had manifestations of this disease so severe that they previously had to undergo endoscopic dilation of the esophagus for symptomatic relief. In our study, patients taking weekly Dupixent had an approximate 24-point improvement on the 0 to 84 dysphagia symptom questionnaire, representing a 64% improvement compared to a 14-point improvement for placebo. 
This update reinforced previously reported Phase III results for which the 52-week follow-up results were recently presented at the United European Gastroenterology Week Virtual 2021 Congress. Completion of our regulatory filing for EoE in adolescents and adults is planned for early 2022. We also recently reported positive results for Dupixent from our Phase III trial in yet another inflammatory skin condition known as prurigo nodularis, an underdiagnosed disease characterized by extreme itch and skin nodules. The trial met its primary and all key secondary endpoints in comparison to placebo, including reduction in itch from baseline at 12 and 24 weeks, achieving clear skin and improvement in quality of life. A second trial in prurigo nodularis is fully enrolled and is expected to read out in the first half of '22 with regulatory submissions planned for the same year. 
If all these exciting Phase III data lead to regulatory approvals, Dupixent would be approved for 6 different allergic or type 2 inflammatory disease indications, including patients as young as 6 months. 
Moving to Libtayo in Oncology. Positive Phase III data of Libtayo in combination with chemotherapy in first-line advanced non-small cell lung cancer were presented at the ESMO 2021 meeting. These data mark Libtayo as 1 of only 2 PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors to demonstrate positive Phase III results in first line non-small cell lung cancer, irrespective of histology, both as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy. These Libtayo studies were conducted in a patient population that included difficult-to-treat disease characteristics that reflects everyday clinical practice. We are rapidly progressing towards regulatory submission for the Libtayo chemotherapy combination across histologies and PD-L1 expression levels, which could unlock an opportunity to help a larger population of lung cancer patients. 
Turning to Hematology. At the upcoming American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting for ASH, we will provide updates to our developing Hematology portfolio. The nodal presentation we will provide a data update for our potentially registrational first-in-human trial of REGN5458. Our BCMA by CD3 bispecific antibody tested in patients with heavily pretreated multiple myeloma. REGN5458 to be a major advance in treatment of patients who have failed several prior lines of therapy, but the potential utility of our BCMA-targeted bispecific is not limited to this patient population. We will discuss our data and further development plans at our virtual ASH Investor event scheduled for Monday, December 13 regarding odronextamab or CD20 by CD3 bispecific. We are pleased with our -- with recruitment in our potentially pivotal trial since the partial clinical hall was lifted earlier this year. Exploration of subcutaneous formulation of odronextamab is on track to start by the end of this year. We are planning to initiate broader Phase III programs in 2022. 
Our bispecific development program for solid tumors is progressing with our unique approaches, including the MUC16xCD3 bispecific as monotherapy in ovarian cancer as well as in combination with Libtayo or with our MUC16xCD28 costim. In addition, we expect to have initial data with our PSMAxCD28 costim in patients with prostate cancer in '22. 
We are also excited about our EGFRxCD28 costim clinical program across multiple EGF high cancer settings, including lung cancer as well as our clinical stage METxMET bispecific and our METxMET antibody drug conjugate, presenting a new [indiscernible] for Regeneron into the realm of drug conjugates linked to our potentially best in class bispecific antibodies. 
In conclusion for Oncology, we are approaching an important new phase for Regeneron. We have several novel Phase I/II programs in clinical development with more expected in the coming months. We also have large Phase III studies planned such as our LAG-3 Libtayo for first-line advanced melanoma against the pembrolizumab monotherapy comparator as well as large registrational programs for our Hematology/Oncology bispecifics. We're excited about the potential that these important investments in our portfolio may bring to patients. 
I would like to conclude with our Regeneron genetics medicines in our collaboration updates. We are uniquely positioned to combine products of our established biologics portfolio and emerging findings from our genetics medicine efforts. As part of our collaboration with Alnylam, we are looking forward to multiple updates on our C5 program. As we already mentioned ASH meeting, we will show first-in-human data for our C5 antibody, pozelimab in combination with the C5 inhibiting siRNA, cemdisiran. We will present initial results in healthy volunteers, which supports development of this first-of-its-kind combination of an antibody and an siRNA therapeutic. Early data on siRNA monotherapy mediated C5 [indiscernible] did not achieve complete terminal complement blockade, which is necessary for adequate disease control in PNH or paroxysmal nocturnal hematuria. Adding the antibody specific for the same target protein could provide patients with a lower dose therapy and a more convenient extended dosing regimen while providing more complete C5 inhibition, resulting in better efficacy and less breakthrough hemolysis. 
We have also recently initiated a Phase III study testing the C5 antibody and siRNA combination in myasthenia gravis. For PNH, starting next year, we are planning to test our combo in both naive and switch patients tested against standard of care therapies, including ravulizumab and eculizumab. This study has the potential to show a true benefit of the combination approach for the treatment of this disease. 
Also in collaboration with Alnylam, some of our initial genetic target discoveries are reaching the stage of clinical readouts for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis or NASH, a disease where finding compelling treatment options has been difficult. We're using the siRNA approach to silence the gene we identified as a potential target. Recall, we discovered that people with a protective HSD17B13 gene variant have a 30% to 70% lower odds of chronic liver disease. Our collaborator, Alnylam, will show initial healthy volunteer safety data for the Alnylam HSD, the HSD17B13 targeting siRNA at their upcoming R&D Day later this month. 
Finally, in October, the Regeneron Genetics Center published a manuscript in nature, which highlighted achievement of the milestone of sequencing almost 0.5 million exomes from the U.K. Biobank database. This nature paper for the first time describes rare variants of genes that could be potential drug targets for diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, asthma and others. 
And with that, I will turn the call over to Marion."

Our third quarter business performance demonstrates the strength of our commercial portfolio. We are executing well on our in-line brands and are maximizing opportunities for diversified and sustainable growth through ongoing launches.",809,"Thank you, George. Our third quarter business performance demonstrates the strength of our commercial portfolio. We are executing well on our in-line brands and are maximizing opportunities for diversified and sustainable growth through ongoing launches. 
First, I will highlight recent achievements with REGEN-COV, our COVID-19 antibody cocktail, which is available in the U.S. under emergency use authorization by the FDA. In the third quarter, U.S. net sales were $677 million, primarily based on the initial deliveries of our third government agreement, which was announced in mid-September. Demand for REGEN-COV accelerated sharply over the third quarter as this promising treatment option continues to help fight the surge in COVID-19 cases. REGEN-COV is increasingly seen as standard of care for outpatient treatment and post-exposure prophylaxis in appropriate patients. Our field educators continue to support key stakeholders in health care systems at administration sites. 
While COVID-19 cases have thankfully decreased over the last several weeks, demand for REGEN-COV remains high with many patients receiving treatment. REGEN-COV has broad therapeutic application in current and potential future integrations across the spectrum of disease from pre-exposure prevention to hospitalization. We look forward to the FDA's decision on our application for a full approval expected in April of 2022. 
Beyond REGEN-COV, we delivered strong growth from our core business in the third quarter. Starting with EYLEA, third quarter global net sales grew 15% year-over-year to more than $2.4 billion. In the U.S., net sales grew 12% year-over-year to nearly $1.5 billion based on category recovery and EYLEA's competitor share gains. EYLEA secured nearly 50% of the overall category and over 75% of the branded category based on our overall platform of efficacy, safety and convenience. 
There are positive early indicators from our unbranded direct-to-consumer campaign that educates patients with diabetic eye disease on the importance of vision care. Retina specialists have applauded our efforts encouraging diabetic patients to seek treatment to prevent irreversible vision loss. 
EYLEA's competitive profile, coupled with favorable underlying demographic trends give us confidence in Regeneron's ongoing leadership position in retinal diseases.  
Turning to Libtayo. Global net sales were $120 million. In the U.S., net sales reached $78 million despite continued COVID impacts on new patient starts. With new indication launches at early stages, the vast majority of sales came from advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma or CSCC, where Libtayo is the #1 systemic treatment. Building on our success in CSCC, we are quickly establishing Libtayo as standard of care in advanced basal cell carcinoma for patients in the second-line setting or where a Hedgehog inhibitor is not appropriate. In lung cancer, we are working to secure a physician experience with Libtayo as a competitive monotherapy treatment option. We look forward to the potential chemotherapy combination approval, which would unlock the much larger group of first-line patients eligible for anti-PD-1. 
Briefly turning to Evkeeza, which is now being used to treat more patients than the prior standard of care, we continue to see initiations in both switch and new-to-category patients, illustrating how our innovative patient identification efforts can be used to support those with HoFH and in the future, other rare diseases. 
And finally, to Dupixent, in the third quarter, global net sales grew 55% year-over-year to $1.7 billion and U.S. net sales grew 48% to $1.3 billion. This growth was driven across all approved indications, with new patient starts above pre-COVID levels. In atopic dermatitis, prescribing trends are strong across the spectrum of moderate-to-severe disease, including adolescent and pediatric patients. Dupixent continues to capture market growth based on well-established efficacy and safety, breadth of current indications and unmatched physician and patient experience. There continues to be substantial potential growth in atopic dermatitis, including in children as young as 6 months in age and more broadly in Dermatology with new potential indications of chronic spontaneous urticaria and prurigo nodularis. 
In respiratory disease, Dupixent continues to surpass recent competitive biologic launches. In asthma, we see ongoing potential to differentiate Dupixent through its competitive profile and label expansion as the market recovers from COVID, when asthma-related emergency room visits were down nearly 50%. Our launch in pediatric asthma is underway, extending this treatment option to 75,000 children in the U.S. who suffer from this often debilitating disease. 
Dupixent's label was also recently updated to include an additional marker of type 2 inflammation called pheno, which extends the eligible population beyond those with high eosinophilic levels. In addition, Dupixent can be prescribed for steroid-dependent asthma regardless of eosinophilic levels. 
In nasal polyps, we continue to see growth with Dupixent leading the market despite new competition. Dupixent continues to be the preferred choice of ENTs and allergists regardless of prior surgery. 
In summary, our commercial team continues to deliver strong growth across the portfolio with differentiated brands, ongoing and potential future launches, we remain on track for long-term growth. Now, I'll turn the call over to Bob."
33715,1684902541,2425244,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2021",2021-11-04,"Earnings Calls","Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Marion.

My comments today on Regeneron's financial results and outlook will be on a non-GAAP basis where applicable. In the third quarter, Regeneron once again delivered strong top and bottom line growth on increasingly diversified revenue streams with contributions from REGEN-COV in our robust core business.
For the third quarter, total revenues grew 51% year-over-year to $3.5 billion. Total diluted net income per share grew 84% year-over-year to $15.37 on net income of $1.8 billion. Excluding revenues related to the COVID-19 antibody cocktail, total revenues grew 18% versus the prior year.
Starting with REGEN-COV. In the third quarter, we recognized $677 million of U.S. net sales, which consist largely of the initial deliveries of approximately 300,000 doses to the U.S. government under the new 1.4 million dose contract as announced in September. Our collaborator, Roche, record sales of the COVID-19 antibody cocktail known as Ronapreve outside the U.S. In accordance with our Roche agreement, as a true-up payment for global profits, we recorded an additional $127 million as Roche collaboration revenue.
In the fourth quarter, we expect to deliver approximately 800,000 doses of REGEN-COV in the U.S. out of which, Roche will supply approximately half of these doses. We will record all REGEN-COV U.S. net product sales. Given the mix of manufactured product supply to the market by Roche and Regeneron, the true-up payment for global profits is expected to result in 0 Roche collaboration revenues in the fourth quarter. The remaining doses from the U.S. government contract are expected to be delivered in the first quarter of 2022.
I will now move to our Bayer collaboration. Ex-U.S. EYLEA net product sales reported to us by Bayer worth $931 million for the third quarter of 2021, representing growth of 19% on a reported basis and 18% on a constant currency basis. Total Bayer collaboration revenue was $365 million, of which we recorded $351 million for our share of net profits from EYLEA sales outside the U.S.
Total Sanofi collaboration revenue was $582 million in the third quarter of 2021. Our share of the profits from the commercialization of Dupixent and Kevzara was $387 million, which compares favorably to our share of profits of $213 million in the prior year. We also recognized a $50 million sales milestone payment related to achievement of $1.5 billion of ex-U.S. sales for the collaboration on a rolling 12-month basis.
Moving on to operating expenses. R&D decreased slightly to $592 million, primarily due to lower spending of REGEN-COV development as compared to the third quarter of 2020.
Next, SG&A expense increased 34% year-over-year to $391 million, primarily due to costs related to growth initiatives for EYLEA and higher headcount. Cost to goods sold increased versus the prior year from $122 million to $224 million, primarily due to REGEN-COV manufacturing costs. Cost of collaboration manufacturing increased 50% year-over-year to $214 million, driven by higher production to support the growing Dupixent sales. Finally, the effective tax rate was 10.8% in the third quarter of 2021.
Shifting to cash flow on the balance sheet. Year-to-date, Regeneron has generated $4.3 billion in free cash flow and ended the quarter with cash and marketable securities less debt of $8.7 billion. We continued to utilize our strong balance sheet in accordance with our capital allocation priorities of investing in internal R&D, funding strategic external R&D partnerships and returning cash to shareholders. Accordingly, in the third quarter, we repurchased approximately $191 million of our shares.
To conclude, I'd like to provide select updates to our 2021 guidance. A complete summary of our latest full year guidance is available in our press release published earlier this morning.
With our -- we are updating our 2021 gross margin guidance to be approximately 88%. This estimate is inclusive of an expected payment to Roche as a true-up of global profits for the COVID-19 antibody cocktail, which will be reported as cost of goods sold. As a result, we expect our gross margin percentage in the fourth quarter to be the lowest of the year.
We are also updating our 2021 R&D guidance to be in the range of $2.55 billion to $2.6 billion. The change to the guidance range is related to updated phasing of expenses and lower spend on REGEN-COV. Looking ahead, we will continue to make investments into both our commercial business and our broad pipeline for long-term growth. In particular, we expect to advance critically important development programs in 2022, including the late-stage studies for the LAG-3 Libtayo combo, BCMA by CD3 and C5 along with branded comparators, as George mentioned earlier, in advancing programs with our collaborators.
In conclusion, we're pleased with the third quarter as we invest in our robust pipeline to drive sustained long-term growth. I will now turn the call back to Justin."

Right now, obviously, as we've said, our cocktail remains active against all the known variants of concern that have emerged and created issues for other antibodies and so forth. However, we want to be prepared. So we're creating a complementary cocktail that if ever variants would arise that would raise problems for our current cocktail, we would have a complementary cocktail that the way we designed it would hopefully be unaffected by the same types of mutations. So it's to be prepared for that possibility that as the virus continues to evolve, we might need a cocktail that might not be sensitive to the same mutations as the first cocktail. But the current cocktail is still active against the variants of concern.
Yes. There's a lot of questions in terms of how to design the study, where to do it, depending on rates of hospitalization and rates of infection. So these are the complications that we've had to navigate throughout this pandemic, as you might remember. And throughout this pandemic, we have managed to carry out the largest COVID-19 program for treatment and for prevention using antibodies. And we hope that, that all the knowledge that we gained from learning how to navigate changing, fluctuating infection rates and hospitalization rates and so forth, we can continue to take advantage of that and continue to carry out our program efficiently and as quickly as possible."

Mind you, with the orals coming, we'll see whether they actually get to the United States. They do have some safety and efficacy issues as a class so far. They have not demonstrated the comparable core study comparisons, notwithstanding the kind of efficacy that monoclonals have delivered nor have they satisfied so many people's satisfaction, the safety concerns around using ImmunoGen perhaps okay for short term.
But when you're getting into longer-term prophylaxis of the immunocompromised, which is where George mentioned, we have a lot of work ongoing. It's really important to remember that we expect to have -- our molecules should be able to be given quite less frequently, I think, one might expect because you're looking at a prophylaxis mode. And we think that they should, based on the evidence we have, delivered really rather remarkable efficacy in that setting as they already have in the non-immunocompromised.

What we've managed to do is starting with our Regeneron Genetics Center is create what we believe is perhaps the world's most powerful technology to identify new genetic targets based on our sequencing of almost 2 million individuals, all linked to electronic digital records. 
That allows us to understand, we think, more powerfully than anybody else, the role of genetic variation, both in disease protection and causation, which have led to a whole series of new disease targets for both protection and causation. And for those, some of those are addressable by biologics and they're part of our existing approaches with biologics, but we had to use new approaches. And for those purposes, we started creating some of these important outside alliances and collaborations with companies like Alnylam for the siRNA approaches, we talked a little bit about and with Intellia with CRISPR-based approaches.
Many of these, we've been able to build and create and take them to another level based on our very productive collaborations with these 2 great companies that we're now collaborating with. And we also invested enormously internally in terms of building our own gene therapy approaches. So we believe that we're positioning ourselves to become leaders for the foreseeable future over the next decade or so in the genetic medicine space. It's becoming an increasingly important and larger part of our portfolio. It's almost a whole separate company, we believe, in terms of the opportunities and the value that it generates. While we're maintaining our leadership position with biologics, not only with classical antibodies but also with bispecifics and all sorts of engineered formats of biologics. So I think it's been a tremendous job by our entire team and organization to essentially create this entirely new capability."

And in the first set of patients that we treated, we show that a single dose of this CRISPR-based therapy led to very dramatic and dose-dependent reductions in the target protein coming from the target gene. I think that the world viewed this as incredibly exciting data.

Most important, however, is our lung launch. The initial launch we had in monotherapy is understandably for a smaller target group of patients. We do believe, however, though, the experience that physicians are gaining with Libtayo in first-line monotherapy treatment is very, very important and bodes well for when we hopefully have the larger indication approved for chemo combo.

Eye disease has often been neglected with very disastrous situations of vision loss that can't be corrected.

The one in the first that we thought that we'd be moving the most rapidly into the clinic and that has turned out to be the case were with liver targets, both sort of more conventional targets like the C5, but also targets that were coming from our own pipeline like the HSD target that we talked about. And that -- those are all moving along forward and we think a very exciting fashion as we've discussed.
Another key area that you just opened up, which is still preclinically, but we're hoping to eventually move into the clinic is targeting the eye targets with siRNAs. And that's really a very important area for us, and it was a very important separate part of the entire Alnylam collaboration.
And the third really critical foundational part of our collaboration with Alnylam involved using siRNAs to target in the brain. And that's also moving forward in a very exciting fashion, and we'll be talking a lot more about that going forward. So really, it's a 3 sort of pillar program, liver targets, eye targets and CNS targets. We're very excited and moving forward on all of them. And as we had guided early on, the first set of targets, of course, would be in the liver and then we'd be moving into the other 2 areas as rapidly as possible."
