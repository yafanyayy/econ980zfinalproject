I'd like to start with a special welcome to Edmund Reese, our new CFO, on his first Broadridge earnings call. 
I know many of you were introduced to Edmund during our virtual Investor Day in December. And I hope you came away as impressed as I have been over the past 2 months. This morning, I'll provide an overview of the key messages from this quarter and give you an update on our progress against the growth plan we discussed in December. Edmund will review our financial views, and we'll close with your questions. Let's get started. 
After a strong second quarter, Broadridge is on track to deliver another solid year of top and bottom line growth. We now expect to be at the higher end of our guidance range for both recurring revenue and adjusted EPS growth. That guidance reflects our strong quarterly results. 
For the quarter, Broadridge delivered 7% recurring revenue growth, continued margin expansion and 38% adjusted EPS growth, in a seasonally small quarter. We continue to execute against the growth plan we outlined in December. I'll highlight later some of the specific steps we've taken on key initiatives across governance, capital markets and wealth and investment management. 
Our strong second quarter results and outlook for the second half of the year have given us the opportunity to step up our investment. I'm pleased to see us increasing our investment in our technology, products and people to meet our clients' growing needs as they face accelerating trends towards next-generation mutualization, resiliency and digital transformation.
Finally, our outlook for the year means we are off to a strong start toward achieving our latest set of 3-year growth objectives, including 7% to 9% recurring revenue growth and 8% to 12% adjusted EPS growth. We remain focused on long-term growth, which has helped us deliver consistent sustainable top quartile total shareholder return. Our focus on long-term growth is the reason why I remain excited by our progress against our clear strategy.
Let's turn to Slide 4 for an update on some recent achievements against these goals. I'll start with our governance franchise, where we are delivering next-generation regulatory capabilities, building data-driven solutions for funds, delivering end-to-end solutions for issuers and driving omnichannel communications.
During the quarter, we made strong progress on each of these fronts. First, on NextGen regulatory. We're making strong progress on building a European regulatory communications hub for the shareholder rights directive. 
Two, we're winning new clients across the EU, including major institutions in both Italy and Spain. We're also working with other technology providers, including a leading Danish bank technology player and a leading French government solution provider to deliver Broadridge's SRD II solutions. 
Broadridge also made strong progress against delivering data-driven solutions to mutual funds. A key part of this effort is our growing data and insights business. Based on our unique data, we enable funds to better understand at an aggregate level who and importantly, where their shareholders are.
The compelling value of these solutions was further demonstrated by a multimillion dollar sale in the second quarter to a leading global fund company. We'll be using our data solutions for multiple use cases, including enabling the repatriation of tens of millions of dollars of dividends to the U.S. shareholders.
On the issuer side, we continue to see strong demand for virtual shareholder meetings. During the past calendar year, we hosted meetings for 83% of the S&P 100, and we're seeing strong renewal rates as we begin the lead-up to the 2021 proxy season.
We continue to enhance our BSM capabilities by rolling out the first phase of an enhanced platform, which will enable corporate issuers to leverage our unique capabilities around shareholder validation, while using the meeting platform of their choice. 
Finally, in omnichannel communications, we continued with double-digit growth in our digital communications revenue in the first half, building on last year's strong performance. 
Let me turn now to our capital markets franchise, where we continue to drive important mutualization benefits to our global clients. Broadridge is already the leading global post-trade provider for cash securities, processing over $10 trillion in equity and fixed income trades per day. During the quarter, we took an important step toward expanding beyond cash securities into exchange-rated derivatives. We announced that R.J. O'Brien, the largest independent futures exchange and clearing firm, has selected Broadridge's global derivatives platform. Our scalable and agile solution will enable R.J. out to streamline and modernize its operations with 1 unified global technology platform.
We're also bringing network value to our clients by extending to the front office and fixed income. As we described at Investor Day, our AI-driven corporate bond trading platform, LCX, remains on track for a broader launch this year. We're now live in the soft launch with select clients, and we continue to receive positive feedback. Full launch with more than 10 dealers and 35 buy-side clients will be later this year. 
Turning to Wealth and Investment Management. As we laid out in December, our goal is to build a leading technology and operation provider to the wealth management industry, by providing both a growing list of differentiated component solutions and by delivering our next-generation industry wealth technology platform. 
First and foremost, We have continued to demonstrate the value of our leading wealth back-office platform by seamlessly processing the recent spike of record trading volumes driven by high volatility and increased retail participation. These volumes have challenged the industry as homegrown systems have struggled to scale, but our performance has continued to drive home the value of a mutualized industry solution.
At the same time, we continue to extend our suite of component solutions, working with multiple partners to bring new and innovative solutions to our clients. And we continue to make strong progress towards the launch of our next-generation wealth management platform with UBS. The net of all of this, across governance, capital markets in wealth and investment management, that we are seeing strong execution on tangible deliverables, coupled with unique innovation that gives us confidence that our longer-term growth is on track.
Let's turn now to a brief review of our recurring revenue results on Slide 5. Edmund will cover our financial performance in more detail, but I want to share my key takeaways from our 7% recurring revenue growth in the second quarter. 
First, I was pleased to see balanced growth across both segments, with 7% growth in ICS and 8% growth in GTO. Second, as I look at the drivers of growth in ICS, what stands out is the impact of strong stock record growth, which reached 24%. And even in a seasonally small quarter, drove strong growth in regulatory revenues.
Our business is clearly benefiting from the long-term technology trends that have lowered the cost to retail investors of buying and owning individual shares. These trends, which include the widespread introduction of commission-free trading, are having a broader and longer-term impact on investment behavior that goes beyond the very recent volatility in a few hypo file names. Stock record growth has been healthy across virtually all of our broker-dealer clients, and it's been especially strong among online brokers who are leading many of these changes. As Edmund will discuss, we expect these growth trends to remain favorable in the second half of the year.
Third, I'm also pleased to see a strong growth contribution from both our data-driven fund solutions as well as our issuer business. Customer communications revenues were flat, with strong growth in digital revenues, balancing modest COVID declines in print volume. 
Fourth and last, strong sales onboarding and higher trading volumes are driving the growth in our GTO segment. As I noted earlier, much of the impact from higher trading levels is coming on the retail side, which clearly benefited from our wealth -- which clearly benefited our Wealth and Investment Management business in the second quarter. 
More important from my perspective is that year-to-date growth in both capital markets and wealth has been balanced at 7% and 9%, respectively. 
Let me wrap up my comments with some final thoughts about how to put our strong second quarter and first half in context. Simply put, our performance in the first half of fiscal '21 gives me even more confidence that Broadridge will continue to deliver steady and consistent revenue and earnings growth in the years to come. 
As we shared at our Investor Day, we have a large and growing $46 billion market opportunity, three strongly growing franchise businesses and a clear targeted growth plan to take advantage of long-term trends around next-generation mutualization, resilience and digital transformation.
We are on track to deliver another solid year of recurring revenue growth, margin expansion and adjusted EPS growth at the higher end of our 6% to 10% range. Our strong results and disciplined cost actions have put us in a position to deliver against the higher end of our revenue and earnings guidance for fiscal '21, while making investments that will sustain our growth through fiscal '23 and beyond.
We are investing in our technology platforms and strengthening our product development teams. We're also investing in our human capital by rewarding our associates, increasing our diversity, equity and inclusion and core development investments and upping and recruiting for new talent, all of which will enhance our talent base going forward.
As we enter the seasonally larger second half, Broadridge is delivering in the short term and investing for the long term. That's a great place to be and a strong formula for long-term value creation.
Before I hand it over to Edmund, I want to thank our associates around the world for the important work they do and for their commitment to the service profit chain. Whether they're working from home or socially distanced on the production floor, they are persevering and delivering for our clients at an extraordinary rate. They truly are enabling better financial lives for millions of investors around the globe, and their engagement in this powerful mission is what drives us forward. Thank you.
Edmund, over to you."

During my opening remarks at our December Investor Day, I mentioned my excitement, joining a company with such a strong leadership team and growth strategy.Now over",799,"Thanks, Tim, and thank you again for the warm welcome to our first earnings call as CFO. During my opening remarks at our December Investor Day, I mentioned my excitement, joining a company with such a strong leadership team and growth strategy.
Now over 2 full months and I'm even more excited and more confident and Broadridge's ability to execute our simple but powerful financial model. And our strong second quarter and outlook for the full year are great examples of how that model works.
As you can see here, looking at the Q2 financial summary on Slide 7, this was a strong quarter of top and bottom line growth across all our key metrics. Recurring revenues grew 7%, operating margin increased 150 basis points year-over-year to 11.2%, and we continue to demonstrate our ability to expand margins, even while ramping up the investment spend that Tim highlighted earlier, which we said we would accelerate during last quarter's call. And adjusted EPS grew to $0.73 in the quarter, up 38% over Q2 '20.
Now let's turn the slide and get into the details of the quarter, starting with some of our key operational metrics. Broadridge's recurring revenue growth benefits from underlying volume growth trends, including record growth. Over the last 10 years, equity and mutual fund record growth has averaged 6% to 8% and is a driver of our regulatory revenues. Stock record growth in Q2 increased 24%, driven in part by a few large issuers. And I'll remind you to keep in mind that second quarter volumes historically make up less than 10% of the full year total. 
Looking ahead to the seasonally larger second half of the year, we expect low double-digit growth across stock records. Looking further ahead, our 3-year objectives assume that this increased growth moderates and returns to mid-single digits.
Touching briefly on trade volumes, which you'll see at the bottom of this slide, this is the fourth consecutive quarter of aggregate double-digit volume growth. This growth reflects the continued volatility in the markets, which, as you know, spiked last March and April and remains well above pre-COVID levels. As a result, we expect tough trading volume comps for both Q3 and Q4.
Now turning to closed sales, the biggest driver of our recurring revenue growth. Our $79 million closed sales year-to-date are in line with our performance over the same period last year. We continue to see strong demand for our ICS solutions, including virtual shareholder meetings, regulation-driven SRD sales across Europe and continued client expansion, cross-selling data solutions to existing customers. We remain on track to achieve our full year guidance of $190 million to $235 million for closed sales.
Historically, the closed sales performance in the back half of the year has been impacted by large signings. A large signing could propel us to the top end of our guidance range, and conversely, delays could lower our performance. And I'll also note that we continue to feel good about our revenue backlog, which, as of Q4 '20, was 12% of our fiscal '20 recurring revenue and gives us great visibility into our top line growth.
Turning to recurring revenue growth on Slide 10. As I said, recurring revenue grew 7% in the quarter, well in line with our historical mid-single-digit growth performance in demonstrating the resiliency and consistency of our recurring revenue growth model. With the strong start to the year, we are on track to be at the higher end of our 3% to 6% recurring revenue growth guidance range.
Now let's look at the drivers of the quarter's recurring revenue growth. Slide 11 highlights that our growth was primarily driven by our internal efforts. Organic growth has consistently been the largest component of our recurring revenue growth. 
In Q2, Revenue from new sales drove 6 points of growth and remain the biggest driver of our revenue growth across both our GTO and ICS segments. We continued our long track record of retaining 98% of existing client recurring revenue, and internal growth contributed 2 points of growth driven by higher trading volumes in our GTO segment. ICS internal growth was neutral as our strong position growth was offset by the impact of lower interest rates and lower customer communications print volumes.
The impact of acquisitions made within the last 12 months contributed 1 point. Barring any new acquisitions, We would expect the contribution to growth from acquisitions to be less than the 1 point in Q3 and 0 in Q4. 
And while we're focused on recurring revenue, let me share some insights on the drivers of growth across our updated ICS and GTO product lines that Tim touched on earlier. These categories were introduced at Investor Day with the goal to better align our external reporting with our growth strategies."

Barring any new acquisitions, we'd expect the contribution of growth from acquisitions to be less than 1 point from Q3 and 0 in Q4. And while we're focused on recurring revenues, let me share some insights on the drivers of growth across our updated ICS and GTO product lines that Tim touched on earlier. 
These categories were introduced at Investor Day with the goal to better align our external rewarding with our growth strategies. ICS recurring revenues rose 7% with strong growth across 3 of our 4 product categories. The biggest contribution to growth came from our regulatory revenues, which were propelled by strong 24% stock record growth and 5% interim record growth. 
We also benefited from additional growth across our international and Canadian proxy volumes. Revenues of our data-driven fund solutions benefited from strong double-digit growth in our data and insight product revenues and the acquisition last February of FundsLibrary, offset by the impact of lower interest rates on our mutual fund trade processing unit. 
Customer communications revenues were flat in the quarter as double-digit growth in digital revenues was offset by line in print volumes. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, we expect to see the impact of some recent client wins in the fourth quarter, which should put that business on the farmer track to low single-digit growth. 
Issuer Solutions revenues rose 14%, driven by higher revenues from virtual shareholder meetings, which also helped drive growth across a broader set of issuer products and offset the impact of lower revenue in our transfer agency business. 
In GTO, recurring revenues grew 8%, driven by strong growth in our Wealth and Investment Management revenues. Both our wealth and capital markets product revenues benefited from new client onboardings, and the impact of the 24% increase in trading volumes versus the second quarter of fiscal 2020, with higher growth coming from the retail side of our clients' businesses.
As we enter the second half of the fiscal year, we expect the growth in trading volumes to slowly significantly last spring spike in volatility, which, coupled with the lower license activity, will put pressure on GTO growth.
Now we'll turn to Slide 12 to brief in touch on our total revenue performance. As a reminder, on Broadridge's revenue mix, 65% of our total revenue is recurring, about 31% is from distribution revenues and 4% for more cyclical event-driven revenue. This revenue mix has steadily improved since 2017, recurring revenues comprised 58% of the total. 
Our total revenue growth this quarter was stronger than usual, reaching 9% with distribution revenues contributing 3 points due to the increased mailings we saw a corresponding to the high record growth and increased event-driven activity this quarter. 
Moving forward, we expect the low to no margin distribution revenues to decline over time, as we focus on increasing higher-margin digital revenues across our governance business. 
Pausing briefly on the event-driven revenues, we saw another quarter aligned with our historical norms of about $50 million a quarter. And we remain on track to meet or exceed our $180 million outlook for fiscal '21 event-driven revenues. 
Going forward, as I covered in the Investor Day, we expect annual-driven event revenues to return to the approximately $200 million average that we've seen over the past 7 years.
Turning to Slide 13. This was another strong quarter of margin expansion. We increased adjusted operating income margin by 150 basis points over last year. During the quarter, we began to ramp up our level of investment in our technology platforms, product capabilities and people as we highlighted we were on our first quarter call. While this increased investment is likely to affect margin expansion in the second half of the fiscal year, these investments will support our long-term growth. 
And I want to underline that point because it's critical to how we run our business. We're foregoing some of the near-term margin expansion that you get from underinvestments, in favor of capturing the larger future margin opportunity. That is driven by growth. That formula has been a key factor in Broadridge's ability to drive long-term sustainable growth. 
Moving to capital allocation on the following slide. We generated $51 million of free cash flow year-to-date, up $82 million over the first 6 months of fiscal '20, driven by higher earnings and strong working capital management. Broadridge remains committed to a balanced capital allocation policy, which prioritizes internal investment, growing our dividend, M&A and returning excess capital to shareholders, all while maintaining our investment-grade credit rating. 
During the first 6 months of the fiscal year, we invested $128 million in building out our industry platforms and another $51 million in CapEx and software spending. 
Turning to capital returns on the right-hand side of the slide, our dividend has grown and remains in line with our historical 45% payout ratio. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, and we've historically generated most of our annual free cash flow, Broadridge is in great shape to pursue attractive targeted M&A opportunities or repurchase shares.
Now turning to guidance on Slide 15. We expect recurring revenue growth to be at the higher end of our 3% to 6% range, with higher full year record growth and strong first half trading volumes, offsetting the drag that we expect from lower second half trading volumes. We expect our adjusted operating income margin to expand to approximately 18% from 17.5% in fiscal year '20 as we balance near-term returns, with continued investments to sustain long-term growth. 
And finally, we expect to be at the higher end of our adjusted EPS growth guidance range of 6% to 10%, putting us well on track to achieve our 3-year 8% to 12% adjusted EPS growth objective that we presented at our Investor Day in December. Finally, as I noted earlier, we continue to expect closed sales in the range of $190 million to $235 million. And looking below the line, we expect our full year effective overall tax rate to remain at 21%, confirming what we shared on our last call.
And one final point on our outlook, we expect third quarter adjusted EPS to be flat or slightly lower than fiscal year '20, driven by increased investment spend and lower license revenues.
So before we begin to take your questions, let me share some final thoughts. I told you at our Investor Day that Broadridge is a simple financial model, based on sustainable revenue growth, consistent investment, margin expansion and balanced capital allocation. That model has produced steady and consistent earnings growth over time and helped drive strong top quartile of total shareholder returns.
Our second quarter results and expectations for the full year are a great example of how that model works. We generated strong 7% recurring revenue growth, propelled by long-term trends. That growth helped drive the 150 basis points of margin expansion, which, in turn, is enabling us to make incremental investments to drive long-term growth, especially over the second half of our year. The end result is earnings growth that positions us well to deliver on our 3-year financial objectives. It's a great example of how we manage our business to drive sustainable revenue growth, steady and consistent adjusted EPS growth and historically top quartile TSR.
So now let me hand the call back to Andrew to take your questions."

And I hear the message about reinvesting the excess growth in products and platforms. But as we think about the 2021 proxy season, if 24% stock record growth is a jumping off point for proxy mailings, will you actually be able to reinvest this excess revenue growth fast enough in the second half to actually keep earnings growth within the 6% to 10% growth guidance? 
And then my follow-up question, which is related, as we think about fiscal '22 and recognizing you haven't given guidance yet, you've got the strong jumping off point with stock record growth with a lot of secular growth drivers behind that. You've got UBS contract coming on stream this summer. Isn't the setup for fiscal '22 potentially above the long-term growth guide as well?"

First, I think, certainly, we're pleased with the headline number that sounds like 24, but I do want to caution that the second quarter is small, and there is some specific names that really drove that. 
And as we look to the second half, we are seeing certainly very nice stock record growth, but not at that level. So that's just an important starting point. 
We are really pleased -- in the investment side, we think that our opportunity here is essentially unlimited relative to our current size. And we see -- we do see many arenas where we're better positioned than anyone to meet real industry needs. So you will see us continuing to invest within the confines of those 3-year targets. And we do have a lot of ability to invest, Dave. So I do think that we will be able to do that.

And Peter, I think this is a really good opportunity to step back and look at the regulatory landscape, and I'll work my way to the fees question. 
But just I think as you look at the regulatory landscape, we have a long history of working with administrations on both sides of the aisle to promote really effective and cost-efficient disclosure that's really the foundation of our market. And with the increasing democratization that we're seeing, there's a real -- the need for effective disclosure is greater than ever before. 
The democrat administrations do tend to be somewhat more inclined to extend disclosures and protections, and we're already seeing some of that relative to ESG and fiduciary standards. But even with all that background, we don't really see a substantive regulatory update relative to the statements that are happening in our space. So 30e-3 is now live, and it's saving funds money. The comments are in for 498b, and those have been really supportive of the summary concept and -- but people are expressing concerns about drop in prospectuses. So it's not clear whether that will happen. 
There is a big push for moving to e-delivery and that's something that we support, and it's really aligned with the idea of summary documents. And then there continues to be, as you raised this question around fees, ICI continues to push for a fee review and is talking about let's move it away from the NYSE, which the NYSE would like to move it away. 
At the same time, FINRA has responded is saying, they don't want it either as you go to the SEC, so I think there's going to be a lot of back and forth here. We do feel wherever it ends up It will be fine. We have a strong relationship with FINRA with strong relationship with the New York Stock Exchange, a strong relationship with the SEC And we really believe that when you look at fees, when you bring all parties to the table, not just the funds, but all parties and have good information that we'll get to a very good place on that. 
I think it's -- in terms of speculating on timing, I think it's going to be a long debate about who is the right place for it to do. And then if there were to be a review, as you know, the last one took several years to unfold."

With respect to -- but not so much as we really notable in the results is just -- it's a modest positive. With respect to 498b, it had a couple of components. There is a -- the most important component was really around moving some of the long-form communications to summary form. We think that would be good for the industry. We think it would be good for investors and the economics of that are neutral to us. 
There was some conversation about dropping the annual prospectus. There was a lot of mixed commentary on that as the comments came back, so that seems less likely to us. 
As you recall in -- when we discussed this, I believe, in the summer call, what we said is the -- we saw potentially a downtick from the prospectus revenue, an uptick from the idea of us being able to create the super documents for people and really provide an industry solution around that. And we saw those balancing each other.
If we're to proceed with the summaries, but not with the prospectus downtick, then that would be a plus. But I think this is going to be quite some time for it to unfold. The new administration is coming in. They have their own set of priorities. And so I think really the timing of this is highly uncertain at this stage."

At the same time, we believe the strong dividend. We don't let cash build up. We only investment we're confident we can execute well. So that's why you see these priorities around internal investment, dividends, M&A, share buyback in that order. 
We are definitely looking at M&A opportunities. We think that's an evergreen strategy for us to supplement our internal product development and bring more value to our clients. In this environment, prices are high, and it's unclear whether any of the opportunities that we're looking at will come through at prices that make sense to us. And we have been on the doorstep a couple of times this year and not been able to go through at a price that made sense for our shareholders.
So I think M&A is something we continue to really look at. There's uncertainty around it. At the same time, we won't let cash build up on our balance sheet. And so if we're not able to exclude on M&A, you will see share buybacks.
I'd like to just ask Edmund to add on to that, if there's anything that I've missed. So just -- Edmund will add that up."

I think we're clearly seeing the extension of healthy trends around the democratization of retail shareholding, and that is building on the prior trends that are still there towards managed accounts and model-based investing. So I think those 2 are building on each other. And -- so I do think that it's going to be something that is longer term.

The 0 commission trading, I think you mentioned more retail investors coming in. I think that's good for Broadridge. In fact, they want to engage and interact digitally. So I think that's also a tailwind for Broadridge and hopefully, that's stable going forward.
The newer things, the coordinated buying efforts, the specs don't exactly yet know exactly how stable that is, and we're not counting on that as we look to our outlook going forward.

The higher performance on the revenue side and our ability to be able to get the efficiency gains, expand operating margins through the initiatives, which I'll touch on that we mentioned in Q1, is what allowed us to make these investments. 
And so in Q1, we talked about roughly about $80 million in cost initiatives, real estate, cloud migration, product realignment. And I think we're well on track. You saw 150 basis points of margin expansion in the second quarter. And I think it's that efficiency that gives us the capacity to be able to make these investments. 
The second point I'll make, and then I'll turn it to Tim, to see if he has anything, that the investments has been a key part of the financial model in strategy for growth, a key part of our capital allocation program prior to majority, and it's going to -- we're going to continue to remain committed to it to support the future growth. 
And I think we have -- Tim mentioned some of these, we have a number of high-returning investment opportunities as we look across our post-trade platforms, our wealth management platforms.

Might be a little margin compression in the short term, but they help us with long-term growth.

So I think that we are -- we're certainly seeing, relative to physical versus digital, we saw very strong growth in our digital communications in the first half. I remarked on that, and that builds on a very nice year last year. And we're seeing very strong interest from our clients in terms of digital transformation and working with us to upgrade their infrastructure for digital communications.
I think I was a bit surprised to see the increase in distribution revenues this quarter. And that's not something that we generally expect. That was really due to increase in both regulatory and event communications. I think we continue to expect that, over the long run, that physical piece will be a smaller part of our business model and the digital piece will be a bigger piece. 
Relative to adviser versus digital channels with the sector investing, I think we're just -- we're seeing both. We saw very good position growth across all of our broker-dealers, including both adviser and online. I think perhaps in terms of number of investors we're seeing with this democratization the new investors being on the digital side. But if you look at where the money is, it's still definitely on the adviser side. And those underlying trends that we've been talking about, for the past couple of years, we don't see any change in terms of move to managed accounts, move to model-based investing. So we think that trend will continue. 
We do think there's an overlay of a new trend around democratization that will add and bring new investors in, which is why we highlighted the fact that with all these new investors, really the need for strong disclosure is higher than ever."

I'd like to start with a special welcome to Edmund Reese, our new CFO, on his first Broadridge earnings call. I know many of you were introduced to Edmund during our virtual Investor Day in December, and I hope you came away as impressed as I have been over the past 2 months. 
This morning, I'll provide an overview of the key messages from this quarter and give you an update on our progress against the growth plan we discussed in December. Edmund will review our financial results, and we'll close with your questions.  
Let's get started. After a strong second quarter, Broadridge is on track to deliver another solid year of top and bottom line growth. We now expect to be at the higher end of our guidance range for both recurring revenue and adjusted EPS growth. That guidance reflects our strong quarterly results. For the quarter, Broadridge delivered 7% recurring revenue growth, continued margin expansion and 38% adjusted EPS growth in a seasonally small quarter. 
We continue to execute against the growth plan we outlined in December. I'll highlight later some of the specific steps we've taken on key initiatives across governance, capital markets and wealth and investment management.  
Our strong second quarter results and outlook for the second half of the year have given us the opportunity to step up our investment. I'm pleased to see us increasing our investment in our technology, products and people to meet our clients' growing needs as they face accelerating trends towards next-generation mutualization, resiliency and digital transformation.  
Finally, our outlook for the year means we are off to a strong start toward achieving our latest set of 3-year growth objectives, including 7% to 9% recurring revenue growth and 8% to 12% adjusted EPS growth. We remain focused on long-term growth, which has helped us deliver consistent sustainable top quartile total shareholder return. Our focus on long-term growth is the reason why I remain excited by our progress against our clear strategy.  
Let's turn to Slide 4 for an update on some recent achievements against these goals. I'll start with our governance franchise, where we are delivering next-generation regulatory capabilities, building data-driven solutions for funds, delivering end-to-end solutions for issuers and driving omnichannel communications. During the quarter, we made strong progress on each of these fronts. 
First, on next-gen regulatory. We're making strong progress on building a European regulatory communications hub for the shareholder rights directive. Two, we're winning new clients across the EU, including major institutions in both Italy and Spain. We're also working with other technology providers, including a leading Danish bank technology player and a leading French government solution provider to deliver Broadridge's SRD II solutions.  
Broadridge also made strong progress against delivering data-driven solutions to mutual funds. A key part of this effort is our growing data and insights business. Based on our unique data, we enable funds to better understand at an aggregate level who and, importantly, where their shareholders are.  
The compelling value of these solutions was further demonstrated by a multimillion dollar sale in the second quarter to a leading global fund company. We'll be using our data solutions for multiple use cases, including enabling the repatriation of tens of millions of dollars of dividends to the U.S. shareholders.  
On the issuer side, we continue to see strong demand for virtual shareholder meetings. During the past calendar year, we hosted meetings for 83% of the S&P 100, and we're seeing strong renewal rates as we begin the lead-up to the 2021 proxy season.  
We continue to enhance our VSM capabilities by rolling out the first phase of an enhanced platform, which will enable corporate issuers to leverage our unique capabilities around shareholder validation, while using the meeting platform of their choice.  
Finally, in omnichannel communications, we continued with double-digit growth in our digital communications revenue in the first half, building on last year's strong performance.  
Let me turn now to our capital markets franchise, where we continue to drive important mutualization benefits to our global clients. Broadridge is already the leading global post-trade provider for cash securities, processing over $10 trillion in equity and fixed income trades per day. 
During the quarter, we took an important step toward expanding beyond cash securities into exchange-rated derivatives. We announced that R.J. O'Brien, the largest independent futures exchange and clearing firm, has selected Broadridge's global derivatives platform. Our scalable and agile solution will enable R.J. out to streamline and modernize its operations with one unified global technology platform.  
We're also bringing network value to our clients by extending to the front office and fixed income. As we described at Investor Day, our AI-driven corporate bond trading platform, LTX, remains on track for a broader launch this year. We're now live in the soft launch with select clients, and we continue to receive positive feedback. Full launch with more than 10 dealers and 35 buy-side clients will be later this year.  
Turning to wealth and investment management. As we laid out in December, our goal is to build a leading technology and operation provider to the wealth management industry by providing both a growing list of differentiated component solutions and by delivering our next-generation industry wealth technology platform.  
First and foremost, we have continued to demonstrate the value of our leading wealth back-office platform by seamlessly processing the recent spike of record trading volumes driven by high volatility and increased retail participation. These volumes have challenged the industry as homegrown systems have struggled to scale, but our performance has continued to drive home the value of a mutualized industry solution.  
At the same time, we continue to extend our suite of component solutions, working with multiple partners to bring new and innovative solutions to our clients, and we continue to make strong progress toward the launch of our next-generation wealth management platform with UBS. The net of all of this, across governance, capital markets and wealth and investment management, that we are seeing strong execution on tangible deliverables, coupled with unique innovation that gives us confidence on our longer-term growth is on track.  
Let's turn now to a brief review of our recurring revenue results on Slide 5. Edmund will cover our financial performance in more detail, but I want to share my key takeaways from our 7% recurring revenue growth in the second quarter.  
First, I was pleased to see balanced growth across both segments, with 7% growth in ICS and 8% growth in GTO. Second, as I look at the drivers of growth in ICS, what stands out is the impact of strong stock record growth, which reached 24% and, even in a seasonally small quarter, drove strong growth in regulatory revenues.  
Our business is clearly benefiting from the long-term technology trends that have lowered the cost to retail investors of buying and owning individual shares. These trends, which include the widespread introduction of commission-free trading, are having a broader and longer-term impact on investment behavior that goes beyond the very recent volatility in a few hypo file names. 
Stock record growth has been healthy across virtually all of our broker-dealer clients, and it's been especially strong among online brokers who are leading many of these changes. As Edmund will discuss, we expect these growth trends to remain favorable in the second half of the year.  
Third, I'm also pleased to see a strong growth contribution from both our data-driven fund solutions as well as our issuer business. Customer communications revenues were flat, with strong growth in digital revenues, balancing modest COVID declines in print volume.  
Fourth and last, strong sales onboarding and higher trading volumes are driving the growth in our GTO segment. As I noted earlier, much of the impact from higher trading levels is coming on the retail side, which clearly benefited from our wealth -- which clearly benefited our wealth and investment management business in the second quarter. More important from my perspective is that year-to-date growth in both capital markets and wealth has been balanced at 7% and 9%, respectively.  
Let me wrap up my comments with some final thoughts about how to put our strong second quarter and first half in context. Simply put, our performance in the first half of fiscal '21 gives me even more confidence that Broadridge will continue to deliver steady and consistent revenue and earnings growth in the years to come. As we shared at our Investor Day, we have a large and growing $46 billion market opportunity, 3 strongly growing franchise businesses and a clear targeted growth plan to take advantage of long-term trends around next-generation mutualization, resilience and digital transformation.  
We are on track to deliver another solid year of recurring revenue growth, margin expansion and adjusted EPS growth at the higher end of our 6% to 10% range. Our strong results and disciplined cost actions have put us in a position to deliver against the higher end of our revenue and earnings guidance for fiscal '21, while making investments that will sustain our growth through fiscal '23 and beyond.  
We are investing in our technology platforms and strengthening our product development teams. We're also investing in our human capital by rewarding our associates, increasing our diversity, equity and inclusion and career development investments and upping our recruiting for new talent, all of which will enhance our talent base going forward.
As we enter the seasonally larger second half, Broadridge is delivering in the short term and investing for the long term. That's a great place to be and a strong formula for long-term value creation.  
Before I hand it over to Edmund, I want to thank our associates around the world for the important work they do and for their commitment to the service profit chain. Whether they're working from home or socially distanced on the production floor, they are persevering and delivering for our clients at an extraordinary rate. They truly are enabling better financial lives for millions of investors around the globe, and their engagement in this powerful mission is what drives us forward. Thank you.  
Edmund, over to you."

During my opening remarks at our December Investor Day, I mentioned my excitement joining a company with such a strong leadership team and growth strategy. Now over 2",801,"Thanks, Tim, and thank you again for the warm welcome to our first earnings call as CFO. During my opening remarks at our December Investor Day, I mentioned my excitement joining a company with such a strong leadership team and growth strategy. Now over 2 full months, and I'm even more excited and more confident in Broadridge's ability to execute our simple but powerful financial model. And our strong second quarter and outlook for the full year are great examples of how that model works.  
As you can see here, looking at the Q2 financial summary on Slide 7, this was a strong quarter of top and bottom line growth across all our key metrics. Recurring revenues grew 7%, operating margin increased 150 basis points year-over-year to 11.2%, and we continue to demonstrate our ability to expand margins, even while ramping up the investment spend that Tim highlighted earlier, which we said we would accelerate during last quarter's call. And adjusted EPS grew to $0.73 in the quarter, up 38% over Q2 '20.  
Now let's turn the slide and get into the details of the quarter, starting with some of our key operational metrics. Broadridge's recurring revenue growth benefits from underlying volume growth trends, including record growth. Over the last 10 years, equity and mutual fund record growth has averaged 6% to 8% and is a driver of our regulatory revenues. Stock record growth in Q2 increased 24% driven in part by a few large issuers, and I'll remind you to keep in mind that second quarter volumes historically make up less than 10% of the full year total.  
Looking ahead to the seasonally larger second half of the year, we expect low double-digit growth across stock records. Looking further ahead, our 3-year objectives assume that this increased growth moderates and returns to mid-single digits.  
Touching briefly on trade volumes, which you'll see at the bottom of this slide, this is the fourth consecutive quarter of aggregate double-digit volume growth. This growth reflects the continued volatility in the markets, which, as you know, spiked last March and April and remains well above pre-COVID levels. As a result, we expect tough trading volume comps for both Q3 and Q4.  
Now turning to closed sales, the biggest driver of our recurring revenue growth. Our $79 million closed sales year-to-date are in line with our performance over the same period last year. We continue to see strong demand for our ICS solutions, including virtual shareholder meetings, regulation-driven SRD sales across Europe and continued client expansion, cross-selling data solutions to existing customers. We remain on track to achieve our full year guidance of $190 million to $235 million for closed sales.  
Historically, the closed sales performance in the back half of the year has been impacted by large signings. A large signing could propel us to the top end of our guidance range. And conversely, delays could lower our performance. And I'll also note that we continue to feel good about our revenue backlog, which, as of Q4 '20, was 12% of our fiscal '20 recurring revenue and gives us great visibility into our top line growth.  
Turning to recurring revenue growth on Slide 10. As I've said, recurring revenue grew 7% in the quarter, well in line with our historical mid-single-digit growth performance in demonstrating the resiliency and consistency of our recurring revenue growth model. With the strong start to the year, we are on track to be at the higher end of our 3% to 6% recurring revenue growth guidance range.  
Now let's look at the drivers of the quarter's recurring revenue growth. Slide 11 highlights that our growth was primarily driven by our internal efforts. Organic growth has consistently been the largest component of our recurring revenue growth. In Q2, revenue from new sales drove 6 points of growth and remained the biggest driver of our revenue growth across both our GTO and ICS segments. 
We continued our long track record of retaining 98% of existing client recurring revenue, and internal growth contributed 2 points of growth driven by higher trading volumes in our GTO segment. ICS internal growth was neutral as our strong position growth was offset by the impact of lower interest rates and lower customer communications print volumes. The impact of acquisitions made within the last 12 months contributed 1 point. Barring any new acquisitions, we would expect the contribution to growth from acquisitions to be less than 1 point in Q3 and 0 in Q4.  
And while we're focused on recurring revenue, let me share some insights on the drivers of growth across our updated ICS and GTO product lines that Tim touched on earlier. These categories were introduced at our Investor Day with the goal to better align our external reporting with our growth strategies.

Barring any new acquisitions, we'd expect the contribution of growth from acquisitions to be less than 1 point from Q3 and 0 in Q4. And while we're focused on recurring revenues, let me share some insights on the drivers of growth across our updated ICS and GTO product lines that Tim touched on earlier.  
These categories were introduced at our Investor Day with the goal to better align our external reporting with our growth strategies. ICS recurring revenues rose 7%, with strong growth across 3 of our 4 product categories. The biggest contribution to growth came from our regulatory revenues, which were propelled by strong 24% stock record growth and 5% interim record growth. We also benefited from additional growth across our international and Canadian proxy volumes. 
Revenues of our data-driven fund solutions benefited from strong double-digit growth in our data and insight product revenues and the acquisition last February of FundsLibrary, offset by the impact of lower interest rates on our mutual fund trade processing unit. Customer communications revenues were flat in the quarter as double-digit growth in digital revenues was offset by a decline in print volumes. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, we expect to see the impact of some recent client wins in the fourth quarter, which should put that business on the former track of low single-digit growth.  
Issuer solutions revenues rose 14% driven by higher revenues from virtual shareholder meetings, which also helped drive growth across a broader set of issuer products and offset the impact of lower revenue in our transfer agency business.  
In GTO, recurring revenues grew 8% driven by strong growth in our wealth and investment management revenues. Both our wealth and capital markets product revenues benefited from new client onboardings and the impact of the 24% increase in trading volumes versus the second quarter of fiscal 2020, with higher growth coming from the retail side of our clients' businesses. As we enter the second half of the fiscal year, we expect the growth in trading volumes to slowly significantly lap last spring's spike in volatility, which, coupled with the lower license activity, will put pressure on GTO growth.  
Now we'll turn to Slide 12 to brief in touch on our total revenue performance. As a reminder, on Broadridge's revenue mix, 65% of our total revenue is recurring, about 31% is from distribution revenues and 4% from more cyclical event-driven revenue. This revenue mix has steadily improved since 2017. Recurring revenues comprised 58% of the total. 
Our total revenue growth this quarter was stronger than usual, reaching 9%, with distribution revenues contributing 3 points due to the increased mailings we saw corresponding to the high record growth and increased event-driven activity this quarter. Moving forward, we expect the low to no margin distribution revenues to decline over time, as we focus on increasing higher-margin digital revenues across our governance business. 
Pausing briefly on the event-driven revenues, we saw another quarter aligned with our historical norms of about $50 million a quarter, and we remain on track to meet or exceed our $180 million outlook for fiscal '21 event-driven revenues. Going forward, as I covered in the Investor Day, we expect annual driven event revenues to return to the approximately $200 million average that we've seen over the past 7 years.  
Turning to Slide 13. This was another strong quarter of margin expansion. We increased adjusted operating income margin by 150 basis points over last year. During the quarter, we began to ramp up our level of investment in our technology platforms, product capabilities and people, as we highlighted we would on our first quarter call. While this increased investment is likely to affect margin expansion in the second half of the fiscal year, these investments will support our long-term growth.  
And I want to underline that point because it's critical to how we run our business. We're foregoing some of the near-term margin expansion that you get from underinvestments in favor of capturing the larger future margin opportunity that is driven by growth. That formula has been a key factor in Broadridge's ability to drive long-term sustainable growth.  
Moving to capital allocation on the following slide. We generated $51 million of free cash flow year-to-date, up $82 million over the first 6 months of fiscal '20, driven by higher earnings and strong working capital management. Broadridge remains committed to a balanced capital allocation policy, which prioritizes internal investment, growing our dividend, M&A and returning excess capital to shareholders, all while maintaining our investment-grade credit rating. During the first 6 months of the fiscal year, we invested $128 million in building out our industry platforms and another $51 million in CapEx and software spending.  
Turning to capital returns on the right-hand side of the slide, our dividend has grown and remains in line with our historical 45% payout ratio. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, and we've historically generated most of our annual free cash flow, Broadridge is in great shape to pursue attractive targeted M&A opportunities or repurchase shares.  
Now turning to guidance on Slide 15. We expect recurring revenue growth to be at the higher end of our 3% to 6% range, with higher full year record growth from strong first half trading volumes, offsetting the drag that we expect from lower second half trading volumes. We expect our adjusted operating income margin to expand to approximately 18% from 17.5% in fiscal year '20 as we balance near-term returns with continued investments to sustain long-term growth.  
And finally, we expect to be at the higher end of our adjusted EPS growth guidance range of 6% to 10%, putting us well on track to achieve our 3-year 8% to 12% adjusted EPS growth objective that we presented at our Investor Day in December. 
Finally, as I noted earlier, we continue to expect closed sales in the range of $190 million to $235 million. And looking below the line, we expect our full year effective overall tax rate to remain at 21%, confirming what we shared on our last call.  
And one final point on our outlook, we expect third quarter adjusted EPS to be flat or slightly lower than fiscal year '20 driven by increased investment spend and lower license revenues.  
So before we begin to take your questions, let me share some final thoughts. I told you at our Investor Day that Broadridge is a simple financial model based on sustainable revenue growth, consistent investment, margin expansion and balanced capital allocation. That model has produced steady and consistent earnings growth over time and helped drive strong top quartile of total shareholder returns. Our second quarter results and expectations for the full year are a great example of how that model works. 
We generated strong 7% recurring revenue growth, propelled by long-term trends. That growth helped drive the 150 basis points of margin expansion, which, in turn, is enabling us to make incremental investments to drive long-term growth, especially over the second half of our year. The end result is earnings growth that positions us well to deliver on our 3-year financial objectives. It's a great example of how we manage our business to drive sustainable revenue growth, steady and consistent adjusted EPS growth and historically top quartile TSR.

But as we think about the 2021 proxy season, if 24% stock record growth is a jumping off point for proxy mailings, will you actually be able to reinvest this excess revenue growth fast enough in the second half to actually keep earnings growth within the 6% to 10% growth guidance?  
And then my follow-up question, which is related, as we think about fiscal '22 and recognizing you haven't given guidance yet, you've got the strong jumping off point with stock record growth, with a lot of secular growth drivers behind that. You've got UBS contract coming on stream this summer. Isn't the setup for fiscal '22 potentially above the long-term growth guide as well?"

I'm going to make a couple of comments and then hand it over to Edmund to also comment.  
First, I think, certainly, we're pleased with the headline number that sounds like 24%, but I do want to caution that the second quarter is small, and there is some specific names that really drove that. And as we look to the second half, we are seeing certainly very nice stock record growth, but not at that level. So that's just an important starting point.  
We are really pleased in the investment side. We think that our opportunity here is essentially unlimited relative to our current size, and we see -- we do see many arenas where we're better positioned than anyone to meet real industry needs. So you will see us continuing to invest within the confines of those 3-year targets, and we do have a lot of ability to invest, Dave. So I do think that we will be able to do that. Really, the only thing that would keep that from happening would be if we had sort of surprising event activity in the fourth quarter.

And Peter, I think this is a really good opportunity to step back and look at the regulatory landscape, and I'll work my way to the fees question. But just I think, as you look into regulatory landscape, we have a long history of working with administrations on both sides of the aisle to promote really effective and cost-efficient disclosure. That's really the foundation of our market. And with the increasing democratization that we're seeing, there's a real -- the need for effective disclosure is greater than ever before. 
The democrat administrations do tend to be somewhat more inclined to extend disclosures and protections, and we're already seeing some of that relative to ESG and fiduciary standards. But even with all that background, they -- we don't really see a substantive regulatory update relative to the things that are happening in our space. 
So 30e-3 is now live, and it's saving funds money. The comments are in for 498B, and those have been really supportive of the summary concept and -- but people are expressing concerns about drop and prospectuses. So it's not clear whether that will happen. 
There is a big push for moving to e-delivery, and that's something that we support, and it's really aligned with the idea of summary documents. And then there continues to be, as you raised this question around fees, ICI continues to push for a fee review and is talking about let's move it away from the NYSE, which the NYSE would like to move it away. 
At the same time, FINRA has responded saying they don't want it either as you go to the SEC, so I think there's going to be a lot of back and forth here. We do feel, wherever it ends up, it will be fine. We have a strong relationship with FINRA, a strong relationship with the New York Stock Exchange, a strong relationship with the SEC. And we really believe that when you look at fees, when you bring all parties to the table, not just the funds, but all parties and have good information that we'll get to a very good place on that. 
I think it's -- in terms of speculating on timing, I think it's going to be a long debate about who is the right place for it to do. And then if there were to be a review, as you know, the last one took several years to unfold."

It's just a -- it's a modest positive. 
With respect to 498B, it had a couple of components. There is a -- the most important component was really around moving some of the long-form communications to summary form. We think that would be good for the industry. We think it would be good for investors, and the economics of that are neutral to us. 
There was some conversation about dropping the annual prospectus. There was a lot of mixed commentary on that as the comments came back, so that seems less likely to us. As you recall in -- when we discussed this, I believe, in the summer call, what we said is the -- we saw potentially a downtick from the prospectus revenue, an uptick from the idea of us being able to create the summary documents for people and really provide an industry solution around that, and we saw those balancing each other.
If we're to proceed with the summaries, but not with the prospectus downtick, then that would be a plus, but I think this is going to be quite some time for it to unfold. The new administration is coming in. They have their own set of priorities. And so I think, really, the timing of this is highly uncertain at this stage."

And Michael, thank you for the question. Look, our capital allocation approach is -- has really not changed, and we believe there's almost unlimited opportunity for us to invest on behalf of our shareholders at really attractive rates of return. 
At the same time, we believe in the strong dividend. We don't let cash buildup. We only invest when we're confident we can execute well. So that's why you see these priorities around internal investment, dividends, M&A, share buyback in that order. 
We are definitely looking at M&A opportunities. We think that's an evergreen strategy for us to supplement our internal product development and bring more value to our clients. In this environment, prices are high, and it's unclear whether any of the opportunities that we're looking at will come through at prices that make sense to us. And we have been on the doorstep a couple of times this year and not been able to go through at a price that made sense for our shareholders.
So I think M&A is something we continue to really look at. There's uncertainty around it. At the same time, we won't let cash build up on our balance sheet. And so if we're not able to execute on M&A, you will see share buybacks.
I'd like to just ask Edmund to add on to that, if there's anything that I've missed, so just -- Edmund will add that up."

The 0 commission trading, I think you mentioned more retail investors coming in. I think that's good for Broadridge. In fact, they want to engage and interact digitally. So I think that's also a tailwind for Broadridge. And hopefully, that's stable going forward.
The newer things, the coordinated buying efforts, the SPACs, don't exactly -- yet know exactly how stable that is, and we're not counting on that as we look to our outlook going forward.

Two things I'd say about it. The higher performance on the revenue side and our ability to be able to get the efficiency gains, expand operating margins through the initiatives, which I'll touch on that we mentioned in Q1, is what allowed us to to make these investments. 
And so in Q1, we talked about -- roughly about $80 million in cost initiatives, real estate, cloud migration, product realignment, and I think we're well on track. You saw 150 basis points of margin expansion in the second quarter. And I think it's that efficiency that gives us the capacity to be able to make these investments. 
The second point I'll make, and then I'll turn it to Tim to see if he has anything, is that the investments has been a key part of the financial model in strategy for growth, a key part of our capital allocation program prior to my joining, and it's going to -- we're going to continue to remain committed to it to support the future growth. 
And I think we have -- Tim mentioned some of these, we have a number of high-returning investment opportunities, as we look across our post-trade platforms, our wealth management platforms. As we look across products and SRD II and VSM and, obviously, our people with our broader sales market strategies. These things help us with growth long term. Might be a little margin compression in the short term, but they help us with long-term growth. 
So this leadership team is going to stay committed to investing, using the efficiency gains that I just talked about and still delivering the steady and consistent earnings growth that we were able to post and guide to for the rest of this year."

I remarked on that, and that builds on a very nice year last year. And we're seeing very strong interest from our clients in terms of digital transformation and working with us to upgrade their infrastructure for digital communications.
I think I was a bit surprised to see the increase in distribution revenues this quarter, and that's not something that we generally expect. That was really due to increase in both regulatory and event communications. I think we continue to expect that, over the long run, that physical piece will be a smaller part of our business model, and the digital piece will be a bigger piece. 
Relative to adviser versus digital channels with the sector investing, I think we're just -- we're seeing both. We saw very good position growth across all of our broker-dealers, including both adviser and online. I think, perhaps in terms of number of investors we're seeing with this democratization, the new investors being on the digital side. But if you look at where the money is, it's still definitely on the adviser side. 
And those underlying trends that we've been talking about for the past couple of years, we don't see any change in terms of move to managed accounts, move to model-based investing. So we think that trend will continue. We do think there's an overlay of a new trend around democratization that will add and bring new investors in, which is why we highlighted the fact that with all these new investors, really, the need for strong disclosure is higher than ever."

I'll begin with an overview of our key messages and an update on our third quarter results, including our performance against our strategic objectives. Edmund will review our financial results, and then we'll take your questions. 
It's an exciting time to be at Broadridge, and we have a lot to cover, so let's get started. I'm pleased to share that Broadridge delivered strong third quarter results. Recurring revenues and adjusted operating income both rose 8%. Our results in both ICS and GTO are being propelled by long-term trends, including increasing digitization and mutualization and the democratization of investing. These trends are driving strong new business growth, record growth in the number of shareholders and higher trading volumes. We're also executing well against our strategic growth plan across governance, capital markets and wealth and investment management. I'll highlight some of those initiatives in a few minutes. 
A combination of those strong results and continued execution against our growth plans is giving us the confidence to continue to invest in our business. We've continued to fund attractive investments in our products, platforms and people, including the pending acquisition of Itiviti. We're also substantially increasing our guidance for fiscal year 2021 on both the top and bottom line. We now expect recurring revenue growth of 8% to 10% and adjusted EPS growth of 11% to 13%. While the new guidance reflects the impact of activity, the bulk of this raise is organic, as Edmund will discuss. The net result of all these points, our strong third quarter results, our continued internal and M&A investment and our outlook for fiscal 2021 is that Broadridge is executing well and is on track to deliver at the higher end of our 3-year financial objectives, including 8% to 12% adjusted EPS growth. We remain focused on delivering long-term growth driven by secular trends and consistent investment across our governance wealth and capital markets businesses and, in turn, generate consistent, sustainable top quartile shareholder returns. 
Broadridge's ability to generate those attractive returns is driven by executing on our clear long-term growth plan. So let me update you on some highlights of our recent progress on Slide 5. I'll start with ICS. Recurring revenues rose 11% to $586 million driven by revenue from new sales and very strong equity record growth. The biggest driver of ICS' strong growth was revenue from new sales, and I'm pleased to see the impact of recent investments on our results. 
Let me share 2 examples of our focus on product investment and strong execution are translating directly into increased revenue growth. The first is the shareholder rights directive too. Over the past 2 years, we've created a shareholder communications hub linking millions of investors across the EU and with hundreds of wealth managers, winning almost 300 new clients along the way. Now as we enter proxy season, we're starting to see those efforts translate into new revenues helping to drive 80-plus percent growth in our international proxy business. 
Virtual shareholder meetings continue to be a great example of product investment translating into new revenues. Over the past year, we've upgraded our VSM capabilities to include the latest in virtual meeting capabilities, including state-of-the-art video and audio technology, improved Q&A functionality, one-click shareholder authentication and seamless proxy voting. Those upgrades have helped retain our existing clients and have driven additional growth. We are now on pace to serve almost 1,900 virtual shareholder meetings this proxy season, up from 1,400 last spring. 
The second factor driving ICS was very strong equity record growth, which was 20% for the quarter. It's clear the move to reducing trading commissions has triggered a significant expansion in the number of market participants, which contributed to the increase in equity record growth. That strong growth has been broad-based across our broker clients that has been most pronounced at the online brokers. It has also been broad-based across issuers with 20% growth across both widely held stocks and those with more medium-sized shareholder bases. We did see large increases at a handful of names, including so-called stocks like GameStop. But those increases only contributed 1 point of the overall growth. 
Commission-free trading is the latest step in a long-term trend. It includes the rise of ETFs, lower trading costs across all participants and changes in investor interfaces that helps propel high single-digit equity and fund record growth over the past decade. Broadridge has invested to scale its capabilities to meet that rise in demand. increase the digitization of critical regulatory communications and ensure that both new and existing investors get the information they need to understand the risks and participate in the governance of their investments. Looking forward, we expect strong record growth to extend into the fourth quarter with our testing indicating 25% stock record growth for Q4. 
To close off on governance. Let me touch briefly on regulatory. I want to congratulate Commissioner Gensler on his confirmation as SEC Chairman. As we have with every chair and administration of both parties over the past 40 years, we look forward to assisting by investing in the next generation of technology to help the SEC achieve its mandate to better inform and protect investors all while reducing cost for registers and creating a fair return for our shareholders. 
Let's turn now to our capital markets franchise. Capital markets recurring revenues slipped by 1% as steady international growth was offset as expected by lower license revenues. We anticipate this period of flattish revenue to continue through the fourth quarter before picking up again in fiscal '22 as we onboard our very healthy backlog. On the strategic front, our planned acquisition of activity represents a significant enhancement of our ability to drive value to our clients. For those who may have missed our call a few weeks ago, let me remind you why we think this transaction is such an exciting step forward for our global capital markets franchise. 
As a leading provider of order management and trade execution technology and connectivity solutions for financial institutions, Itiviti gives Broadridge a compelling opportunity to extend our capital market service offering. The combination of Itiviti's front-office trading solutions with Broadridge's leading post-trade back-office capabilities will allow us to serve our client's entire trade life cycle from order to settlement. With increasing high frequency and algorithm trading, it's increasingly important to serve clients across traditional boundaries. This combination will bring critical data from the back to the front office to improve trading decisions, and it will enable our clients to simplify and improve their front-to-back technology stack and operating model. 
The combination also strengthens our joint capabilities across equities, exchange-traded derivatives and fixed income, and it substantially extends our global reach, creating significant cross-selling opportunities and enhancing our relationships with blue chip clients. The acquisition virtually doubles our business in APAC and further expands our reach in Europe. That expanded footprint and scale positions us to take advantage of growing mutualization trends in both EMEA and Asia. 
Itiviti adds more than $6 billion to Broadridge's total addressable market and will drive stronger growth margins and earnings, as Edmund will discuss in his remarks. Early feedback from our clients has been overwhelmingly positive, giving us added confidence that our front-to-back thesis and our near-term medium growth outlook are sound. 
Also of note in our capital markets franchise is the continued development of our LTX fixed income trading platform. LTX recently completed the first-ever multi-buyer digital block trading. Enabling a single seller to simultaneously access the aggregated liquidity for multiple buyers is a milestone for the fixed income market and I hope one of the many steps towards creating a more liquid corporate bond market. To date, 10 dealers and over 40 asset managers have joined the LTX platform. And an additional 14 institutions are signed in the onboarding process, including one of the world's largest fixed income managers. 
Let's turn next to our wealth and investment management business, where revenues grew by 7%, driven by new client additions and higher equity trading volumes. A key part of our growth strategy is to expand our sales of component solutions. So it's terrific to see new client onboardings across a full range of our wealth and investment management products. We also continue to make progress on building our industry-leading wealth management platform, which will help clients with the digital transformation of their wealth business. We're already live with our average daily balance billing solution and industry milestone. We're currently in active testing of our phone office workstation with select advisers, setting the stage for a period of extensive testing of the broader platform before going live. 
Our sales and marketing efforts with several new clients to this platform are advancing well. Clients see that using the Broadridge wealth platform to drive digitization by seamlessly connecting the back office functions we already provide with additional select front and middle office capabilities will drive a stronger top and bottom line by bringing new capabilities to advisers and clients while digitizing financial adviser, branch and back office interactions. 
Another important part of our wealth strategy is developing a robust partner network to ensure that we can integrate cutting-edge capabilities from innovative partners. Recent partnerships include -- for predictive analytics and [ corp bank ] for securities-based lending and a wealth management fintech accelerator. These partnerships and others represent ongoing steps in building a network that will enable our clients to rapidly adopt new technologies. 
Before I turn the call over to Edmond, I want to step back for a moment and reflect on how far we've come over the past year. When I spoke to you at the close of our fiscal third quarter a year ago, the economic outlook was deeply uncertain when the New York area and much of the world was locked down. My remarks at the time were focused on the steps we were taking to keep our associates safe and meet the needs of our clients in an unprecedented time. Today, after 12 long months, there remains significant challenges and, I'm thinking, in particular, of our more than 3,000 associates in India and of their families and friends. But the global outlook is unquestionably brighter, with increasing economic growth marching hand-in-hand with rising vaccination rates. 
The pandemic has also accelerated many long-term trends, including digitization, mutualization and next-generation resiliency. And the lower cost and friction for investing is bringing in millions of new investors. These changes are clearly having a significant impact across wealth management, governance and capital markets. They're causing financial services leaders to rapidly adopt next-generation technologies. And Broadridge is building the suite of capabilities that will help them navigate and win this period of change. 
We do so from a position of strength. We started the fiscal year last July expecting 2% to 6% recurring revenue growth and 4% to 10% adjusted EPS growth. Our focus then was on driving enough expense savings to assure that we could continue to fund critical growth investments. Fast forward 9 months, and we are poised to deliver 8% to 10% recurring revenue growth driven by a combination of strong new sales and healthy financial markets. After achieving our expense targets, we're now investing heavily in new product capabilities, enhancing our global post-trade platform and building next-generation capabilities across digital communications, wealth management and fixed income trading, among other investments. We're also adding talent and investing in our people to make Broadridge the best place for the most talented associates in our industry. 
Last but not least we're on the brink of closing our $2.5 billion acquisition of Itiviti, expanding our capital markets franchise and further strengthening our global footprint. And yet even after those investments and the near-term dilution from activity, we're positioned to deliver 11% to 13% adjusted EPS growth. Broadridge is at its front foot and leaning into the opportunities we see ahead. It has been a remarkable year. 
Looking further ahead, we're on track to achieve the higher end of our 3-year growth objectives driving strong recurring revenue and double-digit adjusted EPS growth. We see long-term trends continuing to drive demand for our services. And our investments are creating new avenues for growth long beyond our current 3-year objectives. The future of Broadridge is brighter than ever. In my 10 years at Broadridge, I've never been as confident about our long-term outlook as I am on this call today. 
Before I turn it over, I want to thank our associates. We've asked a lot of our team over the past 12 months, and they're delivering. They stayed focused on clients and through them are helping to build better financial lives for millions. Let me now turn the call over to Edmund for a more detailed financial review. Edmund?"

As you can see from the Q3 financial summary on Slide 7,  Broadridge delivered another strong quarter. Recurring revenue grew 8% to $900 million. Adjusted operating income also grew 8% to $284 million. Margins declined 60 basis points to 20.4% as we successfully made the investments that we discussed last quarter in our technology platforms, in our products, our people. Our operating income was partially offset by a higher tax rate in Q3 '21 as we grew over discrete tax benefits in Q3 '20. So our adjusted EPS grew to $1.76 in the quarter, up 5% over Q3 '20. 
Now let's turn the slide and get into the details of the quarter, starting with recurring revenue growth. As I said, recurring revenue grew 8% in the quarter powered by 7% organic growth and comfortably within our historic mid- to high single-digit growth performance. demonstrating the strength of our sustainable recurring revenue growth model. As a result of that strong organic growth and an increase in our outlook for the fourth quarter, we're raising our guidance for recurring revenue growth to 8% to 10% for the full year, up from our prior guidance of growth at the higher end of 3% to 6%. 
Now let's look at this quarter's recurring revenue growth by business on Slide 9. I'll start with our ICS segment, where revenues grew by 11% to $586 million. Regulatory revenues rose 20% to $290 million driven by the 20% equity record growth, higher mutual fund and ETF communications volumes and net new sales, including from our shareholder rights directive 2 solution that Tim highlighted earlier. We expect strong regulatory revenue growth to continue in the fourth quarter with our current testing indicating 25% equity record growth. Our issuer business also contributed to our overall growth rate, thanks to continued growth in VSMs and increased issuer communications. After a strong 12 months, we now have significant penetration of our VSM solution across the S&P 500, and we expect issuer revenue growth to ease going forward as we start to lap the increase of VSM activity that began in Q4 '20. 
Fund solutions revenue was flat. as double-digit growth in data and analytics was offset by lower interest income from custodied accounts in our funds processing business. Customer communications revenues were also flat with double-digit growth in our high-margin digital products offset by lower print volumes due in part to the pandemic-depressed activity levels. We expect growth in both our data-driven solutions and customer communications business to pick up in the fourth quarter as these headwinds ease. 
Turning to GTO. Wealth and investment management revenues rose 7% driven by the onboarding of new component sales and higher retail trading. Capital markets revenues fell 1% of strong growth from international sales, was offset by $6 million in lower license revenues, which declined as expected. As we said last quarter, this flat revenue growth will continue in the Q4 '21 before picking up in fiscal year '22. 
Let's turn to Page 10, where we show more detail on volume trends. Broadridge's recurring revenue growth benefits from underlying volume growth trends, including stock record growth, Over the past decade, record growth across equity, mutual funds and ETF has grown 6% to 8%. Recently, equity record growth has accelerated to 11% in Q4 '20 and continued to increase through the year to 20% in Q3 '21, surpassing the estimates from our January testing. As I said, we expect these growth trends to continue and reach 25% in Q4 '21. 
Mutual fund and ETF record growth picked up as well to 7%, more in line with our historical growth rates. We are modeling a return to more moderate mid-single-digit growth across both equity, mutual fund ETF records for fiscal year '22 with stronger growth in the seasonally smaller first half and more moderate growth in the second half. 
Touching briefly on trade volumes, which you'll see on the bottom of this slide. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of aggregate double-digit volume growth. This growth reflects the increase in volatility in retail investor engagement over the past year, which continued to be quite strong well into the third quarter. More recently, trading volatility subsided during the second half of March, and we expect tougher trading volume comps in Q4. 
Let's move to Slide 11 for a closer look at the drivers of our recurring revenue. Organic growth at a very healthy 7% continues to be the largest component of our recurring revenue growth, and new sales remains the biggest driver with strong growth contribution from both ICS and GTO. We also continued our long track record of revenue retention above 97%. Internal growth contributed another 3 points as growth in ICS regulatory volumes more than offset the decline in GTO license revenue. And finally, acquisitions. We've now fully lapped all of our fiscal year 2020 acquisitions. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect activity to add 3 points to fourth quarter recurring revenue growth. 
Now we'll turn to Slide 12 to briefly touch on our total revenue performance. Total revenue growth this quarter was stronger than usual, reaching 11% with distribution revenue contributing 3 points due to the increased mailings that correspond with the high record growth and the increased event-driven activity this quarter. Moving forward, we continue to expect the low to no margin distribution revenue to decline over time as we focus on increasing higher-margin digital revenue across our governance business. 
Event-driven communications remain an integral part of our client offering. Event-driven revenues have climbed over the past 4 quarters to be more in line with our historical norms of about $50 million a quarter and reached $74 million in the third quarter, well above last year's unusually low $39 million. Broadridge benefited from an increase in mutual fund proxy activity as well as a rebound in proxy contest volumes and capital markets transactions. We expect fiscal '21 event-driven revenue to be more in line with the average that we've seen over the past 7 years. For modeling purposes, we're assuming $50 million to $60 million of event-driven revenues in the fourth quarter. 
Turning to Slide 13. Adjusted operating income grew by 8%. Our adjusted operating income margin declined by 60 basis points, reflecting the continued investments that we're making in our technology platforms and product capabilities that we highlighted on our last quarterly call. These investments, which support our long-term growth, have a short-term impact on margin expansion, but we remain on track to deliver approximately 50 basis points of margin expansion for the full year. right in line with our fiscal year '21 guidance and 3-year growth objectives. This formula forgoing near-term margin expansion and consistently investing in our technology platforms and products to drive long-term sustainable recurring revenue growth will continue to be an important part of how we manage our business. As a CFO focused on long-term growth, it's encouraging to see us making these types of investments across all of our product lines, giving us momentum towards future growth. 
Before I turn to capital allocation, let's turn to Slide 14 and spend a moment on another key operating metric, closed sales, which, as I mentioned earlier, is the most consistent driver of our long-term recurring revenue growth. Our $124 million closed sales year-to-date are in line with our performance over the same period last year. We continue to see strong demand for our ICS solutions, including regulatory and issuer communications and data solutions. We remain on track to achieve our full year guidance of $190 million to $235 million for closed sales, which implies a fourth quarter range of $66 million to $111 million. Historically, the closed sales performance in the last quarter of the year has been impacted by the timing of larger deals. A handful of larger signings could propel us to the top end of our guidance range, and conversely, delays could put us at the lower end. And I'll also note that we continue to feel good about our recurring revenue backlog, which was 12% of our fiscal '20 recurring revenues as of Q4 '20 and gives us great visibility into our top line growth. 
Moving to capital allocation on the following slide. We generated $136 million of free cash flow year-to-date, up $54 million over the first 9 months of fiscal year '20 driven by higher earnings and strong working capital management. During the first 9 months of the fiscal year, we invested $205 million in building out our industry platforms and another $71 million in CapEx and software spending. Our M&A investment through the first 9 months of the year was 0, but that will change with our $2.5 billion acquisition of Itiviti which I'll touch on in a moment. Even after completing the Itiviti acquisition, Broadridge will remain committed to a balanced capital allocation policy. which prioritizes internal investment, growing our dividend, M&A and returning excess capital to shareholders. Importantly, we are also committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit rating, which means we'll prioritize debt paydown over share repurchases and expect to limit ourselves to smaller tuck-in M&A opportunities over the next several quarters. Given our strong free cash flow, we believe that we can comfortably achieve our new 2.5x leverage target by the end of fiscal year '23. Turning to capital returns on the right-hand side of the slide, our dividend has grown and remains in line with our historical 45% payout ratio. 
On Slide 16, we are on track to close the activity acquisition in the coming weeks. So let me take a moment to give you some additional clarity about the expected impact that Itiviti will have on our financial performance. I'll start with fiscal year '21. We expect Itiviti to add $25 billion to $30 billion or 1 point to our full year recurring revenue growth, which equates to 3 points to our fourth quarter growth. And the acquisition is expected to be modestly dilutive to our adjusted EPS growth. In fiscal year '22, we expect Itiviti to add approximately $250 million or about 8 points to our recurring revenue growth. And we expect the acquisition to be accretive by approximately 2 to 3 points or roughly $0.10 to $0.15 to adjusted EPS growth. Please note that Itiviti's results in both fiscal year '21 and fiscal year '22 will be negatively impacted by the accounting treatment of acquired revenue, which will reduce revenue recognition by approximately $30 million in total with 2/3 of that impact in fiscal '22. This revenue haircut is incorporated in the numbers that I just shared with you. 
Finally, I want to reiterate the commentary that I gave you when we announced the deal, about the impact on our 3-year growth objectives. We expect Itiviti to add 2.5 to 3 points to our 3-year recurring revenue growth CAGR and, after interest, more than 2 points to our 3-year adjusted EPS CAGR. 
Now turning to guidance on Slide 17. We are raising our outlook for fiscal '21 recurring revenue growth to 8% to 10% from the higher end of 3% to 6%, and that includes one point of growth from Itiviti. We are raising our guidance for total revenue growth to 8% to 10% from the higher end of 1% to 4%. We continue to expect our adjusted operating income margin to expand to approximately 18%, up from 17.5% in fiscal year '20 as we balance near-term returns with continued investments to sustain long-term growth. We expect adjusted EPS growth of 11% to 13%, up from the higher end of 6% to 10%, and that includes a 1-point drag from Itiviti. Finally, as I noted earlier, we continue to expect closed sales in the range of $190 million to $235 million. 
And before we begin to take your questions, let me share some final thoughts. The Broadridge Financial model is working. We are on track to deliver strong 8% to 10% recurring revenue growth. That growth is fueling our ability to both invest and expand margins. At the same time, our strong free cash flow business model enables us to pursue balanced capital allocation, commit to a rising dividend, fund investments in our platform and products and step up and make a significant M&A investment to grow our capital markets franchise. And finally, thanks to our consistent investment in our capabilities, we are on track to deliver another year of $190 million plus of new closed sales, which, combined with our strong backlog, positions us well for additional recurring revenue growth. The end result is that we're on track to deliver at the higher end of our 3-year financial objectives of 7% to 9% recurring revenue growth and 8% to 12% adjusted EPS growth. It's a great example of how we manage our business to drive sustainable revenue growth, steady and consistent adjusted EPS growth and historically top quartile TSR.

It's a bit more cyclical, but it's an important part of our total offering. It's high-quality revenue at -- it's a strong margin in that business. And as you mentioned, Q3 has continued to increase and go back to our historical norms. We've done about -- on average, about $50 million a quarter. You've seen pickup in mutual fund proxy business and contests and capital markets. It's not unusual to see us have an unusually high quarter or an unusually low quarter. But over the long term, I do expect event-driven revenue to pick up and grow in line with stock record growth. 
So during the Investor Day, I came out and said that we've seen 14 years ago, event-driven revenues average for the first 7 years, $180 million. Over the last 7 years, it's been above $200 million. And I feel comfortable that we should anchor in the full year number for event-driven revenue, and we expect it to be at that level as we look throughout our objectives in the '22 and '23 and, again, at reasonably strong margins in that business."

And Tim, you might have some commentary on the business itself. And we were thinking -- when we were bringing  Itiviti on, first, we were looking for very strong assets in the capital market space after deploying most of our M&A to wealth management and governance over the past 3 years. And the thing that looks great from a financial standpoint for Itiviti is the strong growth outlook. The core business by itself is mid-single-digit growth from a revenue standpoint. I talked earlier that we committed to about $20 million in synergies by 2025 in that business. So you should see high single-digit growth in that business. The recurring revenue models are predictable. They're subscription-like revenues, healthy operating margins in that business. And I think it's a great time to finance it in this low interest rate environment. I also said that we expect because of that profile to get to double-digit IRRs in this business. So I think we'll focus on integrating it, but I do expect it to have that high single-digit revenue growth at 30% margin, so a strong return over a very long time for us in that business.

So just specifically on fiscal '22 for a moment, we said we expect it to add approximately $250 million in revenue, and that does include the purchase accounting of about $30 million. I mentioned that about 2/3 of that is in fiscal '22. The other 1/3 is this year in fiscal '21 impacting the revenues that we expect over the next 2 months. That will be about 8 points to the recurring revenue growth in fiscal year '22 and, as I mentioned, about 2 to 3 points to the adjusted EPS growth. And so you can expect growth on that revenue fully in the fiscal year '23 without any further impact from the accounting adjustment that I was just talking about. So we feel good about the contribution that it will make as we end the '23, as Tim said a moment ago, helping propel us to the top end of our range. 
I'll also add, Chris, when we gave the 3-year objectives, we talked about 5% to 7% organic recurring revenue growth. And we talked about 1 to 2 points from M&A and acquisition, and Itiviti makes -- I think that's what makes us feel good about the objectives is that  Itiviti comes on and adds this type of contribution, putting us at the higher end of those 3-year objectives."

Opportunity two, we have a much stronger position in North America. And so the opportunity to help them better penetrate North America is opportunity two. And so those are sort of the geographic opportunities. And then we have the asset class opportunities, and they have a very strong position in exchange-traded derivatives, and that's a more nascent area for us. And so we expect that combined offer to be very interesting. And we have a very strong position in fixed income, and they have a building position in fixed income. And so that's another attractive area. So we think that between the geographic cross-sell and the asset class cross-sell, that there's a really nice degree of revenue synergy built into this. And that, as you know, most of the things that we do, we do really for revenue growth. We're not a buy this slow-growing thing and cut costs and then going to the next one.

So I think the milestones that we were excited about on LTX and why we continue to talk about it were the patent we received on the best execution protocol which really allows aggregation across buyers and sellers, the first execution of an aggregated trade, which is a real milestone and so important because the electronification of trading, as you know, has been a little slower in fixed income and really hasn't penetrated the larger trades, which are the important ones. And so that aggregation capability, we think, really will help unlock the digitization of fixed income.

But again, I'll reiterate that we remain committed to being able to drive adjusted operating margin to the tune of 50 basis points for the year, and I think we'll still be able to do that. But it does include organic investments. I think about them across our technology platforms, Tim mentioned in his earlier remarks across post-trade, across wealth management and our infrastructure. As you think about the network resiliency that we've had over the past few quarters where we've seen record trade volume growth, I would say that organic investment into our infrastructure and technology platforms are starting to pay dividends. You see it in our products as well. 
Tim earlier talked about the VSM solutions and the SRD solutions within that regulatory business growth. You saw 28% growth benefiting from the investments that we've been making in those solutions. And I almost added on to his comments about LTX where we have continued investments there. And as we think about our 3-year outlooks, no revenue associated with that. So that's an opportunity for us as well. 
And then the final thing I'd say, Patrick, is investments in our go-to-market and sales organizations, particularly as we think about expanding internationally, focusing on our premium accounts.

When you think about our GTO business, we show that chart that breaks it up between capital markets and wealth management.

And that was primarily -- you saw that benefit come through in the capital markets business, and we said that would be a tough comp. As we came into this quarter, so in the capital markets business, you had sort of a harder comp on trading volume and the license revenue impact that brought it to flattish revenue, the trading volumes that you saw, the continued growth, I mentioned, the fifth consecutive quarter of growth was primarily retail trading, and you saw the 7% growth in the wealth Management business is the item that was benefiting from that. So you have this tale of 2 cities in our GTO business right now with capital markets coming over higher comps, facing the lower license revenue that I'll remind you was a grow over an issue, an uptick in Q3 '20 revenues, but wealth management seeing the benefit of the trade volumes that we saw this quarter."

And we certainly stand ready to assist and to play the role that we play. I think it's too soon to tell if that's a business opportunity, but it certainly appears to be an area of focus. 
I think the other questions are really around the initiatives from the previous administration and the extent to which they will continue or not. There's a lot of conversation about end-to-end vote confirmation. We're hearing that could remain an area of focus, and that's certainly something that we've been a supporter of. We shared with the SEC the result of a successful pilot that we've done with the top 100 issuers showing how that can work. On virtual shareholder meetings, there have been discussions about making the beneficial voting available to all providers, which we've done this season via APIs, universal proxy as an area we support and we stand ready to help there's a working group that recommended changes there. There were discussions about OBO NOBO and a working group that really isn't making a recommendation. And then there's a whole conversation around streamlined communications in funds, which we're focused with the previous SEC is unclear. That's going to be a focus for the new leadership, but we support the recommendations, and we'll continue to work to strengthen the industry for the long term. So lots of different things that were on the agenda that are a little less clear in terms of what their forward momentum is. Certainly, the new things we hear about relate to ESG."

And what we're looking at as we look into the fourth quarter is -- and we do have a fair bit of visibility at this stage into what's going to happen in the fourth quarter because there's a lag between when the records come together and when they go out. So we have testing, but we have good visibility. What I'd say is just -- what we're seeing is very, very broad-based growth. We're seeing it across all different types of issuers. We're seeing it across all different types of broker-dealers, although stronger in online broker-dealers. We're seeing it across industries and we're seeing it across both managed accounts and other accounts and it's not just focused on mean stock. So like a lot of the things that you've been reading in other places in the press this rise in equity holdings and rise in participation in the market is very significant. We're also seeing to a less degree but good interim record growth, which is driven by stronger inflows and healthy markets. So we're seeing very strong Q4. We often get asked about when the market changes or if the market changes what would be the impact of that. And we have -- we've done a lot of work going back over the last 25 years of history and events like '99 and '09 and even last spring. And what that would really tell us is that growth flattens, could be slightly negative, but that equity investors tend to stay invested and it is -- sort of reaches a new plateau. So we do think that these levels of holdership are sustainable. We're not modeling the same level of growth in the future, clearly. But we see a return to sort of more sort of normalized growth in the future."

I'll begin with an overview of our key messages and an update on our third quarter results, including our performance against our strategic objectives. Edmund will review our financial results, and then we'll take your questions.  
It's an exciting time to be at Broadridge, and we have a lot to cover, so let's get started. I'm pleased to share that Broadridge delivered strong third quarter results. Recurring revenues and adjusted operating income both rose 8%. Our results in both ICS and GTO are being propelled by long-term trends, including increasing digitization, mutualization and the democratization of investing. These trends are driving strong new business growth, record growth in the number of shareholders and higher trading volumes. We're also executing well against our strategic growth plan across governance, capital markets and wealth and investment management. I'll highlight some of those initiatives in a few minutes.  
A combination of those strong results and continued execution against our growth plans is giving us the confidence to continue to invest in our business. We've continued to fund attractive investments in our products, platforms and people, including the pending acquisition of Itiviti. We're also substantially increasing our guidance for fiscal year 2021 on both the top and bottom line. We now expect recurring revenue growth of 8% to 10% and adjusted EPS growth of 11% to 13%. While the new guidance reflects the impact of Itiviti, the bulk of this raise is organic, as Edmund will discuss. The net result of all these points, our strong third quarter results, our continued internal and M&A investment and our outlook for fiscal 2021 is that Broadridge is executing well and is on track to deliver at the higher end of our 3-year financial objectives, including 8% to 12% adjusted EPS growth.  
We remain focused on delivering long-term growth driven by secular trends and consistent investment across our governance wealth and capital markets businesses and, in turn, generate consistent, sustainable top quartile shareholder returns.  
Broadridge's ability to generate those attractive returns is driven by executing on our clear long-term growth plan. So let me update you on some highlights of our recent progress on Slide 5. I'll start with ICS. Recurring revenues rose 11% to $586 million driven by revenue from new sales and very strong equity record growth. The biggest driver of ICS' strong growth was revenue from new sales, and I'm pleased to see the impact of recent investments on our results.  
Let me share 2 examples of our focus on product investment and strong execution are translating directly into increased revenue growth. The first is the Shareholder Rights Directive II. Over the past 2 years, we've created a shareholder communications hub, linking millions of investors across the EU and with hundreds of wealth managers, winning almost 300 new clients along the way. Now as we enter proxy season, we're starting to see those efforts translate into new revenues helping to drive 80-plus percent growth in our international proxy business.  
Virtual shareholder meetings continue to be a great example of product investment translating into new revenues. Over the past year, we've upgraded our VSM capabilities to include the latest in virtual meeting capabilities, including state-of-the-art video and audio technology, improved Q&A functionality, one-click shareholder authentication and seamless proxy voting. Those upgrades have helped retain our existing clients and have driven additional growth. We are now on pace to serve almost 1,900 virtual shareholder meetings this proxy season, up from 1,400 last spring.  
The second factor driving ICS was very strong equity record growth, which was 20% for the quarter. It's clear, the move to reducing trading commissions has triggered a significant expansion in the number of market participants, which contributed to the increase in equity record growth. That strong growth has been broad-based across our broker clients but has been most pronounced at the online brokers. It has also been broad-based across issuers with 20% growth across both widely held stocks and those with more medium-sized shareholder bases. We did see large increases at a handful of names, including so-called meme stocks like GameStop. But those increases only contributed 1 point of the overall growth.  
Commission-free trading is the latest step in a long-term trend. It includes the rise of ETFs, lower trading costs across all participants and changes in investor interfaces that helps propel high single-digit equity and fund record growth over the past decade. Broadridge has invested to scale its capabilities to meet that rise in demand, increase the digitization of critical regulatory communications and ensure that both new and existing investors get the information they need to understand the risks and participate in the governance of their investments. Looking forward, we expect strong record growth to extend into the fourth quarter with our testing indicating 25% stock record growth for Q4.  
To close off on governance. Let me touch briefly on regulatory. I want to congratulate Commissioner Gensler on his confirmation as SEC Chairman. As we have with every chair and administration of both parties over the past 40 years, we look forward to assisting by investing in the next generation of technology, to help the SEC achieve its mandate to better inform and protect investors, all while reducing cost for registers and creating a fair return for our shareholders.  
Let's turn now to our capital markets franchise. Capital markets' recurring revenues slipped by 1% as steady international growth was offset as expected by lower license revenues. We anticipate this period of flattish revenue to continue through the fourth quarter before picking up again in fiscal '22 as we onboard our very healthy backlog. On the strategic front, our planned acquisition of activity represent a significant enhancement of our ability to drive value to our clients. For those who may have missed our call a few weeks ago, let me remind you why we think this transaction is such an exciting step forward for our global capital markets franchise.  
As a leading provider of order management and trade execution technology and connectivity solutions for financial institutions, Itiviti gives Broadridge a compelling opportunity to extend our capital market service offering. The combination of Itiviti's front-office trading solutions, with Broadridge's leading post-trade back-office capabilities, will allow us to serve our client's entire trade life cycle from order to settlement. With increasing high frequency and algorithm trading, it's increasingly important to serve clients across traditional boundaries. This combination will bring critical data from the back to the front office to improve trading decisions, and it will enable our clients to simplify and improve their front-to-back technology stack and operating model.  
The combination also strengthens our joint capabilities across equities, exchange-traded derivatives and fixed income, and it substantially extends our global reach, creating significant cross-selling opportunities and enhancing our relationships with blue chip clients. The acquisition virtually doubles our business in APAC and further expands our reach in Europe. That expanded footprint and scale positions us to take advantage of growing mutualization trends in both EMEA and Asia.  
Itiviti adds more than $6 billion to Broadridge's total addressable market and will drive stronger growth, margins and earnings, as Edmund will discuss in his remarks. Early feedback from our clients has been overwhelmingly positive, giving us added confidence that our front-to-back thesis and our near-term medium growth outlook are sound.  
Also of note in our capital markets franchise is the continued development of our LTX fixed income trading platform. LTX recently completed the first-ever multi-buyer digital block trading. Enabling a single seller to simultaneously access the aggregated liquidity for multiple buyers is a milestone for the fixed income market, and I hope one of the many steps towards creating a more liquid corporate bond market. To date, 10 dealers and over 40 asset managers have joined the LTX platform. And an additional 14 institutions are signed in the onboarding process, including one of the world's largest fixed income managers.  
Let's turn next to our wealth and investment management business, where revenues grew by 7%, driven by new client additions and higher equity trading volumes. A key part of our growth strategy is to expand our sales of component solutions. So it's terrific to see new client onboardings across a full range of our wealth and investment management products. We also continue to make progress on building our industry-leading wealth management platform, which will help clients with the digital transformation of their wealth business. We're already live with our average daily balance billing solution and industry milestone. We're currently in active testing of our phone office workstation with select advisers, setting the stage for a period of extensive testing of the broader platform before going live.  
Our sales and marketing efforts with several new clients to this platform are advancing well. Clients see that using the Broadridge wealth platform to drive digitization by seamlessly connecting the back office functions we already provide, with additional select front and middle office capabilities, will drive a stronger top and bottom line by bringing new capabilities to advisers and clients while digitizing financial adviser, branch and back office interactions.  
Another important part of our wealth strategy is developing a robust partner network to ensure that we can integrate cutting-edge capabilities from innovative partners. Recent partnerships include Fligoo for predictive analytics and [ Anchor Bank ] for securities-based lending; and [indiscernible], a wealth management fintech accelerator. These partnerships and others represent ongoing steps in building a network that will enable our clients to rapidly adopt new technologies.  
Before I turn the call over to Edmund, I want to step back for a moment and reflect at how far we've come over the past year. When I spoke to you at the close of our fiscal third quarter a year ago, the economic outlook was deeply uncertain and from the New York area and much of the world was locked down. My remarks at that time were focused on the steps we were taking to keep our associates safe and meet the needs of our clients in an unprecedented time. Today, after 12 long months, there remains significant challenges and thinking, in particular, of our more than 3,000 associates in India and of their families and friends. But the global outlook is unquestionably brighter, with increasing economic growth marching, hand-in-hand with rising vaccination rates.  
The pandemic has also accelerated many long-term trends, including digitization, mutualization and next-generation resiliency. And the lower cost and friction for investing is bringing in millions of new investors. These changes are clearly having a significant impact across wealth management, governance and capital markets. They're causing financial services leaders to rapidly adopt next-generation technologies. And Broadridge is building the suite of capabilities that will help them navigate and win this period of change.  
We do so from a position of strength. We started the fiscal year last July expecting 2% to 6% recurring revenue growth and 4% to 10% adjusted EPS growth. Our focus then was on driving enough expense savings to assure that we could continue to fund critical growth investments. Fast forward 9 months, and we are poised to deliver 8% to 10% recurring revenue growth, driven by a combination of strong new sales and healthy financial markets. After achieving our expense targets, we're now investing heavily in new product capabilities, enhancing our global post-trade platform and building next-generation capabilities across digital communications, wealth management and fixed income trading, among other investments. We're also adding talent and investing in our people to make Broadridge the best place for the most talented associates in our industry.  
Last but not least, we're on the brink of closing our $2.5 billion acquisition of Itiviti, expanding our capital markets franchise and further strengthening our global footprint. And yet even after those investments and the near-term dilution from Itiviti, we're positioned to deliver 11% to 13% adjusted EPS growth. Broadridge is at its front foot and leaning into the opportunities we see ahead. It has been a remarkable year.  
Looking further ahead, we're on track to achieve the higher end of our 3-year growth objectives, driving strong recurring revenue and double-digit adjusted EPS growth. We see long-term trends continuing to drive demand for our services. And our investments are creating new avenues for growth long beyond our current 2-year objectives. The future of Broadridge is brighter than ever. In my 10 years at Broadridge, I've never been as confident about our long-term outlook as I am on this call today.  
Before I turn it over, I want to thank our associates. We've asked a lot of our team over the past 12 months, and they're delivering. They stayed focused on clients, and through them are helping to build better financial lives for millions. Let me now turn the call over to Edmund for a more detailed financial review. Edmund?"

As you can see from the Q3 financial summary on Slide 7,  Broadridge delivered another strong quarter. Recurring revenue grew 8% to $900 million. Adjusted operating income also grew 8% to $284 million. Margins declined 60 basis points to 20.4% as we successfully made the investments that we discussed last quarter in our technology platforms, in our products, our people. Our operating income was partially offset by a higher tax rate in Q3 '21 as we grew over discrete tax benefits in Q3 '20. So our adjusted EPS grew to $1.76 in the quarter, up 5% over Q3 '20.  
Now let's turn the slide and get into the details of the quarter, starting with recurring revenue growth. As I said, recurring revenue grew 8% in the quarter, powered by 7% organic growth, and comfortably within our historic mid- to high single-digit growth performance. demonstrating the strength of our sustainable recurring revenue growth model. As a result of that strong organic growth and an increase in our outlook for the fourth quarter, we're raising our guidance for recurring revenue growth to 8% to 10% for the full year, up from our prior guidance of growth at the higher end of 3% to 6%.  
Now let's look at this quarter's recurring revenue growth by business on Slide 9. I'll start with our ICS segment, where revenues grew by 11% to $586 million. Regulatory revenues rose 20% to $290 million driven by the 20% equity record growth, higher mutual fund and ETF communications volumes and net new sales, including from our Shareholder Rights Directive II solution that Tim highlighted earlier. We expect strong regulatory revenue growth to continue in the fourth quarter with, our current testing indicating 25% equity record growth. 
Our Issuer business also contributed to our overall growth rate, thanks to continued growth in VSMs and increased issuer communications. After a strong 12 months, we now have significant penetration of our VSM solution across the S&P 500, and we expect issuer revenue growth to ease going forward as we start to lap the increase of VSM activity that began in Q4 '20.  
Fund solutions revenue was flat as double-digit growth in data and analytics was offset by lower interest income from custodied accounts in our funds processing business. Customer communications revenues were also flat with double-digit growth in our high-margin digital products, offset by lower print volumes due in part to the pandemic-depressed activity levels. We expect growth in both our data-driven solutions and customer communications business to pick up in the fourth quarter as these headwinds ease.  
Turning to GTO. Wealth and investment management revenues rose 7%, driven by the onboarding of new component sales and higher retail trading. Capital markets revenues fell 1% of strong growth from international sales, was offset by $6 million in lower license revenues, which declined as expected. As we said last quarter, this flat revenue growth will continue in the Q4 '21 before picking up in fiscal year '22.  
Let's turn to Page 10, where we show more detail on volume trends. Broadridge's recurring revenue growth benefits from underlying volume growth trends, including stock record growth. Over the past decade, record growth across equity, mutual funds and ETF has grown 6% to 8%. Recently, equity record growth has accelerated to 11% in Q4 '20 and continued to increase through the year to 20% in Q3 '21, surpassing the estimates from our January testing. As I said, we expect these growth trends to continue and reach 25% in Q4 '21. 
Mutual fund and ETF record growth picked up as well to 7%, more in line with our historical growth rates. We are modeling a return to more moderate mid-single-digit growth across both equity, mutual fund ETF records for fiscal year '22, with stronger growth in the seasonally smaller first half and more moderate growth in the second half.  
Touching briefly on trade volumes, which you'll see on the bottom of this slide. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of aggregate double-digit volume growth. This growth reflects the increase in volatility in retail investor engagement over the past year, which continued to be quite strong well into the third quarter. More recently, trading volatility subsided during the second half of March, and we expect tougher trading volume comps in Q4.  
Let's move to Slide 11 for a closer look at the drivers of our recurring revenue. Organic growth at a very healthy 7% continues to be the largest component of our recurring revenue growth, and new sales remains the biggest driver with strong growth contribution from both ICS and GTO. We also continued our long track record of revenue retention above 97%. Internal growth contributed another 3 points as growth in ICS regulatory volumes more than offset the decline in GTO license revenue. And finally, acquisitions. We've now fully lapped all of our fiscal year 2020 acquisitions. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect Itiviti to add 3 points to fourth quarter recurring revenue growth.  
Now we'll turn to Slide 12 to briefly touch on our total revenue performance. Total revenue growth this quarter was stronger than usual, reaching 11%, with distribution revenue contributing 3 points due to the increased mailings that correspond with the high record growth and the increased event-driven activity this quarter. Moving forward, we continue to expect the low to no-margin distribution revenue to decline over time as we focus on increasing higher-margin digital revenue across our governance business.  
Event-driven communications remain an integral part of our client offering. Event-driven revenues have climbed over the past 4 quarters to be more in line with our historical norms of about $50 million a quarter and reached $74 million in the third quarter, well above last year's unusually low $39 million. Broadridge benefited from an increase in mutual fund proxy activity as well as a rebound in proxy contest volumes and capital markets transactions. We expect fiscal '21 event-driven revenue to be more in line with the average that we've seen over the past 7 years. For modeling purposes, we're assuming $50 million to $60 million of event-driven revenues in the fourth quarter.  
Turning to Slide 13. Adjusted operating income grew by 8%. Our adjusted operating income margin declined by 60 basis points, reflecting the continued investments that we're making in our technology platforms and product capabilities that we highlighted on our last quarterly call. These investments, which support our long-term growth, have a short-term impact on margin expansion, but we remain on track to deliver approximately 50 basis points of margin expansion for the full year, right in line with our fiscal year '21 guidance and 3-year growth objectives. This formula, forgoing near-term margin expansion and consistently investing in our technology platforms and products to drive long-term sustainable recurring revenue growth, will continue to be an important part of how we manage our business. As a CFO focused on long-term growth, it's encouraging to see us making these types of investments across all of our product lines, giving us momentum towards future growth.  
Before I turn to capital allocation, let's turn to Slide 14 and spend a moment on another key operating metric, closed sales, which, as I mentioned earlier, is the most consistent driver of our long-term recurring revenue growth. Our $124 million closed sales year-to-date are in line with our performance over the same period last year. We continue to see strong demand for our ICS solutions, including regulatory and issuer communications and data solutions. 
We remain on track to achieve our full year guidance of $190 million to $235 million for closed sales, which implies a fourth quarter range of $66 million to $111 million. Historically, the closed sales performance in the last quarter of the year has been impacted by the timing of larger deals. A handful of larger signings could propel us to the top end of our guidance range, and conversely, delays could put us at the lower end. And I'll also note that we continue to feel good about our recurring revenue backlog, which was 12% of our fiscal '20 recurring revenues as of Q4 '20 and gives us great visibility into our top line growth.  
Moving to capital allocation on the following slide. We generated $136 million of free cash flow year-to-date, up $54 million over the first 9 months of fiscal year '20 driven by higher earnings and strong working capital management. During the first 9 months of the fiscal year, we invested $205 million in building out our industry platforms and another $71 million in CapEx and software spending. Our M&A investment through the first 9 months of the year was 0, but that will change with our announced $2.5 billion acquisition of Itiviti, which I'll touch on in a moment. Even after completing the Itiviti acquisition, Broadridge will remain committed to a balanced capital allocation policy, which prioritizes internal investment, growing our dividend, M&A and returning excess capital to shareholders. 
Importantly, we are also committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit rating, which means we'll prioritize debt paydown over share repurchases and expect to limit ourselves to smaller tuck-in M&A opportunities over the next several quarters. Given our strong free cash flow, we believe that we can comfortably achieve our new 2.5x leverage target by the end of fiscal year '23. Turning to capital returns on the right-hand side of the slide, our dividend has grown and remains in line with our historical 45% payout ratio.  
On Slide 16, we are on track to close the Itiviti acquisition in the coming weeks. So let me take a moment to give you some additional clarity about the expected impact that Itiviti will have on our financial performance. I'll start with fiscal year '21. We expect Itiviti to add $25 billion to $30 billion or 1 point to our full year recurring revenue growth, which equates to 3 points to our fourth quarter growth. And the acquisition is expected to be modestly dilutive to our adjusted EPS growth. In fiscal year '22, we expect Itiviti to add approximately $250 million or about 8 points to our recurring revenue growth. And we expect the acquisition to be accretive by approximately 2 to 3 points or roughly $0.10 to $0.15 to adjusted EPS growth. Please note that Itiviti's results in both fiscal year '21 and fiscal year '22 will be negatively impacted by the accounting treatment of acquired revenue, which will reduce revenue recognition by approximately $30 million in total with 2/3 of that impact in fiscal '22. This revenue haircut is incorporated in the numbers that I just shared with you.  
Finally, I want to reiterate the commentary that I gave you when we announced the deal, about the impact on our 3-year growth objectives. We expect Itiviti to add 2.5 to 3 points to our 3-year recurring revenue growth CAGR and, after interest, more than 2 points to our 3-year adjusted EPS CAGR.  
Now turning to guidance on Slide 17. We are raising our outlook for fiscal '21 recurring revenue growth to 8% to 10% from the higher end of 3% to 6%, and that includes one point of growth from Itiviti. We are raising our guidance for total revenue growth to 8% to 10% from the higher end of 1% to 4%. We continue to expect our adjusted operating income margin to expand to approximately 18%, up from 17.5% in fiscal year '20 as we balance near-term returns with continued investments to sustain long-term growth. We expect adjusted EPS growth of 11% to 13%, up from the higher end of 6% to 10%, and that includes a 1-point drag from Itiviti.  
Finally, as I noted earlier, we continue to expect closed sales in the range of $190 million to $235 million. And before we begin to take your questions, let me share some final thoughts. The Broadridge Financial model is working. We are on track to deliver strong 8% to 10% recurring revenue growth. That growth is fueling our ability to both invest and expand margins. At the same time, our strong free cash flow business model enables us to pursue balanced capital allocation, commit to a rising dividend, fund investments in our platform and products and step up and make a significant M&A investment to grow our capital markets franchise. And finally, thanks to our consistent investment in our capabilities, we are on track to deliver another year of $190 million plus of new closed sales, which, combined with our strong backlog, positions us well for additional recurring revenue growth. The end result is that we're on track to deliver at the higher end of our 3-year financial objectives of 7% to 9% recurring revenue growth and 8% to 12% adjusted EPS growth. It's a great example of how we manage our business to drive sustainable revenue growth, steady and consistent adjusted EPS growth and historically top quartile TSR.

And as you mentioned, Q3 has continued to increase and go back to our historical norms. We've done about -- on average, about $50 million a quarter. You've seen pickup in mutual fund proxy business and contests in capital markets. It's not unusual to see us have an unusually high quarter or an unusually low quarter. But over the long term, I do expect event-driven revenue to pick up and grow in line with stock record growth. 
So during the Investor Day, I came out and said that we've seen 14 years ago, event-driven revenues average for the first 7 years, $180 million. Over the last 7 years, it's been above $200 million. And I feel comfortable that we should anchor in the full year number for event-driven revenue, and we expect it to be at that level as we look throughout our objectives in the '22 and '23 and, again, at reasonably strong margins in that business."

And Tim, you might have some commentary on the business itself. And we were thinking -- when we were bringing  Itiviti on, first, we were looking for very strong assets in the capital market space after deploying most of our M&A to wealth management and governance over the past 3 years. And the thing that looks great from a financial standpoint for Itiviti is the strong growth outlook. The core business by itself is mid-single-digit growth from a revenue standpoint. 
I talked earlier that we committed to about $20 million in synergies by 2025 in that business. So you should see high single-digit growth in that business. The recurring revenue models are predictable. They're subscription-like revenues, healthy operating margins in that business. And I think that's a great time to finance it in this low interest rate environment. I also said that we expect, because of that profile, to get to double-digit IRRs in this business. So I think we'll focus on integrating it, but I do expect it to have that high single-digit revenue growth at 30% margin, so a strong return over a very long time for us in that business.

I mentioned that about 2/3 of that is in fiscal '22, the other 1/3 is this year in fiscal '21 impacting the revenues that we expect over the next 2 months. 
That will be about 8 points to the recurring revenue growth in fiscal year '22 and, as I mentioned, about 2 to 3 points to the adjusted EPS growth. And so you can expect growth on that revenue fully in the fiscal year '23 without any further impact from the accounting adjustment that I was just talking about. So we feel good about the contribution that it will make as we end the '23, as Tim said a moment ago, helping propel us to the top end of our range. 
I'll also add, Chris, when we gave the 3-year objectives, we talked about 5% to 7% organic recurring revenue growth.

The first execution of an aggregated trade, which is a real milestone and so important because the electronification of trading, as you know, has been a little slower in fixed income and really hasn't penetrated the larger trades, which are the important ones.

And so it really increased the efficiency for the salesperson and allows them to serve their clients a lot better. So that AI piece, even independent of the marketplace, has real value. And so I think it really makes us some very interesting conversations."

But again, I'll reiterate that we remain committed to being able to drive adjusted operating margin to the tune of 50 basis points for the year, and I think we'll still be able to do that. But it does include organic investments. 
I think about them across our technology platforms, Tim mentioned in his earlier remarks across post-trade, across wealth management and our infrastructure. As you think about the network resiliency that we've had over the past few quarters where we've seen record trade volume growth, I would say that organic investment into our infrastructure and technology platforms are starting to pay dividends. You see it in our products as well. 
Tim earlier talked about the VSM solutions and the SRD solutions within that regulatory business growth. You saw 28% growth benefiting from the investments that we've been making in those solutions. And I almost added on to his comments about LTX where we have continued investments there. And as we think about our 3-year outlooks, no revenue associated with that. So that's an opportunity for us as well. 
And then the final thing I'd say, Patrick, is investments in our go-to-market and sales organizations, particularly as we think about expanding internationally, focusing on our premium accounts. These are investments that are really, as I mentioned, think drive recurring revenue growth. So we'll continue -- we have been, and we'll continue to be, committed to these investments while producing margin expansion and delivering the high return that we want to drive."

When you think about our GTO business, we show that chart that breaks it up between capital markets and wealth management.

And that was primarily -- you saw that benefit come through in the capital markets business, and we said that would be a tough comp. As we came into this quarter, so in the capital markets business, you had sort of a harder comp on trading volume and the license revenue impact that brought it to flattish revenue. 
The trading volumes that you saw, the continued growth, I mentioned, the fifth consecutive quarter of growth was primarily retail trading, and you saw the 7% growth in the wealth management business is the item that was benefiting from that. So you have this tale of 2 cities in our GTO business right now with capital markets coming over higher comps, facing the lower license revenue that I'll remind you was a grow over an issue, an uptick in Q3 '20 revenues, but wealth management seeing the benefit of the trade volumes that we saw this quarter."

And we certainly stand ready to assist and to play the role that we play. I think it's too soon to tell that the business opportunity, but it certainly appears to be an area of focus. 
I think the other questions are really around the initiatives from the previous administration and the extent to which they will continue or not. We -- there's a lot of conversation about end-to-end vote confirmation. We're hearing that could remain an area of focus, and that's certainly something that we've been a supporter of. We shared with the SEC the result of a successful pilot that we've done with the top 100 issuers showing how that can work. On virtual shareholder meetings, there have been discussions about making the beneficial voting available to all providers, which we've done this season via APIs, universal proxy as an area we support and we stand ready to help. There's a working group that recommended changes there. There were discussions about OBO-NOBO and a working group that really isn't making a recommendation. 
And then there's a whole conversation around streamlined communications in funds, which we're focused with the previous SEC is unclear. That's going to be a focus for the new leadership, but we support the recommendations, and we'll continue to work to strengthen the industry for the long term. So lots of different things that were on the agenda, that are a little less clear in terms of what their forward momentum is. Certainly, the new things we hear about relate to ESG."

And what we're looking at as we look into the fourth quarter is -- and we do have a fair bit of visibility at this stage into what's going to happen in the fourth quarter because there's a lag between when the records come together and when they go out. So we have testing, but we have good visibility. What I'd say is just -- what we're seeing is very, very broad-based growth. We're seeing it across all different types of issuers. We're seeing it across all different types of broker-dealers, although stronger in online broker-dealers. We're seeing it across industries and we're seeing it across both managed accounts and other accounts, and if not, just focused on meme stock. 
So like a lot of the things that you've been reading in other places in the press, this rise in equity holdings and rise in participation in the market is very significant. We're also seeing, to a less degree but good interim, record growth, which is driven by stronger inflows and healthy markets. So we're seeing very strong Q4. We often get asked about when the market changes or if the market changes, what would be the impact of that? And we have -- we've done a lot of work going back over the last 25 years of history and events like '99 and '09 and even last spring. And what that would really tell us is that growth flattens, could be slightly negative, but that equity investors tend to stay invested and it is -- sort of reaches a new plateau. So we do think that these levels of holdership are sustainable. We're not modeling the same level of growth in the future, clearly. But we see a return to sort of more sort of normalized growth in the future."

I'll begin with an overview of our key messages and an update on our third quarter results, including our performance against our strategic objectives. Edmund will review our financial results, and then we'll take your questions.  
It's an exciting time to be at Broadridge, and we have a lot to cover, so let's get started. I'm pleased to share that Broadridge delivered strong third quarter results. Recurring revenues and adjusted operating income both rose 8%. Our results in both ICS and GTO are being propelled by long-term trends, including increasing digitization, mutualization and the democratization of investing. These trends are driving strong new business growth, record growth in the number of shareholders and higher trading volumes. We're also executing well against our strategic growth plan across governance, capital markets and wealth and investment management. I'll highlight some of those initiatives in a few minutes.  
A combination of those strong results and continued execution against our growth plans is giving us the confidence to continue to invest in our business. We've continued to fund attractive investments in our products, platforms and people, including the pending acquisition of Itiviti. We're also substantially increasing our guidance for fiscal year 2021 on both the top and bottom line. We now expect recurring revenue growth of 8% to 10% and adjusted EPS growth of 11% to 13%. While the new guidance reflects the impact of Itiviti, the bulk of this raise is organic, as Edmund will discuss. The net result of all these points, our strong third quarter results, our continued internal and M&A investment and our outlook for fiscal 2021 is that Broadridge is executing well and is on track to deliver at the higher end of our 3-year financial objectives, including 8% to 12% adjusted EPS growth.  
We remain focused on delivering long-term growth driven by secular trends and consistent investment across our governance wealth and capital markets businesses and, in turn, generate consistent, sustainable top quartile shareholder returns.  
Broadridge's ability to generate those attractive returns is driven by executing on our clear long-term growth plan. So let me update you on some highlights of our recent progress on Slide 5. I'll start with ICS. Recurring revenues rose 11% to $586 million driven by revenue from new sales and very strong equity record growth. The biggest driver of ICS' strong growth was revenue from new sales, and I'm pleased to see the impact of recent investments on our results.  
Let me share 2 examples of our focus on product investment and strong execution are translating directly into increased revenue growth. The first is the Shareholder Rights Directive II. Over the past 2 years, we've created a shareholder communications hub, linking millions of investors across the EU with hundreds of wealth managers, winning almost 300 new clients along the way. Now as we enter proxy season, we're starting to see those efforts translate into new revenues helping to drive 80-plus percent growth in our international proxy business.  
Virtual shareholder meetings continue to be a great example of product investment translating into new revenues. Over the past year, we've upgraded our VSM capabilities to include the latest in virtual meeting capabilities, including state-of-the-art video and audio technology, improved Q&A functionality, one-click shareholder authentication and seamless proxy voting. Those upgrades have helped retain our existing clients and have driven additional growth. We are now on pace to serve almost 1,900 virtual shareholder meetings this proxy season, up from 1,400 last spring.  
The second factor driving ICS was very strong equity record growth, which was 20% for the quarter. It's clear, the move to reducing trading commissions has triggered a significant expansion in the number of market participants, which contributed to the increase in equity record growth. That strong growth has been broad-based across our broker clients but has been most pronounced at the online brokers. It has also been broad-based across issuers with 20% growth across both widely held stocks and those with more medium-sized shareholder bases. We did see large increases at a handful of names, including so-called meme stocks like GameStop. But those increases only contributed 1 point of the overall growth.  
Commission-free trading is the latest step in a long-term trend. It includes the rise of ETFs, lower trading costs across all participants and changes in investor interfaces that helps propel high single-digit equity and fund record growth over the past decade. Broadridge has invested to scale its capabilities to meet that rise in demand, increase the digitization of critical regulatory communications and ensure that both new and existing investors get the information they need to understand the risks and participate in the governance of their investments. Looking forward, we expect strong record growth to extend into the fourth quarter with our testing indicating 25% stock record growth for Q4.  
To close off on governance. Let me touch briefly on regulatory. I want to congratulate Commissioner Gensler on his confirmation as SEC Chairman. As we have with every chair and administration of both parties over the past 40 years, we look forward to assisting by investing in the next generation of technology, to help the SEC achieve its mandate to better inform and protect investors, all while reducing cost for registers and creating a fair return for our shareholders.  
Let's turn now to our capital markets franchise. Capital markets' recurring revenues slipped by 1% as steady international growth was offset as expected by lower license revenues. We anticipate this period of flattish revenue to continue through the fourth quarter before picking up again in fiscal '22 as we onboard our very healthy backlog. On the strategic front, our planned acquisition of activity represent a significant enhancement of our ability to drive value to our clients. For those who may have missed our call a few weeks ago, let me remind you why we think this transaction is such an exciting step forward for our global capital markets franchise.  
As a leading provider of order management and trade execution technology and connectivity solutions for financial institutions, Itiviti gives Broadridge a compelling opportunity to extend our capital market service offering. The combination of Itiviti's front-office trading solutions, with Broadridge's leading post-trade back-office capabilities, will allow us to serve our client's entire trade life cycle from order to settlement. With increasing high frequency and algorithm-driven trading, it's increasingly important to serve clients across traditional boundaries. This combination will bring critical data from the back to the front office to improve trading decisions, and it will enable our clients to simplify and improve their front-to-back technology stack and operating model.  
The combination also strengthens our joint capabilities across equities, exchange-traded derivatives and fixed income, and it substantially extends our global reach, creating significant cross-selling opportunities and enhancing our relationships with blue chip clients. The acquisition virtually doubles our business in APAC and further expands our reach in Europe. That expanded footprint and scale positions us to take advantage of growing mutualization trends in both EMEA and Asia.  
Itiviti adds more than $6 billion to Broadridge's total addressable market and will drive stronger growth, margins and earnings, as Edmund will discuss in his remarks. Early feedback from our clients has been overwhelmingly positive, giving us added confidence that our front-to-back thesis and our near-term medium growth outlook are sound.  
Also of note in our capital markets franchise is the continued development of our LTX fixed income trading platform. LTX recently completed the first-ever multi-buyer digital block trade. Enabling a single seller to simultaneously access the aggregated liquidity for multiple buyers is a milestone for the fixed income market, and I hope one of the many steps towards creating a more liquid corporate bond market. To date, 10 dealers and over 40 asset managers have joined the LTX platform. And an additional 14 institutions are signed in the onboarding process, including one of the world's largest fixed income managers.  
Let's turn next to our wealth and investment management business, where revenues grew by 7%, driven by new client additions and higher equity trading volumes. A key part of our growth strategy is to expand our sales of component solutions. So it's terrific to see new client onboardings across a full range of our wealth and investment management products. We also continue to make progress on building our industry-leading wealth management platform, which will help clients with the digital transformation of their wealth business. We're already live with our average daily balance billing solution and industry milestone. We're currently in active testing of our front office workstation with select advisers, setting the stage for a period of extensive testing of the broader platform before going live.  
Our sales and marketing efforts with several new clients to this platform are advancing well. Clients see that using the Broadridge wealth platform to drive digitization by seamlessly connecting the back office functions we already provide, with additional select front and middle office capabilities, will drive a stronger top and bottom line by bringing new capabilities to advisers and clients while digitizing financial adviser, branch and back office interactions.  
Another important part of our wealth strategy is developing a robust partner network to ensure that we can integrate cutting-edge capabilities from innovative partners. Recent partnerships include Fligoo for predictive analytics and [ Core Bank ] for securities-based lending; and [ the Tiefen Group], a wealth management fintech accelerator. These partnerships and others represent ongoing steps in building a network that will enable our clients to rapidly adopt new technologies.  
Before I turn the call over to Edmund, I want to step back for a moment and reflect at how far we've come over the past year. When I spoke to you at the close of our fiscal third quarter a year ago, the economic outlook was deeply uncertain and from the New York area and much of the world was locked down. My remarks at that time were focused on the steps we were taking to keep our associates safe and meet the needs of our clients in an unprecedented time. Today, after 12 long months, there remains significant challenges and thinking, in particular, of our more than 3,000 associates in India and of their families and friends. But the global outlook is unquestionably brighter, with increasing economic growth marching hand-in-hand with rising vaccination rates.  
The pandemic has also accelerated many long-term trends, including digitization, mutualization and next-generation resiliency. And the lower cost and friction for investing is bringing in millions of new investors. These changes are clearly having a significant impact across wealth management, governance and capital markets. They're causing financial services leaders to rapidly adopt next-generation technologies. And Broadridge is building the suite of capabilities that will help them navigate and win this period of change.  
We do so from a position of strength. We started the fiscal year last July expecting 2% to 6% recurring revenue growth and 4% to 10% adjusted EPS growth. Our focus then was on driving enough expense savings to assure that we could continue to fund critical growth investments. Fast forward 9 months, and we are poised to deliver 8% to 10% recurring revenue growth, driven by a combination of strong new sales and healthy financial markets. After achieving our expense targets, we're now investing heavily in new product capabilities, enhancing our global post-trade platform and building next-generation capabilities across digital communications, wealth management and fixed income trading, among other investments. We're also adding talent and investing in our people to make Broadridge the best place for the most talented associates in our industry.  
Last but not least, we're on the brink of closing our $2.5 billion acquisition of Itiviti, expanding our capital markets franchise and further strengthening our global footprint. And yet even after those investments and the near-term dilution from Itiviti, we're positioned to deliver 11% to 13% adjusted EPS growth. Broadridge is at its front foot and leaning into the opportunities we see ahead. It has been a remarkable year.  
Looking further ahead, we're on track to achieve the higher end of our 3-year growth objectives, driving strong recurring revenue and double-digit adjusted EPS growth. We see long-term trends continuing to drive demand for our services. And our investments are creating new avenues for growth long beyond our current 2-year objectives. The future of Broadridge is brighter than ever. In my 10 years at Broadridge, I've never been as confident about our long-term outlook as I am on this call today.  
Before I turn it over, I want to thank our associates. We've asked a lot of our team over the past 12 months, and they're delivering. They stayed focused on clients, and through them on helping to build better financial lives for millions. Let me now turn the call over to Edmund for a more detailed financial review. Edmund?"

Margins declined 60 basis points to 20.4% as we successfully made the investments that we discussed last quarter in our technology platforms, in our products, our people.

As I said, recurring revenue grew 8% in the quarter, powered by 7% organic growth, and comfortably within our historic mid- to high single-digit growth performance. demonstrating the strength of our sustainable recurring revenue growth model. As a result of that strong organic growth and an increase in our outlook for the fourth quarter, we're raising our guidance for recurring revenue growth to 8% to 10% for the full year, up from our prior guidance of growth at the higher end of 3% to 6%.  
Now let's look at this quarter's recurring revenue growth by business on Slide 9. I'll start with our ICS segment, where revenues grew by 11% to $586 million. Regulatory revenues rose 20% to $290 million driven by the 20% equity record growth, higher mutual fund and ETF communications volumes and net new sales, including from our Shareholder Rights Directive II solution that Tim highlighted earlier. We expect strong regulatory revenue growth to continue in the fourth quarter with, our current testing indicating 25% equity record growth. 
Our Issuer business also contributed to our overall growth rate, thanks to continued growth in VSMs and increased issuer communications. After a strong 12 months, we now have significant penetration of our VSM solution across the S&P 500, and we expect issuer revenue growth to ease going forward as we start to lap the increase of VSM activity that began in Q4 '20.  
Fund solutions revenue was flat as double-digit growth in data and analytics was offset by lower interest income from custodied accounts in our funds processing business. Customer communications revenues were also flat with double-digit growth in our high-margin digital products, offset by lower print volumes due in part to the pandemic-depressed activity levels. We expect growth in both our data-driven solutions and customer communications business to pick up in the fourth quarter as these headwinds ease.  
Turning to GTO. Wealth and investment management revenues rose 7%, driven by the onboarding of new component sales and higher retail trading. Capital markets revenues fell 1% as strong growth from international sales, was offset by $6 million in lower license revenues, which declined as expected. As we said last quarter, this flat revenue growth will continue in the Q4 '21 before picking up in fiscal year '22.  
Let's turn to Page 10, where we show more detail on volume trends. Broadridge's recurring revenue growth benefits from underlying volume growth trends, including stock record growth. Over the past decade, record growth across equity, mutual funds and ETF has grown 6% to 8%. Recently, equity record growth has accelerated to 11% in Q4 '20 and continued to increase through the year to 20% in Q3 '21, surpassing the estimates from our January testing. As I said, we expect these growth trends to continue and reach 25% in Q4 '21. 
Mutual fund and ETF record growth picked up as well to 7%, more in line with our historical growth rates. We are modeling a return to more moderate mid-single-digit growth across both equity, mutual fund ETF records for fiscal year '22, with stronger growth in the seasonally smaller first half and more moderate growth in the second half.  
Touching briefly on trade volumes, which you'll see on the bottom of this slide. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of aggregate double-digit volume growth. This growth reflects the increase in volatility in retail investor engagement over the past year, which continued to be quite strong well into the third quarter. More recently, trading volatility subsided during the second half of March, and we expect tougher trading volume comps in Q4.  
Let's move to Slide 11 for a closer look at the drivers of our recurring revenue. Organic growth at a very healthy 7% continues to be the largest component of our recurring revenue growth, and new sales remains the biggest driver with strong growth contribution from both ICS and GTO. We also continued our long track record of revenue retention above 97%. Internal growth contributed another 3 points as growth in ICS regulatory volumes more than offset the decline in GTO license revenue. And finally, acquisitions. We've now fully lapped all of our fiscal year 2020 acquisitions. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect Itiviti to add 3 points to fourth quarter recurring revenue growth.  
Now we'll turn to Slide 12 to briefly touch on our total revenue performance. Total revenue growth this quarter was stronger than usual, reaching 11%, with distribution revenue contributing 3 points due to the increased mailings that correspond with the high record growth and the increased event-driven activity this quarter. Moving forward, we continue to expect the low to no-margin distribution revenue to decline over time as we focus on increasing higher-margin digital revenue across our governance business.  
Event-driven communications remain an integral part of our client offering. Event-driven revenues have climbed over the past 4 quarters to be more in line with our historical norms of about $50 million a quarter and reached $74 million in the third quarter, well above last year's unusually low $39 million. Broadridge benefited from an increase in mutual fund proxy activity as well as a rebound in proxy contest volumes and capital markets transactions. We expect fiscal '21 event-driven revenue to be more in line with the average that we've seen over the past 7 years. For modeling purposes, we're assuming $50 million to $60 million of event-driven revenues in the fourth quarter.  
Turning to Slide 13. Adjusted operating income grew by 8%. Our adjusted operating income margin declined by 60 basis points, reflecting the continued investments that we're making in our technology platforms and product capabilities that we highlighted on our last quarterly call. These investments, which support our long-term growth, have a short-term impact on margin expansion, but we remain on track to deliver approximately 50 basis points of margin expansion for the full year, right in line with our fiscal year '21 guidance and 3-year growth objectives. This formula, forgoing near-term margin expansion and consistently investing in our technology platforms and products to drive long-term sustainable recurring revenue growth, will continue to be an important part of how we manage our business. As a CFO focused on long-term growth, it's encouraging to see us making these types of investments across all of our product lines, giving us momentum towards future growth.  
Before I turn to capital allocation, let's turn to Slide 14 and spend a moment on another key operating metric, closed sales, which, as I mentioned earlier, is the most consistent driver of our long-term recurring revenue growth. Our $124 million closed sales year-to-date are in line with our performance over the same period last year. We continue to see strong demand for our ICS solutions, including regulatory and issuer communications and data solutions. 
We remain on track to achieve our full year guidance of $190 million to $235 million for closed sales, which implies a fourth quarter range of $66 million to $111 million. Historically, the closed sales performance in the last quarter of the year has been impacted by the timing of larger deals. A handful of larger signings could propel us to the top end of our guidance range, and conversely, delays could put us at the lower end. And I'll also note that we continue to feel good about our recurring revenue backlog, which was 12% of our fiscal '20 recurring revenues as of Q4 '20 and gives us great visibility into our top line growth.  
Moving to capital allocation on the following slide. We generated $136 million of free cash flow year-to-date, up $54 million over the first 9 months of fiscal year '20 driven by higher earnings and strong working capital management. During the first 9 months of the fiscal year, we invested $205 million in building out our industry platforms and another $71 million in CapEx and software spending. Our M&A investment through the first 9 months of the year was 0, but that will change with our announced $2.5 billion acquisition of Itiviti, which I'll touch on in a moment. Even after completing the Itiviti acquisition, Broadridge will remain committed to a balanced capital allocation policy, which prioritizes internal investment, growing our dividend, M&A and returning excess capital to shareholders. 
Importantly, we are also committed to maintaining an investment-grade credit rating, which means we'll prioritize debt paydown over share repurchases and expect to limit ourselves to smaller tuck-in M&A opportunities over the next several quarters. Given our strong free cash flow, we believe that we can comfortably achieve our new 2.5x leverage target by the end of fiscal year '23. Turning to capital returns on the right-hand side of the slide, our dividend has grown and remains in line with our historical 45% payout ratio.  
On Slide 16, we are on track to close the Itiviti acquisition in the coming weeks. So let me take a moment to give you some additional clarity about the expected impact that Itiviti will have on our financial performance. I'll start with fiscal year '21. We expect Itiviti to add $25 [ billion ] to $30 [ billion ] or 1 point to our full year recurring revenue growth, which equates to 3 points to our fourth quarter growth. And the acquisition is expected to be modestly dilutive to our adjusted EPS growth. In fiscal year '22, we expect Itiviti to add approximately $250 million or about 8 points to our recurring revenue growth. And we expect the acquisition to be accretive by approximately 2 to 3 points or roughly $0.10 to $0.15 to adjusted EPS growth. Please note that Itiviti's results in both fiscal year '21 and fiscal year '22 will be negatively impacted by the accounting treatment of acquired revenue, which will reduce revenue recognition by approximately $30 million in total with 2/3 of that impact in fiscal '22. This revenue haircut is incorporated in the numbers that I just shared with you.  
Finally, I want to reiterate the commentary that I gave you when we announced the deal, about the impact on our 3-year growth objectives. We expect Itiviti to add 2.5 to 3 points to our 3-year recurring revenue growth CAGR and, after interest, more than 2 points to our 3-year adjusted EPS CAGR.  
Now turning to guidance on Slide 17. We are raising our outlook for fiscal '21 recurring revenue growth to 8% to 10% from the higher end of 3% to 6%, and that includes one point of growth from Itiviti. We are raising our guidance for total revenue growth to 8% to 10% from the higher end of 1% to 4%. We continue to expect our adjusted operating income margin to expand to approximately 18%, up from 17.5% in fiscal year '20 as we balance near-term returns with continued investments to sustain long-term growth. We expect adjusted EPS growth of 11% to 13%, up from the higher end of 6% to 10%, and that includes a 1-point drag from Itiviti.  
Finally, as I noted earlier, we continue to expect closed sales in the range of $190 million to $235 million. And before we begin to take your questions, let me share some final thoughts. The Broadridge Financial model is working. We are on track to deliver strong 8% to 10% recurring revenue growth. That growth is fueling our ability to both invest and expand margins. At the same time, our strong free cash flow business model enables us to pursue balanced capital allocation, commit to a rising dividend, fund investments in our platform and products and step up and make a significant M&A investment to grow our capital markets franchise. And finally, thanks to our consistent investment in our capabilities, we are on track to deliver another year of $190 million plus of new closed sales, which, combined with our strong backlog, positions us well for additional recurring revenue growth. The end result is that we're on track to deliver at the higher end of our 3-year financial objectives of 7% to 9% recurring revenue growth and 8% to 12% adjusted EPS growth. It's a great example of how we manage our business to drive sustainable revenue growth, steady and consistent adjusted EPS growth and historically top quartile TSR.

And as you mentioned, Q3 has continued to increase and go back to our historical norms. We've done about -- on average, about $50 million a quarter. You've seen pickup in mutual fund proxy business and contests in capital markets. It's not unusual to see us have an unusually high quarter or an unusually low quarter. But over the long term, I do expect event-driven revenue to pick up and grow in line with stock record growth. 
So during the Investor Day, I came out and said that we've seen 14 years ago, event-driven revenues average for the first 7 years, $180 million. Over the last 7 years, it's been above $200 million. And I feel comfortable that we should anchor in the full year number for event-driven revenue, and we expect it to be at that level as we look throughout our objectives in the '22 and '23 and, again, at reasonably strong margins in that business."

And Tim, you might have some commentary on the business itself. And we were thinking -- when we were bringing  Itiviti on, first, we were looking for very strong assets in the capital market space after deploying most of our M&A to wealth management and governance over the past 3 years. And the thing that looks great from a financial standpoint for Itiviti is the strong growth outlook. The core business by itself is mid-single-digit growth from a revenue standpoint. 
I talked earlier that we committed to about $20 million in synergies by 2025 in that business. So you should see high single-digit growth in that business. The recurring revenue models are predictable. They're subscription-like revenues, healthy operating margins in that business. And I think that's a great time to finance it in this low interest rate environment. I also said that we expect, because of that profile, to get to double-digit IRRs in this business. So I think we'll focus on integrating it, but I do expect it to have that high single-digit revenue growth at 30% margin, so a strong return over a very long time for us in that business.

I mentioned that about 2/3 of that is in fiscal '22, the other 1/3 is this year in fiscal '21 impacting the revenues that we expect over the next 2 months. 
That will be about 8 points to the recurring revenue growth in fiscal year '22 and, as I mentioned, about 2 to 3 points to the adjusted EPS growth. And so you can expect growth on that revenue fully in the fiscal year '23 without any further impact from the accounting adjustment that I was just talking about. So we feel good about the contribution that it will make as we end the '23, as Tim said a moment ago, helping propel us to the top end of our range. 
I'll also add, Chris, when we gave the 3-year objectives, we talked about 5% to 7% organic recurring revenue growth.

And then we have the asset class opportunities, and they have a very strong position in exchange-traded derivatives, and that's a more nascent area for us. And so we expect that combined offer to be very interesting. And we have a very strong position in fixed income, and they have a building position in fixed income. And so that's another attractive area. So we think that between the geographic cross-sell and the asset class cross-sell, that there's a really nice degree of revenue synergy built into this.

And I'm glad you asked that question actually because it was sort of in the script there, but we have, just in this last quarter, signed -- I'm not sure if it's the largest, but 1 of the top 3 in terms of fixed income managers, and so that is not on board yet, but it will be coming on board in the next few months, but that was a real milestone for us. So I think the milestones that we were excited about on LTX, and why we continue to talk about it were -- the patent we received on the best execution protocol, which really allows aggregation across buyers and sellers.
The first execution of an aggregated trade, which is a real milestone and so important because the electronification of trading, as you know, has been a little slower in fixed income and really hasn't penetrated the larger trades, which are the important ones. And so that aggregation capability, we think, really will help unlock the digitization of fixed income. And then the third milestone was really the designing of one of the top -- one of the very top fixed income managers. And so we think that's just another sign and why we're confident, as we go through this year. We're going to continue to see momentum pick up."

And what those firms are seeing and they're testing our AI side by side with their AI, and they're seeing that it adds real value in terms of, well, ""Who's the #25 first,"" and I might not otherwise call it. And so it really increased the efficiency for the salesperson and allows them to serve their clients a lot better. So that AI piece, even independent of the marketplace, has real value. And so I think it really makes us some very interesting conversations."

But again, I'll reiterate that we remain committed to being able to drive adjusted operating margin to the tune of 50 basis points for the year, and I think we'll still be able to do that. But it does include organic investments. 
I think about them across our technology platforms, Tim mentioned in his earlier remarks across post-trade, across wealth management and our infrastructure. As you think about the network resiliency that we've had over the past few quarters where we've seen record trade volume growth, I would say that organic investment into our infrastructure and technology platforms are starting to pay dividends. You see it in our products as well. 
Tim earlier talked about the VSM solutions and the SRD solutions within that regulatory business growth. You saw 28% growth benefiting from the investments that we've been making in those solutions. And I almost added on to his comments about LTX where we have continued investments there. And as we think about our 3-year outlooks, no revenue associated with that. So that's an opportunity for us as well. 
And then the final thing I'd say, Patrick, is investments in our go-to-market and sales organizations, particularly as we think about expanding internationally, focusing on our premium accounts. These are investments that are really, as I mentioned, think drive recurring revenue growth. So we'll continue -- we have been, and we'll continue to be, committed to these investments while producing margin expansion and delivering the high return that we want to drive."

When you think about our GTO business, we show that chart that breaks it up between capital markets and wealth management. And the first thing I'd say is, as we were coming into Q2, remember, we're coming in Q3 off of record trading volume comps, 26% combined equity and fixed income and 28% for equity. And that was primarily -- you saw that benefit come through in the capital markets business, and we said that would be a tough comp. As we came into this quarter, so in the capital markets business, you had sort of a harder comp on trading volume and the license revenue impact that brought it to flattish revenue. 
The trading volumes that you saw, the continued growth, I mentioned, the fifth consecutive quarter of growth was primarily retail trading, and you saw the 7% growth in the wealth management business is the item that was benefiting from that. So you have this tale of 2 cities in our GTO business right now with capital markets coming over higher comps, facing the lower license revenue that I'll remind you was a grow over an issue, an uptick in Q3 '20 revenues, but wealth management seeing the benefit of the trade volumes that we saw this quarter."

I think when we hear about the focus of the next SEC, certainly, one of the things at the top of the list that we hear about in the market is around ESG and related disclosures for ESG, and how that may be an early focus. And we certainly stand ready to assist and to play the role that we play. I think it's too soon to tell that the business opportunity, but it certainly appears to be an area of focus. 
I think the other questions are really around the initiatives from the previous administration and the extent to which they will continue or not. We -- there's a lot of conversation about end-to-end vote confirmation. We're hearing that could remain an area of focus, and that's certainly something that we've been a supporter of. We shared with the SEC the result of a successful pilot that we've done with the top 100 issuers showing how that can work. On virtual shareholder meetings, there have been discussions about making the beneficial voting available to all providers, which we've done this season via APIs, universal proxy as an area we support and we stand ready to help. There's a working group that recommended changes there. There were discussions about OBO-NOBO and a working group that really isn't making a recommendation. 
And then there's a whole conversation around streamlined communications in funds, which we're focused with the previous SEC is unclear. That's going to be a focus for the new leadership, but we support the recommendations, and we'll continue to work to strengthen the industry for the long term. So lots of different things that were on the agenda, that are a little less clear in terms of what their forward momentum is. Certainly, the new things we hear about relate to ESG."

And we're -- just more broadly, we're seeing this, as I talked about in my prepared remarks, just as part of a long-term trend of the democratization of investing. And what we're looking at as we look into the fourth quarter is -- and we do have a fair bit of visibility at this stage into what's going to happen in the fourth quarter because there's a lag between when the records come together and when they go out. So we have testing, but we have good visibility. What I'd say is just -- what we're seeing is very, very broad-based growth. We're seeing it across all different types of issuers. We're seeing it across all different types of broker-dealers, although stronger in online broker-dealers. We're seeing it across industries and we're seeing it across both managed accounts and other accounts, and if not, just focused on meme stock. 
So like a lot of the things that you've been reading in other places in the press, this rise in equity holdings and rise in participation in the market is very significant. We're also seeing, to a less degree but good interim, record growth, which is driven by stronger inflows and healthy markets. So we're seeing very strong Q4. We often get asked about when the market changes or if the market changes, what would be the impact of that? And we have -- we've done a lot of work going back over the last 25 years of history and events like '99 and '09 and even last spring. And what that would really tell us is that growth flattens, could be slightly negative, but that equity investors tend to stay invested and it is -- sort of reaches a new plateau. So we do think that these levels of holdership are sustainable. We're not modeling the same level of growth in the future, clearly. But we see a return to sort of more sort of normalized growth in the future."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin with our key messages and then provide an overview of our performance against our strategic objectives across governance, capital markets and wealth and investment management. and then close some thoughts about our future before Edmund reviews the financials. 
Let's get started. I have 4 headlines. First, Broadridge delivered a strong fiscal year '21. Recurring revenues rose 10%. Adjusted EPS rose 13%, and our sales teams delivered tenth consecutive year of record sales. Our results demonstrate how well positioned Broadridge is to take advantage of increasing investor participation and the growing need to digitize and mutualize financial services. 
Second, we're executing against the strategic growth plan we laid out at our Investor Day in December. We're building the next generation of governance products, growing the scope of our capital markets business across the trade life cycle and building our wealth management franchise. 
Third, we remain committed to balanced capital allocation. In fiscal '21, we increased our level of investment on our internal platforms, completed the largest acquisition in our history and returned nearly $250 million in capital to shareholders. Yesterday, our Board approved an 11% increase in our annual dividend per share. Broadridge has now increased its annual dividend every year since becoming a public company with double-digit increases in 8 of the last 9 years. 
Fourth and last, we expect another strong year in fiscal '22. Our guidance calls for 12% to 15% recurring revenue growth, further margin expansion, 11% to 15% adjusted EPS growth and another year of record sales. The combination of strong fiscal year '21 results and our guidance for fiscal '22 leaves Broadridge extremely well positioned to achieve the higher end of our 3-year growth objectives. 
As we close out the first year of our current 3-year cycle, I want to give you an update on our progress against our strategic growth plans for each of our 3 franchise businesses, starting with governance or ICS on Slide 4. ICS recurring revenue rose 11% in fiscal '21 to $2.1 billion driven by both new sales and internal growth. Strength of our governance franchise comes from its position at the heart of a network, linking broker-dealers, corporate issuers, asset managers, and tens of millions of individual and institutional investors. Our fiscal '21 results highlight how our strategy of innovating at the core while providing incremental value to all network participants drive -- drives incremental and sustainable growth for Broadridge. 
I'll start with our core regulatory business. The big story here is the very strong position growth we're seeing across equities, Equity stock record growth, which is our measure of the number of positions held by shareholders, grew 26% in fiscal '21, including 33% in the seasonally strongest fourth quarter. We continue to be struck by the broad-based nature of this growth. We're seeing growth across large and small issuers not simply a handful of mega cap tech or mean stocks. 
Looking at industry sectors, tech and consumer cyclical stocks are leading the growth with 42% and 37% growth, respectively. We're also seeing double-digit growth across virtually other sector, including 33% growth in health care names and 20% plus in basic materials and industrials. This broad-based participation is a key reason why we believe that fiscal year '21's strong growth is an extension of the long-term trend that's been driving higher equity and fund position growth over the past decade and why we're forecasting continued growth in fiscal '22. 
At Broadridge, we're able to meet this increased demand because we've invested in scaling our capacity. After the initial COVID surge last spring, we invested in new distribution capacity to build incremental flexibility across our network, enabling us to seamlessly ensure that holders of more than 500 million positions got the communications they needed to participate in corporate governance. We've also invested in new digital capabilities including QR codes that make voting on your mobile device easier than ever. 
Our governance franchise is also increasingly global with gains from our Shareholder Rights Directive 2 solution and the continued expansion of our European fund communications business. We're also expanding the suite of data-driven solutions we provide for fund clients, driven in part by another year of double-digit growth across our data and intelligence products. 
We're growing our relationships with corporate issuers. We conducted almost 2,400 virtual shareholder meetings in fiscal '21, up from 1,500 a year ago. We've become the clear choice for America's leading companies with more than 3/4 of S&P 100 companies using Broadridge to host their annual meetings in 2021. In turn, increased demand for our VSM capabilities has enabled us to deepen our client relationships, leading to strong growth in our suite of other annual meeting services and disclosure solutions products. 
Finally, in customer communications, our strategy is focused on using our print capability as a door opener for growing our digital business. So it was encouraging to see strong double-digit growth in digital revenues, which offset lower print revenues and helped drive higher earnings. All in all, it was a very strong year for our governance franchise. 
Now let's turn to capital markets on Slide 5. In capital markets, we're driving trading innovation across the front office, enabling our clients to simplify and improve their global post-trade technology, providing strong enterprise and data component solutions and building new network-enabled solutions using AI, digital ledger and other innovative technologies. 
Capital markets revenue grew 8% to $701 million driven by new client additions and the acquisition of Itiviti, which has given us a new capability to drive innovation across the trade life cycle. While the Itiviti integration is only just beginning, I'm excited by the progress we've made. Itiviti recently closed its largest ever sale, and we're on track to leverage Broadridge's relationships to drive more meaningful sales in the quarters ahead. Client feedback has continued to be positive and the sales pipeline, especially in EMEA and APAC, is strong. 
A key driver of our revenue growth is our continued success at bringing clients under our global platforms, enabling them to simplify their global technology. We're also enhancing those platform capabilities. A great example is the exchange-traded derivatives platform onto which we're onboarding R.J. O'Brien. 
I'm also tremendously excited by the continued progress in developing new capabilities based on next-gen AI and DLT technology. Our LTX fixed income platform continues to progress well. We have more than 70 buy and sell-side users on the platform, and we're adding more every week. And the average initiated trade is north of $3.5 million, indicating demand for increased liquidity in fixed income markets. We also recently launched our digital ledger repo platform and are averaging $35 billion worth of transactions daily, a number which will grow as more clients, including UBS, come on to the platform. While both of these products are small today, each is bringing an innovative and differentiated solution to a multibillion-dollar market. 
Now let's turn to our wealth and investment management franchise on Slide 6. In wealth, we're extending our services around our core back office capabilities, growing our suite of component solutions and building a modular platform that will link our individual capabilities across a modern technology architecture. The biggest driver behind our 6% growth in wealth and investment management revenues was revenue from new sales. During the year, we added new clients to both our core back office platform and saw strong demand for our digital solutions suite. 
Our work with UBS on the digital transformation of the wealth management industry remains one of our most exciting initiatives. The Broadridge wealth management platform is an important part of UBS' own multiyear transformation plan for its North American wealth business. As we align around UBS' goals and sequencing, we've already rolled out select components, and we expect to roll out the additional platform components over the next 18 to 24 months. Based on the terms of our contract, we'll begin recognizing revenue when we complete the delivery of the full suite. 
Meanwhile, this platform continues to draw attention from other clients. We were pleased to announce last month that RBC Wealth Management will become our second client on the Broadridge wealth platform. RBC is pursuing its own digital transformation journey, and our platform will accelerate their ability to enhance the client experience. optimize adviser productivity and digitize its back office. We're excited to be a key technology partner in that journey. 
Beyond our work on the wealth platform, we continue to make progress in expanding our digital solutions with the adviser stream tuck-in acquisition and by extending our partner network. Lastly, I was pleased to see strong growth in our investment management technology revenues, which grew by 12%, strong revenue from sales of existing solutions, continued platform development and new product additions. We're making solid progress on our wealth and investment management growth strategy. 
As I wrap up my strategy update, I want to highlight the common denominator behind our execution across governance, capital markets and wealth and investment management. Broadridge is investing in driving near-, medium- and long-term growth. We've invested to process higher position counts, more virtual shareholder meetings and handle surges and trading volumes, which are critical in fiscal '21 and will remain important in fiscal '22 and '23. At the same time, we're investing in initiatives that will carry our growth momentum forward, including our data intelligence products, the emergence of a European governance hub, Itiviti and our wealth platform. And finally, I see tangible signs of products that have the potential to extend our growth runway well into the next decade like digital communications, digital ledger repo and fixed income AI. These are solutions that our clients value as evidenced by the traction that we're gaining in the market for each of them. This mix of near-, medium- and long-term growth businesses across the company is exciting. 
What does that mean for Broadridge? Let's turn to Slide 7. As we enter fiscal '22, I've never been more optimistic about Broadridge's long-term growth prospects. When I look across our company, I see a leadership team that's stronger than ever, focused on how we engage our associates, better serve our clients and create value for our shareholders. That team is executing against our growth plans across governance, capital markets and wealth and investment management. We're finding ways to help our clients accelerate digitization, drive mutualization benefits and enable the increasing democratization of investing. 
Even more tangibly, we are on track to deliver another strong year. Our strong backlog gives us visibility into new revenue over the next 12 to 24 months, and we see continued position growth as new investors enter the market and current investors continue to diversify their portfolios. In short, we see another year ahead of low-teens revenue and adjusted EPS growth. 
The net result of strong fiscal year '21 results, continued execution against our growth strategy and an outlook for continued growth in '22 means that Broadridge is well positioned to deliver at the higher end of our 3-year growth objectives, including 79% recurring revenue growth and 8% to 12% adjusted EPS growth. 
Before I conclude, I want to thank all Broadridge associates for their work over the past year. Little in the past 12 months has been easy, but they have found a way to adapt to the new virtual environment. They stayed focused on our clients, and they are helping drive the transformation of the financial services industry that is enabling better financial lives for millions. Thank you. Let me now turn it over to Edmund."

As you can see from the financial summary on Slide 8, Broadridge delivered strong fiscal '21 results, capped off by a strong fourth quarter and demonstrating significant progress towards our 3-year objectives.",2510,"Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. As you can see from the financial summary on Slide 8, Broadridge delivered strong fiscal '21 results, capped off by a strong fourth quarter and demonstrating significant progress towards our 3-year objectives. 
Fiscal '21 recurring revenues increased 10% to $3.3 billion driven by strong growth in both ICS and GTO. That strong growth enabled us to make the near-, medium- and long-term investments in our technology platforms and our digital products while driving 60 basis points of AOI margin expansion for the year. Higher revenues and higher margins drove 13% adjusted EPS growth to $5.66. In the fourth quarter, revenues rose 15% year-over-year to $1.1 billion driven by growth in ICS and the acquisition of Itiviti. Adjusted operating income rose 4% as we continued our ongoing investments, and adjusted EPS grew 2% to $2.19. Our results came in at the high end of our latest full year guidance range and above our 3-year recurring revenue and adjusted EPS growth objectives. And as Tim has highlighted, our sales team closed the year on a high note and pushed us modestly above our closed sales guidance range. 
So let's get into the details of those results, starting with recurring revenue on Slide 9. The momentum in our business, driven by the trends and increased investor participation in digital solutions, continued into the fourth quarter and helped Broadridge post another year of 10% recurring revenue growth. Our recurring revenue growth was powered by 8% organic growth, which came in well above our 5% to 7% 3-year growth objectives. The combination of organic growth, ,coupled with 2 points of growth from our acquisition of FundsLibrary and Fi360 in fiscal year '20 and then Itiviti in May pushed our fiscal year '21 recurring revenue growth above our 7% to 9% objective as well. So a strong start toward our 3-year recurring revenue growth objectives. 
Now let's look at this quarter's recurring revenue growth by business, beginning with ICS on Slide 10. ICS revenues grew by 17% to $719 million in the fourth quarter, all of that growth organic. The biggest driver of that growth was in our regulatory business, which grew 27% to $381 million. Fourth quarter stock record growth was 33%, and mutual fund record growth was 11%, both key drivers of growth in regulatory. We also benefited from strong growth in international, and our investment in the Shareholder Rights Directive 2 solution is paying back. and contributing to recurring revenue growth. For the full year, regulatory revenues rose 20%. Issuer revenue also contributed to growth, rising 20% in the fourth quarter to $106 million and 21% growth for the full year. As Tim noted, our continued success in providing virtual shareholder meeting services has helped drive revenue growth of our other annual meeting services and document disclosure products. 
Fund solutions lapped the drag from lower interest income and recurring revenue grew 7% in the fourth quarter. Full year revenues rose 5% driven by the fiscal year '20 acquisitions mentioned earlier and revenue from net new business. Customer communications revenues was down 1% in the quarter as declines in the low-margin print revenue offset digital growth. For the full year, customer communications revenue growth was slightly positive, but more importantly, higher margin digital revenues within customer communications grew by 15%. 
Turning to GTO on Slide 11. GTO recurring revenues rose 10% to $346 million in the quarter driven by 18% growth in our capital markets business and 1% growth in wealth and investment management. Across both capital markets and wealth, solid revenue growth from new business was offset by $7 million of lower license revenue, which declined as expected and modestly lower trading volume. Our acquisition of Itiviti closed in mid-May and contributed $29 million to revenue growth in the capital markets franchise. For the full year, GTO revenues rose 7% to $1.3 billion driven by 4 points of organic growth and 3 points from acquisitions. Organic growth was driven by new sales, and internal growth was essentially flat as the benefit of higher full year trading volumes was offset by lower license revenue, which declined relative to an unusually high fiscal year '20 level. We expect modest growth in license revenues in fiscal year '22. So Broadridge's recurring revenue growth benefited from strong volume growth, both in ICS and our GTO business segment. 
So let's turn to Slide 12 for a closer look at volume trends. Equity stock record growth rose to a record 26% in fiscal '21, well above the 6% to 8% trend in the past decade. Fourth quarter proxy volumes, which accounted for 55% of full year distributions, benefited from 33% stock record growth. We also saw strength in mutual fund and ETF regulatory communications driven by strong fund inflows as we lap last spring's COVID-driven withdrawals. Looking ahead to fiscal '22, we continue to model stock record growth growing at a healthy low teens pace, though the seasonally light first half before reverting to more trend line mid- to high single-digit growth in the much more meaningful seasonal second half. We're also expecting mid- to high single-digit fund record growth. 
Turning to trading volumes on the bottom of the slide. Fourth quarter volumes slipped 1% driven by a combination of tough year-over-year comps and lower overall market volatility. Fourth quarter volumes also declined on a sequential basis as elevated levels in Q3 '21 driven by market volatility subsided. Trading volumes rose 12% for the full year. As we look ahead to fiscal '22, we expect trading volumes to be essentially flat for the year with modestly higher volumes in the first half of the year offset by lower volumes in the third quarter. 
Shifting to a view of growth drivers of recurring revenue on Slide 13. Organic growth rose to 11% in the fourth quarter driven by a combination of new sales and the seasonal impact of higher proxy volumes. New sales contributed 6 points to growth with balanced contribution from both ICS and GTO. Internal growth of 7 points was primarily driven by proxy volumes as is typically the case in our fourth quarter. Acquisitions contributed 3 points. Almost all of that came from Itiviti with only a modest contribution from our mid-June acquisition of AdvisorStream. Client losses subtracted 2 points of growth in both the fourth quarter and for the full year, marking another year of 98% client revenue retention rates. High retention rates reflect the value of the services we offer, our commitment to client services and our intangible outcome of our service profit chain culture. 
I'll round out our revenue drivers discussion on Slide 14 with a look at total revenue. Total revenues rose a healthy 12% in the fourth quarter. Recurring revenue was the primary contributor to that growth, and Broadridge will see a further boost from an uptick in event-driven revenues as well as 2 points of growth from higher distribution revenue. While higher distribution revenues contributed to our overall growth, their share of the full year total revenues declined to 31%, down from 32% in fiscal year '20 and 38% 5 years ago. We expect that the share of low to no margin distribution revenues will continue to decline as we remain focused on growing recurring revenues. FX was a modest positive, reflecting the weakening of the U.S. dollar. 
Looking down the slide, Event-driven revenues rose $5 million year-over-year in the fourth quarter to $73 million driven by higher proxy contest activity. For the full year, event-driven revenues rebounded from a cyclical load to a healthy $237 million. That rebound was broad-based across the full range of event-driven activities. Higher mutual fund communications contributed roughly 1/4 of the growth, as did higher revenues from proxy contests as well as higher revenues from capital markets activity and other communications. Going forward, we're not forecasting that a major fund complex goes to proxy. And while there might be some quarterly cyclicality, we expect full year fiscal '22 event-driven revenues to be approximately $220 million, in line with the fiscal year '15 through fiscal year '21 long-term average. 
Turning to Slide 15. For the full year, adjusted operating income margin expanded 60 basis points to 18.1%, slightly ahead of our latest guidance and multiyear objectives. AOI margin declined 180 basis points to 22.8% in the fourth quarter on the back of our planned fiscal year '21 investment spend. We have a strong track record and high confidence in our ability to make growth accretive investments while still expanding margins and delivering near-term profit growth in line with our adjusted EPS 3-year growth objective. 
Before I move to our uses of cash in our balance sheet, let me touch on closed sales in our revenue backlog on Slide 16. Thanks to a strong fourth quarter, Broadridge recorded another year of strong closed sales with balanced growth across both our ICS and GTO segments. I was especially pleased to see strong growth in our smaller sales, those under $2 million in annualized values, which rose 11%. These small sales represent the bread and butter of our long-term growth and reflect the broad demand we are seeing across our businesses. Our sales performance pushed our overall backlog, a measure of past sales that have not yet been recognized into revenue, to $400 million, up from $355 million last year and steady at 12% of recurring revenue. As a CFO, I appreciate the added visibility into our future revenues that our backlog gives me. 
Moving to capital allocation on the next slide. Broadridge remains committed to a capital allocation policy that balances internal investment, M&A and capital return to shareholders. In fiscal year '21, we generated $557 million of free cash flow, up $58 million from fiscal year '20. Given the size of the market opportunity we see in front of us, we're continuing to prioritize making investments in our business, both internal and external. The biggest use of our cash was the $2.6 billion acquisition of Itiviti, which was completed in the fourth quarter. And late in the fourth quarter, we also completed the additional tuck-in acquisition of AdvisorStream. Since the close of the quarter, we've made 2 more very small tuck-in acquisitions for the assets of Jordan & Jordan and the remaining share of Alpha Omega. We invested almost $300 million in continued platform build-outs as we add to our capabilities across wealth management and capital markets and another $100 million in CapEx and software development. Total capital return to shareholders was $248 million. The 11% increase in our annual dividend approved by our board was in line with our long-term 45% payout ratio policy and will increase capital returns in fiscal year '22. 
As a result of the Itiviti acquisition, our total debt rose to $3.9 billion, up from $1.8 billion at the end of fiscal year '20. Our leverage ratio at year-end was 3.5x. We remain focused on an investment-grade credit rating and target a 2.5x leverage ratio by the end of fiscal '23. 
I'll close my prepared remarks this morning with some comments on our fiscal year '22 guidance, which is on Slide 18. Our guidance for fiscal '22 calls for low-teen recurring revenue growth, healthy margin expansion and another year of strong adjusted EPS growth. 
Let's take each point in turn, starting with recurring revenues. We expect to grow recurring revenues by 12% to 15% in fiscal year '22. That includes organic revenue growth of 5% to 7% with growth balanced across both ICS and  GTO. We're not modeling in any revenue contribution from the UBS contract in fiscal '22. As Tim noted, we expect to complete the rollout of the full wealth management platform suite over the next 18 to 24 months, and we'll begin to recognize revenues at that time. 
We expect the contribution from acquisitions to add an additional 7 to 8 points, with most of that coming from Itiviti. Our more recent acquisitions of AdvisorStream, J&J and Alpha Omega should contribute less than $10 million combined to fiscal '22 recurring revenues. As always, we do not forecast the impact of any future tuck-in acquisitions that we might make. 
In addition to recurring revenue, we expect mid-single-digit distribution revenue growth driven in part by a postal rate increase. Event-driven revenue should, as I indicated earlier, be more in line with our fiscal '15 to '21 7-year average level of approximately $220 million. For modeling purposes, between recurring revenue, distribution and event-driven revenues, total revenue growth should be in the range of 9% to 13%. We are expecting our adjusted operating income margin of approximately 19%, up from 18.1% in fiscal year '21 driven by a combination of incremental scale, digital and efficiency gains as well as the addition of the higher-margin Itiviti business. Finally, we expect adjusted EPS growth to be in a range of 11% to 15%. Included in our EPS outlook is an expectation that the tax rate will essentially be flat at approximately 21% and that we'll see a modest increase in our overall share count. 
On our last guidance point, we expect another year of record closed sales. Our outlook calls for closed sales in the range of $240 million to $280 million. This guidance emphasizes the strength of our financial model and our ability to drive sustainable revenue growth, expand our margins while maintaining a balanced capital allocation policy in delivering steady and consistent adjusted EPS growth. 
That concludes my remarks on our fiscal year '22 guidance. But before I turn the call over for your questions, I have one more final administrative note. Beginning with our first quarter results, we'll be updating how we report foreign exchange. As you know, we've historically used a fixed exchange rate for our segment revenues and for recurring revenue. The difference between the fixed internal rate and the actual rate are recorded in our FX revenue line, which was negative $132 million in fiscal year '21. With the continued growth in our international revenues, especially after the acquisition of Itiviti, the time is right to adjust our reporting. Going forward, we will be changing our internal rate to one that is much closer to the actual rate. This will have the impact of shrinking our reported negative FX revenue to a much smaller number and lowering our segment and recurring revenue numbers by the same amount. These changes will have no significant impact on our reported recurring revenue growth rate nor will they have any impact on our reported total revenue or profitability metrics. We intend to publish our historical revenue results at a restated rate ahead of our first quarter earnings so that you have a chance to adjust your models. Again, this is a change that will begin with our first quarter earnings report. It will lower our reported recurring revenue with little, if any, change to growth rates and will have no impact on total revenue, operating profit or adjusted EPS. With that administrative note out of the way, let's open up the call for your questions. Operator?"

Hi, David. Thanks for joining this morning. Look, first, I'd start off by saying that the fiscal '22 growth is strong across both our organic business and the contribution from acquisitions and I think positions us well for the 3-year -- against the 3-year objectives that we have, positions us well to be towards the high end of that. We still need to execute on sales, converting our sales to revenue and the Itiviti integration. We feel very confident with that, and I think that will actually position us well. 
I think as we think about some of the areas, you've heard us say earlier that we're positioning volume growth to return to mid-single-digit levels. That obviously can be a tailwind, but we feel confident based on our view into the first -- the next 2 quarters that, that is -- that we can expect that level. Event-driven revenues, I think, is also something that, on a quarterly level, has been quite cyclical. We've returned to more historical levels this year in fiscal year '21, and I think that growth was broad-based. So we feel confident about that as we go into fiscal year '22 as well. And I'll tell you that we feel good about the margin expansion that helps us get to a strong point from an adjusted EPS growth standpoint as well. That's driven both by Itiviti and the continued scale and efficiency gains that we get in our core business as well. 
So as you think about the variability in our model going into fiscal year '22, I think we will continue to focus on executing on sales, converting that sales to revenue, driving the Itiviti integration. I think event-driven revenue's more in line with what we've historically seen, and volumes are back to mid-single-digit levels. And I think that's what drives the range for us. And Tim might want to add a point just about the strategy there."

We've been investing clearly in our VSM capability but also in our disclosure business for corporate issuers and, of course, our ongoing investments in digital communications. So right across the whole governance suite, you see investments in each of those areas. And when you look at the product road map, we're able to accelerate some of those product road maps. If you look at the number of innovations that we have delivered over the past 18 months in things like core proxy and core distribution regulatory communications is markedly up. 
And then on the capital markets and wealth management side, really there, the investments in things like digital ledger repo, things like LTX, applying AI to fixed income trading, making a big difference.

I think that really shows how, as we continue to add on new solutions like Itiviti, we see an increased market for us that brought to us in a lot of additional sales resources. And so we do see higher sales for us. 
In terms of how that will affect the backlog, it is -- when you look at the mix of sales, we had a lot of sales this year that were not strategic sales. They were a lot -- we hit a lot of singles this year. And as we bring on the Itiviti sales, those also tend to be a little bit smaller, a little bit faster to implement. So I think sometimes when you see the mix between some of those very large strategic projects and the singles and doubles, the singles and doubles come online usually sort of within a year versus within 2 years. And so I think we may see some fluctuations in backlog. I'm not sure what -- how to imply what that means for the momentum of our business. It does flex a little bit based on the product mix. 
What I will say, though, is seeing that backlog grow again this year, having $400 million of revenue that we know is going to come live over the next 2 years, it gives us a lot of confidence in the revenue from sales portion of our growth formula, and that is the largest part of our growth formula. And so it's -- as CEO and when you think about the environment that we have out there and all the concerns, we have to know that, that revenue is already been sold. The projects are in sight. It's happening. It gives a lot of confidence in that. And it makes me sleep just a little bit better at night."

I do think it was a really remarkable year from the standpoint of position growth. And we do see it, though, as part of the long-term trends that are driving position growth across equities and funds and ETFs. And those, as you know, are democratization of investing managed accounts, more nascently, direct indexing. And so we see those trends continuing in the future. The record growth this year, very broad-based, which really reinforces our view that is part of these long term trends. 
In terms of the investments to support it, it was really around ensuring that the resiliency of the network and being able to produce sort of all output from multiple places. And it just -- it's not a major thing, but it was just something that we felt we needed to do so, not really almost -- won't even enter a model but just to show the ongoing investments that we always make in our business. 
I'm going to let Edmund comment on the margin profile and sort of our confidence about next year and sort of why we believe that. And then I'll add on at the end."

We look at we have some insight into stock record positions for companies that we expect a proxy in the next 1 to 2 quarters. And when you look at that testing, which I would say covers the large majority of distributions and maybe there's some movement between the time that we test  and the time that we actually mail, but the information has been quite reliable, and when you look at that, you see what we said in my prepared remarks, low-teen growth through the first half of the year. And mind you, that's coming off of 16% growth in Q1 last year and 24% growth in Q2 of last year. So low teen growth coming off of that. And that's helpful. That gives us great insight. 
But I'll remind you that the first half is our seasonally light period of the year. If you look at '21 or look at '20, the first half of the year was 13% of overall volumes. So what really is more important is the back half of the year, and we are assuming and modeling more normal levels in the second half of the year that we return to historical levels, and you combine that, and that's what gets us to the mid- to high single-digit growth levels. So you're not -- I don't expect to see 33% and 26% coming out of the fourth and full year numbers that we see, but we have good insight into the next 6 months or so. And I think what we have modeled positions us well, first of all, for fiscal year '22 and gives us confidence in that. 
As we think about the margins of the business, clearly, overall in our business, what we're able to drive, bringing on new customers without -- a new business without incremental cost to scale in our business, the efficiency gains that we're able to get, I think, helps us be able to expand margins, but specifically on print and digital. It was good to see our customer communications business not just driving the earnings growth that we've seen there but now to see digital, which is a higher-margin business because there's very low to no margin in the distribution revenue starting to grow in recurring revenue, which is a higher business for us. So you might see lower revenue in that business, but it comes at a higher margin, and we feel good about the progress we're making on that."

If you were to look back at Q3, you would have seen the opposite of what you saw in the fourth quarter in terms of more of the growth being in wealth management and less being in capital markets. We're coming off a year of 7% growth in GTO. That, I think, is the important thing. Now 3 points of that is driven by the Itiviti acquisition and 4 points of that was organic. So I think as we think about the growth going forward, trading volumes coming off at still 12% in fiscal year '21 over tough comps and maybe less volatility going into fiscal '21. I think we expect to get back in our organic core business back into the 5% to 7% growth range across both of those businesses really driven by net new sales, as Tim talked about earlier, in both our capital markets business and wealth management business. 
In Q4, we were growing over some license revenues, higher license revenues in fiscal year '20 and lower trading volumes. But I think you'll start to see driven by new sales as we get back to the 5% to 7% 3-year objectives that we have across both of our businesses."

So just to be very clear, Robinhood is a Broadridge client but it's not a proxy client currently. So we really don't see any impact on our -- direct impacts on our business. What we do see there, Chris, is we've been really leading in innovation in proxy communications, creating APIs, and I talked about that product rollout and the acceleration of road map, creating opportunities for our clients who leverage that event as an opportunity to really engage their retail clients and for corporations to engage their retail clients. And so we think this is going to create sort of heightened interest in a wide range of communications and engagement topics, all of which we really welcome.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin with our key messages and then provide an overview of our performance against our strategic objectives across governance, capital markets and wealth and investment management. And I'll close with some thoughts about our future before Edmund reviews the financials.  
Let's get started. I have 4 headlines. First, Broadridge delivered a strong fiscal year '21. Recurring revenues rose 10%, adjusted EPS rose 13%, and our sales teams delivered tenth consecutive year of record sales. Our results demonstrate how well-positioned Broadridge is to take advantage of increasing investor participation and the growing need to digitize and mutualize financial services. Second, we're executing against the strategic growth plan we laid out at our Investor Day in December. We're building the next generation of governance products, growing the scope of our capital markets business across the trade life cycle and building our wealth management franchise.  
Third, we remain committed to balanced capital allocation. In fiscal '21, we increased our level of investment on our internal platforms, completed the largest acquisition in our history and returned nearly $250 million in capital to shareholders. Yesterday, our Board approved an 11% increase in our annual dividend per share. Broadridge has now increased its annual dividend every year since becoming a public company with double-digit increases in 8 of the last 9 years.  
Fourth and last, we expect another strong year in fiscal '22. Our guidance calls for 12% to 15% recurring revenue growth, further margin expansion, 11% to 15% adjusted EPS growth and another year of record sales. The combination of strong fiscal year '21 results and our guidance for fiscal '22 leaves Broadridge extremely well-positioned to achieve the higher end of our 3-year growth objectives. As we close out the first year of our current 3-year cycle, I want to give you an update on our progress against our strategic growth plans for each of our 3 franchise businesses, starting with governance or ICS on Slide 4. 
ICS recurring revenue rose 11% in fiscal '21 to $2.1 billion, driven by both new sales and internal growth. The strength of our governance franchise comes from its position at the heart of a network, linking broker-dealers, corporate issuers, asset managers, and tens of millions of individual and institutional investors. Our fiscal '21 results highlight how our strategy of innovating at the core while providing incremental value to all network participants drives incremental and sustainable growth for Broadridge.  
I'll start with our core regulatory business. The big story here is the very strong position growth we're seeing across equities. Equity stock record growth, which is our measure of the number of positions held by shareholders, grew 26% in fiscal '21, including 33% in the seasonally strongest fourth quarter. We continue to be struck by the broad-based nature of this growth. We're seeing growth across large and small issuers not simply a handful of mega cap tech or mean stocks.  
Looking at industry sectors. Tech and consumer cyclical stocks are leading the growth with 42% and 37% growth, respectively. We're also seeing double-digit growth across virtually other sector, including 33% growth in health care names and 20% plus in basic materials and industrials. This broad-based participation is a key reason why we believe that fiscal year '21's strong growth is an extension of the long-term trend that's been driving higher equity and fund position growth over the past decade, and why we're forecasting continued growth in fiscal '22.  
At Broadridge, we're able to meet this increased demand because we've invested in scaling our capacity. After the initial COVID surge last spring, we invested in new distribution capacity to build incremental flexibility across our network, enabling us to seamlessly ensure that holders of more than 500 million positions got the communications they needed to participate in corporate governance. We've also invested in new digital capabilities, including QR codes that make voting on your mobile device easier than ever.  
Our governance franchise is also increasingly global with gains from our Shareholder Rights Directive II solution and the continued expansion of our European fund communications business. We're also expanding the suite of data-driven solutions we provide for funded clients, driven in part by another year of double-digit growth across our data and intelligence products.  
We're growing our relationships with corporate issuers. We conducted almost 2,400 virtual shareholder meetings in fiscal '21, up from 1,500 a year ago. We've become the clear choice for America's leading companies with more than 3/4 of S&P 100 companies using Broadridge to host their annual meetings in 2021. In turn, increased demand for our VSM capabilities has enabled us to deepen our client relationships, leading to strong growth in our suite of other annual meeting services and disclosure solutions products.  
Finally, in customer communications. Our strategy is focused on using our print capability as a door opener for growing our digital business. So it was encouraging to see strong double-digit growth in digital revenues, which offset lower print revenues and helps drive higher earnings. All in all, it was a very strong year for our governance franchise.  
Now let's turn to capital markets on Slide 5. In capital markets, we're driving trading innovation across the front office, enabling our clients to simplify and improve their global post-trade technology, providing strong enterprise and data component solutions and building new network-enabled solutions using AI, digital ledger and other innovative technologies.  
Capital markets revenue grew 8% to $701 million driven by new client additions and the acquisition of Itiviti, which has given us a new capability to drive innovation across the trade life cycle. While the Itiviti integration is only just beginning, I'm excited by the progress we've made. Itiviti recently closed its largest ever sale, and we're on track to leverage Broadridge's relationships to drive more meaningful sales in the quarters ahead. Client feedback has continued to be positive and the sales pipeline, especially in EMEA and APAC, is strong.  
A key driver of our revenue growth is our continued success at bringing clients under our global platforms, enabling them to simplify their global technology. We're also enhancing those platform capabilities. A great example is the exchange-traded derivatives platform onto which we're onboarding R.J. O'Brien.  
I'm also tremendously excited by the continued progress in developing new capabilities based on next-gen AI and DLT technology. Our LTX fixed income platform continues to progress well. We have more than 70 buy and sell-side users on the platform, and we're adding more every week. And the average initiated trade is north of $3.5 million, indicating demand for increased liquidity in fixed income markets. We also recently launched our digital ledger repo platform and are averaging $35 billion worth of transactions daily, a number which will grow as more clients, including UBS, come on to the platform. While both of these products are small today, each is bringing an innovative and differentiated solution to a multibillion-dollar market.  
Now let's turn to our wealth and investment management franchise on Slide 6. In wealth, we're extending our services around our core back office capabilities, growing our suite of component solutions and building a modular platform that will link our individual capabilities across a modern technology architecture. The biggest driver behind our 6% growth in wealth and investment management revenues was revenue from new sales. During the year, we added new clients to both our core back office platform and saw strong demand for our digital solutions suite.  
Our work with UBS on the digital transformation of the wealth management industry remains one of our most exciting initiatives. The Broadridge wealth management platform is an important part of UBS' own multiyear transformation plan for its North American wealth business. As we align around UBS' goals and sequencing, we've already rolled out select components, and we expect to roll out the additional platform components over the next 18 to 24 months. Based on the terms of our contract, we'll begin recognizing revenue when we complete the delivery of the full suite.  
Meanwhile, this platform continues to draw attention from other clients. We were pleased to announce last month that RBC Wealth Management will become our second client on the Broadridge wealth platform. RBC is pursuing its own digital transformation journey, and our platform will accelerate their ability to enhance the client experience, optimize adviser productivity and digitize its back office. We're excited to be a key technology partner in that journey.  
Beyond our work on the wealth platform, we continue to make progress in expanding our digital solutions with the adviser stream tuck-in acquisition and by extending our partner network. Lastly, I was pleased to see strong growth in our investment management technology revenues, which grew by 12%. Strong revenue from sales of existing solutions, continued platform development and new product additions. We're making solid progress on our wealth and investment management growth strategy.  
As I wrap up my strategy update, I want to highlight the common denominator behind our execution across governance, capital markets and wealth and investment management. Broadridge is investing in driving near, medium- and long-term growth. We've invested to process higher position counts, more virtual shareholder meetings and handle surges and trading volumes, which are critical in fiscal '21 and will remain important in fiscal '22 and '23. At the same time, we're investing in initiatives that will carry our growth momentum forward, including our data intelligence products, the emergence of a European governance hub, Itiviti and our wealth platform. 
And finally, I see tangible signs of products that have the potential to extend our growth runway well into the next decade like digital communications, digital ledger repo and fixed income AI. These are solutions that our clients value as evidenced by the traction that we're gaining in the market for each of them. This mix of near-, medium- and long-term growth businesses across the company is exciting. What does that mean for Broadridge? 
Let's turn to Slide 7. As we enter fiscal '22, I've never been more optimistic about Broadridge's long-term growth prospects. When I look across our company, I see a leadership team that's stronger than ever, focused on how we engage our associates, better serve our clients and create value for our shareholders. That team is executing against our growth plans across governance, capital markets and wealth and investment management. We're finding ways to help our clients accelerate digitization, drive mutualization benefits and enable the increasing democratization of investing.  
Even more tangibly, we are on track to deliver another strong year. Our strong backlog gives us visibility into new revenue over the next 12 to 24 months, and we see continued position growth as new investors enter the market and current investors continue to diversify their portfolios. In short, we see another year ahead of low-teens revenue and adjusted EPS growth. The net result of strong fiscal year '21 results, continued execution against our growth strategy and an outlook for continued growth in '22 means that Broadridge is well-positioned to deliver at the higher end of our 3-year growth objectives, including 79% recurring revenue growth and 8% to 12% adjusted EPS growth.  
Before I conclude, I want to thank all Broadridge associates for their work over the past year. Little in the past 12 months has been easy, but they have found a way to adapt to the new virtual environment. They stayed focused on our clients, and they are helping drive the transformation of the financial services industry that is enabling better financial lives for millions. 
Thank you. Let me now turn it over to Edmund."
1032802,1674464173,2374990,"Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc., Q4 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 12, 2021",2021-08-12,"Earnings Calls","Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. As you can see from the financial summary on Slide 8, Broadridge delivered strong fiscal '21 results, capped off by a strong fourth quarter and demonstrating significant progress towards our 3-year objectives. F",2511,"Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. As you can see from the financial summary on Slide 8, Broadridge delivered strong fiscal '21 results, capped off by a strong fourth quarter and demonstrating significant progress towards our 3-year objectives. Fiscal '21 recurring revenues increased 10% to $3.3 billion driven by strong growth in both ICS and GTO. That strong growth enabled us to make the near-, medium- and long-term investments in our technology platforms and our digital products while driving 60 basis points of AOI margin expansion for the year. 
Higher revenues and higher margins drove 13% adjusted EPS growth to $5.66. In the fourth quarter, revenues rose 15% year-over-year to $1.1 billion, driven by growth in ICS and the acquisition of Itiviti. Adjusted operating income rose 4% as we continued our ongoing investments, and adjusted EPS grew 2% to $2.19. Our results came in at the high end of our latest full year guidance range and above our 3-year recurring revenue and adjusted EPS growth objectives. And as Tim has highlighted, our sales team closed the year on a high note and pushed us modestly above our closed sales guidance range. So let's get into the details of those results, starting with recurring revenue on Slide 9. 
The momentum in our business, driven by the trends and increased investor participation in digital solutions, continued into the fourth quarter and helped Broadridge post another year of 10% recurring revenue growth. Our recurring revenue growth was powered by 8% organic growth, which came in well above our 5% to 7% 3-year growth objectives. The combination of organic growth, ,coupled with 2 points of growth from our acquisition of FundsLibrary and Fi360 in fiscal year '20, and then Itiviti in May pushed our fiscal year '21 recurring revenue growth above our 7% to 9% objective as well. So a strong start toward our 3-year recurring revenue growth objectives.  
Now let's look at this quarter's recurring revenue growth by business, beginning with ICS on Slide 10. ICS revenues grew by 17% to $719 million in the fourth quarter, all of that growth organic. The biggest driver of that growth was in our regulatory business, which grew 27% to $381 million. Fourth quarter stock record growth was 33%, and mutual fund record growth was 11%, both key drivers of growth in regulatory. We also benefited from strong growth in international, and our investment in the Shareholder Rights Directive II solution is paying back, and contributing to recurring revenue growth. 
For the full year, regulatory revenues rose 20%. Issuer revenue also contributed to growth, rising 20% in the fourth quarter to $106 million and 21% growth for the full year. As Tim noted, our continued success in providing virtual shareholder meeting services has helped drive revenue growth of our other annual meeting services and document disclosure products.  
Fund solutions lapped the drag from lower interest income and recurring revenue grew 7% in the fourth quarter. Full year revenues rose 5% driven by the fiscal year '20 acquisitions mentioned earlier and revenue from net new business. Customer communication revenues was down 1% in the quarter as declines in the low-margin print revenue offset digital growth. For the full year, customer communications revenue growth was slightly positive, but more importantly, higher margin digital revenues within customer communications grew by 15%.  
Turning to GTO on Slide 11. GTO recurring revenues rose 10% to $346 million in the quarter, driven by 18% growth in our capital markets business and 1% growth in wealth and investment management. Across both capital markets and wealth, solid revenue growth from new business was offset by $7 million of lower license revenue, which declined as expected and modestly lower trading volume. Our acquisition of Itiviti closed in mid-May and contributed $29 million to revenue growth in the capital markets franchise. For the full year, GTO revenues rose 7% to $1.3 billion driven by 4 points of organic growth and 3 points from acquisitions. Organic growth was driven by new sales, and internal growth was essentially flat as the benefit of higher full year trading volumes was offset by lower license revenue, which declined relative to an unusually high fiscal year '20 level. We expect modest growth in license revenues in fiscal year '22. So Broadridge's recurring revenue growth benefited from strong volume growth, both in ICS and our GTO business segment.  
So let's turn to Slide 12 for a closer look at volume trends. Equity stock record growth rose to a record 26% in fiscal '21, well above the 6% to 8% trend in the past decade. Fourth quarter proxy volumes, which accounted for 55% of full year distributions, benefited from 33% stock record growth. We also saw strength in mutual fund and ETF regulatory communications driven by strong fund inflows as we lap last spring's COVID-driven withdrawals. Looking ahead to fiscal '22. We continue to model stock record growth growing at a healthy low teens pace, though the seasonally light first half before reverting to more trend line mid- to high single-digit growth in the much more meaningful seasonal second half. We're also expecting mid- to high single-digit fund record growth.  
Turning to trading volumes on the bottom of the slide. Fourth quarter volumes slipped 1% driven by a combination of tough year-over-year comps and lower overall market volatility. Fourth quarter volumes also declined on a sequential basis as elevated levels in Q3 '21 driven by market volatility subsided. Trading volumes rose 12% for the full year. As we look ahead to fiscal '22, we expect trading volumes to be essentially flat for the year with modestly higher volumes in the first half of the year, offset by lower volumes in the third quarter.  
Shifting to a view of growth drivers of recurring revenue on Slide 13. Organic growth rose to 11% in the fourth quarter, driven by a combination of new sales and the seasonal impact of higher proxy volumes. New sales contributed 6 points to growth with balanced contribution from both ICS and GTO. Internal growth of 7 points was primarily driven by proxy volumes as is typically the case in our fourth quarter. Acquisitions contributed 3 points. Almost all of that came from Itiviti with only a modest contribution from our mid-June acquisition of AdvisorStream. Client losses subtracted 2 points of growth in both the fourth quarter and for the full year, marking another year of 98% client revenue retention rates. High retention rates reflect the value of the services we offer, our commitment to client services and our intangible outcome of our service profit chain culture.  
I'll round out our revenue drivers discussion on Slide 14 with a look at total revenue. Total revenues rose a healthy 12% in the fourth quarter. Recurring revenue was the primary contributor to that growth, and Broadridge will see a further boost from an uptick in event-driven revenues as well as 2 points of growth from higher distribution revenue. While higher distribution revenues contributed to our overall growth, their share of the full year total revenues declined to 31%, down from 32% in fiscal year '20 and 38%, 5 years ago. We expect that the share of low to no margin distribution revenues will continue to decline as we remain focused on growing recurring revenues. FX was a modest positive, reflecting the weakening of the U.S. dollar.  
Looking down the slide. Event-driven revenues rose $5 million year-over-year in the fourth quarter to $73 million, driven by higher proxy contest activity. For the full year, event-driven revenues rebounded from a cyclical load to a healthy $237 million. That rebound was broad-based across the full range of event-driven activities. Higher mutual fund communications contributed to roughly 1/4 of the growth, as did higher revenues from proxy contests as well as higher revenues from capital markets activity and other communications. Going forward, we're not forecasting that a major fund complex goes to proxy. And while there might be some quarterly cyclicality, we expect full year fiscal '22 event-driven revenues to be approximately $220 million, in line with the fiscal year '15 through fiscal year '21 long-term average.  
Turning to Slide 15. For the full year, adjusted operating income margin expanded 60 basis points to 18.1%, slightly ahead of our latest guidance and multiyear objectives. AOI margin declined 180 basis points to 22.8% in the fourth quarter on the back of our planned fiscal year '21 investment spend. We have a strong track record and high confidence in our ability to make growth accretive investments while still expanding margins and delivering near-term profit growth in line with our adjusted EPS 3-year growth objective.  
Before I move to our uses of cash in our balance sheet, let me touch on closed sales in our revenue backlog on Slide 16. Thanks to a strong fourth quarter, Broadridge recorded another year of strong closed sales, with balanced growth across both our ICS and GTO segments. I was especially pleased to see strong growth in our smaller sales, those under $2 million in annualized values, which rose 11%. These small sales represent the bread and butter of our long-term growth and reflect the broad demand we are seeing across our businesses. Our sales performance pushed our overall backlog, a measure of past sales that have not yet been recognized into revenue, to $400 million, up from $355 million last year and steady at 12% of recurring revenue. As a CFO, I appreciate the added visibility into our future revenues that our backlog gives me.  
Moving to capital allocation on the next slide. Broadridge remains committed to a capital allocation policy that balances internal investment, M&A and capital returned to shareholders. In fiscal year '21, we generated $557 million of free cash flow, up $58 million from fiscal year '20. Given the size of the market opportunity we see in front of us, we're continuing to prioritize making investments in our business, both internal and external. The biggest use of our cash was the $2.6 billion acquisition of Itiviti, which was completed in the fourth quarter. And late in the fourth quarter, we also completed the additional tuck-in acquisition of AdvisorStream. Since the close of the quarter, we've made 2 more very small tuck-in acquisitions for the assets of Jordan & Jordan and the remaining share of Alpha Omega. We invested almost $300 million in continued platform build-outs as we add to our capabilities across wealth management and capital markets and another $100 million in CapEx and software development.  
Total capital return to shareholders was $248 million. The 11% increase in our annual dividend approved by our board was in line with our long-term 45% payout ratio policy and will increase capital returns in fiscal year '22. As a result of the Itiviti acquisition, our total debt rose to $3.9 billion, up from $1.8 billion at the end of fiscal year '20. Our leverage ratio at year-end was 3.5x. We remain focused on an investment-grade credit rating and target a 2.5x leverage ratio by the end of fiscal '23.  
I'll close my prepared remarks this morning with some comments on our fiscal year '22 guidance, which is on Slide 18. Our guidance for fiscal '22 calls for low-teen recurring revenue growth, healthy margin expansion and another year of strong adjusted EPS growth.  
Let's take each point in turn, starting with recurring revenues. We expect to grow recurring revenues by 12% to 15% in fiscal year '22. That includes organic revenue growth of 5% to 7% with growth balanced across both ICS and GTO. We're not modeling in any revenue contribution from the UBS contract in fiscal '22. As Tim noted, we expect to complete the rollout of the full wealth management platform suite over the next 18 to 24 months, and we'll begin to recognize revenues at that time. We expect the contribution from acquisitions to add an additional 7 to 8 points, with most of that coming from Itiviti. Our more recent acquisitions of AdvisorStream, J&J and Alpha Omega should contribute less than $10 million combined to fiscal '22 recurring revenues. As always, we do not forecast the impact of any future tuck-in acquisitions that we might make.  
In addition to recurring revenue, we expect mid-single-digit distribution revenue growth, driven in part by a postal rate increase. Event-driven revenue should, as I indicated earlier, be more in line with our fiscal '15 to '21 7-year average level of approximately $220 million. For modeling purposes, between recurring revenue, distribution and event-driven revenues, total revenue growth should be in the range of 9% to 13%. We are expecting our adjusted operating income margin of approximately 19%, up from 18.1% in fiscal year '21, driven by a combination of incremental scale, digital and efficiency gains as well as the addition of the higher-margin Itiviti business. 
Finally, we expect adjusted EPS growth to be in a range of 11% to 15%. Included in our EPS outlook is an expectation that the tax rate will essentially be flat at approximately 21% and that we'll see a modest increase in our overall share count. On our last guidance point, we expect another year of record closed sales. Our outlook calls for closed sales in the range of $240 million to $280 million. This guidance emphasizes the strength of our financial model and our ability to drive sustainable revenue growth, expand our margins while maintaining a balanced capital allocation policy in delivering steady and consistent adjusted EPS growth.  
That concludes my remarks on our fiscal year '22 guidance. But before I turn the call over for your questions, I have one more final administrative note. Beginning with our first quarter results. We'll be updating how we report foreign exchange. As you know, we've historically used a fixed exchange rate for our segment revenues and for recurring revenue. The difference between the fixed internal rate and the actual rate are recorded in our FX revenue line, which was negative $132 million in fiscal year '21. With the continued growth in our international revenues, especially after the acquisition of Itiviti, the time is right to adjust our reporting. Going forward, we will be changing our internal rate to one that is much closer to the actual rate. This will have the impact of shrinking our reported negative FX revenue to a much smaller number and lowering our segment and recurring revenue numbers by the same amount. 
These changes will have no significant impact on our reported recurring revenue growth rate nor will they have any impact on our reported total revenue or profitability metrics. We intend to publish our historical revenue results at a restated rate, ahead of our first quarter earnings so that you have a chance to adjust your models. Again, this is a change that will begin with our first quarter earnings report. It will lower our reported recurring revenue with little, if any, change to growth rates and will have no impact on total revenue, operating profit or adjusted EPS. 
With that administrative note out of the way, let's open up the call for your questions. Operator?"

Look, first, I'd start off by saying that the fiscal '22 growth is strong across both our organic business and the contribution from acquisitions, and I think positions us well for the 3-year -- against the 3-year objectives that we have, positions us well to be towards the high end of that. We still need to execute on sales, converting our sales to revenue and the Itiviti integration. We feel very confident with that, and I think that will actually position us well. 
I think as we think about some of the areas, you've heard us say earlier that we're positioning volume growth to return to mid-single-digit levels. That obviously can be a tailwind, but we feel confident based on our view into the first -- the next 2 quarters that, that is -- that we can expect that level. Event-driven revenues, I think, is also something that, on a quarterly level, has been quite cyclical. We've returned to more historical levels this year in fiscal year '21, and I think that growth was broad-based. So we feel confident about that as we go into fiscal year '22 as well. And I'll tell you that we feel good about the margin expansion that helps us get to a strong point from an adjusted EPS growth standpoint as well. That's driven both by Itiviti and the continued scale and efficiency gains that we get in our core business as well. 
So as you think about the variability in our model going into fiscal year '22, I think we will continue to focus on executing on sales, converting that sales to revenue, driving the Itiviti integration. I think event-driven revenue's more in line with what we've historically seen, and volumes are back to mid-single-digit levels. And I think that's what drives the range for us. And Tim might want to add a point just about the strategy there."

You look at our funds business and the investments that we've been making in our data and intelligence business, that continues to be a very strong growth for us, and we see a lot of future runway there. We've been investing clearly in our VSM capability but also in our disclosure business for corporate issuers and, of course, our ongoing investments in digital communications. So right across the whole governance suite, you see investments in each of those areas. And when you look at the product road map, we're able to accelerate some of those product road maps. If you look at the number of innovations that we have delivered over the past 18 months in things like core proxy and core distribution regulatory communications, it's -- is markedly up. And then on the capital markets and wealth management side, really there, the investments in things like digital ledger repo, things like LTX, applying AI to fixed income trading, making a big difference. And so we're just excited across the whole portfolio. And you are -- that's why you're seeing strength in the underlying growth in each of those areas."

I think that really shows how, as we continue to add on new solutions. Like Itiviti, we see an increased market for us that brought to us in a lot of additional sales resources. And so we do see higher sales for us. 
In terms of how that will affect the backlog, it is -- when you look at the mix of sales, we had a lot of sales this year that were not strategic sales. They were a lot -- we hit a lot of singles this year. And as we bring on the Itiviti sales, those also tend to be a little bit smaller, a little bit faster to implement. So I think sometimes when you see the mix between some of those very large strategic projects and the singles and doubles, the singles and doubles come online usually sort of within a year versus within 2 years. And so I think we may see some fluctuations in backlog. I'm not sure what -- how to imply what that means for the momentum of our business. It does flex a little bit based on the product mix. 
What I will say, though, is seeing that backlog grow again this year, having $400 million of revenue that we know is going to come live over the next 2 years. It gives us a lot of confidence in the revenue from sales portion of our growth formula, and that is the largest part of our growth formula. And so it's -- as CEO, and when you think about the environment that we have out there and all the concerns, we have to know that, that revenue is already been sold. The projects are in sight. It's happening. It gives a lot of confidence in that. And it makes me sleep just a little bit better at night."

The record growth this year, very broad-based, which really reinforces our view that is part of these long term trends. 
In terms of the investments to support it, it was really around ensuring that the resiliency of the network and being able to produce sort of all output from multiple places.

We look at we have some insight into stock record positions for companies that we expect a proxy in the next 1 to 2 quarters. And when you look at that testing, which I would say covers the large majority of distributions. And maybe there's some movement between the time that we test and the time that we actually mail, but the information has been quite reliable, and when you look at that, you see what we said in my prepared remarks, low-teen growth through the first half of the year. And mind you, that's coming off of 16% growth in Q1 last year and 24% growth in Q2 of last year. So low teen growth coming off of that. And that's helpful, that gives us great insight. 
But I'll remind you that the first half is our seasonally light period of the year. If you look at '21 or look at '20, the first half of the year was 13% of overall volumes. So what really is more important is the back half of the year, and we are assuming and modeling more normal levels in the second half of the year that we return to historical levels, and you combine that, and that's what gets us to the mid- to high single-digit growth levels. So you're not -- I don't expect to see 33% and 26% coming out of the fourth and full year numbers that we see, but we have good insight into the next 6 months or so. And I think what we have modeled positions us well, first of all, for fiscal year '22 and gives us confidence in that. 
As we think about the margins of the business, clearly, overall in our business, what we're able to drive, bringing on new customers without -- a new business without incremental cost to scale in our business, the efficiency gains that we're able to get, I think, helps us be able to expand margins, but specifically on print and digital. It was good to see our customer communications business, not just driving the earnings growth that we've seen there but now to see digital, which is a higher-margin business because there's very low to no margin in the distribution revenue, starting to grow in recurring revenue, which is a higher business for us. So you might see lower revenue in that business, but it comes at a higher margin, and we feel good about the progress we're making on that."

If you were to look back at Q3, you would have seen the opposite of what you saw in the fourth quarter in terms of more of the growth being in wealth management and less being in capital markets. We're coming off a year of 7% growth in GTO. That, I think, is the important thing. Now 3 points of that is driven by the Itiviti acquisition and 4 points of that was organic. So I think as we think about the growth going forward, trading volumes coming off at still 12% in fiscal year '21, over tough comps and maybe less volatility going into fiscal '21. I think we expect to get back in our organic core business back into the 5% to 7% growth range, across both of those businesses really driven by net new sales, as Tim talked about earlier, in both our capital markets business and wealth management business. In Q4, we were growing over some license revenues, higher license revenues in fiscal year '20 and lower trading volumes. But I think you'll start to see driven by new sales as we get back to the 5% to 7% 3-year objectives that we have across both of our businesses."

So just to be very clear, Robinhood is a Broadridge client but it's not a proxy client currently. So we really don't see any impact on our -- direct impacts on our business. What we do see there, Chris, is we've been really leading in innovation in proxy communications, creating APIs.

I think the key thing about event-driven revenue, though, is that as I looked at fiscal year '21, the growth, as I said in my prepared remarks, was broad-based. So it wasn't any one particular contest that drove the growth that was across mutual fund proxy. It was across content. It was across capital markets. And I don't think we're looking for any big one item in fiscal year '22 either. So I think that gives us confidence that we'll return back to the type of average full year numbers that you've seen over the last 7 years."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'll begin with an overview of our key messages and some highlights from our strong first quarter.

I'll begin with an overview of our key messages and some highlights from our strong first quarter. Next, I'll provide an update on execution against our growth strategy across our 3 franchises. Finally, I'll close with some thoughts on how Broadridge is continuing to drive long-term sustainable growth. 
Let's get started. Our first quarter results marked a strong start to the fiscal year. Recurring revenues rose 16% and adjusted EPS rose 9%. 
Second, our top line growth continues to be propelled by a combination of our own actions and strong underlying market trends. The biggest driver of our 7% organic growth across all 3 of our businesses was the onboarding of closed sales as we continue to convert our $385 million backlog into recurring revenue. 
We also benefited from the continued tailwind of very healthy position growth in governance, driven by ongoing trends. 
Third, we continue to execute on our long-term growth plans across our governance, capital markets and wealth and investment management franchises. I'll provide an update on our execution steps in a few moments. 
Finally, our strong start to the year puts us in a very good position to reaffirm our full year guidance, including 12% to 15% recurring revenue growth and 11% to 15% adjusted EPS growth. It also keeps us on track to deliver at the higher end of our 3-year growth objectives. 
Beyond those 3-year objectives, we are focused on delivering sustainable long-term growth driven by ongoing industry trends and investments across our governance, capital markets and wealth franchises and in turn, generating consistent top quartile shareholder returns. Generating those returns requires consistent execution. So let's turn to Slide 5 for an update on our growth strategy, starting with governance. 
Our governance business had a very strong first quarter. ICS recurring revenues rose 11% to $410 million. As I noted earlier, the biggest driver of that growth was revenue from closed sales. 
The other key driver continued to be position growth, which reached 39% for equity proxies in a small quarter and 9% for funds and ETFs. 
In equities, the growth continues to be broad-based across all market caps in multiple industries. In funds, much of the growth is being propelled by ETFs. 
Over the past decade, the number of both equity and funded ETF shareholders has risen at a high single-digit rate, propelled by the ongoing democratization of investing. 
We're also extending our governance franchise to enable voting choice. Many of you saw the announcement from BlackRock a few weeks ago that they will implement pass-through voting for their institutional investors. Climate change and ESG more broadly are becoming increasingly important to investors, and they're demanding to have greater transparency and voice in the actions that companies they own are taking to address these issues. Broadridge is playing a key role in helping BlackRock implement this important change. 
We have been working with them over an extended period to leverage our infrastructure to enable pass-through voting. It's a great example of how our expertise in managing preferences and voting and our 24/7 SaaS platform is helping our fund industry clients. 
Given the increasing importance of ESG, -- We're hearing from others in the industry, seeking to offer a similar service to their clients over time. 
Moving to capital markets. We continue to make progress in growing our franchise with revenues rising 34% to $209 million driven primarily by the integration of activity, which is going well. Our newly combined capital markets team has hit the ground running and finding complementary product opportunities that leverage our pre and post rate expertise and client reach. For example, we recently announced the integration of [indiscernible] solution with Broadridge's buy-side portfolio order and investment management system. This will enable Broadridge's clients to achieve greater automation in their post-trade workflows and is a tangible step toward integrating our solutions across the trade life cycle. 
Outside of activity, we brought live another large U.S. bank with a global business to our GPTM capital markets technology platform. The first phase of this onboarding, covering global fixed income is a result of over 2 years of platform investment. We expect to roll out additional phases, including the expansion of equities over the coming quarters. 
In Wealth and Investment Management, revenues rose 6% to $131 million. We continue to make steady progress in developing our Broadridge Wealth Management platform, while also delivering component solutions. 
For example, we were recently selected by a leading Canadian pension plan to leverage our investment management, private debt and loan solutions to help them manage their alternative asset portfolio. 
I want to wrap up by giving you my perspective on what our continued execution means for Broadridge and our investors. So let's turn to Slide 6.-- Our strong first quarter results reflect the underlying growth trends powering our business and the execution of the clear growth plan we laid out at our Investor Day 11 months ago. We're extending our governance capabilities to cover more investors, more geographies and more issuers. We're building the data-driven solutions for the fund industry and the digital communications infrastructure that helps companies increase the effectiveness and lower the cost of their client communications. We're growing our capital markets franchise by adding new clients under our platforms and integrating the front office capabilities we acquired Motivity. And we're building our wealth and new medical management franchise by adding more component solutions and creating a next-generation wealth management technology platform. 
The critical factor underlying all this execution has been and will continue to be investment in our technology and digital platforms. We're pursuing a $52 billion market opportunity that's continuing to evolve. The long-term trends, drive that evolution, including the ongoing democratization of investing, which in turn is driving and being driven by greater digitization were only accelerated by the pandemic. Those same trends are powering our growth and creating an imperative for investment by our clients in the next-generation technology we provide. 
We're all hearing a lot these days about the ""democratization"" of investing. But what we are seeing now is a continuation of a 50-year trend driven by the ongoing combination of new technology and reduced trading costs. These forces have led to continued innovation from discount brokerage to online trading, to 401, ETFs and managed accounts. 
More recently, modern user interface, 0 commission trading and the pandemic have accelerated this long-term trend. 
Together, these forces have made investing consistently more cost-effective and more accessible for more people. For Broadridge, this has supported high single-digit growth over the last decade in the number of positions we serve. Going forward, more innovations, including direct indexing, will support continued growth. So we expect that same high single-digit growth for many years to come. It's worth noting that democratization is also playing a part in the increasing importance of ESG, which further underlines the importance of what Broadridge does. As new investors come to the market and new innovations drive increased diversification. It's critical that investors get to shareholder disclosures and other communications they need to make informed decisions. 
Investors are also seeking to exercise their vote on how issuers and funds should approach ESG issues. Our 24/7 SaaS technology platform plays a critical role in powering that system of corporate governance. And these trends are making governance, voting and disclosures an even more important part of the investment process. We have built that platform through continuous innovation and investment to link tens of thousands of corporate issuers and funds with hundreds of banks and broker-dealers and tens of millions of institute individual investors. Our platform is constantly monitoring and validating positions across more than 100 million retail and 270,000 institutional accounts. 
Every day, we collect, maintain and manage the investor preferences that are critical to driving digital distribution. 
Doing so effectively, and securely requires investment in continuous monitoring to provide the highest levels of data security. It also requires us to serve our bank and broker-dealer clients with co-branded communications, client service and integrated billing and collections to greatly simplify the entire ecosystem. 
As a result, we've built a 24/7 proxy and fund information infrastructure, which delivers highly accurate voting for thousands of annual meetings and whose efficiency saves funds and corporate issuers hundreds of millions of dollars each year. Thanks to our investments in it. is also increasingly green, driving down paper and mail volumes and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
So we will continue to invest in extending that network to enable expanded voting, enhance shareholder communications and to better gather and share data analytics that helps funds and issuers better understand changes in their investor base. 
Digitization is the second trend that's been accelerated by the pandemic and which is driving our growth. It's reducing costs for our clients, broadening their reach and accelerating processes on account only to trade settlement and communications. It's being facilitated by the rapid adoption of next-generation technologies. The move to the cloud enables a scalable variable cost computing architecture, which is changing our clients' business models. Data analytics, and AI are transforming how clients make decisions and power their investment processes. The move to digital technology and financial services has been both a driver and beneficiary of market democratization. Financial services need technology and scale to compete in today's complex markets, and Broadridge provides both. Our SaaS technology is an unmet for accelerated digitization with next-generation technology. We're delivering blockchain solutions to the retail market, AI-driven trading to fixed income and enhanced virtual and meeting experience among many other examples, bringing new technologies to our clients with mutualized solutions at scale is a core part of our strategy. 
Past investments have put Broadridge in a position to help our clients today. With the acceleration of demolition and digitization, the opportunity to invest for the future is as high as ever. We're investing to build new platforms and solutions, including our broader Wealth platform. Consistent with our history, we'll also actively seek out M&A opportunities that meet our strategic and financial criteria. 
Collectively, this investment strategy has and will continue to extend our capabilities and governance, including data analytics, capital markets, including most recently phone office trading and wealth and investment management. I'm confident that these investments will only further strengthen our position as an innovation enabler for our clients and reinforce our long-term growth. 
Finally, any focus on sustainable, long-term growth must be grounded in meeting the needs of all stakeholders. At Broadridge, that focus starts with our culture, anchored in the service profit chain that puts associate engagement at the core of our business approach. It extends to our clients and communities as well as our shareholders. I encourage you to read our recently released sustainability report. You'll learn about how we are building the most engaging workplace for the most talented associates in our industry, the efforts we make to keep our clients' data secure, our success in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and much more. 
Before turning the call to Edmund, I'd like to thank the thousands of dedicated and talented Broadridge associates that have made these results and future opportunities possible. They are the foundation of our success. 
Let me briefly sum up. Broadridge delivered a strong quarter driven by continued execution and powerful underlying growth trends. We are executing on our long-term growth strategy and are committed to making investments that will create additional opportunities. And we're doing it the right way by also driving associate engagement, making a positive impact on our communities, reducing our environmental footprint and improving the financial lives of millions. I'm confident that Broadridge is on track to achieve the higher end of our 3-year growth objectives and is well positioned to drive sustainable growth for the long term. 
And now let me turn to Edmund for a review of our financial results. Edmund?"
1032802,1685595101,2422731,"Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2021",2021-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. As you've just heard from Tim, we are pleased with how our strategy is progressing. It's good to be here to discuss another quarter of strong financial performance, driven by new sales, strong underlying volume",1719,"Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. As you've just heard from Tim, we are pleased with how our strategy is progressing. It's good to be here to discuss another quarter of strong financial performance, driven by new sales, strong underlying volume trends in the acquisition of ltiviti. You can see that strong performance in the financial summary on Slide 7, which shows that recurring revenues grew 16% to $751 million. 
Adjusted operating income rose 17% to $177 million, with AOI margins flat to last year at 14.8%, reflecting our continued ability to find efficiencies and gain operating leverage through our scale, allowing us to invest in our technology and digital platforms. 
That growth in operating income was partially offset by higher interest expense related to financing the Itiviti acquisition. As a result, adjusted EPS rose 9% to $1.07. 
Let's get into the details of those results, starting with the recurring revenue on Slide 8. Recurring revenues grew from $650 million in Q1 '21 to $751 million in Q1 in '22 and an increase of 16%. Organic recurring revenue grew at 7% and came in at the high end of our 5% to 7% 3-year objectives, reflecting the continued momentum from our sales and revenue backlog and increased investor participation. The contribution from acquisitions, primarily our continued success integrating activity, added another 9 points to recurring revenue growth. 
Now let's turn to Slide 9 and look at the growth across our ICS and GTO businesses. We reported double-digit recurring revenue growth in both of our segments. 
ICS recurring revenue grew by 11%, all organic to $410 million, propelled by a combination of new sales and strong volumes. Regulatory revenues rose 23% to $165 million, powered by higher mutual funded ETF communications, strong equity position growth in the U.S. and closed sales revenue. 
Growth was also strong in our international proxy business led in part by strong performance in Canada. Our issuer business also contributed to our overall growth rate to strong sales of our disclosure products. 
And as expected, we are also benefiting from high retention of our virtual shareholder meeting solution. 
Data-driven Fund Solutions revenue grew 5% to $83 million, boosted by an increase in revenue from assets under administration and revenue from new sales of our data and analytics products. 
Finally, customer communications revenues rose 2% driven by new sales and growth in digital. 
In turning to GTO, recurring revenues grew 21% to $341 million and 2% organic. Wealth and Investment Management revenues rose 6%, driven by the onboarding of new component sales and higher retail trading. Capital Markets revenues increased 34% as we benefited from a full quarter of Itiviti revenue. Excluding activity, organic growth was slightly negative as lower license and consulting revenue was offset by strong revenue growth from new business, including revenues from onboarding of the major U.S. bank that Tim mentioned. 
Going forward, we expect revenue from closed sales fueled by our healthy revenue backlog will drive strong growth over the balance of the year. So let's turn to Slide 10 for a closer look at the volume trends. Broadridge continued to benefit from strong volume trends in the first quarter. The biggest driver of our rental growth was mutual fund and ETF record growth, which rose 9% and driven by healthy markets and strong inflows. 
Equity record growth was 39% in a seasonally small quarter. So keep in mind that the first quarter historically represents approximately 5% of full year equity communications with more than 80% coming in the fiscal third and fourth quarters. While mutual funded ETF communications are more balanced through the year. 
Looking ahead, our testing of record positions is showing continued strong growth trends in the seasonally larger second half with high single-digit growth indicated for both equities and funds. 
On the bottom of the slide, we saw a modest 2% increase in our trading volumes as higher fixed income volumes were offset by lower equity volumes. Our outlook for the balance of the year assumes flat trading volumes. 
Turning to Slide 11, where we summarize the drivers of recurring revenue growth. Recurring revenues rose 16%, powered by 7% organic growth and 9 points from acquisitions. Revenue from closed sales was the biggest driver of our organic growth. We saw strong contribution from sales across both ICS and GTO. Our recurring revenue retention rate remained unchanged at 98% and internal growth contributed another 2 points as growth in ICS outpaced the decline in GTO. 
Activity was the biggest driver of our acquisition growth, contributing $54 million the growth with a much smaller contribution from the tuck-in acquisitions we made late in Q4 and in early Q1.
Now we'll turn to Slide 12 to review the drivers of total revenue and for some additional color on our strong event-driven revenues. Total revenue growth was 17% as strong recurring revenue growth was accompanied by 4 points of growth from higher distribution revenue and 3 points from event-driven revenues. Low to no margin distribution revenues grew 11% year-over-year, primarily resulting from higher customer communications mailings. 
Higher postage rates were a small factor in the first quarter but will be a more significant contributor to distribution revenues for the remainder of the year. So we expect continued high levels of distribution revenue growth for the full year. 
And as I've previously noted, over the long term, we expect that the share of distribution revenue as a percentage of total revenue will continue to decline as we remain focused on growing recurring revenue. 
Event-driven revenues rose to $76 million in the quarter, driven by higher mutual fund proxies. Q1 '22 did benefit from a large fund proxy that was originally expected in Q3 '22. 
Despite this timing benefit, and given the strong start to the year, we now expect event-driven revenues for the full year to be modestly ahead of our $220 million 7-year average. For modeling purposes, we're expecting Q2 to Q4 to be in line with our 55 million 7-year quarterly average. 
Rounding out revenue drivers, changes in FX contributed a point to our growth. As previously disclosed, we changed our FX reporting methodology to better align the presentation of our key metrics with current FX rates. You can find our comparable revenue, segment profitability and closed sales numbers for fiscal '20 and '21 in the 8-K we filed at the end of September and in the appendix to the slides. 
So let's now move to margins on Slide 13. Adjusted operating income margin was flat at 14.8% in the first quarter. The positive impact of strong recurring and event-driven growth was offset by growth investments and an increase in low-margin distribution revenue. We continue to expect AOI margin of approximately 19% for the full year as we benefit from the higher-margin activity revenues and continued margin expansion in our organic business, offsetting the greater-than-expected higher growth and low margin distribution revenues. 
Moving on to close sales on Slide 14. Closed sales of $30 million were essentially flat year-over-year. And closed sales were balanced across both our ICS and GTO segments, and we continue to see over 2/3 of our sales in smaller core deals. Those under $2 million in annualized value. That gives us confidence in the broad demand and long-term growth of our digital products. We remain on track to deliver $240 million to $280 million in closed sales for the full year. 
And finally, cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 15. The Broadridge's cash flow generation is typically negative in the fiscal first quarter and strengthens throughout the year, and Q1 '22 was no exception with negative free cash flow of $151 million. 
Turning the uses of capital, we continue to invest in our long-term growth. A big part of that investment is the technology platforms we're building in capital markets and wealth. These new platforms require upfront investment to build new capabilities and convert new clients. We invested $82 million in our platforms during the first quarter. Our investment in our next-generation wealth management platform is an important part of that, but we're also investing in other platforms such as our global post-trade management or GPTM solution. All of these investments are tied to long-term client contracts and strengthen our capabilities across capital markets and wealth management. We will continue to prioritize these internal investments in our technology platforms as part of our capital allocation model. And we're excited about the growth from new client revenues as we convert clients onto the new platforms. 
As we integrate activity, continued M&A remains a focus. During the quarter, we had a modest minority investment and invested $13 million in the pair of tuck-in acquisitions within our Capital Markets business. 
Looking forward, you can expect us to continue investing in our platforms and allocating capital to targeted M&A opportunities that meet our high strategic criteria and financial profile. And we will continue to return capital to shareholders, primarily through our dividend as we remain focused on paying down debt and maintaining an investment-grade credit rating. 
I'll close my prepared remarks with a quick review of our guidance and some final thoughts on our first quarter results. We are reaffirming our full year guidance on all of our key financial metrics. We continue to expect 12% to 15% recurring revenue growth, adjusted operating income margin of approximately 19% and adjusted EPS growth of 11% to 15%. I'll note that over the last 5 years, the first half has typically represented less than 30% of our full year adjusted EPS, and I expect that trend to hold in fiscal year '22. 
Finally, as I noted earlier, we expect closed sales in the range of $240 million to $280 million. 
And with that, let me reiterate today's key messages. Broadridge delivered strong first quarter results with 16% recurring revenue growth driven by new sales, strong underlying volume trends and the acquisition of ltiviti. We are reaffirming our guidance for a strong fiscal year 2022, and we are investing in our business as we pursue our $52 billion addressable market. As a result, we are well positioned to deliver at the high end of our 3-year objectives, and we see a long run rate for continued growth. So with that, let's take your questions. Let me turn it back to the operator."

So I'm curious to hear where the bookings are coming in that category and what kind of play out that could be in the next couple of years?"

And then I'll let Edmund take you through sort of the broader pipeline and momentum in capital markets. 
So on the wealth management side, and I think as we said before, this transformation of wealth management is one of our most exciting opportunities. And we continue to drive with UBS on bringing that forward. We've had just last week, we spent time with the senior leadership and really feeling good about how the partnership is working and making really strong progress in building the new capabilities and the pretty complex work of decommissioning was a very tenured platform. So we are, as you know, already live with some applications. We're working with UBS to sequencing bringing forward the additional solutions that will align with the pace of their broader digital transformation. We expect to implement that in phases over the next 18 to 24 months. As you remember, the way we do our revenue recognition we'll begin recognizing revenue when that becomes fully live. And so in the meantime, the net of that goes on to our balance sheet, which you'll see in coming quarters. So we feel good about it. 
We think, though, on the revenue side for that particular initiative, it will be a ways out before you begin to see it. But we're continuing to hear validation with other clients, good progress with and good discussions with others. So that's sort of the update on the wealth management piece. Obviously, in the mean we continue to make strong progress with our component sales on the wealth management side. The view of where we are in capital markets and sort of the overall momentum. Let me just let Edmund comment on that."

I want to start with just saying that GTO continues to be a very healthy franchise with over $30 billion when you look at Capital Markets and Wealth Management inside of that $30 billion in market opportunity. We're coming off a strong year in GTO overall at 7% in fiscal year '21 and now, 21% this year. A lot of that is activity, of course, but the organic business in GTO was 2% growth. And it's just -- as Tim just talked about the wealth management business, if you think about that component, it grew at 6% for the quarter. That's well within our 5% to 7% organic growth objectives, and that's coming from continued onboarding of new sales and the retail trading that we've seen. The organic business in the capital markets in the first quarter was slightly negative. I mentioned in my remarks that lower license revenue and lower consulting revenue was the driver of that. But to your question, we have a strong pipeline to onboard. We mentioned earlier our recurring revenue backlog of $385 million, a large chunk of that is GTO. So we look to have license revenue growth in the back half of the year. Flat trading growth and continue to onboard that pipeline. That puts us in a position where we expect the capital markets business to also be within our 5- to 7-year growth objectives. And I think that's a great place to be with both of these franchises well within our organic overall growth ranges."

I think the important story within customer communications is a little bit sort of deeper than this top line number, even though it's nice to see that top line number positive. It's really around the transition within that business, paper to digital. And as you know, we've grown the digital business inside that at double digits the past 2 years.

Medium term, we think the really nice opportunity to bring activity to Broadridge clients in North America, leverage our strength in fixed income and other new asset classes. And then longer term, we talked about linking front and back office and really bringing data from the back office into the front and also making that whole fund back office more seamless and cost effective. So we are seeing really nice signs of affirmation of that. We're seeing really nice demand from clients to have discussions about that and continued interest in having alternatives to existing providers. So really high client engagement around that long-term thesis. 
And in the meantime, the integration is going well. The combined Capital Markets team, as I said in my remarks, is making great strides in the integration.

So the investments that we're deploying in this quarter and for the rest of the year, will go towards activity as we look to build capabilities front to back as well. So we feel good about the progress. The last thing I'd say about it. As I've mentioned to you that acquisitions would be 7% to 8% of contribution, and you saw strong reaffirmation of that in the first quarter with 9 points of our recurring revenue growth from acquisitions. And for our 3-year objectives, I think since we brought activity on, we'll see 2 points of contribution to adjusted EPS growth.

Our recent testing shows that Q2 is normalizing a bit to be closer to 20%. Now that's a nice uptick from the low teen growth that we saw in testing just a few months ago. I will mention that you should keep in mind that the first half is a much lighter component of the volumes. Last year, I think we showed in the slide that last year, the first half was about 13%. Over 80% of the volumes are in the back half of the year, the third and the fourth quarter in our mid-October testing for that suggests high single-digit growth for the second half of the year.

I think the interesting question is as others look at this, would it come to the retail and ETS side. And in which case, it could become a revenue driver. I would think that by long term that kind of thing. So I'm not -- I wouldn't be thinking about anything at all near term. But as you think about the kinds of things that continue to support that high mid-single or high single-digit position growth, it could be a factor over time. 
I do think that topic around increasing importance of governance, that's a clear positive for Broadridge, whether it's institutional or retail and the fact that BlackRock world's largest global asset manager is taking a step, I think, is really making people take a hard look at this."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'll begin with an overview of our key messages and some highlights from our strong first quarter.

I'll begin with an overview of our key messages and some highlights from our strong first quarter. Next, I'll provide an update on execution against our growth strategy across our 3 franchises. Finally, I'll close with some thoughts on how Broadridge is continuing to drive long-term sustainable growth.  
Let's get started. Our first quarter results marked a strong start to the fiscal year. Recurring revenues rose 16% and adjusted EPS rose 9%.  
Second, our top line growth continues to be propelled by a combination of our own actions and strong underlying market trends. The biggest driver of our 7% organic growth across all 3 of our businesses was the onboarding of closed sales as we continue to convert our $385 million backlog into recurring revenue. We also benefited from the continued tailwind of very healthy position growth in governance, driven by ongoing trends.  
Third, we continue to execute on our long-term growth plans across our governance, capital markets and wealth and investment management franchises. I'll provide an update on our execution steps in a few moments.  
Finally, our strong start to the year puts us in a very good position to reaffirm our full year guidance, including 12% to 15% recurring revenue growth and 11% to 15% adjusted EPS growth. It also keeps us on track to deliver at the higher end of our 3-year growth objectives.  
Beyond those 3-year objectives, we are focused on delivering sustainable long-term growth driven by ongoing industry trends and investments across our governance, capital markets and wealth franchises and in turn, generating consistent top quartile shareholder returns. 
Generating those returns requires consistent execution. So let's turn to Slide 5 for an update on our growth strategy, starting with governance.  
Our governance business had a very strong first quarter. ICS recurring revenues rose 11% to $410 million. As I noted earlier, the biggest driver of that growth was revenue from closed sales. The other key driver continued to be position growth, which reached 39% for equity proxies in a small quarter, and 9% for funds and ETFs. In equities, the growth continues to be broad-based across all market caps in multiple industries. In funds, much of the growth is being propelled by ETFs.  
Over the past decade, the number of both equity and funded ETF shareholders has risen at a high single-digit rate, propelled by the ongoing democratization of investing.  
We're also extending our governance franchise to enable voting choice. Many of you saw the announcement from BlackRock a few weeks ago that they will implement pass-through voting for their institutional investors. Climate change and ESG more broadly are becoming increasingly important to investors, and they're demanding to have greater transparency and voice in the actions that companies they own are taking to address these issues. 
Broadridge is playing a key role in helping BlackRock implement this important change. We have been working with them over an extended period to leverage our infrastructure to enable pass-through voting. It's a great example of how our expertise in managing preferences and voting and our 24/7 SaaS platform is helping our fund industry clients.  
Given the increasing importance of ESG, we're hearing from others in the industry, seeking to offer a similar service to their clients over time.  
Moving to capital markets. We continue to make progress in growing our franchise with revenues rising 34% to $209 million driven primarily by the integration of Itiviti, which is going well. Our newly combined capital markets team has hit the ground running in finding complementary product opportunities that leverage our pre and post rate expertise and client reach. For example, we recently announced the integration of Itiviti's NYFIX solution with Broadridge's buy-side portfolio order and investment management system. This will enable Broadridge's clients to achieve greater automation in their post-trade workflows and is a tangible step toward integrating our solutions across the trade life cycle.  
Outside of Itiviti, we brought live another large U.S. bank with a global business to our GPTM capital markets technology platform. The first phase of this onboarding, covering global fixed income, is a result of over 2 years of platform investment. We expect to roll out additional phases, including the expansion of equities over the coming quarters.  
In wealth and investment management, revenues rose 6% to $131 million. We continue to make steady progress in developing our Broadridge wealth management platform, while also delivering component solutions. For example, we were recently selected by a leading Canadian pension plan to leverage our investment management private debt and loan solutions to help them manage their alternative asset portfolio.  
I want to wrap up by giving you my perspective on what our continued execution means for Broadridge and our investors. So let's turn to Slide 6. 
Our strong first quarter results reflect the underlying growth trends powering our business and the execution of the clear growth plan we laid out at our Investor Day 11 months ago. We're extending our governance capabilities to cover more investors, more geographies and more issuers. We're building the data-driven solutions for the fund industry and the digital communications infrastructure that helps companies increase the effectiveness and lower the cost of their client communications. We're growing our capital markets franchise by adding new clients under our platforms and integrating the front office capabilities we acquired in Itiviti. And we're building our wealth and new management franchise by adding more component solutions and creating a next-generation wealth management technology platform.  
The critical factor underlying all this execution has been and will continue to be investment in our technology and digital platforms. We're pursuing a $52 billion market opportunity that's continuing to evolve. The long-term trends driving that evolution, including the ongoing democratization of investing, which in turn is driving and being driven by greater digitization, were only accelerated by the pandemic. Those same trends are powering our growth and creating an imperative for investment by our clients in the next-generation technology we provide.  
We're all hearing a lot these days about the ""democratization"" of investing. But what we are seeing now is a continuation of a 50-year trend driven by the ongoing combination of new technology and reduced trading costs. These forces have led to continued innovation from discount brokerage to online trading, to 401s, ETFs and managed accounts. More recently, modern user interface, 0 commission trading and the pandemic have accelerated this long-term trend.  
Together, these forces have made investing consistently more cost-effective and more accessible for more people. For Broadridge, this has supported high single-digit growth over the last decade in the number of positions we serve. Going forward, more innovations, including direct indexing, will support continued growth. So we expect that same high single-digit growth for many years to come. 
It's worth noting that democratization is also playing a part in the increasing importance of ESG, which further underlines the importance of what Broadridge does. As new investors come to the market and new innovations drive increased diversification, it's critical that investors get to shareholder disclosures and other communications they need to make informed decisions.  
Investors are also seeking to exercise their vote on how issuers and funds should approach ESG issues. Our 24/7 SaaS technology platform plays a critical role in powering that system of corporate governance. And these trends are making governance, voting and disclosures an even more important part of the investment process. 
We have built that platform through continuous innovation and investment to link tens of thousands of corporate issuers and funds with hundreds of banks and broker-dealers and tens of millions of institute individual investors. Our platform is constantly monitoring and validating positions across more than 100 million retail and 270,000 institutional accounts.  Every day, we collect, maintain and manage the investor preferences that are critical to driving digital distribution.  
Doing so effectively and securely requires investment in continuous monitoring to provide the highest levels of data security. It also requires us to serve our bank and broker-dealer clients with co-branded communications, client service and integrated billing and collections that greatly simplify the entire ecosystem.  
As a result, we've built a 24/7 proxy and fund information infrastructure, which delivers highly accurate voting for thousands of annual meetings and whose efficiency saves funds and corporate issuers hundreds of millions of dollars each year. 
Thanks to our investments in digitization, it's also increasingly green, driving down paper and mail volumes and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  
So we will continue to invest in extending that network to enable expanded voting, enhance shareholder communications  and to better gather and share data analytics that helps funds and issuers better understand changes in their investor base.  
Digitization is the second trend that's been accelerated by the pandemic and which is driving our growth. It's reducing costs for our clients, broadening their reach and accelerating processes from account opening to trade settlement and communications. 
It's being facilitated by the rapid adoption of next-generation technologies. The move to the cloud enables a scalable and variable cost computing architecture, which is changing our clients' business models. Data, analytics, and AI are transforming how clients make decisions and power their investment processes. The move to digital technology and financial services has been both a driver and beneficiary of market democratization. 
Financial services need technology and scale to compete in today's complex markets, and Broadridge provides both. Our SaaS technology is an on-ramp for accelerated digitization with next-generation technology. We're delivering blockchain solutions to the repo market, AI-driven trading to fixed income and enhanced virtual and new meeting experience among many other examples. Bringing new technologies to our clients with mutualized solutions at scale is a core part of our strategy.  
Past investments have put Broadridge in a position to help our clients today. With the acceleration of democratization and digitization, the opportunity to invest for the future is as high as ever. We're investing to build new platforms and solutions, including our Broadridge wealth platform. Consistent with our history, we'll also actively seek out M&A opportunities that meet our strategic and financial criteria.  
Collectively, this investment strategy has and will continue to extend our capabilities in governance, including data analytics, capital markets, including most recently phone office trading and wealth and investment management. I'm confident that these investments will only further strengthen our position as an innovation enabler for our clients and reinforce our long-term growth.  
Finally, any focus on sustainable, long-term growth must be grounded in meeting the needs of all stakeholders. At Broadridge, that focus starts with our culture, anchored in the service profit chain that puts associate engagement at the core of our business approach. It extends to our clients and communities as well as our shareholders. 
I encourage you to read our recently released sustainability report. You'll learn about how we are building the most engaging workplace for the most talented associates in our industry, the efforts we make to keep our clients' data secure, our success in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and much more.  
Before turning the call to Edmund, I'd like to thank the thousands of dedicated and talented Broadridge associates that have made these results and future opportunities possible. They are the foundation of our success.  
Let me briefly sum up. Broadridge delivered a strong quarter driven by continued execution and powerful underlying growth trends. We are executing on our long-term growth strategy and are committed to making investments that will create additional opportunities. And we're doing it the right way by also driving associate engagement, making a positive impact on our communities, reducing our environmental footprint and improving the financial lives of millions. I'm confident that Broadridge is on track to achieve the higher end of our 3-year growth objectives and is well positioned to drive sustainable growth for the long term.  
And now let me turn to Edmund for a review of our financial results. Edmund?"
1032802,1685595101,2423000,"Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc., Q1 2022 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2021",2021-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. As you've just heard from Tim, we are pleased with how our strategy is progressing. It's good to be here to discuss another quarter of strong financial performance, driven by new sales, strong underlying volume",1716,"Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. As you've just heard from Tim, we are pleased with how our strategy is progressing. It's good to be here to discuss another quarter of strong financial performance, driven by new sales, strong underlying volume trends and the acquisition of Itiviti. 
You can see that strong performance in the financial summary on Slide 7, which shows that recurring revenues grew 16% to $751 million. Adjusted operating income rose 17% to $177 million, with AOI margins flat to last year at 14.8%, reflecting our continued ability to find efficiencies and gain operating leverage through our scale, allowing us to invest in our technology and digital platforms.  
That growth in operating income was partially offset by higher interest expense related to financing the Itiviti acquisition. As a result, adjusted EPS rose 9% to $1.07.  
Let's get into the details of those results, starting with the recurring revenue on Slide 8. Recurring revenues grew from $650 million in Q1 '21 to $751 million in Q1 '22, an increase of 16%. Organic recurring revenue grew at 7% and came in at the high end of our 5% to 7% 3-year objectives, reflecting the continued momentum from our sales and revenue backlog and increased investor participation. The contribution from acquisitions, primarily our continued success integrating Itiviti, added another 9 points to recurring revenue growth.  
Now let's turn to Slide 9 and look at the growth across our ICS and GTO businesses. We reported double-digit recurring revenue growth in both of our segments.  
ICS recurring revenue grew by 11%, all organic, to $410 million, propelled by a combination of new sales and strong volumes. Regulatory revenues rose 23% to $165 million, powered by higher mutual funded ETF communications, strong equity position growth in the U.S. and closed sales revenue.  
Growth was also strong in our international proxy business led in part by strong performance in Canada. Our issuer business also contributed to our overall growth rate to strong sales of our disclosure products. And as expected, we are also benefiting from high retention of our virtual shareholder meeting solution.  
Data-driven fund solutions revenue grew 5% to $83 million, boosted by an increase in revenue from assets under administration and revenue from new sales of our data and analytics products.  
Finally, customer communications revenues rose 2% driven by new sales and growth in digital.  
In turning to GTO, recurring revenues grew 21% to $341 million and 2% organic. Wealth and investment management revenues rose 6%, driven by the onboarding of new component sales and higher retail trading. Capital Markets revenues increased 34% as we benefited from a full quarter of Itiviti revenue. Excluding Itiviti, organic growth was slightly negative as lower license and consulting revenue was offset by strong revenue growth from new business, including revenues from onboarding of the major U.S. bank that Tim mentioned.  
Going forward, we expect revenue from closed sales, fueled by our healthy revenue backlog, will drive strong growth over the balance of the year. 
So let's turn to Slide 10 for a closer look at the volume trends. Broadridge continued to benefit from strong volume trends in the first quarter. The biggest driver of our internal growth was mutual fund and ETF record growth, which rose 9% driven by healthy markets and strong inflows.  
Equity record growth was 39% in a seasonally small quarter. So keep in mind that the first quarter historically represents approximately 5% of full year equity communications with more than 80% coming in the fiscal third and fourth quarters while mutual funded ETF communications are more balanced through the year.  
Looking ahead, our testing of record positions is showing continued strong growth trends in the seasonally larger second half with high single-digit growth indicated for both equities and funds.  
On the bottom of the slide, we saw a modest 2% increase in our trading volumes as higher fixed income volumes were offset by lower equity volumes. Our outlook for the balance of the year assumes flat trading volumes.  
Turning to Slide 11, where we summarize the drivers of recurring revenue growth. Recurring revenues rose 16%, powered by 7% organic growth and 9 points from acquisitions. Revenue from closed sales was the biggest driver of our organic growth. We saw strong contribution from sales across both ICS and GTO. Our recurring revenue retention rate remained unchanged at 98% and internal growth contributed another 2 points as growth in ICS outpaced the decline in GTO.  
Itiviti was the biggest driver of our acquisition growth, contributing $54 million of growth with a much smaller contribution from the tuck-in acquisitions we made late in Q4 and in early Q1.   
Now we'll turn to Slide 12 to review the drivers of total revenue and for some additional color on our strong event-driven revenues. Total revenue growth was 17% as strong recurring revenue growth was accompanied by 4 points of growth from higher distribution revenue and 3 points from event-driven revenues. Low to no margin distribution revenues grew 11% year-over-year, primarily resulting from the higher customer communications mailings.  
Higher postage rates were a small factor in the first quarter but will be a more significant contributor to distribution revenues for the remainder of the year. So we expect continued high levels of distribution revenue growth for the full year.  
And as I've previously noted, over the long term, we expect that the share of distribution revenue as a percentage of total revenue will continue to decline as we remain focused on growing recurring revenue.  
Event-driven revenues rose to $76 million in the quarter, driven by higher mutual fund proxies. Q1 '22 did benefit from a large fund proxy that was originally expected in Q3 '22.  Despite this timing benefit and given the strong start to the year, we now expect event-driven revenues for the full year to be modestly ahead of our $220 million 7-year average. For modeling purposes, we're expecting Q2 to Q4 to be in line with our $55 million 7-year quarterly average.  
Rounding out revenue drivers, changes in FX contributed 1 point to our growth. As previously disclosed, we changed our FX reporting methodology to better align the presentation of our key metrics with current FX rates. You can find our comparable revenue, segment profitability and closed sales numbers for fiscal '20 and '21 in the 8-K we filed at the end of September and in the appendix to these slides.  
So let's now move to margins on Slide 13. Adjusted operating income margin was flat at 14.8% in the first quarter. The positive impact of strong recurring and event-driven growth was offset by growth investments and an increase in low-margin distribution revenue. We continue to expect AOI margin of approximately 19% for the full year as we benefit from the higher-margin Itiviti revenues and continued margin expansion in our organic business, offsetting the greater-than-expected higher growth and low margin distribution revenues.  
Moving on to close sales on Slide 14. Closed sales of $30 million were essentially flat year-over-year. And closed sales were balanced across both our ICS and GTO segments, and we continue to see over 2/3 of our sales in smaller core deals, those under $2 million in annualized value. That gives us confidence in the broad demand and long-term growth of our digital products. We remain on track to deliver $240 million to $280 million in closed sales for the full year.  
And finally, cash flow and capital allocation on Slide 15. Broadridge's cash flow generation is typically negative in the fiscal first quarter and strengthens throughout the year, and Q1 '22 was no exception with negative free cash flow of $151 million.  
Turning to uses of capital, we continue to invest in our long-term growth. A big part of that investment is the technology platforms we're building in capital markets and wealth. These new platforms require upfront investment to build new capabilities and convert new clients. We invested $82 million in our platforms during the first quarter. Our investment in our next-generation wealth management platform is an important part of that, but we're also investing in other platforms such as our global post-trade management or GPTM solution. 
All of these investments are tied to long-term client contracts and strengthen our capabilities across capital markets and wealth management. We will continue to prioritize these internal investments in our technology platforms as part of our capital allocation model. And we're excited about the growth from new client revenues as we convert clients onto the new platforms.  
As we integrate Itiviti, continued M&A remains a focus. During the quarter, we had a modest minority investment and invested $13 million in a pair of tuck-in acquisitions within our capital markets business.  
Looking forward, you can expect us to continue investing in our platforms and allocating capital to targeted M&A opportunities that meet our high strategic criteria and financial profile. And we will continue to return capital to shareholders, primarily through our dividend, as we remain focused on paying down debt and maintaining an investment-grade credit rating.  
I'll close my prepared remarks with a quick review of our guidance and some final thoughts on our first quarter results. We are reaffirming our full year guidance on all of our key financial metrics. We continue to expect 12% to 15% recurring revenue growth, adjusted operating income margin of approximately 19% and adjusted EPS growth of 11% to 15%. I'll note that over the last 5 years, the first half has typically represented less than 30% of our full year adjusted EPS, and I expect that trend to hold in fiscal year '22. Finally, as I noted earlier, we expect closed sales in the range of $240 million to $280 million.  
And with that, let me reiterate today's key messages. Broadridge delivered strong first quarter results with 16% recurring revenue growth driven by new sales, strong underlying volume trends and the acquisition of ltiviti. We are reaffirming our guidance for a strong fiscal year 2022, and we are investing in our business as we pursue our $52 billion addressable market. As a result, we are well positioned to deliver at the high end of our 3-year objectives, and we see a long run rate for continued growth. 
So with that, let's take your questions. Let me turn it back to the operator."

And then more importantly, just the overall opportunity on the pipeline on the capital market side as well. It's been an area that I know we focused on that should have a long runway.

And then I'll let Edmund take you through sort of the broader pipeline and momentum in capital markets. 
So on the wealth management side, and I think as we said before, this transformation of wealth management is one of our most exciting opportunities. And we continue to drive with UBS on bringing that forward. We've had -- just last week, we spent time with the senior leadership and really feeling good about how the partnership is working. And making really strong progress in building the new capabilities and the pretty complex work of decommissioning was a very tenured platform. 
So we are, as you know, already live with some applications. We're working with UBS to sequencing, bringing forward the additional solutions that will align with the pace of their broader digital transformation. We expect to implement that in phases over the next 18 to 24 months. As you remember, the way we do our revenue recognition, we'll begin recognizing revenue when that becomes fully live. And so in the meantime, the net of that goes on to our balance sheet, which you'll see in coming quarters. So we feel good about it. 
We think, though, on the revenue side for that particular initiative, it will be a ways out before you begin to see it. But we're continuing to hear validation with other clients, good progress with RBC and good discussions with others. So that's sort of the update on the wealth management piece.  Obviously, in the mean we continue to make strong progress with our component sales on the wealth management side. 
For a review of where we are in capital markets and sort of the overall momentum, let me just let Edmund comment on that."

I want to start with just saying that GTO continues to be a very healthy franchise with over $30 billion when you look at capital markets and wealth management inside of that $30 billion in market opportunity. We're coming off a strong year in GTO overall at 7% in fiscal year '21 and now, 21% this year. A lot of that is Itiviti, of course, but the organic business in GTO was 2% growth. And it's just -- as Tim just talked about the wealth management business, if you think about that component, it grew at 6% for the quarter. That's well within our 5% to 7% organic growth objectives, and that's coming from continued onboarding of new sales and the retail trading that we've seen. 
The organic business in the capital markets in the first quarter was slightly negative. I mentioned in my remarks that lower license revenue and lower consulting revenue was the driver of that. But to your question, we have a strong pipeline to onboard. And we've mentioned earlier our recurring revenue backlog of $385 million, a large chunk of that is GTO. So we look to have license revenue growth in the back half of the year, flat trading growth and continue to onboard that pipeline. That puts us in a position where we expect the capital markets business to also be within our 5- to 7-year growth objectives. And I think that's a great place to be with both of these franchises well within our organic overall growth ranges."

I think the important story within customer communications is a little bit sort of deeper than this top line number, even though it's nice to see that top line number positive. It's really around the transition within that business, from paper to digital. And as you know, we've grown the digital business inside that at double digits the past 2 years.

And as a reminder, its strength in front office and Europe and Asia really complements our strength in back office and North America. 
And we're really pursuing 3 growth opportunities there. There's an ongoing opportunity sort of -- Itiviti, without Broadridge, has just continued to take share in front office and its existing markets and solutions really based on the fact that the competitors are disinvesting. 
Medium term, we think there's a really nice opportunity to bring Itiviti to Broadridge clients in North America, leverage our strength in fixed income and other new asset classes. And then longer term, we talked about linking front and back office and really bringing data from the back office into the front and also making that whole front to back office more seamless and cost effective. 
So we are seeing really nice signs of affirmation of that. We're seeing really nice demand from clients to have discussions about that and continued interest in having alternatives to existing providers. So really high client engagement around that long-term thesis. 
And in the meantime, the integration is going well. The combined capital markets team, as I said in my remarks, is making great strides in the integration.

And to Tim's point about front to back, this is something that we are investing in. So the investments that we're deploying in this quarter and for the rest of the year will go towards activity as we look to build capabilities front to back as well. So we feel good about the progress. 
The last thing I'd say about it is I've mentioned to you that acquisitions would be 7% to 8% of contribution, and you saw strong reaffirmation of that in the first quarter with 9 points of our recurring revenue growth from acquisitions.

Wealth management, that's continued to grow. I think the 4-year CAGR on wealth management is about 8%.

And it is -- those certainly, as you correctly noted, are some eye-popping numbers. Obviously, it's a small quarter, so it's hard to really draw anything from that 1 data point. I think the thing that I want to come back to, just at the broad level, is that this whole trend I talked about in my remarks, the democratization, it's a long-term trend that's made investing more accessible and cost-effective and those drivers have been consistent over time in the mid- to high single digits. It certainly is elevated now. We don't see that elevated level as something that continues over the long run. We do see return to that mid-single digits. It will still be elevated a bit this year. But we feel really good about those long-term drivers, including new things like direct indexing. 
So Edmund, then maybe just give us a little bit more color on that."

So as Tim just said, David, mid-single-digit growth over the last 10 years in both equities and fund and ETF positions, to the point that Tim just made, that has elevated, I'd say, beginning with the fiscal '20 Q4 time period and ended at 26% last year, up to the eye-popping numbers at 39% in Q1 '22. 
Our recent testing shows that Q2 is normalizing a bit to be closer to 20%. Now that's a nice uptick from the low teen growth that we saw in testing just a few months ago. I will mention that you should keep in mind that the first half is a much lighter component of the volumes. Last year, I think we showed in the slide that last year, the first half was about 13%. Over 80% of the volumes are in the back half of the year, the third and the fourth quarter, and our mid-October testing for that suggests high single-digit growth for the second half of the year. 
So I think we feel good about where that positions us for '22. And more importantly, the trends that Tim mentioned earlier, like direct indexing, I think that gives us confidence that we should expect to see mid- to high-single digits for many years to come. And as is our history, we'll come back to you in February as we get closer to proxy season and do more testing with an update on where we stand."

It combines democratization, it combines ESG, it combines innovation, it combines the power of the network and our infrastructure. So a lot of the things that we've been working on. This really brings them together and it's something that we have been working on for a while. 
So near term, as you pointed out, it's not a revenue driver and to the extent that it's on the institutional side, it's not really a revenue driver. I think the interesting question is as others look at this, would it come to the retail and ETF side. And in which case, it could become a revenue driver. I would think that would be a long term that kind of thing. So I'm not -- I wouldn't be thinking about anything at all near term. But as you think about the kinds of things that continue to support that high mid-single or high single-digit position growth, it could be a factor over time. 
I do think that topic around increasing importance of governance, that's a clear positive for Broadridge, whether it's institutional or retail and the fact that BlackRock, the world's largest global asset manager, is taking a step, I think, is really making people take a hard look at this."

And so many of these things are sort of already decided, but then they get caught in the contracting and there's a big pipeline of things. And because of the relationship we have with our clients, they know it's coming up and they tend to sort of bump us up to the top of the heap and create this big backlog in Q4.

I'd like to start with a special welcome to Edmund Reese, our new CFO, on his first Broadridge earnings call. I know many of you were introduced to Edmund during our virtual Investor Day in December, and I hope you came away as impressed as I have been over the past 2 months. 
This morning, I'll provide an overview of the key messages from this quarter and give you an update on our progress against the growth plan we discussed in December. Edmund will review our financial results, and we'll close with your questions.  
Let's get started. After a strong second quarter, Broadridge is on track to deliver another solid year of top and bottom line growth. We now expect to be at the higher end of our guidance range for both recurring revenue and adjusted EPS growth. That guidance reflects our strong quarterly results. For the quarter, Broadridge delivered 7% recurring revenue growth, continued margin expansion and 38% adjusted EPS growth in a seasonally small quarter. 
We continue to execute against the growth plan we outlined in December. I'll highlight later some of the specific steps we've taken on key initiatives across governance, capital markets and wealth and investment management.  
Our strong second quarter results and outlook for the second half of the year have given us the opportunity to step up our investment. I'm pleased to see us increasing our investment in our technology, products and people to meet our clients' growing needs as they face accelerating trends towards next-generation mutualization, resiliency and digital transformation.  
Finally, our outlook for the year means we are off to a strong start toward achieving our latest set of 3-year growth objectives, including 7% to 9% recurring revenue growth and 8% to 12% adjusted EPS growth. We remain focused on long-term growth, which has helped us deliver consistent sustainable top quartile total shareholder return. Our focus on long-term growth is the reason why I remain excited by our progress against our clear strategy.  
Let's turn to Slide 4 for an update on some recent achievements against these goals. I'll start with our governance franchise, where we are delivering next-generation regulatory capabilities, building data-driven solutions for funds, delivering end-to-end solutions for issuers and driving omnichannel communications. During the quarter, we made strong progress on each of these fronts. 
First, on next-gen regulatory. We're making strong progress on building a European regulatory communications hub for the shareholder rights directive. Two, we're winning new clients across the EU, including major institutions in both Italy and Spain. We're also working with other technology providers, including a leading Danish bank technology player and a leading French government solution provider to deliver Broadridge's SRD II solutions.  
Broadridge also made strong progress against delivering data-driven solutions to mutual funds. A key part of this effort is our growing data and insights business. Based on our unique data, we enable funds to better understand at an aggregate level who and, importantly, where their shareholders are.  
The compelling value of these solutions was further demonstrated by a multimillion dollar sale in the second quarter to a leading global fund company. We'll be using our data solutions for multiple use cases, including enabling the repatriation of tens of millions of dollars of dividends to the U.S. shareholders.  
On the issuer side, we continue to see strong demand for virtual shareholder meetings. During the past calendar year, we hosted meetings for 83% of the S&P 100, and we're seeing strong renewal rates as we begin the lead-up to the 2021 proxy season.  
We continue to enhance our VSM capabilities by rolling out the first phase of an enhanced platform, which will enable corporate issuers to leverage our unique capabilities around shareholder validation, while using the meeting platform of their choice.  
Finally, in omnichannel communications, we continued with double-digit growth in our digital communications revenue in the first half, building on last year's strong performance.  
Let me turn now to our capital markets franchise, where we continue to drive important mutualization benefits to our global clients. Broadridge is already the leading global post-trade provider for cash securities, processing over $10 trillion in equity and fixed income trades per day. 
During the quarter, we took an important step toward expanding beyond cash securities into exchange-rated derivatives. We announced that R.J. O'Brien, the largest independent futures exchange and clearing firm, has selected Broadridge's global derivatives platform. Our scalable and agile solution will enable R.J. out to streamline and modernize its operations with one unified global technology platform.  
We're also bringing network value to our clients by extending to the front office and fixed income. As we described at Investor Day, our AI-driven corporate bond trading platform, LTX, remains on track for a broader launch this year. We're now live in the soft launch with select clients, and we continue to receive positive feedback. Full launch with more than 10 dealers and 35 buy-side clients will be later this year.  
Turning to wealth and investment management. As we laid out in December, our goal is to build a leading technology and operation provider to the wealth management industry by providing both a growing list of differentiated component solutions and by delivering our next-generation industry wealth technology platform.  
First and foremost, we have continued to demonstrate the value of our leading wealth back-office platform by seamlessly processing the recent spike of record trading volumes driven by high volatility and increased retail participation. These volumes have challenged the industry as homegrown systems have struggled to scale, but our performance has continued to drive home the value of a mutualized industry solution.  
At the same time, we continue to extend our suite of component solutions, working with multiple partners to bring new and innovative solutions to our clients, and we continue to make strong progress toward the launch of our next-generation wealth management platform with UBS. The net of all of this, across governance, capital markets and wealth and investment management, that we are seeing strong execution on tangible deliverables, coupled with unique innovation that gives us confidence on our longer-term growth is on track.  
Let's turn now to a brief review of our recurring revenue results on Slide 5. Edmund will cover our financial performance in more detail, but I want to share my key takeaways from our 7% recurring revenue growth in the second quarter.  
First, I was pleased to see balanced growth across both segments, with 7% growth in ICS and 8% growth in GTO. Second, as I look at the drivers of growth in ICS, what stands out is the impact of strong stock record growth, which reached 24% and, even in a seasonally small quarter, drove strong growth in regulatory revenues.  
Our business is clearly benefiting from the long-term technology trends that have lowered the cost to retail investors of buying and owning individual shares. These trends, which include the widespread introduction of commission-free trading, are having a broader and longer-term impact on investment behavior that goes beyond the very recent volatility in a few hypo file names. 
Stock record growth has been healthy across virtually all of our broker-dealer clients, and it's been especially strong among online brokers who are leading many of these changes. As Edmund will discuss, we expect these growth trends to remain favorable in the second half of the year.  
Third, I'm also pleased to see a strong growth contribution from both our data-driven fund solutions as well as our issuer business. Customer communications revenues were flat, with strong growth in digital revenues, balancing modest COVID declines in print volume.  
Fourth and last, strong sales onboarding and higher trading volumes are driving the growth in our GTO segment. As I noted earlier, much of the impact from higher trading levels is coming on the retail side, which clearly benefited from our wealth -- which clearly benefited our wealth and investment management business in the second quarter. More important from my perspective is that year-to-date growth in both capital markets and wealth has been balanced at 7% and 9%, respectively.  
Let me wrap up my comments with some final thoughts about how to put our strong second quarter and first half in context. Simply put, our performance in the first half of fiscal '21 gives me even more confidence that Broadridge will continue to deliver steady and consistent revenue and earnings growth in the years to come. As we shared at our Investor Day, we have a large and growing $46 billion market opportunity, 3 strongly growing franchise businesses and a clear targeted growth plan to take advantage of long-term trends around next-generation mutualization, resilience and digital transformation.  
We are on track to deliver another solid year of recurring revenue growth, margin expansion and adjusted EPS growth at the higher end of our 6% to 10% range. Our strong results and disciplined cost actions have put us in a position to deliver against the higher end of our revenue and earnings guidance for fiscal '21, while making investments that will sustain our growth through fiscal '23 and beyond.  
We are investing in our technology platforms and strengthening our product development teams. We're also investing in our human capital by rewarding our associates, increasing our diversity, equity and inclusion and career development investments and upping our recruiting for new talent, all of which will enhance our talent base going forward.
As we enter the seasonally larger second half, Broadridge is delivering in the short term and investing for the long term. That's a great place to be and a strong formula for long-term value creation.  
Before I hand it over to Edmund, I want to thank our associates around the world for the important work they do and for their commitment to the service profit chain. Whether they're working from home or socially distanced on the production floor, they are persevering and delivering for our clients at an extraordinary rate. They truly are enabling better financial lives for millions of investors around the globe, and their engagement in this powerful mission is what drives us forward. Thank you.  
Edmund, over to you."

During my opening remarks at our December Investor Day, I mentioned my excitement joining a company with such a strong leadership team and growth strategy. Now over 2",801,"Thanks, Tim, and thank you again for the warm welcome to our first earnings call as CFO. During my opening remarks at our December Investor Day, I mentioned my excitement joining a company with such a strong leadership team and growth strategy. Now over 2 full months, and I'm even more excited and more confident in Broadridge's ability to execute our simple but powerful financial model. And our strong second quarter and outlook for the full year are great examples of how that model works.  
As you can see here, looking at the Q2 financial summary on Slide 7, this was a strong quarter of top and bottom line growth across all our key metrics. Recurring revenues grew 7%, operating margin increased 150 basis points year-over-year to 11.2%, and we continue to demonstrate our ability to expand margins, even while ramping up the investment spend that Tim highlighted earlier, which we said we would accelerate during last quarter's call. And adjusted EPS grew to $0.73 in the quarter, up 38% over Q2 '20.  
Now let's turn the slide and get into the details of the quarter, starting with some of our key operational metrics. Broadridge's recurring revenue growth benefits from underlying volume growth trends, including record growth. Over the last 10 years, equity and mutual fund record growth has averaged 6% to 8% and is a driver of our regulatory revenues. Stock record growth in Q2 increased 24% driven in part by a few large issuers, and I'll remind you to keep in mind that second quarter volumes historically make up less than 10% of the full year total.  
Looking ahead to the seasonally larger second half of the year, we expect low double-digit growth across stock records. Looking further ahead, our 3-year objectives assume that this increased growth moderates and returns to mid-single digits.  
Touching briefly on trade volumes, which you'll see at the bottom of this slide, this is the fourth consecutive quarter of aggregate double-digit volume growth. This growth reflects the continued volatility in the markets, which, as you know, spiked last March and April and remains well above pre-COVID levels. As a result, we expect tough trading volume comps for both Q3 and Q4.  
Now turning to closed sales, the biggest driver of our recurring revenue growth. Our $79 million closed sales year-to-date are in line with our performance over the same period last year. We continue to see strong demand for our ICS solutions, including virtual shareholder meetings, regulation-driven SRD sales across Europe and continued client expansion, cross-selling data solutions to existing customers. We remain on track to achieve our full year guidance of $190 million to $235 million for closed sales.  
Historically, the closed sales performance in the back half of the year has been impacted by large signings. A large signing could propel us to the top end of our guidance range. And conversely, delays could lower our performance. And I'll also note that we continue to feel good about our revenue backlog, which, as of Q4 '20, was 12% of our fiscal '20 recurring revenue and gives us great visibility into our top line growth.  
Turning to recurring revenue growth on Slide 10. As I've said, recurring revenue grew 7% in the quarter, well in line with our historical mid-single-digit growth performance in demonstrating the resiliency and consistency of our recurring revenue growth model. With the strong start to the year, we are on track to be at the higher end of our 3% to 6% recurring revenue growth guidance range.  
Now let's look at the drivers of the quarter's recurring revenue growth. Slide 11 highlights that our growth was primarily driven by our internal efforts. Organic growth has consistently been the largest component of our recurring revenue growth. In Q2, revenue from new sales drove 6 points of growth and remained the biggest driver of our revenue growth across both our GTO and ICS segments. 
We continued our long track record of retaining 98% of existing client recurring revenue, and internal growth contributed 2 points of growth driven by higher trading volumes in our GTO segment. ICS internal growth was neutral as our strong position growth was offset by the impact of lower interest rates and lower customer communications print volumes. The impact of acquisitions made within the last 12 months contributed 1 point. Barring any new acquisitions, we would expect the contribution to growth from acquisitions to be less than 1 point in Q3 and 0 in Q4.  
And while we're focused on recurring revenue, let me share some insights on the drivers of growth across our updated ICS and GTO product lines that Tim touched on earlier. These categories were introduced at our Investor Day with the goal to better align our external reporting with our growth strategies.

ICS internal growth was neutral as our strong position growth was offset by the impact of lower interest rates and lower customer communications print volumes.

Barring any new acquisitions, we'd expect the contribution of growth from acquisitions to be less than 1 point from Q3 and 0 in Q4. And while we're focused on recurring revenues, let me share some insights on the drivers of growth across our updated ICS and GTO product lines that Tim touched on earlier.  
These categories were introduced at our Investor Day with the goal to better align our external reporting with our growth strategies. ICS recurring revenues rose 7%, with strong growth across 3 of our 4 product categories. The biggest contribution to growth came from our regulatory revenues, which were propelled by strong 24% stock record growth and 5% interim record growth. We also benefited from additional growth across our international and Canadian proxy volumes. 
Revenues of our data-driven fund solutions benefited from strong double-digit growth in our data and insight product revenues and the acquisition last February of FundsLibrary, offset by the impact of lower interest rates on our mutual fund trade processing unit. Customer communications revenues were flat in the quarter as double-digit growth in digital revenues was offset by a decline in print volumes. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, we expect to see the impact of some recent client wins in the fourth quarter, which should put that business on the former track of low single-digit growth.  
Issuer solutions revenues rose 14% driven by higher revenues from virtual shareholder meetings, which also helped drive growth across a broader set of issuer products and offset the impact of lower revenue in our transfer agency business.  
In GTO, recurring revenues grew 8% driven by strong growth in our wealth and investment management revenues. Both our wealth and capital markets product revenues benefited from new client onboardings and the impact of the 24% increase in trading volumes versus the second quarter of fiscal 2020, with higher growth coming from the retail side of our clients' businesses. As we enter the second half of the fiscal year, we expect the growth in trading volumes to slowly significantly lap last spring's spike in volatility, which, coupled with the lower license activity, will put pressure on GTO growth.  
Now we'll turn to Slide 12 to brief in touch on our total revenue performance. As a reminder, on Broadridge's revenue mix, 65% of our total revenue is recurring, about 31% is from distribution revenues and 4% from more cyclical event-driven revenue. This revenue mix has steadily improved since 2017. Recurring revenues comprised 58% of the total. 
Our total revenue growth this quarter was stronger than usual, reaching 9%, with distribution revenues contributing 3 points due to the increased mailings we saw corresponding to the high record growth and increased event-driven activity this quarter. Moving forward, we expect the low to no margin distribution revenues to decline over time, as we focus on increasing higher-margin digital revenues across our governance business. 
Pausing briefly on the event-driven revenues, we saw another quarter aligned with our historical norms of about $50 million a quarter, and we remain on track to meet or exceed our $180 million outlook for fiscal '21 event-driven revenues. Going forward, as I covered in the Investor Day, we expect annual driven event revenues to return to the approximately $200 million average that we've seen over the past 7 years.  
Turning to Slide 13. This was another strong quarter of margin expansion. We increased adjusted operating income margin by 150 basis points over last year. During the quarter, we began to ramp up our level of investment in our technology platforms, product capabilities and people, as we highlighted we would on our first quarter call. While this increased investment is likely to affect margin expansion in the second half of the fiscal year, these investments will support our long-term growth.  
And I want to underline that point because it's critical to how we run our business. We're foregoing some of the near-term margin expansion that you get from underinvestments in favor of capturing the larger future margin opportunity that is driven by growth. That formula has been a key factor in Broadridge's ability to drive long-term sustainable growth.  
Moving to capital allocation on the following slide. We generated $51 million of free cash flow year-to-date, up $82 million over the first 6 months of fiscal '20, driven by higher earnings and strong working capital management. Broadridge remains committed to a balanced capital allocation policy, which prioritizes internal investment, growing our dividend, M&A and returning excess capital to shareholders, all while maintaining our investment-grade credit rating. During the first 6 months of the fiscal year, we invested $128 million in building out our industry platforms and another $51 million in CapEx and software spending.  
Turning to capital returns on the right-hand side of the slide, our dividend has grown and remains in line with our historical 45% payout ratio. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, and we've historically generated most of our annual free cash flow, Broadridge is in great shape to pursue attractive targeted M&A opportunities or repurchase shares.  
Now turning to guidance on Slide 15. We expect recurring revenue growth to be at the higher end of our 3% to 6% range, with higher full year record growth from strong first half trading volumes, offsetting the drag that we expect from lower second half trading volumes. We expect our adjusted operating income margin to expand to approximately 18% from 17.5% in fiscal year '20 as we balance near-term returns with continued investments to sustain long-term growth.  
And finally, we expect to be at the higher end of our adjusted EPS growth guidance range of 6% to 10%, putting us well on track to achieve our 3-year 8% to 12% adjusted EPS growth objective that we presented at our Investor Day in December. 
Finally, as I noted earlier, we continue to expect closed sales in the range of $190 million to $235 million. And looking below the line, we expect our full year effective overall tax rate to remain at 21%, confirming what we shared on our last call.  
And one final point on our outlook, we expect third quarter adjusted EPS to be flat or slightly lower than fiscal year '20 driven by increased investment spend and lower license revenues.  
So before we begin to take your questions, let me share some final thoughts. I told you at our Investor Day that Broadridge is a simple financial model based on sustainable revenue growth, consistent investment, margin expansion and balanced capital allocation. That model has produced steady and consistent earnings growth over time and helped drive strong top quartile of total shareholder returns. Our second quarter results and expectations for the full year are a great example of how that model works. 
We generated strong 7% recurring revenue growth, propelled by long-term trends. That growth helped drive the 150 basis points of margin expansion, which, in turn, is enabling us to make incremental investments to drive long-term growth, especially over the second half of our year. The end result is earnings growth that positions us well to deliver on our 3-year financial objectives. It's a great example of how we manage our business to drive sustainable revenue growth, steady and consistent adjusted EPS growth and historically top quartile TSR.  
So now let me hand the call back to Andrew to take your questions."

But as we think about the 2021 proxy season, if 24% stock record growth is a jumping off point for proxy mailings, will you actually be able to reinvest this excess revenue growth fast enough in the second half to actually keep earnings growth within the 6% to 10% growth guidance?  
And then my follow-up question, which is related, as we think about fiscal '22 and recognizing you haven't given guidance yet, you've got the strong jumping off point with stock record growth, with a lot of secular growth drivers behind that. You've got UBS contract coming on stream this summer. Isn't the setup for fiscal '22 potentially above the long-term growth guide as well?"

I'm going to make a couple of comments and then hand it over to Edmund to also comment.  
First, I think, certainly, we're pleased with the headline number that sounds like 24%, but I do want to caution that the second quarter is small, and there is some specific names that really drove that. And as we look to the second half, we are seeing certainly very nice stock record growth, but not at that level. So that's just an important starting point.  
We are really pleased in the investment side. We think that our opportunity here is essentially unlimited relative to our current size, and we see -- we do see many arenas where we're better positioned than anyone to meet real industry needs. So you will see us continuing to invest within the confines of those 3-year targets, and we do have a lot of ability to invest, Dave. So I do think that we will be able to do that. Really, the only thing that would keep that from happening would be if we had sort of surprising event activity in the fourth quarter.

If we're able to make those investments, they'll contribute to some modest acceleration, as I said, at -- in the Investor Day to '22 and '23."

And Peter, I think this is a really good opportunity to step back and look at the regulatory landscape, and I'll work my way to the fees question. But just I think, as you look into regulatory landscape, we have a long history of working with administrations on both sides of the aisle to promote really effective and cost-efficient disclosure. That's really the foundation of our market. And with the increasing democratization that we're seeing, there's a real -- the need for effective disclosure is greater than ever before. 
The democrat administrations do tend to be somewhat more inclined to extend disclosures and protections, and we're already seeing some of that relative to ESG and fiduciary standards. But even with all that background, they -- we don't really see a substantive regulatory update relative to the things that are happening in our space. 
So 30e-3 is now live, and it's saving funds money. The comments are in for 498B, and those have been really supportive of the summary concept and -- but people are expressing concerns about drop and prospectuses. So it's not clear whether that will happen. 
There is a big push for moving to e-delivery, and that's something that we support, and it's really aligned with the idea of summary documents. And then there continues to be, as you raised this question around fees, ICI continues to push for a fee review and is talking about let's move it away from the NYSE, which the NYSE would like to move it away. 
At the same time, FINRA has responded saying they don't want it either as you go to the SEC, so I think there's going to be a lot of back and forth here. We do feel, wherever it ends up, it will be fine. We have a strong relationship with FINRA, a strong relationship with the New York Stock Exchange, a strong relationship with the SEC. And we really believe that when you look at fees, when you bring all parties to the table, not just the funds, but all parties and have good information that we'll get to a very good place on that. 
I think it's -- in terms of speculating on timing, I think it's going to be a long debate about who is the right place for it to do. And then if there were to be a review, as you know, the last one took several years to unfold."

It's just a -- it's a modest positive. 
With respect to 498B, it had a couple of components. There is a -- the most important component was really around moving some of the long-form communications to summary form. We think that would be good for the industry. We think it would be good for investors, and the economics of that are neutral to us. 
There was some conversation about dropping the annual prospectus. There was a lot of mixed commentary on that as the comments came back, so that seems less likely to us. As you recall in -- when we discussed this, I believe, in the summer call, what we said is the -- we saw potentially a downtick from the prospectus revenue, an uptick from the idea of us being able to create the summary documents for people and really provide an industry solution around that, and we saw those balancing each other.
If we're to proceed with the summaries, but not with the prospectus downtick, then that would be a plus, but I think this is going to be quite some time for it to unfold. The new administration is coming in. They have their own set of priorities. And so I think, really, the timing of this is highly uncertain at this stage."

At the same time, we believe in the strong dividend. We don't let cash buildup. We only invest when we're confident we can execute well. So that's why you see these priorities around internal investment, dividends, M&A, share buyback in that order. 
We are definitely looking at M&A opportunities. We think that's an evergreen strategy for us to supplement our internal product development and bring more value to our clients. In this environment, prices are high, and it's unclear whether any of the opportunities that we're looking at will come through at prices that make sense to us. And we have been on the doorstep a couple of times this year and not been able to go through at a price that made sense for our shareholders.

And this environment might be a little challenging in terms of the focus of some of our potential partners on closing the contracts. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, large signing can have us to the top or a delay, which normally means a delay into the next year, not the fact that we won't be able to close the sale can be a challenge for us.

I think we're clearly seeing the extension of healthy trends around the democratization of retail shareholding, and that is building on the prior trends that are still there towards managed accounts and model-based investing. So I think those 2 are building on each other. And -- so I do think that it's going to be something that is longer term.

The 0 commission trading, I think you mentioned more retail investors coming in. I think that's good for Broadridge. In fact, they want to engage and interact digitally. So I think that's also a tailwind for Broadridge. And hopefully, that's stable going forward.
The newer things, the coordinated buying efforts, the SPACs, don't exactly -- yet know exactly how stable that is, and we're not counting on that as we look to our outlook going forward. But as Tim mentioned, that higher growth that we saw Q4, Q1 and Q2, we expect to moderate, but still be in the low double digit for the rest of this year.

I think that, that is a very nice opportunity for us on top of the cash securities opportunity. It is -- I think it will take some time for it to unfold, as people will be looking for us to bring R.J. O'Brien live. And so I'm not looking to have an immediate impact on this, but I do think that, over the longer term, it's going to really increase the power of our argument around global simplification.

Two things I'd say about it. The higher performance on the revenue side and our ability to be able to get the efficiency gains, expand operating margins through the initiatives, which I'll touch on that we mentioned in Q1, is what allowed us to to make these investments. 
And so in Q1, we talked about -- roughly about $80 million in cost initiatives, real estate, cloud migration, product realignment, and I think we're well on track. You saw 150 basis points of margin expansion in the second quarter. And I think it's that efficiency that gives us the capacity to be able to make these investments. 
The second point I'll make, and then I'll turn it to Tim to see if he has anything, is that the investments has been a key part of the financial model in strategy for growth, a key part of our capital allocation program prior to my joining, and it's going to -- we're going to continue to remain committed to it to support the future growth. 
And I think we have -- Tim mentioned some of these, we have a number of high-returning investment opportunities, as we look across our post-trade platforms, our wealth management platforms. As we look across products and SRD II and VSM and, obviously, our people with our broader sales market strategies. These things help us with growth long term. Might be a little margin compression in the short term, but they help us with long-term growth.

I think I was a bit surprised to see the increase in distribution revenues this quarter, and that's not something that we generally expect. That was really due to increase in both regulatory and event communications. I think we continue to expect that, over the long run, that physical piece will be a smaller part of our business model, and the digital piece will be a bigger piece. 
Relative to adviser versus digital channels with the sector investing, I think we're just -- we're seeing both. We saw very good position growth across all of our broker-dealers, including both adviser and online. I think, perhaps in terms of number of investors we're seeing with this democratization, the new investors being on the digital side. But if you look at where the money is, it's still definitely on the adviser side. 
And those underlying trends that we've been talking about for the past couple of years, we don't see any change in terms of move to managed accounts, move to model-based investing.
