We're excited to discuss our fourth quarter and annual results with you today. Overall, we had a very strong Q4 and full year 2020, despite the ongoing global challenges presented by COVID-19. Before we jump",2103,"Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. We're excited to discuss our fourth quarter and annual results with you today. 
Overall, we had a very strong Q4 and full year 2020, despite the ongoing global challenges presented by COVID-19. 
Before we jump into the numbers, I would first like to remind everyone once again that our fourth quarter included an extra week this year, which also included New Year's Eve and New Year's Day. Both of which are typically major sales days. We have an extra week in our fiscal year every 5 or 6 years, depending on how the calendar falls. Typically, our fiscal year consists of 3 12-week quarters and a 16-week fourth quarter. But in 2020, our fourth quarter consisted of 17 weeks. In the earnings release we filed this morning, the impact of this additional week has been adjusted out of our 2020 results as an item affecting comparability. The next time this will happen is in 2026. 
Turning to our results. 
Overall, our team members and franchisees around the world generated strong operating results, leading to a diluted EPS of $3.85 for Q4 and $12.39 for the full year. Our diluted EPS, as adjusted for the extra week in our fiscal year, was $3.46 for Q4 and $12.01 for the full year. 
Here's some additional detail on the components of our earnings. 
In Q4, global retail sales grew 21.7% as compared to Q4 2019. As a reminder, global retail sales growth includes both comp growth and unit growth, which I'll break down for you in a moment. Our global retail sales in Q4 were benefited by the extra week and also by a weaker dollar. When excluding the extra week and the positive impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew 12%. 
For the full year, our global retail sales grew 12.5%. When excluding the extra week and the negative impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew 10.4%. 
Breaking down our global retail sales growth. 
Our U.S. retail sales grew 22.8% during Q4 and 17.6% for the full year. When excluding the extra week, U.S. retail sales grew 14.3% in Q4 and 15% for the full year. 
Our international retail sales grew 20.7% during Q4 and 7.5% for the full year. When excluding the extra week and the impact of foreign currency, international retail sales grew 9.9% for Q4 and 5.9% for the full year. 
During Q4, we continued to see positive momentum in our international business, including a reduction in temporary store closures and other operating restrictions, which contributed to sequentially stronger same-store sales performance and an increase in net units, which I'll discuss in more detail momentarily. 
Turning to comps. During Q4, we continued to lead the broader restaurant industry, with 39 straight quarters of positive U.S. comparable sales and 108 consecutive quarters or 27 years of positive international comps, both truly remarkable achievements. Same-store sales in the U.S. grew 11.2% in the quarter, lapping a prior year increase of 3.4%. And same-store sales for our international business grew 7.3%, rolling over a prior year increase of 1.7%. As a reminder, our same-store sales growth is not affected by the extra week. 
Breaking down the U.S. comp. Our franchise business increased 11.4% in the quarter while our company-owned stores were up 8.1%. The U.S. comp this quarter was driven by a healthy mix of both ticket and order growth. Within that mix, our ticket growth was driven by an increase in items per order and a higher delivery mix, which often comes with an associated transparent delivery fee. The 7.3% international comp was driven by ticket growth. Similar to in our U.S. business, that ticket growth was driven by both a higher item count and a higher delivery mix. 
Shifting to unit count. We and our franchisees added 116 net stores in the U.S. during the fourth quarter, consisting of 118 store openings and 2 closures. For the full year, we and our franchisees opened 229 net U.S. stores. Our international business added 272 net stores during Q4, comprised of 328 store openings and 56 closures. For the full year, we added 395 net international stores. In total, we and our franchisees opened 624 stores globally in 2020. 
We're very pleased with our ability to continue to grow units during the pandemic and particularly encouraged by our strong growth in Q4. However, we do still face some challenges opening stores in certain markets, including delays in construction and permitting, which we will continue to monitor moving forward. 
Regarding revenues and operating margins. 
Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $1.4 billion and were up $206 million or 17.9% from the prior year quarter. Total revenues for the year were $4.1 billion and were up $499 million or 13.8% from prior year. The extra week increased revenues by an estimated $88 million. The remaining increase was driven by higher global retail sales, which in turn drove higher revenues across all areas of our business. 
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted our international royalty revenues by $0.4 million in Q4 as compared to Q4 2019, and negatively impacted our royalty revenues by $3.9 million for the full year as compared to 2019. 
Our consolidated operating margin as a percent of revenues increased to 39.5% from 38.9% in Q4 2019, due primarily to higher revenues from our U.S. franchise business, partially offset by investments made related to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Company-owned store margin as a percent of revenue decreased to 21.9% from 24.4% in Q4 2019 and was negatively impacted by higher COVID-related labor costs. 
As we announced in December of 2020, we paid a special bonus to our front-line workers to thank them for their contributions throughout the pandemic. 
Supply chain operating margin as a percent of revenue increased to 11.6% from 11.1% in Q4 2019, driven by operating efficiencies and reduced fuel expenses. 
G&A expenses increased approximately $19 million in Q4 2020 as compared to Q4 2019. For the full year, our G&A was $407 million, an increase of approximately $24 million as compared to prior year. We estimate that $6 million of these expenses were incurred as a result of the extra week this year. The remaining increase primarily related to higher variable performance-based compensation expense and professional fees and was partially offset by lower travel expenses. 
Net interest expense increased approximately $8 million in the quarter as compared to Q4 2019. We estimate that $3 million of this increase was driven by the extra week this year. The remaining increase was driven by a higher weighted average debt balance resulting from our 2019 recapitalization transaction and was partially offset by a lower weighted average borrowing rate. Our weighted average borrowing rate decreased to 3.9% from 4.0% in Q4 2019 due to the lower interest rates on the debt outstanding in Q4 2020 as compared to Q4 2019. 
Our reported effective tax rate was 19.9% for the quarter as compared to 17.8% in Q4 2019. The reported effective tax rate in Q4 2020 included a 1.8 percentage point positive impact from tax benefits on equity-based compensation as compared to a 3.9 percentage point positive impact in Q4 2019. We expect to see continued volatility in our effective tax rate related to these equity-based compensation tax benefits. 
When you combine all of these elements, our fourth quarter net income was up $22.6 million or 17.5% over Q4 2019. For the full year, our net income went up $90.6 million or 22.6% over 2019. We estimate that the 53rd week positively impacted net income by $15 million in the fourth quarter and for the full year due to the additional week of sales and the associated operating leverage, which is included as an item affecting comparability in our earnings release. 
Our diluted EPS in Q4 was $3.85 versus $3.12 in the prior year, an increase of 23.4%. Our diluted EPS as adjusted in Q4 was $3.46 versus diluted EPS as adjusted of $3.13 in Q4 2019, an increase of 10.5%. Breaking down that $0.33 increase a bit. Most notably, our improved operating results benefited us by $0.34. Our lower diluted share count, driven by share repurchases during 2020, benefited us by $0.16. I'll provide more detail on share repurchases in a moment. Higher net interest expense, resulting primarily from the higher average debt balances I mentioned earlier, negatively impacted us by $0.10. And finally, our higher effective tax rate, resulting primarily from lower tax benefits on equity-based compensation, as I mentioned previously, negatively impacted us by $0.07. 
For the full year, our diluted EPS was $12.39 versus $9.56 in the prior year, an increase of 29.6%. Our diluted EPS as adjusted for the full year was $12.01 versus diluted EPS as adjusted of $9.57 in 2019, an increase of 25.5%. 
Shifting to cash. Our economic model remains strong, and it continued to generate significant free cash flow throughout the quarter. During full year 2020, we generated net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $593 million. After deducting for CapEx, we generated free cash flow of approximately $504 million. 
Regarding our capital expenditures, we spent approximately $89 million on CapEx in 2020, primarily on our supply chain centers and technology initiatives. 
During Q4, we also repurchased and retired approximately 568,000 shares for $225 million or $3.96 per share on average, bringing our 2020 total repurchases to $305 million. Subsequently, we've also repurchased an incremental 66,000 shares for $25 million year-to-date in Q1 2021. 
Related to our repurchases, we're also pleased to announce that, as you saw in this morning's earnings release, our Board of Directors has approved a new $1 billion share repurchase program, which has replaced the remaining authorization under our existing program. Additionally, during Q4, we returned $61 million to our shareholders in the form of 2 $0.78 quarterly dividend payments, bringing our 2020 total dividend payments to $122 million. As we move into 2021, we're excited to announce that our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.94 per share, to be paid on March 30, an increase of 21% over the previous quarter's dividend. When you add the share repurchases and quarterly dividends, the cumulative impact is that we returned more than $425 million to shareholders in 2020. 
Before wrapping up the financial update, I'd like to walk you through the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our Q4 results, as we have done in previous quarters. 
During Q4, the estimated total impact from safety and cleaning equipment, enhanced sick pay and other compensation for our team members, and support for our franchisees and our communities was $7 million. 
As we look ahead, we would like to remind you of the 2021 outlook items that we communicated in mid-January as well as provide you with a longer-range outlook. 
We currently project that the store food basket within our U.S. system will be up 2.5% to 3.5% as compared to 2020 levels, and we do expect some volatility around that range quarter-to-quarter. We estimate that foreign currency could have a $4 million to $8 million positive impact on royalty revenues in 2021 as compared to 2020. We anticipate our gross CapEx investments to be approximately $100 million, as we continue to invest in strategically growing our business, including in technology, innovation, new stores and supply chain capacity. We expect our G&A expense to be in the range of $415 million to $425 million. Keep in mind that G&A expense can vary up or down depending on, among other things, our performance versus our plan, as that affects variable performance-based compensation expense, as well as other areas such as corporate store advertising. In addition, in this morning's earnings release, we also announced our 2 to 3-year outlook of 6% to 10% global retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, and 6% to 8% global net unit growth. 
We anticipate providing additional outlook measures if and when we have the appropriate visibility into the broader environment such that it would be meaningful for the investment community. 
In closing, our business continued its strong performance during the fourth quarter and for the year, and we remain in very good shape financially. Obviously, we will continue to closely monitor all aspects of our business operations given these uncertain times. 
And finally, as I intend to do in each of these calls, I want to take a minute to thank our incredible team members and franchisees around the world. They're the reason our brand is able to generate these results. 
Thank you again for joining the call today. And I'll now turn it over to Rich."

2020 was a milestone year for us at Domino's. It's our 60th year in business, and it certainly was a year like no other. We and our franchisees entered the year with great optimism and solid plans to continue to grow the Domino's brand around the world. 
As COVID-19 swept across the globe, we were forced to adapt quickly to a new and more challenging operating environment. As we continue to deal with the pandemic, we were also [ comprised ] with profound issues around social justice that could not be ignored. Throughout the year, my team and I led with our values. And we stayed focused on our core stakeholders. Those are our customers, our team members, our franchisees, our communities and our shareholders. And despite the any challenges, our franchisees and team members rose to the occasion and delivered exceptional results during 2020. I am so grateful for the hundreds of thousands of committed people around the world who wear the Domino's logo every day. The year like no other really brought out the strength and determination that makes the Domino's culture so unique. 
Now I'd like to do a few things on the call this morning. I'll share some reflections on our performance during the quarter. But I'll focus most of my commentary on 2020 in total, across both our U.S. and our international businesses. And I'll discuss some of the things we are focused on as we look forward into 2021 and beyond. And then following that, as always, we'll take some Q&A. 
So with that as our road map for the morning, let's get started with our U.S. business. 
Over the past 60 years, we've worked very hard to earn the trust of our customers, built on our commitment to high-quality products, service and image, along with our industry leading value. In 2020, that foundation of trust was as critical as ever. This trust allowed us to connect with our customers in unique ways and to communicate and to execute a safe, quality delivery experience for them and their families. We never took their trust lightly. And through innovations such as contactless delivery and Domino's car side delivery, we remain focused on ensuring that our customers felt as confident and safe as ever when they ordered from Domino's. We gave our customers more options, expanding our menu with 3 new product launches in the back half of 2020. Our new wings and sauces have been enthusiastically embraced by our customers. And our new cheeseburger and chicken taco pizzas are now among our best-selling specialty pizzas. 
Now innovation wasn't just limited to our delivery options or menu in 2020. We also delivered a number of operations in technology innovations to our stores. Those included our GPS driver tracking, our enhanced macon line and cuttable technology and tools, and our AI-enabled forecasting to better match demand with capacity in our stores. These innovations are all designed to increase speed, accuracy and efficiency, allowing us to continue to better serve our customers. 
We, along with our franchisees, also remain dedicated and disciplined on the value we're known for when our customers really needed it the most. Our core $5.99 and $7.99 platforms have been a reliable, important part of the Domino's brand experience for many years. 
While we certainly brought new customers into the brand over the last year, the story of 2020 was more about the frequency and loyalty of our existing customer base. Our customers ordered more often. And when they did, they also ordered more items. And we saw that specifically among our loyalty program members. We now have over 27 million, 27 million active members in our pizza of the pie rewards loyalty program. Notably, we achieved continued year-over-year growth in our loyalty program without running any of our more aggressive week-long promotions during the last 3 quarters of 2020. 
Now despite the challenges associated with construction and permitting during the pandemic, store growth was once again a significant driver for us of growth in the U.S. We and our franchisees, both new and existing, continued to invest in our businesses, resulting in 229 net new stores for the year. If you look back over the last 5 years, we've opened nearly 1,200 new stores in the U.S. and we have closed fewer than 80 over the last 5 years. We continued to invest in our supply chain business to support the growth of our franchisees, opening 2 new U.S. centers in 2020, on time and on budget. And that's despite the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. We opened in Columbia, South Carolina in march. We opened in Katy, Texas in December. And in September, we also added a thin crust production line to our existing supply chain center in Edison, New Jersey. 
We also invested in the safety and well-being of our frontline corporate store and supply chain team members throughout 2020. We invested in equipment and processes designed to ensure their safety and an enhanced sick pay and benefits and enhanced hourly wages, recognizing the unique challenges of working during the pandemic, including the nearly $10 million in bonuses that we paid to our corporate store and supply chain team members in the month of December. 
And we invested in our communities throughout 2020: partnering with our franchisees to donate 10 million slices to first-responders, frontline workers and families in need; responding to natural disasters by getting food to people in need; launching a national hiring campaign to provide 30,000 jobs to workers who may have been displaced from theirs; committing $3 million to support black communities in the U.S., including $1 million to establish the Domino's Black Franchisee Opportunity Fund; and partnering with our franchisees to raise $100 million over the next 10 years for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. We and our franchisees raised $13 million for St. Jude in 2020 alone. 
Now looking ahead to 2020 in our U.S. business, we will continue as a work in progress brand, striving to get a little better each and every day. And I'll highlight a few focus areas. And not surprisingly, most of these areas will not be new news to you. 
First, we will continue to fortress our markets, driving faster and more consistent service, lower delivery costs, better economics for drivers and incremental carryout traffic. Fortressing will continue to drive overall store growth into 2021, including in our company-owned markets. We will continue to deliver new product innovation in 2021. We will continue to produce world-class advertising. And we're excited to begin our relationship with Work In Progress as our new advertising agency. We will continue to invest in technology to enable great customer experiences, to drive speed, accuracy and efficiency inside our stores, to improve our corporate store team members' ability to support our business. 
Value is always a key focus for us, and that won't change in 2021. More than ever, with many Americans out of work in these uncertain economic times, value matters. And we are committed to maintaining our unquestioned position of value leadership within the QSR pizza segment. 
We're ramping up our focus on service in 2021, getting pizzas out the door to our customers hotter, fresher and more reliably than ever before through innovation within our stores. We're doubling down with technology, with training and with communications. 
We will continue to invest in our frontline team members across our corporate stores and supply chain centers, increasing hourly wages in many markets and enhancing our team member benefits. We will also be taking a comprehensive look at our environmental impact. Within the next 1 to 3 years, we will set science-based, time-bound commitments in accordance with the science-based targets initiative process to reduce the company's total contribution to climate change. And as always, we will remain obsessed, absolutely obsessed with franchisee profitability. 
Stu shared our initial 2020 store level EBITDA estimate with you in January. And we will share the final number with you when that figure is ready, but we do expect it to be higher than the estimate that STU shared with you last month. While we believe this level of profitability and associated cash-on-cash returns exceeds any player in our category, we recognize that some of our franchisees and our corporate stores are under intense cost pressure. Despite higher overall levels of unemployment across the country, many local labor markets remain tight and wages continue to rise across the country. Fixed costs such as rent and insurance also bring added pressure. But my team and I recognize these challenges. And we remain intensely focused on helping to drive efficiency and profitability at the store and enterprise level for our franchisees, just as we are for our corporate markets. 
As I look back on the fourth quarter and on the full year, I'm very happy with our U.S. performance. We achieved our 39th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales growth and we surpassed $8 billion in U.S. retail sales for the very first time. I am confident that we are well positioned to continue playing the long game in our U.S. business. 
Now I'm going to move on to international. 
During the fourth quarter, our pandemic recovery continued, as we reopened stores and delivered the strongest quarterly comp we've reported in 4 years. We marked our 108th straight positive quarter. That's 27 full years, an incredible run that seemed in doubt when COVID struck early in the year. And I'm particularly pleased that our master franchisees continued to invest in the business, opening 272 net stores in the quarter and 395 net for the full year. Now when you consider that we had about 2,400 stores temporarily closed back in Q2, this is truly a remarkable achievement. And it highlights the terrific unit level economics that our master franchisees have built in many markets around the globe. There is no question that we had more closures in 2020. In fact, we had over 300 than you would normally see from Domino [ in a ] year. This was driven by strategic choices in several markets from previously underperforming units, including a number of units with formats that admittedly would have struggled in the new operating environment rather than reopening them after the pandemic. 
So when I look forward, I am very optimistic about our master franchisees' ability to ramp up our unit growth across the international business. And I want to thank our international partners for their engagement throughout the year. We dramatically increased our communication across the system. And master franchisees from all over the world really leaned in, sharing best practices throughout the year to help their peers and to help our U.S. team manage through the pandemic. This truly demonstrated the power of the global Domino's system. And we could not have responded so effectively to COVID without this level of partnership. 
Now I'd love to share a few 2020 market highlights. 
We opened for the first time in Croatia, welcoming the team there to the Domino's family. We opened 95 net stores in China and grew retail sales by over 30%, accelerating growth in this very important market. We were also very pleased to invest in DASH brands, our master franchise partner, with a $40 million investment in 2020 and the subsequent $40 million investment which we completed in Q1 of this year. We are excited to partner more deeply with their terrific management team and investors. And I am more optimistic than ever about the potential for Domino's in China. Japan was an incredible success story in 2020, passing the 700-store milestone with 100 net stores and over 40% in retail sales growth. Germany is another market that saw outstanding retail sales growth of over 25%, with 100 -- excuse me, where we are fast approaching 350 stores, with much potential for future growth. 
I'd also like to thank our teams that worked incredibly hard to reopen stores throughout the year following the COVID-driven closures. India, France, Spain, Mexico, New Zealand and Panama are a few of the markets, along with many others around the world, that have pushed hard to bounce back from significant temporary closures and to position themselves for growth in 2021. Based on the latest reports, we now have fewer than 150 temporary international store closures. 
Now when we look at this recovery in our international business, India deserves a specific mention. After some strategic store closures earlier in the year, Jubilant Foodworks, our master franchise partner, dramatically accelerated growth with 50 net stores in their most recent reported quarter. And as we look forward into 2021, I remain very optimistic about the long-term growth potential of our international business. The opportunity is there. Our unit economics are strong, and our master franchisees are committed. Combined with our corporate support and best practice sharing around the globe, we have the recipe to take this business to its full potential. 
So in closing, 2020 was a year like none other, but Domino's is a brand like none other. I am proud of our franchise partners and our team members who once again proved to me that they are the best in the restaurant business. And as we look ahead to 2021, we aren't sure exactly what the new normal will look like or when we'll get there, but we will remain diligently focused on delivering for our customers our team members, our franchisees, our communities and our shareholders. 
At Domino's, we have a long track record of profitable growth, driven by a disciplined operating model. This model served us well in 2020 and will continue to be the foundation for our growth in 2021 and beyond. This gives me a great deal of confidence in our ability to grow the Domino's brand over the long term. That confidence is demonstrated in this morning's release, where we announced our new 2 to 3-year outlook of 6% to 10% global retail sales growth and 6% to 8% global net unit growth as well as our new $1 billion share repurchase program. 
So I'll leave my remarks this morning with a heartfelt thank you to our franchise partners and team members. And that's not just for your efforts in 2020, but also for your continued perseverance in 2021 as we battled COVID and the recent winter storms across the U.S. I am proud to serve you each and every day. 
And with that, Stu and I will be happy to take your questions."

And our new outlook that we've published is a 2 to 3-year look. But specifically to your question on the unit growth, we were really pleased to see some significant momentum building in the fourth quarter of the year, as you saw in the store growth numbers that we published, both for the U.S. business and for the international business. And the reality is there was a lot of pent-up demand out there throughout the course of the year where we just had challenges getting stores opened up due to construction and permitting and other issues. But the fundamental unit level economics in the business have never been better. 
Stu shared a preliminary look at U.S. store-level EBITDA last month. And as we tabulate the final numbers, we expect it to be at least that $158,000 or higher. So terrific economics in the business. Our approach to fortressing in the U.S. and in our international markets is still working very, very well for us. 
And then as it relates to the global retail sales growth number. While COVID gave us some tailwind on that in the U.S., it was actually a headwind in the international side of the business when you look at all the temporary store closures that we had back in the second quarter, where we were up around 2,400 units that were closed, which had a significant impact, as you know, on retail sales back then. 
So we're optimistic, Brian, as we look forward, and that optimism is reflected in that new outlook that we published this morning."

You said the star of 2020 was really about increased orders and spend from existing customers. I know that you always get a lot of questions about consolidation and independents. But I guess my sense would be then based on what you're talking about in your business, that maybe the whole category saw a nice tailwind, including both big competitors and independents. So maybe less about share shifts to Domino's and more about an aggregate kind of rising tide. And I was just wondering if you could talk a bit about that now that we're a year into the pandemic, if you have a better sense of maybe where the traffic was coming from or going to and what the intra-segment dynamics look like."

And what I'll -- as I answer your question, I'll break it down a bit across the 2 businesses that we run out of each of our boxes across the country. 
So if you start with the delivery business, most certainly, the pandemic brought a tailwind in the delivery business, not just for Domino's Pizza, but across the category, and frankly, across categories. And during the year, we saw strong growth in both order counts and also growth in ticket in that delivery business as customers tended to order more pizzas. 
As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we also saw that, in particular, our 27 million active loyalty members ordered more from us. Their frequency increased during the year. 
If you contrast that with the carryout business, in the carryout business, COVID actually brought a headwind for us in terms of customer activity. As fewer customers during the pandemic were comfortable going out and walking into restaurants even to pick up carryout, we did see some pressure on order counts in the carryout business. And the growth story there in 2020 was really around ticket. 
Now prior to the pandemic, that carryout business has been a terrific source of customer acquisition and order count growth for us. So as we look forward into 2021, that is one of the important drivers that we see in terms of our ability to continue to grow sales in the U.S., is the restart of that growth on the carryout side of the business."

The half-life of any lead that you have is pretty short on that side of the business. And our investments will continue. They did in 2020 and will continue going forward. We're continuing to make great progress with the development of our next-generation of our Pulse software, which is really the heartbeat of our stores. We're continuing to invest in our digital ordering platforms as well. And we saw a really nice growth in digital ordering. During 2020, our digital sales for the year went up about 5 points over 2019. We ran about 75% digital sales throughout 2020. So we will continue to make investments there to drive the business on the customer side. 
We're also ramping up our investments in technology as it relates to how we operate our stores. So I've talked a little bit about GPS tracking. We invested in that in 2020, substantially rolled that out across the entire U.S. system. We'll continue to invest there, and also additional technology tools at the make line and at the cut table inside our stores to make the jobs easier for our team members and to help us to get pizzas out the door faster to our customers."

But I did just want to get your overall thoughts, especially as you do have some leading indicators of markets that have reopened. And most people talk about the reopening trade of people going back and dining in restaurants. And a lot of the consumer packaged food companies seem to suggest that they're not going to lose very much of their own business that they've generated through grocery in 2020. 
So the question is, as we think about second half of '21 versus second half of '19 or even if we think about '22 versus '19, what's your sense? And listen, and I guess at this point, it's a guess, but you guys get to make an educated guess using some of the early market data that you have of kind of being able to grow sales versus the '19 level, even if we do say, hey, comping against high teens comps is just always going to be difficult for any business, and we just shouldn't expect that.

So when I look across 2021, one important growth driver for us is going to be to reaccelerate that growth on the carryout side of the business, because we know lapping some of the delivery tailwind is going to be difficult. We're also going to continue to invest in value in the business, as we always have, and making sure that as our customers continue to manage their households through what is going to be a fairly difficult economic time for a lot of Americans, we believe that continuing to stay focused on value is also going to help us. As a lot of folks who have been paying a lot to have food delivered to their houses, as behaviors start to change and other options open up, we're going to continue to have Domino's as the unquestioned value leader in the QSR pizza segment, and frankly, broadly across the restaurant industry. When you think about what it costs to have food delivered to feed a family of 4, we really like our positioning in that space. 
We'll also look throughout the year to reinitiate some of our boost weeks. Our aggressive value weeks that have been an important part of our strategy to acquire customers over the last number of years. 
So we're not going to do anything, John, just to lap a comp. That's not how we manage the business here. Everything that we do is going to be around how do we continue to drive sustained and profitable long-term growth for our franchisees and ourselves."

One is that there is no question that the stimulus dollars and the enhanced federal unemployment insurance certainly puts money in consumers' pockets and allows them to go out and buy food.

And their transparent delivery fees at the local level, they're going to be higher in these higher wage markets than they are in some of the others. So we've been able to manage our way through a lot of minimum wage increases across the country. 
And I'll tell you, quite honestly, in our corporate store business, we're not paying the federal minimum wage anyway. You can't go out there and hire people at that rate anyway. We're above the minimum wage, both for our folks that work inside the stores and our tip drivers on the road. And then in our supply chain business, we're in excess of $15 an hour everywhere we operate."

So coming into COVID, Domino's and the pizza category in general is facing incremental competition from the growth in third-party delivery. Whereas you mentioned that COVID, the delivery channel overall has benefited with the acceleration of adoption? So as you look at the competitive environment today, do you think Domino's is any better positioned with respect to third-party delivery now that restaurants will likely be more focused on bringing back in-store traffic and there's some kind of regular -- more regulatory requirements, or in a more challenging position given the breadth and depth of competition has increased?"

I think for us, we be honest, we struggled a little bit understanding the long-term economics in some of the aggregator businesses. In 60 years, we've never made a dollar delivering a pizza. We make money on the product, but we don't make money on the delivery. So we're just not sure how others do it. And in a world where we're trying to shrink our delivery area to get closer to our customer for better service, a lot of these third-parties are trying to expand to reach more customers, which we think just takes away from service. 
And when you think about the profit equation, you get somebody who inserts themselves into the value chain, and they have to make their money somewhere. And it's either got to come from the restaurant or it has to come from the customer. And we think, over time, that's going to put a lot of pressure, particularly on the independent restaurants, to be able to continue to make margins in rising cost environments while paying these aggregators. And the customers over time are going to start looking at the free delivery that cost them $15 to get $12 worth of food when they start digging in to look at service fees and service charges. 
So we're just not sure how it all plays out. And you've seen that with some of the public players in that space who have commented about the challenge of driving long-term profitability as an aggregator. So for us, we continue to just be the low-cost delivery provider, provide great value. And we think as long as we're providing a great product with great service at a great value, we'll let everything else shake out. And certainly, we don't know how long it will take to all shake out. But from our perspective, we're in a pretty good spot."

So I'll talk about loyalty, maybe just even a little bit more broadly because there were a couple of metrics that I shared earlier that I think are important on this front. One is the increase in the number of active members of our piece of the pie rewards program, which was up to 27 million plus. We also saw an increase in engagement and frequency among that group as well, which is a big focus of ours. Once that program gets to that level of scale, 27 million plus, and we've got -- beyond that, we've got 40 million plus that at some point have been enrolled in the program, and we've got 80 million plus customers that are in our database. So we spent a lot of time on initiatives thinking about how can we continue to mine that treasure of customers and find ways to better serve them at their time of need to drive higher frequency. 
Another metric I shared earlier that is also important is the increase that we saw in digital engagement with our customers, with digital sales going up from 70% to 75% during the year broadly across the customer base. That's yet another opportunity because those customers tend -- our ticket tends to be higher because we do a better job with upsell on them. And once they start ordering digitally, they tend to be stickier with us over the long term. So we'll continue, as we always do, many efforts focused in that space. 
And then you asked about new products also. We had, as I mentioned earlier, 3 that we successfully launched in 2020, and that's going to continue to be part of our playbook going forward. We've got some exciting things that our culinary team has been working on that I certainly like, and based on our testing, a lot of our customers do as well. So you'll see some more news coming from us in that space during 2021 as well."

We're excited to discuss our fourth quarter and annual results with you today. Overall, we had a very strong Q4 and full year 2020, despite the ongoing global challenges presented by COVID-19.  Before we jump i",2103,"Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. We're excited to discuss our fourth quarter and annual results with you today. Overall, we had a very strong Q4 and full year 2020, despite the ongoing global challenges presented by COVID-19.  
Before we jump into the numbers, I would first like to remind everyone once again that our fourth quarter included an extra week this year, which also included New Year's Eve and New Year's Day. Both of which are typically major sales days. We have an extra week in our fiscal year every 5 or 6 years, depending on how the calendar falls. Typically, our fiscal year consists of 3 12-week quarters and a 16-week fourth quarter. But in 2020, our fourth quarter consisted of 17 weeks. In the earnings release we filed this morning, the impact of this additional week has been adjusted out of our 2020 results as an item affecting comparability. The next time this will happen is in 2026.  
Turning to our results. Overall, our team members and franchisees around the world generated strong operating results, leading to a diluted EPS of $3.85 for Q4 and $12.39 for the full year. Our diluted EPS, as adjusted for the extra week in our fiscal year, was $3.46 for Q4 and $12.01 for the full year.  
Here's some additional detail on the components of our earnings. In Q4, global retail sales grew 21.7% as compared to Q4 2019. As a reminder, global retail sales growth includes both comp growth and unit growth, which I'll break down for you in a moment. Our global retail sales in Q4 were benefited by the extra week and also by a weaker dollar. When excluding the extra week and the positive impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew 12%. For the full year, our global retail sales grew 12.5%. When excluding the extra week and the negative impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew 10.4%.  
Breaking down our global retail sales growth. Our U.S. retail sales grew 22.8% during Q4 and 17.6% for the full year. When excluding the extra week, U.S. retail sales grew 14.3% in Q4 and 15% for the full year.  
Our international retail sales grew 20.7% during Q4 and 7.5% for the full year. When excluding the extra week and the impact of foreign currency, international retail sales grew 9.9% for Q4 and 5.9% for the full year. 
During Q4, we continued to see positive momentum in our international business, including a reduction in temporary store closures and other operating restrictions, which contributed to sequentially stronger same-store sales performance and an increase in net units, which I'll discuss in more detail momentarily.  
Turning to comps. During Q4, we continued to lead the broader restaurant industry, with 39 straight quarters of positive U.S. comparable sales and 108 consecutive quarters or 27 years of positive international comps, both truly remarkable achievements. Same-store sales in the U.S. grew 11.2% in the quarter, lapping a prior year increase of 3.4%. And same-store sales for our international business grew 7.3%, rolling over a prior year increase of 1.7%. As a reminder, our same-store sales growth is not affected by the extra week.  
Breaking down the U.S. comp. Our franchise business increased 11.4% in the quarter while our company-owned stores were up 8.1%. The U.S. comp this quarter was driven by a healthy mix of both ticket and order growth. Within that mix, our ticket growth was driven by an increase in items per order and a higher delivery mix, which often comes with an associated transparent delivery fee. The 7.3% international comp was driven by ticket growth. Similar to in our U.S. business, that ticket growth was driven by both a higher item count and a higher delivery mix.  
Shifting to unit count. We and our franchisees added 116 net stores in the U.S. during the fourth quarter, consisting of 118 store openings and 2 closures. For the full year, we and our franchisees opened 229 net U.S. stores. Our international business added 272 net stores during Q4, comprised of 328 store openings and 56 closures. For the full year, we added 395 net international stores. In total, we and our franchisees opened 624 stores globally in 2020.  
We're very pleased with our ability to continue to grow units during the pandemic and particularly encouraged by our strong growth in Q4. However, we do still face some challenges opening stores in certain markets, including delays in construction and permitting, which we will continue to monitor moving forward.  
Regarding revenues and operating margins. Total revenues for the fourth quarter were $1.4 billion and were up $206 million or 17.9% from the prior year quarter. Total revenues for the year were $4.1 billion and were up $499 million, or 13.8%, from prior year. The extra week increased revenues by an estimated $88 million. The remaining increase was driven by higher global retail sales, which in turn drove higher revenues across all areas of our business.  
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted our international royalty revenues by $0.4 million in Q4 as compared to Q4 2019, and negatively impacted our royalty revenues by $3.9 million for the full year as compared to 2019.  
Our consolidated operating margin as a percent of revenues increased to 39.5% from 38.9% in Q4 2019, due primarily to higher revenues from our U.S. franchise business, partially offset by investments made related to the COVID-19 pandemic.  
Company-owned store margin as a percent of revenue decreased to 21.9% from 24.4% in Q4 2019 and was negatively impacted by higher COVID-related labor costs. As we announced in December of 2020, we paid a special bonus to our frontline workers to thank them for their contributions throughout the pandemic.  
Supply chain operating margin as a percent of revenue increased to 11.6% from 11.1% in Q4 2019, driven by operating efficiencies and reduced fuel expenses.  
G&A expenses increased approximately $19 million in Q4 2020 as compared to Q4 2019. For the full year, our G&A was $407 million, an increase of approximately $24 million as compared to prior year. We estimate that $6 million of these expenses were incurred as a result of the extra week this year. The remaining increase primarily related to higher variable performance-based compensation expense and professional fees and was partially offset by lower travel expenses.  
Net interest expense increased approximately $8 million in the quarter as compared to Q4 2019. We estimate that $3 million of this increase was driven by the extra week this year. The remaining increase was driven by a higher weighted average debt balance resulting from our 2019 recapitalization transaction and was partially offset by a lower weighted average borrowing rate. Our weighted average borrowing rate decreased to 3.9% from 4.0% in Q4 2019 due to the lower interest rates on the debt outstanding in Q4 2020 as compared to Q4 2019.  
Our reported effective tax rate was 19.9% for the quarter as compared to 17.8% in Q4 2019. The reported effective tax rate in Q4 2020 included a 1.8 percentage point positive impact from tax benefits on equity-based compensation as compared to a 3.9 percentage point positive impact in Q4 2019. We expect to see continued volatility in our effective tax rate related to these equity-based compensation tax benefits.  
When you combine all of these elements, our fourth quarter net income was up $22.6 million, or 17.5%, over Q4 2019. For the full year, our net income was up $90.6 million, or 22.6%, over 2019. We estimate that the 53rd week positively impacted net income by $15 million in the fourth quarter and for the full year due to the additional week of sales and the associated operating leverage, which is included as an item affecting comparability in our earnings release.  
Our diluted EPS in Q4 was $3.85 versus $3.12 in the prior year, an increase of 23.4%. Our diluted EPS as adjusted in Q4 was $3.46 versus diluted EPS as adjusted of $3.13 in Q4 2019, an increase of 10.5%. Breaking down that $0.33 increase a bit. Most notably, our improved operating results benefited us by $0.34. Our lower diluted share count, driven by share repurchases during 2020, benefited us by $0.16. I'll provide more detail on share repurchases in a moment.  
Higher net interest expense, resulting primarily from the higher average debt balances I mentioned earlier, negatively impacted us by $0.10. And finally, our higher effective tax rate, resulting primarily from lower tax benefits on equity-based compensation, as I mentioned previously, negatively impacted us by $0.07.  
For the full year, our diluted EPS was $12.39 versus $9.56 in the prior year, an increase of 29.6%. Our diluted EPS as adjusted for the full year was $12.01 versus diluted EPS as adjusted of $9.57 in 2019, an increase of 25.5%.  
Shifting to cash. Our economic model remains strong, and it continued to generate significant free cash flow throughout the quarter. During full year 2020, we generated net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $593 million. After deducting for CapEx, we generated free cash flow of approximately $504 million.  
Regarding our capital expenditures, we spent approximately $89 million on CapEx in 2020, primarily on our supply chain centers and technology initiatives. During Q4, we also repurchased and retired approximately 568,000 shares for $225 million, or $3.96 per share, on average, bringing our 2020 total repurchases to $305 million. Subsequently, we've also repurchased an incremental 66,000 shares for $25 million year-to-date in Q1 2021.  
Related to our repurchases, we're also pleased to announce that, as you saw in this morning's earnings release, our Board of Directors has approved a new $1 billion share repurchase program, which has replaced the remaining authorization under our existing program. Additionally, during Q4, we returned $61 million to our shareholders in the form of 2 $0.78 quarterly dividend payments, bringing our 2020 total dividend payments to $122 million. As we move into 2021, we're excited to announce that our Board of Directors has declared a quarterly dividend of $0.94 per share, to be paid on March 30, an increase of 21% over the previous quarter's dividend. When you add the share repurchases and quarterly dividends, the cumulative impact is that we returned more than $425 million to shareholders in 2020.  
Before wrapping up the financial update, I'd like to walk you through the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our Q4 results, as we have done in previous quarters. During Q4, the estimated total impact from safety and cleaning equipment, enhanced sick pay and other compensation for our team members and support for our franchisees and our communities was $7 million.  
As we look ahead, we would like to remind you of the 2021 outlook items that we communicated in mid-January as well as provide you with a longer-range outlook. We currently project that the store food basket within our U.S. system will be up 2.5% to 3.5% as compared to 2020 levels, and we do expect some volatility around that range quarter-to-quarter. We estimate that foreign currency could have a $4 million to $8 million positive impact on royalty revenues in 2021 as compared to 2020. 
We anticipate our gross CapEx investments to be approximately $100 million, as we continue to invest in strategically growing our business, including in technology, innovation, new stores and supply chain capacity. We expect our G&A expense to be in the range of $415 million to $425 million. Keep in mind that G&A expense can vary up or down depending on, among other things, our performance versus our plan, as that affects variable performance-based compensation expense, as well as other areas such as corporate store advertising. 
In addition, in this morning's earnings release, we also announced our 2- to 3-year outlook of 6% to 10% global retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, and 6% to 8% global net unit growth. We anticipate providing additional outlook measures if and when we have the appropriate visibility into the broader environment such that it would be meaningful for the investment community.  
In closing, our business continued its strong performance during the fourth quarter and for the year, and we remain in very good shape financially. Obviously, we will continue to closely monitor all aspects of our business operations given these uncertain times.  
And finally, as I intend to do in each of these calls, I want to take a minute to thank our incredible team members and franchisees around the world. They're the reason our brand is able to generate these results.  
Thank you again for joining the call today. And I'll now turn it over to Rich."

2020 was a milestone year for us at Domino's. It's our 60th year in business, and it certainly was a year like no other. We and our franchisees entered the year with great optimism and solid plans to continue to grow the Domino's brand around the world.  
As COVID-19 swept across the globe, we were forced to adapt quickly to a new and more challenging operating environment. As we continue to deal with the pandemic, we were also confronted with profound issues around social justice that could not be ignored. Throughout the year, my team and I lead with our values. And we stayed focused on our core stakeholders. Those are our customers, our team members, our franchisees, our communities and our shareholders. And despite the any challenges, our franchisees and team members rose to the occasion and delivered exceptional results during 2020. I am so grateful for the hundreds of thousands of committed people around the world who wear the Domino's logo every day. The year like no other really brought out the strength and determination that makes the Domino's culture so unique.  
Now I'd like to do a few things on the call this morning. I'll share some reflections on our performance during the quarter. But I'll focus most of my commentary on 2020 in total, across both our U.S. and our international businesses. And I'll discuss some of the things we are focused on as we look forward into 2021 and beyond. And then following that, as always, we'll take some Q&A.  
So with that as our road map for the morning, let's get started with our U.S. business. 
Over the past 60 years, we've worked very hard to earn the trust of our customers, built on our commitment to high-quality products, service and image, along with our industry-leading value. In 2020, that foundation of trust was as critical as ever. This trust allowed us to connect with our customers in unique ways and to communicate and to execute a safe, quality delivery experience for them and their families. We never took their trust lightly. And through innovations such as contactless delivery and Domino's car side delivery, we remain focused on ensuring that our customers felt as confident and safe as ever when they ordered from Domino's. 
We gave our customers more options, expanding our menu with 3 new product launches in the back half of 2020. Our new wings and sauces have been enthusiastically embraced by our customers. And our new cheeseburger and chicken taco pizzas are now among our best-selling specialty pizzas.  
Now innovation wasn't just limited to our delivery options or menu in 2020. We also delivered a number of operations in technology innovations to our stores. Those included our GPS driver tracking, our enhanced makeline and cut table technology and tools, and our AI-enabled forecasting to better match demand with capacity in our stores. These innovations are all designed to increase speed, accuracy and efficiency, allowing us to continue to better serve our customers.  
We, along with our franchisees, also remain dedicated and disciplined on the value we're known for when our customers really needed it the most. Our core $5.99 and $7.99 platforms have been a reliable, important part of the Domino's brand experience for many years.  
While we certainly brought new customers into the brand over the last year, the story of 2020 was more about the frequency and loyalty of our existing customer base. Our customers ordered more often. And when they did, they also ordered more items. And we saw that specifically among our loyalty program members. We now have over 27 million, 27 million active members in our Piece of the Pie Rewards loyalty program. Notably, we achieved continued year-over-year growth in our loyalty program without running any of our more aggressive week-long promotions during the last 3 quarters of 2020.  
Now despite the challenges associated with construction and permitting during the pandemic, store growth was once again a significant driver for us of growth in the U.S. We and our franchisees, both new and existing, continued to invest in our businesses, resulting in 229 net new stores for the year. If you look back over the last 5 years, we've opened nearly 1,200 new stores in the U.S. and we have closed fewer than 80 over the last 5 years. We continued to invest in our supply chain business to support the growth of our franchisees, opening 2 new U.S. centers in 2020, on time and on budget. And that's despite the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. We opened in Columbia, South Carolina in March. We opened in Katy, Texas in December. And in September, we also added a thin crust production line to our existing supply chain center in Edison, New Jersey.  
We also invested in the safety and well-being of our frontline corporate store and supply chain team members throughout 2020. We invested in equipment and processes designed to ensure their safety and an enhanced sick pay and benefits and enhanced hourly wages, recognizing the unique challenges of working during the pandemic, including the nearly $10 million in bonuses that we paid to our corporate store and supply chain team members in the month of December.  
And we invested in our communities throughout 2020, partnering with our franchisees to donate 10 million slices to first-responders, frontline workers and families in need, responding to natural disasters by getting food to people in need, launching a national hiring campaign to provide 30,000 jobs to workers who may have been displaced from theirs; committing $3 million to support black communities in the U.S., including $1 million to establish the Domino's Black Franchisee Opportunity Fund; and partnering with our franchisees to raise $100 million over the next 10 years for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. We and our franchisees raised $13 million for St. Jude in 2020 alone.  
Now looking ahead to 2020 in our U.S. business, we will continue as a WorkInProgress brand, striving to get a little better each and every day. And I'll highlight a few focus areas. And not surprisingly, most of these areas will not be new news to you. 
First, we will continue to fortress our markets, driving faster and more consistent service, lower delivery costs, better economics for drivers and incremental carryout traffic. Fortressing will continue to drive overall store growth into 2021, including in our company-owned markets. We will continue to deliver new product innovation in 2021. We will continue to produce world-class advertising. And we're excited to begin our relationship with WorkInProgress as our new advertising agency. We will continue to invest in technology to enable great customer experiences, to drive speed, accuracy and efficiency inside our stores, to improve our corporate store team members' ability to support our business.  
Value is always a key focus for us, and that won't change in 2021. More than ever, with many Americans out of work in these uncertain economic times, value matters. And we are committed to maintaining our unquestioned position of value leadership within the QSR pizza segment.  
We're ramping up our focus on service in 2021, getting pizzas out the door to our customers hotter, fresher and more reliably than ever before through innovation within our stores. We're doubling down with technology, with training and with communications. 
We will continue to invest in our frontline team members across our corporate stores and supply chain centers, increasing hourly wages in many markets and enhancing our team member benefits. We will also be taking a comprehensive look at our environmental impact. Within the next 1 to 3 years, we will set science-based, time-bound commitments in accordance with the science-based targets initiative process to reduce the company's total contribution to climate change. And as always, we will remain obsessed, absolutely obsessed with franchisee profitability.  
Stu shared our initial 2020 store-level EBITDA estimate with you in January. And we will share the final number with you when that figure is ready, but we do expect it to be higher than the estimate that Stu shared with you last month. While we believe this level of profitability and associated cash-on-cash returns exceeds any player in our category, we recognize that some of our franchisees and our corporate stores are under intense cost pressure. Despite higher overall levels of unemployment across the country, many local labor markets remain tight and wages continue to rise across the country. Fixed costs such as rent and insurance also bring added pressure. But my team and I recognize these challenges. And we remain intensely focused on helping to drive efficiency and profitability at the store and enterprise level for our franchisees, just as we are for our corporate markets.  
As I look back on the fourth quarter and on the full year, I'm very happy with our U.S. performance. We achieved our 39th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales growth and we surpassed $8 billion in U.S. retail sales for the very first time. I am confident that we are well positioned to continue playing the long game in our U.S. business.  
Now I'm going to move on to international. During the fourth quarter, our pandemic recovery continued, as we reopened stores and delivered the strongest quarterly comp we've reported in 4 years. We marked our 108th straight positive quarter. That's 27 full years, an incredible run that seemed in doubt when COVID struck early in the year. And I'm particularly pleased that our master franchisees continued to invest in the business, opening 272 net stores in the quarter and 395 net for the full year. 
Now when you consider that we had about 2,400 stores temporarily closed back in Q2, this is truly a remarkable achievement. And it highlights the terrific unit-level economics that our master franchisees have built in many markets around the globe. There is no question that we had more closures in 2020. In fact, we had over 300 than you would normally see from Domino's in a typical year. This was driven by strategic choices in several markets to close some previously underperforming units, including a number of units with formats that admittedly would have struggled in the new operating environment rather than reopening them after the pandemic.  
So when I look forward, I am very optimistic about our master franchisees' ability to ramp up our unit growth across the international business. And I want to thank our international partners for their engagement throughout the year. We dramatically increased our communication across the system. And master franchisees from all over the world really leaned in, sharing best practices throughout the year to help their peers and to help our U.S. team manage through the pandemic. This truly demonstrated the power of the global Domino's system. And we could not have responded so effectively to COVID without this level of partnership.  
Now I'd love to share a few 2020 market highlights.  
We opened for the first time in Croatia, welcoming the team there to the Domino's family. We opened 95 net stores in China and grew retail sales by over 30%, accelerating growth in this very important market. We were also very pleased to invest in Dash Brands, our master franchise partner, with a $40 million investment in 2020 and the subsequent $40 million investment which we completed in Q1 of this year. We are excited to partner more deeply with their terrific management team and investors. And I am more optimistic than ever about the potential for Domino's in China. Japan was an incredible success story in 2020, passing the 700-store milestone with 100 net stores and over 40% in retail sales growth. Germany is another market that saw outstanding retail sales growth of over 25%, with 100 -- excuse me, where we are fast approaching 350 stores, with much potential for future growth.  
I'd also like to thank our teams that worked incredibly hard to reopen stores throughout the year following the COVID-driven closures. India, France, Spain, Mexico, New Zealand and Panama are a few of the markets, along with many others around the world, that have pushed hard to bounce back from significant temporary closures and to position themselves for growth in 2021. Based on the latest reports, we now have fewer than 150 temporary international store closures.  
Now when we look at this recovery in our international business, India deserves a specific mention. After some strategic store closures earlier in the year, Jubilant Foodworks, our master franchise partner, dramatically accelerated growth with 50 net stores in their most recent reported quarter. And as we look forward into 2021, I remain very optimistic about the long-term growth potential of our international business. The opportunity is there. Our unit economics are strong, and our master franchisees are committed. Combined with our corporate support and best practice sharing around the globe, we have the recipe to take this business to its full potential.  
So in closing, 2020 was a year like none other, but Domino's is a brand like none other. I am proud of our franchise partners and our team members who once again proved to me that they are the best in the restaurant business. And as we look ahead to 2021, we aren't sure exactly what the new normal will look like or when we'll get there, but we will remain diligently focused on delivering for our customers our team members, our franchisees, our communities and our shareholders.  
At Domino's, we have a long track record of profitable growth, driven by a disciplined operating model. This model served us well in 2020 and will continue to be the foundation for our growth in 2021 and beyond. This gives me a great deal of confidence in our ability to grow the Domino's brand over the long term. That confidence is demonstrated in this morning's release, where we announced our new 2- to 3-year outlook of 6% to 10% global retail sales growth and 6% to 8% global net unit growth as well as our new $1 billion share repurchase program.  
So I'll end my remarks this morning with a heartfelt thank you to our franchise partners and team members. And that's not just for your efforts in 2020, but also for your continued perseverance in 2021 as we battled COVID and the recent winter storms across the U.S. I am proud to serve you each and every day.  
And with that, Stu and I will be happy to take your questions."

But when you're talking about 6% to 8% unit growth, 6% to 10% retail sales growth, does this view also specifically apply to how you are thinking and we should think about 2021? At least on the unit growth side, it seems like you had a really nice step-up in trends in the fourth quarter. So any additional color would be really helpful."

And our new outlook that we've published is a 2- to 3-year look. But specifically to your question on the unit growth, we were really pleased to see some significant momentum building in the fourth quarter of the year, as you saw in the store growth numbers that we published, both for the U.S. business and for the international business. And the reality is there was a lot of pent-up demand out there throughout the course of the year where we just had challenges getting stores opened up due to construction and permitting and other issues. But the fundamental unit-level economics in the business have never been better. 
Stu shared a preliminary look at U.S. store-level EBITDA last month. And as we tabulate the final numbers, we expect it to be at least that $158,000 or higher. So terrific economics in the business. Our approach to fortressing in the U.S. and in our international markets is still working very, very well for us. 
And then as it relates to the global retail sales growth number. While COVID gave us some tailwind on that in the U.S., it was actually a headwind in the international side of the business when you look at all the temporary store closures that we had back in the second quarter, where we were up around 2,400 units that were closed, which had a significant impact, as you know, on retail sales back then. 
So we're optimistic, Brian, as we look forward, and that optimism is reflected in that new outlook that we published this morning."

You said the start of 2020 was really about increased orders and spend from existing customers. I know that you always get a lot of questions about consolidation and independents. But I guess my sense would be then based on what you're talking about in your business, that maybe the whole category saw a nice tailwind, including both big competitors and independents. 
So maybe less about share shifts to Domino's and more about an aggregate kind of rising tide. And I was just wondering if you could talk a bit about that now that we're a year into the pandemic, if you have a better sense of maybe where the traffic was coming from or going to and what the intra-segment dynamics look like."

And what I'll -- as I answer your question, I'll break it down a bit across the 2 businesses that we run out of each of our boxes across the country. 
So if you start with the delivery business, most certainly, the pandemic brought a tailwind in the delivery business, not just for Domino's Pizza, but across the category, and frankly, across categories. And during the year, we saw strong growth in both order counts and also growth in ticket in that delivery business as customers tended to order more pizzas. 
As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we also saw that, in particular, our 27 million active loyalty members ordered more from us. Their frequency increased during the year. 
If you contrast that with the carryout business, in the carryout business, COVID actually brought a headwind for us in terms of customer activity. As fewer customers during the pandemic were comfortable going out and walking into restaurants even to pick up carryout, we did see some pressure on order counts in the carryout business. And the growth story there in 2020 was really around ticket. 
Now prior to the pandemic, that carryout business has been a terrific source of customer acquisition and order count growth for us. So as we look forward into 2021, that is one of the important drivers that we see in terms of our ability to continue to grow sales in the U.S., is the restart of that growth on the carryout side of the business."

We're continuing to make great progress with the development of our next generation of our PULSE software, which is really the heartbeat of our stores. 
We're continuing to invest in our digital ordering platforms as well. And we saw a really nice growth in digital ordering. During 2020, our digital sales for the year went up about 5 points over 2019. We ran about 75% digital sales throughout 2020. So we will continue to make investments there to drive the business on the customer side. 
We're also ramping up our investments in technology as it relates to how we operate our stores. So I've talked a little bit about GPS tracking. We invested in that in 2020, substantially rolled that out across the entire U.S. system. We'll continue to invest there, and also additional technology tools at the makeline and at the cut table inside our stores to make the jobs easier for our team members and to help us to get pizzas out the door faster to our customers."

And a lot of the consumer packaged-food companies seem to suggest that they're not going to lose very much of their own business that they've generated through grocery in 2020. 
So the question is, as we think about second half of '21 versus second half of '19 or even if we think about '22 versus '19, what's your sense? And listen, and I guess at this point, it's a guess, but you guys get to make an educated guess using some of the early market data that you have of kind of being able to grow sales versus the '19 level, even if we do say, hey, comping against high teens comps is just always going to be difficult for any business, and we just shouldn't expect that.

So when I look across 2021, one important growth driver for us is going to be to reaccelerate that growth on the carryout side of the business, because we know lapping some of the delivery tailwind is going to be difficult. We're also going to continue to invest in value in the business, as we always have, and making sure that as our customers continue to manage their households through what is going to be a fairly difficult economic time for a lot of Americans, we believe that continuing to stay focused on value is also going to help us. 
As a lot of folks who have been paying a lot to have food delivered to their houses, as behaviors start to change and other options open up, we're going to continue to have Domino's as the unquestioned value leader in the QSR pizza segment, and frankly, broadly across the restaurant industry. When you think about what it costs to have food delivered to feed a family of 4, we really like our positioning in that space. 
We'll also look throughout the year to reinitiate some of our boost weeks. Our aggressive value weeks that have been an important part of our strategy to acquire customers over the last number of years. 
So we're not going to do anything, John, just to lap a comp. That's not how we manage the business here. Everything that we do is going to be around how do we continue to drive sustained and profitable long-term growth for our franchisees and ourselves."

As we continue to aggressively open stores, as that accelerated, certainly, the impact of some of those splits weighs a little bit on the comp. And then frankly, as we got deeper into the fourth quarter and you started to see the COVID-19 pandemic in a significant resurgence across the country, that has a material impact on the carryout business when folks get less comfortable getting out in their cars and going to visit places of business."

Service time improvement is going to continue to be a significant not just in 2021, quite frankly, but longer-term effort for us, that really is one of the important moats that we have to build around our business. 
And fortressing is certainly a big part of that. And we do continue to see, where we fortress our markets, we do see service time improvements, material improvements as we shrink the radius around the stores, allowing us to travel fewer miles and get to our customers with not just faster, but hotter, fresher food."

So the interesting thing is, today, as it relates to wage environment -- we've operated in a really wide spectrum of wage rates across the country as it is today. And I know minimum wage in particular is certainly a topic that everybody is thinking about out there. But today, we operate in states that are at the federal minimum wage, all the way up to places like Seattle, which are already in excess of $15, $16 an hour. And we've still been able to offer the $5.99 and $7.99 platforms across the country. 
And there's a couple of things that enable us to do that. One is the volumes that we run at, there's no way you can stay at that value level without having a high-volume business like we have today. Second is that our franchisees at the local level have flexibility around menu pricing and around delivery fees. And their transparent delivery fees at the local level, they're going to be higher in these higher-wage markets than they are in some of the others. So we've been able to manage our way through a lot of minimum wage increases across the country. 
And I'll tell you, quite honestly, in our corporate store business, we're not paying the federal minimum wage anywhere. You can't go out there and hire people at that rate anyway. We're above the minimum wage, both for our folks that work inside the stores and our tip drivers on the road. And then in our supply chain business, we're in excess of $15 an hour everywhere we operate."

I think for us, we -- be honest, we struggled a little bit understanding the long-term economics in some of the aggregator businesses. In 60 years, we've never made a dollar delivering a pizza. We make money on the product, but we don't make money on the delivery. So we're just not sure how others do it. And in a world where we're trying to shrink our delivery area to get closer to our customer for better service, a lot of these third parties are trying to expand to reach more customers, which we think just takes away from service. 
And when you think about the profit equation, you get somebody who inserts themselves into the value chain, and they have to make their money somewhere. And it's either got to come from the restaurant or it has to come from the customer. And we think, over time, that's going to put a lot of pressure, particularly on the independent restaurants, to be able to continue to make margins in rising cost environments while paying these aggregators. And the customers over time are going to start looking at the free delivery that cost them $15 to get $12 worth of food when they start digging in to look at service fees and service charges. 
So we're just not sure how it all plays out. And you've seen that with some of the public players in that space who have commented about the challenge of driving long-term profitability as an aggregator. So for us, we continue to just be the low-cost delivery provider, provide great value. And we think as long as we're providing a great product with great service at a great value, we'll let everything else shake out. And certainly, we don't know how long it will take to all shake out.

So I'll talk about loyalty, maybe just even a little bit more broadly because there were a couple of metrics that I shared earlier that I think are important on this front. One is the increase in the number of active members of our Piece of the Pie Rewards program, which was up to 27 million plus. We also saw an increase in engagement and frequency among that group as well, which is a big focus of ours. Once that program gets to that level of scale, 27 million plus, and we've got -- beyond that, we've got 40 million plus that at some point have been enrolled in the program, and we've got 80 million plus customers that are in our database. So we spent a lot of time on initiatives thinking about how can we continue to mine that treasure of customers and find ways to better serve them at their time of need to drive higher frequency. 
Another metric I shared earlier that is also important is the increase that we saw in digital engagement with our customers, with digital sales going up from 70% to 75% during the year broadly across the customer base. That's yet another opportunity because those customers tend -- our ticket tends to be higher because we do a better job with upsell on them. And once they start ordering digitally, they tend to be stickier with us over the long term. So we'll continue, as we always do, many efforts focused in that space. 
And then you asked about new products also. We had, as I mentioned earlier, 3 that we successfully launched in 2020, and that's going to continue to be part of our playbook going forward. We've got some exciting things that our culinary team has been working on that I certainly like, and based on our testing, a lot of our customers do as well. So you'll see some more news coming from us in that space during 2021 as well."

And this is something that didn't even exist at the beginning of 2020. It was an idea, a concept that we had that the team just pulled forward and accelerated the development on. And now we've fully rolled out across our system. And not only has it helped us in the pandemic to do safe carryout for customers, but frankly, over the long haul, we look at car side delivery as the way we will compete against the drive-through. 
We've only got about 10% or so of our Domino's in the U.S. that have a drive-through window. So this is a great way for us to serve customers without them getting out of their cars. Post the rollout, we have continued to improve our service times in car side delivery. And our aspiration here, which is well within reach, is that we get to a point where you can get a car side delivery at Domino's faster than you can wait in line at a QSR drive-through to get your food through the window. 
And to your point on mix, we don't -- we're not sharing that externally yet for competitive reasons. But we have seen a dramatic increase in customer usage of Domino's car side delivery since we launched it. And part of our 2020 plans are going to be to drive that even higher."

And then the second thing is that we were able to grow the number of customers active in the program, while also still growing the frequency with which those customers order.

We're excited to share our strong first quarter results with you today. 
Overall, Domino's team members and franchisees around the world generated impressive operating results, leading to a diluted EPS of $3 for the first quarter. 
Global retail sales grew 16.7% in Q1 as compared to Q1 2020. As a reminder, global retail sales growth includes both comp growth and unit growth, which I'll break down for you in a moment. When excluding the positive impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew 14%. 
Breaking down that global retail sales growth, our U.S. retail sales grew 15.3% and our international retail sales grew 18%. When excluding the positive impact of foreign currency, International retail sales grew 12.8%. We continue to see positive momentum in both our U.S. and international businesses in Q1, leading to both strong same-store sales performance and net unit growth. 
Turning to comps. During Q1, we continued to lead the broader restaurant industry with 40 straight quarters of positive U.S. comparable sales and 109 consecutive quarters of positive international comps. Same-store sales in the U.S. grew 13.4% in the quarter, lapping a prior year increase of 1.6%. Same-store sales for our international business grew 11.8%, rolling over a prior year increase of 1.5%. 
Breaking down the U.S. comp a bit further. Our franchise business was up 13.9% in the quarter, while our company-owned stores were up 6.3%. We observed a larger spread than we've historically seen between the top line performance of our franchise stores and our company-owned stores, which we believe was primarily a result of the heavily urban and higher income footprint of our company-owned stores relative to a more diverse mix across our franchise base. The corporate store comp was also disproportionately impacted by store splits resulting from our fortressing efforts as we opened more new corporate stores as a percent of the total corporate store base than we did franchise stores in 2020. 
The U.S. comp this quarter included a healthy mix of both ticket and order growth. The ticket growth was driven by both an increase in items per order and a higher delivery mix, which also includes a transparent delivery fee. 
The 11.8% international comp was driven by ticket growth. Similar to our U.S. business, that ticket growth was driven by a higher delivery mix and an increase in items per order. 
Shifting to unit count. We and our franchisees added 36 net stores in the U.S. during the first quarter, consisting of 37 store openings and the closure of 1 of our corporate stores. Our international business added 139 net stores comprised of 160 store openings and 21 closures. We're very pleased with our new -- with our net unit growth during Q1, which was an increase over the prior year quarter. 
Turning to revenues and operating margins. Total revenues for the first quarter were approximately $984 million, and were up approximately $111 million or 12.7% over the prior year quarter. The increase was driven by higher global retail sales, which generated higher revenues across all areas of our business. 
Changes in foreign current exchange rates positively impacted our international royalty revenues by $2.1 million in Q1 2021 as compared to prior year. Our consolidated operating margin as a percent of revenue increased to 39.6% in Q1 2021 from 39% in the prior year due primarily to higher revenues from our U.S. franchise business. Company-owned store margin as a percent of revenues increased to 23.9% from 22.4% primarily as a result of strong sales leverage. This was also up sequentially from 21.9% in Q4 2020, driven by lower labor costs as a percent of revenue in Q1 2021. 
Supply chain operating margin as a percent of revenues decreased to 10.5% from 11.5% in the prior year quarter. As a reminder, in 2020, we opened 2 new supply chain centers in South Carolina and Texas, respectively, as well as a new pressed product line in New Jersey, which increased our overall fixed operating costs as a percent of revenue. 
G&A expenses increased approximately $2.8 million in Q1 as compared to Q1 2020, resulting from a combination of higher advertising expenses and labor costs, partially offset by travel. 
Net interest expense increased approximately $0.9 million in the quarter, primarily the result of lower interest income. As previously disclosed, in Q1 2021, we invested an additional $40 million in Dash Brands, our master franchisee in China following their achievement of previously established performance conditions. 
Accordingly, we remeasured the original $40 million investment we made in Q2 of last year due to the observable change in price from the valuation of the additional investment. This $2.5 million gain was recorded in other income in the first quarter of 2021. 
Our effective tax rate was 21.3% for the quarter as compared to a negative 3.7% in Q1 2020. The effective tax rate in Q1 2021 includes a 0.6 percentage point positive impact from tax benefits on equity-based compensation as compared to a 26 percentage point positive impact in Q1 2020. This decrease was due to significantly fewer stock option exercise in Q1 of this year. And we expect to see continued volatility in our effective tax rate related to these equity-based compensation tax benefits. 
Combining all of these elements, our first quarter net income was down $3.8 million or 3.2% versus Q1 2020. We On a pretax basis, income before provision for income taxes was up $32.3 million or 27.6%. Our diluted EPS in Q1 was $3 versus $3.07 in the prior year, a decrease of 2.3%. Breaking down that $0.07 decrease. Most notably, our improved operating results benefited us by $0.61. The gain on the Dash Brands investment benefited us by $0.05. Net interest expense negatively impacted us by $0.02. And A lower diluted share count driven by share repurchases over the trailing 12 months benefited us by $0.03. And finally, our higher effective tax rate resulting from lower tax benefits on equity-based compensation, as I mentioned previously, negatively impacted us by $0.74. 
Shifting to cash. Our economic model continued to generate significant cash flow throughout the quarter. During Q1, we generated net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $153 million. After deducting for CapEx, we generated free cash flow of approximately $136 million. 
Regarding our capital expenditures, We spent approximately $17 million on CapEx in Q1, primarily on our technology initiatives. As previously disclosed, during Q1, we also repurchased and retired approximately 66,000 shares for $25 million. 
As a reminder, in February, our Board approved a new $1 billion authorization for future share repurchases. 
We also paid a $0.94 quarterly dividend on March 30. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.94 per share to be paid on June 30. 
As it relates to our capital structure, on April 16, we refinanced our debt to keep pace with our growing business. We're very pleased with our gross issuance of $1.85 billion which includes $850 million of 7.5-year 2.662% fixed rate notes and $1 billion of 10-year 3.151% fixed rate notes. We used a portion of the proceeds to retire our 2017 floating rate notes in our 2017 5-year fixed rate notes to prefund certain interest payable and to pay transaction fees and expenses. We expect to use the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include distributions to holders of our common stock, other equivalent payments and/or stock repurchases. This recapitalization will reduce our weighted average borrowing rate from 3.9% as of the end of the first quarter to approximately 3.7%, and it will return our leverage to approximately 6x EBITDA, consistent with our leverage model following previous recapitalizations. Additional information on this transaction is included in our Form 10-Q, which was filed this morning. 
Since the onset of the pandemic in previous earnings calls, we've provided updates on the impact of COVID-19-related expenses, including safety and cleaning equipment, enhanced sick pay and other compensation for our team members,and support for our franchisees and our communities. The estimated impact of these items in the first quarter of 2021 was not material. 
In closing, our business continued its strong performance during the first quarter. And while we continue to closely monitor all aspects of our operations in these ever-changing times, we're confident in the strength and resilience of the Domino's brand and of the Domino's franchisees, their team members and our corporate teams worldwide. Our results would not be possible without their tireless efforts each and every day, and we sincerely appreciate them. 
Thank you, again, for joining the call today, and I'll turn it over to Rich."

Today, I'll keep my comments rather brief, as I highlight the first quarter results for our U.S. and our international businesses. And then after that, Stu and I will be happy to take some of your questions. 
Let's start with the U.S. business. Our U.S. business performed extremely well during the quarter, highlighted by 15.3% retail sales growth and a 13.4% comp This marked our 40th consecutive quarter of positive U.S. same-store sales growth. We continue to see strong growth across our business in the first quarter, and we did not witness any material differences between those markets that have largely reopened versus those that have remained more restricted. We certainly saw some sales benefits from the federal government stimulus at the beginning and at the end of Q1. And which were partially offset by the negative impact of the significant winter storms in February that impacted such a large portion of the country. 
Due to the positive sales impacts from the stimulus, We elected not to run any of our aggressive boost week promotions during the quarter, but instead, we remain focused on providing great service and offering great value to our customers every day. 
Now like many of you, we are also watching the 2-year stack on U.S. same-store sales at 15% for the first quarter we saw a slight sequential improvement of the 2-year stack when compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. 
Given the COVID overlaps, we will continue to look at the business through both, the 1- and 2-year lenses as we report to you throughout 2021.
Now beyond the comps, when you look at the absolute dollars, our first quarter same-store average weekly unit sales in the U.S. exceeded $26,000. I am also quite pleased with our performance in the first quarter on the other critical component of our retail sales growth. That's new store openings. Our addition of 36 net stores was a nice improvement over Q1 of 2020, and we anticipate a strong pipeline of future openings. 
I want to highlight that we had only 1 corporate store closure in the U.S. during Q1, and we had 0 -- 0 U.S. franchise store closures, an impressive testament to the continued health of our U.S. system. 
On many occasions, you've heard me say that net unit growth and by extension store closures are 1 of the most important ways to measure a brand's health within our industry. A single store closure in the quarter on a base of over 6,000 units demonstrates the elite economic proposition that we offer to our franchisees. 
And on that note, I'm thrilled to report yet another record-setting year of franchisee profitability. With our final 2020 estimated average EBITDA number for U.S. franchise stores coming in at just over $177,000, the highest in our history. While this result was certainly aided by the COVID demand tailwind, it clearly demonstrates not only the power of the brand, but also the incredible work of our U.S. franchisees and operators and their relentless efforts throughout an incredibly busy 2020. 
Our fortressing strategy continues to build best practice case studies showcasing franchisee enterprise growth and ROI, which is a big part of the momentum and excitement behind the strategy. But equally as important, it sets us up extremely well to compete in 2021 and beyond as we continue to drive lower relative costs, better service, higher runs per hour and therefore, better economics for drivers, along with meaningful incremental carryout within our stores in fortress territories. 
While carryout order count remained pressured in Q1 as it was throughout the last year, we continue to grow awareness of Domino's Carside Delivery. This has created a new option to serve our customers effectively during COVID and will remain an important part of our strategy as we continue to evolve the carryout experience. Not only to enhance the loyalty of our current carryout customers but also to reach a new, different and largely untapped drive-thru oriented customer going forward. 
On the advertising front, I'm excited about the national TV campaign we launched this week. highlighting our very exciting partnership with Nuro. We are delivering a true autonomous pizza delivery experience to select customers in Houston today, demonstrating our forward-thinking approach to innovation, as we build and evolve the brand for the future. 
We also brought back our old nemesis, The Noid, in this ad campaign, and it is already generating some incredible buzz around the Domino's brand. 
Now the final thing I'd like to acknowledge is we close out the discussion on our Q1 results in the U.S. is the very difficult staffing environment that we are in today. The combination of COVID, strong sales, the broader economy reopening and the high level of government stimulus is creating one of the most difficult staffing environments that we've seen in a long time. This puts pressure on our operators to meet demand while continuing to deliver great service to their customers. I thank our U.S. franchisees and our corporate store operators for the work they are doing to attract and retain great team members in a very tight labor market. 
As we close out our discussion on the U.S. business, I would simply highlight that the Domino's brand is strong as it has ever been, and I remain confident in our ability to drive long-term growth. 
Let's move on now to the International business. It was an outstanding quarter of performance for our international business. Our 12.8% retail sales growth was supported by a very strong 11.8% comp, continuing the momentum we saw towards the end of last year. Q1 also marked our 109th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales in international, a tremendous accomplishment by our international franchise partners. And in fact, the Q1 comp was the strongest result we've seen in more than a decade in that business. 
As I discussed earlier with our U.S. business, we are also watching the 2-year comp stacks for international and will continue to do so throughout 2021. Q1 represented a 13.3% 2-year stack, which was a 430 basis point improvement versus the fourth quarter of 2020. 
We also continue to build momentum on store growth in our international business. Our 139 net stores in Q1 was a 100-store improvement versus the first quarter of 2020. 
We expect that COVID will continue to have a significant impact on many of our international markets for some time to come and will bring ongoing challenges to new store openings. But this acceleration in growth speaks to our outstanding unit level economics and the perseverance and commitment of our international master franchisees. 
We continue to have temporary store closures around the world, but those have come down dramatically over the last few quarters, and we're below 100 at the end of the first quarter. 
Now I'd like to highlight a few markets that drove terrific growth during the quarter. India, China and Japan, once again, led our system in net unit growth. And I'd like to highlight another market, Guatemala that also delivered terrific store growth. 
China, Japan, Turkey, Colombia, Germany and France all drove impressive retail sales growth during the quarter. So once again, I am very proud of our master franchisees and their operators for a great start to 2021. They are the best in the business, and that's why I continue to be bullish about our international retail sales growth opportunity over the long term. 
So in closing, I'm very pleased with our quarter 1 results. Our incredible base of franchisees and operators, combined with outstanding unit-level economics, place us in an enviable position of strength within our industry. 
Q1 reinforced our position as the global leader in QSR pizza, but there is still so much opportunity ahead of us to drive global retail sales growth and to capture additional meaningful share within the category. 
As we look ahead to the rest of 2021 and beyond, we will, as always, stay focused on winning the long game. and we remain confident in our 2- to 3-year outlook of 6% to 8% annual net store growth and 6% to 10% annual global retail sales growth. 
So thank you, once again, for joining us today. And at this time, Stu and I will now be happy to take your questions."

But the topical question that I must ask is related to the U.S. business as it begins to lap the meaningful upswing in strength from last year that really began around this time. As we kind of sit here and we analyze your 2-year trends in the first quarter, it does suggest actually an improving likelihood of of successfully lapping that strength, at least with maybe the ability to perhaps hold on to those gains more than we all thought originally. Can I get your reaction to that thought? And what specific weapons do you have in your arsenal that you plan to deploy over the rest of the year to fight this lap?"

But what we're really focused on are continuing to make the investments to drive long-term growth in the business. And as I look out across the rest of the year, we are really in an enviable position. We've got a fantastic advertising war chest. We have not deployed some of the tools this year so far that we've used in the past around our boost weeks to drive incremental customer acquisitions. So we have those in our arsenal. And I think very importantly, the carryout business, which on a relative basis, when you look at order growth during 2020 was weak,relative to its historical run rate. And so we've got an opportunity to continue to drive that carryout business, along with some day and day parts during the week as well. As it relates to last year weekends and late night were relatively weak versus weekdays and the earlier in the dayparts from last year. 
So as customer patterns continue to change, as the economy continues to open up, we feel confident that we've got a set of tools to allow us to continue to grow our business."

Our share in the international business in total is significantly less than where we are in the U.S. today. So as I look at it now, I still see a significant amount of opportunity to continue to grow the business. We're hitting scale in some of the key markets around the world. If you look at the places where we've been really strong, recently, like Japan, like India, we're starting to get there in China. We've started to hit some really nice scale points in some of those markets as well that give us the wherewithal and the ability to invest at a high level in the business going forward. And then finally, I would just highlight, once again, as we talk about all the time, the growth really comes back to the unit level economics in the business. And while we still got some challenges in a few places around the globe, by and large, the unit level economics remain really strong. across the world. And with COVID loosening up certainly in some places, not as much in others.

And as I've mentioned previously, while we're trying to grow our overall profit dollars for the supply chain business, we're not trying to do it at the expense of our franchisees. We're trying to do it with our franchisees through the overall growth. So we're absorbing a piece of that labor increase versus passing that automatically through the same that we do with food cost inflation. 
In terms of store level, certainly, I think everybody right now, you see it the news everywhere is challenged from a labor perspective and a hiring perspective. We still believe that at the -- when all is said and done, you've got to be focused on service, services where you drive your differential customer engagement and drive that loyalty. Part of -- one of the structural things that we do, which helps us from a service perspective because we don't want to take our eye off that ball is fortressing. And we've obviously talked a lot about fortressing, but you get closer to your customers and you have the ability to serve them better. 
The second thing that we do is I think everybody sees a lot of the technology investments that we make on the front end. There's a lot that we do on the back end to try and improve the efficiency of the labor in store, take some of the labor out on store and enable s that same labor to be doing other things. So whether it's tools related to the make line or other initiatives that we're doing to try and drive throughput in the stores and trying to reduce the labor required on a daily, hourly basis. There It's at the forefront of everybody's mind right now. But I don't think sacrificing service is the way to do it."

And we see opportunities to continue to take share across the category. And it's why we -- why we're so focused on retail sales growth as the key metric not only because it drives all the economics in our business, but obviously, that's how we ultimately gain market share over time. 
As I look this year and ongoing, fortressing is going to continue to be a big part of that strategy to gain share. As we've talked about in the past, we are still relatively under penetrated in terms of share in the carryout business specifically. And fortressing gives us an opportunity to go out and grab that largely incremental carryout business. 
And then on the delivery side, we believe that we've got to continue to offer great value to our customers and terrific service to continue to gain share on the delivery side. And we've talked about how fortressing helps that over time. We're going to continue to invest in our technology initiatives and operating practices, procedures to continue to help us do a better job of service with our customers as well. And then you combine that with fantastic unit-level economics, which allow franchisees to invest in service and an incredible war chest in terms of our advertising fund to go out there and drive customer awareness and acquisition, and we feel like we're in a very strong position to continue to grow."

So part of what we're doing and working on is trying to continue to make that a great job with the best economics for drivers relative to the other alternatives that they have out there. We've talked about a number of strategies around that. We continue our work around fortressing to give drivers more deliveries per hour, which translates into higher wages. We're working on technology and operating practices that keep drivers in their cars. So imagine a world where they don't come back into the store, we run the pizzas out to their cars and then go and take the next order. So we're trying to work on those economics for our drivers to keep them busy and earning higher level wages. 
And then also a big part of what makes Domino's different and has made us different over time is that being a driver at Domino's or a pizza maker inside the store is an opportunity to become an entrepreneur over time. And so a big part of our job and our franchisees' jobs also is to sell the opportunity going forward because 90-plus percent of them started office drivers or insiders. 
And then the final thing I'd say about labor is that we'll present an ongoing challenge, not just for Domino's, but for others across the industry is The -- just the changes in minimum wage around the country, as that moves differentially from 1 market to another, certainly, it puts pressures in some places and not in others. And as we operate as a national brand, we always have to take those things into account as we plan our ongoing marketing and promotional calendar over the course of the year."

You've also got here in 2021 some pent-up demand that wasn't satisfied in 2020 as we had so many more restrictions around construction and permitting and everything else. 
And then what you add to that is a healthy number of new franchisees coming into the system every year. And one of the things that makes us a little different from the rest of QSR and of franchising is that those new franchisees all come from within our system. So they could be corporate employees.

Brett, it's a great question, and one that when we sit down every year and make our investment decisions around technology, we are always trying to invest against a portfolio both of near-term things that can have immediate value, but then also some of the longer-term investments that may not drive any immediate value, but that we want to make sure that we're out in the forefront on. When I think about the near-term component of that, we've got a significant amount of technology investment that is going to our stores today and improving the efficiency with which we operate our stores. When you think about what some of the kind of the key pinch points or constraints are in the business, right now. It is labor, it is availability and labor costs at the store level. So we're focusing a lot of time and energy on running more efficient stores such that we can drive higher order counts and higher sales per labor hour. 
So there's a lot of effort there and a number of things that are rolling out through our system today. And then on the longer term, Nuro is a great example of that. We are doing some autonomous deliveries as we speak, in Houston. right now, but it's going to be a while before autonomous delivery is broadly deployed across the Domino's system, but we want to make sure that we're investing and learning today, in particular, how the customer will interact with the robot and how the robot will interact with our operations at the stores. And those are the key learnings that we're trying to drive now such that when we are able to more broadly deploy the technology, we're ready and have a good understanding of how it can impact our business and our customers."

If you look at last year, we had 624 net openings for the year. And if you look in the first quarter of this year, when you look back trailing 4 quarter was 730. So that pace has already accelerated up by more than 100 units. And when we look at the pipeline in the U.S. and we look at the pipeline in our international markets, we see a really strong pipeline ahead and an opportunity to continue to accelerate that pace of unit opening. 
The unknown for us as we look out across the year, still relates to COVID. And you turn the news on, you'll see there are some places around the world where COVID is really still raging and in some places, getting worse. To what extent that impacts our pace of unit growth, we're still monitoring and and still have some uncertainty around that. But the good news for the brand is that the unit economics are incredibly strong, the demand for franchisee investment is there, and we expect to continue to see the pace of unit growth accelerate. 
The final part of your question was around the staffing, and that's always a challenge. But one that we and our franchisees feel comfortable that we can manage over time. Part of the beauty, particularly as it relates to the U.S. of opening these new stores is that the majority of these are opening in our -- as part of our fortressing program and giving us an opportunity to do 2 things. One is to shrink the territory, so we get more deliveries per hour of delivery driver labor, but also you get that incremental carryout business, which is a much less labor-intensive Business for our stores, which is one of the reasons we want to continue to grow and build that business."

Good morning, everyone. We're excited to share our strong first quarter results with you today.
Overall, Domino's team members and franchisees around the world generated impressive operating results, leading to a diluted EPS of $3 for the first quarter. Global retail sales grew 16.7% in Q1 as compared to Q1 2020. As a reminder, global retail sales growth includes both comp growth and unit growth, which I'll break down for you in a moment. When excluding the positive impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew 14%. 
Breaking down that global retail sales growth, our U.S. retail sales grew 15.3%, and our international retail sales grew 18%. When excluding the positive impact of foreign currency, international retail sales grew 12.8%. We continue to see positive momentum in both our U.S. and international businesses in Q1, leading to both strong same-store sales performance and net unit growth. 
Turning to comps. During Q1, we continued to lead the broader restaurant industry with 40 straight quarters of positive U.S. comparable sales and 109 consecutive quarters of positive international comps. Same-store sales in the U.S. grew 13.4% in the quarter, lapping a prior year increase of 1.6%. Same-store sales for our international business grew 11.8%, rolling over a prior year increase of 1.5%. 
Breaking down the U.S. comp a bit further. Our franchise business was up 13.9% in the quarter, while our company-owned stores were up 6.3%. We observed a larger spread than we've historically seen between the top line performance of our franchise stores and our company-owned stores, which we believe was primarily a result of the heavily urban and higher income footprint of our company-owned stores relative to a more diverse mix across our franchise base.
The corporate store comp was also disproportionately impacted by store splits resulting from our fortressing efforts as we opened more new corporate stores as a percent of the total corporate store base than we did franchise stores in 2020. 
The U.S. comp this quarter included a healthy mix of both ticket and order growth. The ticket growth was driven by both an increase in items per order and a higher delivery mix, which also includes a transparent delivery fee. The 11.8% international comp was driven by ticket growth. Similar to our U.S. business, that ticket growth was driven by a higher delivery mix and an increase in items per order. 
Shifting to unit count. We and our franchisees added 36 net stores in the U.S. during the first quarter, consisting of 37 store openings and the closure of 1 of our corporate stores. Our international business added 139 net stores comprised of 160 store openings and 21 closures. We're very pleased with our new -- with our net unit growth during Q1, which was an increase over the prior year quarter. 
Turning to revenues and operating margins. Total revenues for the first quarter were approximately $984 million and were up approximately $111 million or 12.7% over the prior year quarter. The increase was driven by higher global retail sales, which generated higher revenues across all areas of our business. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted our international royalty revenues by $2.1 million in Q1 2021 as compared to prior year.
Our consolidated operating margin as a percent of revenue increased to 39.6% in Q1 2021 from 39% in the prior year due primarily to higher revenues from our U.S. franchise business. Company-owned store margin as a percent of revenues increased to 23.9% from 22.4% primarily as a result of strong sales leverage. This was also up sequentially from 21.9% in Q4 2020, driven by lower labor cost as a percent of revenue in Q1 2021. 
Supply chain operating margin as a percent of revenues decreased to 10.5% from 11.5% in the prior year quarter. As a reminder, in 2020, we opened 2 new supply chain centers in South Carolina and Texas, respectively, as well as a new press product line in New Jersey, which increased our overall fixed operating cost as a percent of revenue. 
G&A expenses increased approximately $2.8 million in Q1 as compared to Q1 2020, resulting from a combination of higher advertising expenses and labor costs, partially offset by travel. 
Net interest expense increased approximately $0.9 million in the quarter, primarily the result of lower interest income. As previously disclosed, in Q1 2021, we invested an additional $40 million in Dash Brands, our master franchisee in China, following their achievement of previously established performance conditions. Accordingly, we remeasured the original $40 million investment we made in Q2 of last year due to the observable change in price from the valuation of the additional investment. This $2.5 million gain was recorded in other income in the first quarter of 2021. 
Our effective tax rate was 21.3% for the quarter as compared to a negative 3.7% in Q1 2020. The effective tax rate in Q1 2021 includes a 0.6 percentage point positive impact from tax benefits on equity-based compensation as compared to a 26 percentage point positive impact in Q1 2020. This decrease was due to significantly fewer stock option exercises in Q1 of this year. And we expect to see continued volatility in our effective tax rate related to these equity-based compensation tax benefits. 
Combining all of these elements, our first quarter net income was down $3.8 million or 3.2% versus Q1 2020. On a pretax basis, income before provision for income taxes was up $32.3 million or 27.6%.
Our diluted EPS in Q1 was $3 versus $3.07 in the prior year, a decrease of 2.3%. Breaking down that $0.07 decrease, most notably, our improved operating results benefited us by $0.61; the gain on the Dash Brands investment benefited us by $0.05; net interest expense negatively impacted us by $0.02; a lower diluted share count driven by share repurchases over the trailing 12 months benefited us by $0.03; and finally, our higher effective tax rate resulting from lower tax benefits on equity-based compensation, as I mentioned previously, negatively impacted us by $0.74. 
Shifting to cash. Our economic model continued to generate significant cash flow throughout the quarter. During Q1, we generated net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $153 million. After deducting for CapEx, we generated free cash flow of approximately $136 million. 
Regarding our capital expenditures, we spent approximately $17 million on CapEx in Q1, primarily on our technology initiatives. As previously disclosed, during Q1, we also repurchased and retired approximately 66,000 shares for $25 million. As a reminder, in February, our Board approved a new $1 billion authorization for future share repurchases. We also paid a $0.94 quarterly dividend on March 30. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.94 per share to be paid on June 30. 
As it relates to our capital structure, on April 16, we refinanced our debt to keep pace with our growing business. We're very pleased with our gross issuance of $1.85 billion, which includes $850 million of 7.5-year, 2.662% fixed rate notes and $1 billion of 10-year, 3.151% fixed rate notes. We used a portion of the proceeds to retire our 2017 floating rate notes in our 2017 5-year fixed rate notes to prefund certain interest payable and to pay transaction fees and expenses.
We expect to use the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include distributions to holders of our common stock, other equivalent payments and/or stock repurchases. This recapitalization will reduce our weighted average borrowing rate from 3.9% as of the end of the first quarter to approximately 3.7%, and it will return our leverage to approximately 6x EBITDA, consistent with our leverage model following previous recapitalizations. Additional information on this transaction is included in our Form 10-Q, which was filed this morning. 
Since the onset of the pandemic, in previous earnings calls, we've provided updates on the impact of COVID-19-related expenses, including safety and cleaning equipment, enhanced sick pay and other compensation for our team members and support for our franchisees and our communities. The estimated impact of these items in the first quarter of 2021 was not material. 
In closing, our business continued its strong performance during the first quarter. And while we continue to closely monitor all aspects of our operations in these ever-changing times, we're confident in the strength and resilience of the Domino's brand and of the Domino's franchisees, their team members and our corporate teams worldwide. Our results would not be possible without their tireless efforts each and every day, and we sincerely appreciate them. 
Thank you again for joining the call today, and I'll now turn it over to Ritch."

We are now more than 1 year into the COVID pandemic, the most challenging operating environment w",1491,"Thank you, Stu, and thanks to all of you for joining us this morning.
Overall, I am very pleased with our results this quarter and our strong start to 2021. We are now more than 1 year into the COVID pandemic, the most challenging operating environment we've ever experienced as a brand. I continue to be extremely proud of our global franchisees and their extraordinary efforts around product, service, image and day-to-day execution. We remain focused on providing outstanding food through safe and reliable delivery and carryout experiences. And as a brand, we are also proud to continue our position as an industry leader on value at a time when our customers need it the most. 
Today, I'll keep my comments rather brief as I highlight the first quarter results for our U.S. and our international businesses. And then after that, Stu and I will be happy to take some of your questions. 
Let's start with the U.S. business. Our U.S. business performed extremely well during the quarter, highlighted by 15.3% retail sales growth and a 13.4% comp. This marked our 40th consecutive quarter of positive U.S. same-store sales growth. We continue to see strong growth across our business in the first quarter, and we did not witness any material differences between those markets that have largely reopened versus those that have remained more restricted.
We certainly saw some sales benefits from the federal government stimulus at the beginning and at the end of Q1, which were partially offset by the negative impact of the significant winter storms in February that impacted such a large portion of the country. Due to the positive sales impacts from the stimulus, we elected not to run any of our aggressive boost week promotions during the quarter, but instead, we remain focused on providing great service and offering great value to our customers every day. 
Now like many of you, we are also watching the 2-year stack on U.S. same-store sales. At 15% for the first quarter, we saw a slight sequential improvement of the 2-year stack when compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Given the COVID overlaps, we will continue to look at the business through both the 1- and 2-year lenses as we report to you throughout 2021.
Now beyond the comps, when you look at the absolute dollars, our first quarter same-store average weekly unit sales in the U.S. exceeded $26,000. I am also quite pleased with our performance in the first quarter on the other critical component of our retail sales growth, that's new store openings. Our addition of 36 net stores was a nice improvement over Q1 of 2020, and we anticipate a strong pipeline of future openings. 
I want to highlight that we had only 1 corporate store closure in the U.S. during Q1, and we had 0 U.S. franchise store closures, an impressive testament to the continued health of our U.S. system. On many occasions, you've heard me say that net unit growth and, by extension, store closures are one of the most important ways to measure a brand's health within our industry. A single store closure in the quarter on a base of over 6,000 units demonstrates the elite economic proposition that we offer to our franchisees. 
And on that note, I'm thrilled to report yet another record-setting year of franchisee profitability with our final 2020 estimated average EBITDA number for U.S. franchise stores coming in at just over $177,000, the highest in our history. While this result was certainly aided by the COVID demand tailwind, it clearly demonstrates not only the power of the brand, but also the incredible work of our U.S. franchisees and operators and their relentless efforts throughout an incredibly busy 2020. 
Our fortressing strategy continues to build best-practice case studies showcasing franchisee enterprise growth and ROI, which is a big part of the momentum and excitement behind the strategy. But equally as important, it sets us up extremely well to compete in 2021 and beyond as we continue to drive lower relative costs, better service, higher runs per hour and, therefore, better economics for drivers, along with meaningful incremental carryout within our stores in fortress territories. 
While carryout order count remained pressured in Q1, as it was throughout the last year, we continue to grow awareness of Domino's Carside Delivery. This has created a new option to serve our customers effectively during COVID and will remain an important part of our strategy as we continue to evolve the carryout experience, not only to enhance the loyalty of our current carryout customers, but also to reach a new, different and largely untapped drive-through-oriented customer going forward. 
On the advertising front, I'm excited about the national TV campaign we launched this week, highlighting our very exciting partnership with Nuro. We are delivering a true autonomous pizza delivery experience to select customers in Houston today, demonstrating our forward-thinking approach to innovation as we build and evolve the brand for the future. We also brought back our old nemesis, the Noid, in this ad campaign, and it is already generating some incredible buzz around the Domino's brand. 
Now the final thing I'd like to acknowledge as we close out the discussion on our Q1 results in the U.S. is the very difficult staffing environment that we are in today. The combination of COVID, strong sales, the broader economy reopening and the high level of government stimulus is creating one of the most difficult staffing environments that we've seen in a long time. This puts pressure on our operators to meet demand while continuing to deliver great service to their customers. I thank our U.S. franchisees and our corporate store operators for the work they are doing to attract and retain great team members in a very tight labor market. 
As we close out our discussion on the U.S. business, I would simply highlight that the Domino's brand is as strong as it has ever been, and I remain confident in our ability to drive long-term growth. 
Let's move on now to the international business. It was an outstanding quarter of performance for our international business. Our 12.8% retail sales growth was supported by a very strong 11.8% comp, continuing the momentum we saw towards the end of last year. Q1 also marked our 109th consecutive quarter of positive same-store sales in international, a tremendous accomplishment by our international franchise partners. And in fact, the Q1 comp was the strongest result we've seen in more than a decade in that business. 
As I discussed earlier with our U.S. business, we are also watching the 2-year comp stacks for international and will continue to do so throughout 2021. Q1 represented a 13.3% 2-year stack, which was a 430 basis point improvement versus the fourth quarter of 2020. We also continue to build momentum on store growth in our international business. Our 139 net stores in Q1 was a 100-store improvement versus the first quarter of 2020. 
We expect that COVID will continue to have a significant impact on many of our international markets for some time to come and will bring ongoing challenges to new store openings. But this acceleration in growth speaks to our outstanding unit-level economics and the perseverance and commitment of our international master franchisees. We continue to have temporary store closures around the world, but those have come down dramatically over the last few quarters, and we're below 100 at the end of the first quarter. 
Now I'd like to highlight a few markets that drove terrific growth during the quarter. India, China and Japan once again led our system in net unit growth. And I'd like to highlight another market, Guatemala, that also delivered terrific store growth. China, Japan, Turkey, Colombia, Germany and France all drove impressive retail sales growth during the quarter. So once again, I am very proud of our master franchisees and their operators for a great start to 2021. They are the best in the business, and that's why I continue to be bullish about our international retail sales growth opportunity over the long term. 
So in closing, I'm very pleased with our quarter 1 results. Our incredible base of franchisees and operators, combined with outstanding unit-level economics, place us in an enviable position of strength within our industry. Q1 reinforced our position as the global leader in QSR pizza, but there is still so much opportunity ahead of us to drive global retail sales growth and to capture additional meaningful share within the category. 
As we look ahead to the rest of 2021 and beyond, we will, as always, stay focused on winning the long game. And we remain confident in our 2- to 3-year outlook of 6% to 8% annual net store growth and 6% to 10% annual global retail sales growth. 
So thank you once again for joining us today. And at this time, Stu and I will now be happy to take your questions."

But the topical question that I must ask is related to the U.S. business as it begins to lap the meaningful upswing in strength from last year that really began around this time. As we kind of sit here and we analyze your 2-year trends in the first quarter, it does suggest actually an improving likelihood of successfully lapping that strength, at least with maybe the ability to perhaps hold on to those gains more than we all thought originally. Can I get your reaction to that thought? And what specific weapons do you have in your arsenal that you plan to deploy over the rest of the year to fight this lap?"

And you're absolutely right, we've got some pretty strong laps ahead of us from the second and the third quarters of last year. But what we're really focused on are continuing to make the investments to drive long-term growth in the business. And as I look out across the rest of the year, we are really in an enviable position. We've got a fantastic advertising war chest. We have not deployed some of the tools this year so far that we've used in the past around our boost weeks to drive incremental customer acquisitions. So we have those in our arsenal.
And I think very importantly, the carryout business, which on a relative basis, when you look at order growth during 2020, was weak relative to its historical run rate. And so we've got an opportunity to continue to drive that carryout business along with some day and dayparts during the week as well. As it relates to last year, weekends and late night were relatively weak versus weekdays and the earlier in the day dayparts from last year. So as customer patterns continue to change, as the economy continues to open up, we feel confident that we've got a set of tools to allow us to continue to grow our business."

But just the way the sample played out over time, the result ended up coming in quite a bit stronger. And when I think about where we sit within the industry today, that $177,000 in store-level EBITDA really puts our system in an incredible position of strength. And when you see it, you're not surprised that we only had 1 store that closed in the U.S. throughout the entire quarter."

John, thanks for the question. And it really is -- it's -- performance is still quite mixed across the markets within the international business, as you might guess, that the dynamics as it relates to COVID are still quite different depending upon what parts of the world that we're in. But what we have seen is as we were able to, over the course of 2020, reopen our markets, you may recall this time last year, we were, gosh, 2,000-plus units that were temporarily closed. And as we've been able to get units reopened and then to get the pipeline of new development going and turn the marketing back on across the international businesses, we've seen a strong resurgence in sales in many of the markets that we operate in. 
And it's going to continue to be choppy market by market as we look out across 2021 because in some places, we're going to be lapping very weak comps in retail sales from last year. And in other places on the planet, we're going to be lapping very strong numbers from last year."

As I look across the globe, Jared, we still see so much opportunity for continued growth and share gain in that international business. So while it's grown rapidly certainly over the last decade, you're still looking at an international business in total that grows in that kind of low -- the market overall that grows in that kind of low to mid-single digits. And then you've got much share gain opportunity as well. Our share in the international business in total is significantly less than where we are in the U.S. today.
So as I look at it now, I still see a significant amount of opportunity to continue to grow the business. We're hitting scale in some of the key markets around the world. If you look at the places where we've been really strong, recently, like Japan, like India, we're starting to get there, in China. We've started to hit some really nice scale points in some of those markets as well that give us the wherewithal and the ability to invest at a high level in the business going forward.
And then finally, I would just highlight, once again, as we talk about all the time, the growth really comes back to the unit-level economics in the business. And while we still got some challenges in a few places around the globe, by and large, the unit-level economics remain really strong across the world. And with COVID loosening up certainly in some places, not as much in others, as it loosens up, it really gives those franchisees the opportunity to release some of that pent-up demand for unit-level investment and growth."

What I am pleased to see is that our active loyalty membership continues to grow. And also, we continue to see really strong and steady order frequency among those active loyalty customers.

I mentioned -- as I mentioned earlier, we have not been as aggressive in our marketing of the carryout segment just given some of the challenges around operating in the COVID environment, but we see a lot of opportunity as we look across this year to continue to crank that back up. And our new service method of Domino's Carside Delivery, we see as a critical weapon to do that. We brought that forward to address the safety concerns that customers had around picking up their food in a COVID environment. But over the long term, that's really a great tool for us as we compete for carryout business against the drive-through lanes of other QSR concepts."

And then secondly, Ritch, something that we've talked about in calls before is things like service levels to the U.S. consumer. Can you talk about if the current labor market is changing some of the service levels, in other words, lengthening delivery times, that you're kind of seeing the pendulum swing in an unfavorable direction and if there's anything you can do to continue to improve the service times that I think we used to discuss on a pre-COVID basis."

We don't explicitly price with our franchisees based on a breakdown that says, well, this piece is labor and this piece is food. And as I've mentioned previously, while we're trying to grow our overall profit dollars for the supply chain business, we're not trying to do it at the expense of our franchisees. We're trying to do it with our franchisees through the overall growth. So we're absorbing a piece of that labor increase versus passing that automatically through the same that we do with food cost inflation. 
In terms of store level, certainly, I think everybody right now, you see it in the news everywhere, is challenged from a labor perspective and a hiring perspective. We still believe that at the -- when all is said and done, you've got to be focused on service, services where you drive your differential customer engagement and drive that loyalty. Part of -- one of the structural things that we do, which helps us from a service perspective because we don't want to take our eye off that ball, is fortressing. And we've obviously talked a lot about fortressing, but you get closer to your customers and you have the ability to serve them better. 
The second thing that we do is I think everybody sees a lot of the technology investments that we make on the front end. There's a lot that we do on the back end to try and improve the efficiency of the labor in store, take some of the labor out of stores and enable that same labor to be doing other things. So whether it's tools related to the make line or other initiatives that we're doing to try and drive throughput in the stores and trying to reduce the labor required on a daily, hourly basis, there -- it's at the forefront of everybody's mind right now. But I don't think sacrificing service is the way to do it."

And we see opportunities to continue to take share across the category. And it's why we're so focused on retail sales growth as the key metric, not only because it drives all the economics in our business, but obviously, that's how we ultimately gain market share over time.
As I look this year and ongoing, fortressing is going to continue to be a big part of that strategy to gain share. As we've talked about in the past, we are still relatively under-penetrated in terms of share in the carryout business specifically. And fortressing gives us an opportunity to go out and grab that largely incremental carryout business. 
And then on the delivery side, we believe that we've got to continue to offer great value to our customers and terrific service to continue to gain share on the delivery side. And we've talked about how fortressing helps that over time. We're going to continue to invest in our technology initiatives and operating practices, procedures to continue to help us do a better job of service with our customers as well. And then you combine that with fantastic unit-level economics, which allow franchisees to invest in service, and an incredible war chest in terms of our advertising fund to go out there and drive customer awareness and acquisition, we feel like we're in a very strong position to continue to grow."

And in particular, the real pinch point in the business is drivers. So part of what we're doing and working on is trying to continue to make that a great job with the best economics for drivers relative to the other alternatives that they have out there. And we've talked about a number of strategies around that. We continue our work around fortressing to give drivers more deliveries per hour, which translates into higher wages. We're working on technology and operating practices that keep drivers in their cars. So imagine a world where they don't come back into the store, we run the pizzas out to their cars and then go and take the next order. So we're trying to work on those economics for our drivers to keep them busy and earning higher-level wages. 
And then also a big part of what makes Domino's different and has made us different over time is that being a driver at Domino's or a pizza maker inside the store is an opportunity to become an entrepreneur over time. And so a big part of our job and our franchisees' jobs also is to sell the opportunity going forward because 90-plus percent of them started off as drivers or insiders. 
And then the final thing I'd say about labor that will present an ongoing challenge, not just for Domino's, but for others across the industry, is the -- just the changes in minimum wage around the country. As that moves differentially from one market to another, certainly, it puts pressures in some places and not in others. And as we operate as a national brand, we always have to take those things into account as we plan our ongoing marketing and promotional calendar over the course of the year."

And then what you add to that is a healthy number of new franchisees coming into the system every year. And one of the things that makes us a little different from the rest of QSR and of franchising is that those new franchisees all come from within our system. So they could be corporate employees.

And I talked about some of those a little bit earlier on the call, some of the things that we kind of turned the volume down on a little bit, with the carryout business being one of them. You might recall back at the beginning of 2020, we were running advertising on TV called -- a campaign called Pie Pass, where folks would walk into the store and see their name up on the screen as they pick their pizza. But we had to turn that off immediately when we couldn't allow customers to come into our stores. And then throughout the remainder of the year, we were developing new safe service methods for carryout, but we weren't pushing that business as hard as we had pushed, not just in '19, but in the years -- the 5 or 6 years that preceded that. 
Secondly, we turned off the more aggressive promotional weeks that we had typically peppered across the annual calendar. We ran those in '19. We didn't run those in 2020. So those may give you a little bit of a sense for some of the things that we -- arrows that we have in the quiver, if you will, that we can bring back and deploy in 2021 as we get to a more normal operating environment.

When I think about the near-term component of that, we've got a significant amount of technology investment that is going to our stores today and improving the efficiency with which we operate our stores. When you think about what some of the kind of the key pinch points or constraints are in the business, right now, it is labor and it is availability and labor costs at the store level. So we're focusing a lot of time and energy on running more efficient stores such that we can drive higher order counts and higher sales per labor hour. So there's a lot of effort there and a number of things that are rolling out through our system today.
And then on the longer term, Nuro is a great example of that. We are doing some autonomous deliveries as we speak in Houston right now, but it's going to be a while before autonomous delivery is broadly deployed across the Domino's system. But we want to make sure that we're investing and learning today, in particular, how the customer will interact with the robot and how the robot will interact with our operations at the stores.

One is to shrink the territory so we can get more deliveries per hour of delivery driver labor, but also you get that incremental carryout business, which is a much less labor-intensive business for our stores, which is one of the reasons we want to continue to grow and build that business."

Overall, I am very pleased with our results this quarter, which once again demonstrated the strength of the Domino's brand around the world. We are still navigating through the COVID pandemic across the globe. Throughout the last 18 months, our franchisees have continued to step up to the challenge in service of their customers, their communities and their team members. I continue to be extremely proud of our global franchisees and their extraordinary efforts to provide outstanding food through safe and reliable delivery and carryout experiences. 
You've heard me speak often about the importance of global retail sales growth and how that drives our business model. During the second quarter, we delivered 17.1% global retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, driven by a powerful combination of growth in U.S. same-store sales, international same-store sales and global store counts. The second quarter marked our 41st consecutive quarter of U.S. same-store sales growth and our 110th consecutive quarter of international same-store sales growth. 
We also reinforced our leadership position in the pizza category with a very strong quarter of global store growth, highlighted by the opening of our 18,000th store. We celebrated this terrific milestone with the opening of a beautiful store in La Junta, Colorado. The pace of that store growth has accelerated significantly during the first half of this year. When you look at it on a trailing 4-quarter basis, our pace of net store growth has increased from 624 in Q4 2020 to 884 in Q2 2021. 
During the quarter, we also completed our $1.85 billion refinancing transaction, lowering the cost of our debt and giving us the capacity to return $1 billion to our shareholders through our recently completed accelerated share repurchase transaction. Overall, the Domino's brand continues to deliver as our strong same-store sales, store growth and resulting retail sales growth deliver great returns to our franchisees and our shareholders. 
I'll turn the call over now to Jessica Parrish, our Controller and Treasurer. She will take you through the details of the quarter. And then after that, I'll come back and share some additional observations about the quarter and some thoughts around how we are approaching the business going forward. Jessica, over to you."

We are excited to share our strong second quarter results with you today. Overall, Domino's team members and franchisees around the world generated impressive operating results, leading to a diluted EPS of $3.0",1313,"Thank you, Rich, and good morning, everyone. We are excited to share our strong second quarter results with you today. Overall, Domino's team members and franchisees around the world generated impressive operating results, leading to a diluted EPS of $3.06 for Q2. Our diluted EPS, as adjusted for certain items related to our recapitalization transaction completed during the quarter, was $3.12. 
In Q2, we continued to see positive momentum in both the U.S. and international businesses in both same-store sales performance and net unit growth, leading to strong global retail sales growth. Global retail sales grew 21.6% in Q2 as compared to Q2 2020. When excluding the positive impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew 17.1%. 
Breaking down total global retail sales growth, U.S. retail sales grew 7.4% and international retail sales grew 39.7%. When excluding the positive impact of foreign currency, international retail sales grew 29.5%, rolling over a prior year decrease of 3.4%. The prior year decrease in international retail sales, excluding foreign currency, resulted primarily from temporary store closures, changes in store hours and service method disruptions in certain international markets as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Turning to comps. During Q2, we continued to lead the broader restaurant industry with 41 straight quarters of positive U.S. comparable sales and 110 consecutive quarters of positive international comps. Same-store sales in the U.S. grew 3.5% in the quarter, lapping a prior year increase of 16.1%. Same-store sales for our international business grew 13.9%, rolling over a prior year increase of 1.3%. 
Breaking down the U.S. comp, our franchise business was up 3.9% in the quarter while our company-owned stores were down 2.6%.  As we noted on our Q1 call, we continue to observe a larger spread between the top line performance of our franchised stores and our company-owned stores than we have historically seen. We believe this is primarily a function of the heavily urban and higher-income footprint of our company-owned store markets relative to a more diverse mix across our franchise space. 
The U.S. comp this quarter was driven by ticket growth due to increases in items per order in our transparent delivery fee as well as the mix of products we sell. Order counts on a same-store basis were consistent with Q2 2020 levels, which were higher than Q2 2019 levels as a result of customer ordering behavior during the pandemic. 
The international comp was driven by order growth due to the return of nondelivery service methods, the resumption of normal store hours and the reopening of stores that were temporarily closed in certain of our international markets in Q2 2020. 
Shifting to unit count. We and our franchisees added 35 net stores in the U.S. during the second quarter, consisting of 39 store openings and 4 closures. Our international business added 203 net stores comprised of 217 store openings and 14 closures. 
Turning to revenues and operating margins. Total revenues for the second quarter were up approximately $112.4 million or 12.2% over the prior year quarter. The increase was driven by higher global retail sales, which generated higher revenues across all areas of our business. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted our international royalty revenues by $4 million in Q2 2021 as compared to the prior year quarter. 
Our consolidated operating margin as a percentage of revenues increased to 39.5% in Q2 2021 from 38.8% in the prior year due primarily to higher revenues from our U.S. franchise business. Company-owned store margin as a percentage of revenues increased to 24.5% from 23.1%, primarily as a result of lower labor costs, partially offset by higher food costs. Recall that we incurred additional bonus pay in the second quarter of last year for team members on the front lines during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Supply chain operating margin as a percentage of revenues decreased to 11% from 11.9% in the prior year quarter, resulting primarily from higher insurance and food costs as well as higher fixed operating costs driven by depreciation on our new supply chain facilities opened last year. These increases were partially offset by lower labor costs. 
G&A expenses increased approximately $12.3 million in Q2 as compared to Q2 2020, resulting from higher labor costs, including higher variable performance-based compensation and noncash compensation expense, partially offset by lower professional fees. Additionally, as we discussed in our Q1 call, we completed our most recent recapitalization transaction during the second quarter in April. In connection with the recapitalization, we incurred approximately $500,000 of pretax G&A expenses for certain professional fees, which is included as an item affecting comparability in this morning's earnings release. 
Net interest expense increased approximately $6.7 million in the quarter, driven by a higher average debt balance. This increase in interest expense also includes $2.3 million of pretax incremental interest related to the recapitalization transaction, which has been adjusted out as an item affecting comparability in this morning's earnings release. Our weighted average borrowing rate for Q2 2021 was 3.8%, down from 3.9% in Q2 2020. 
Our effective tax rate was 19.6% for the quarter as compared to 4.7% in Q2 2020. The effective tax rate in Q2 2021 includes a 2.3 percentage point positive impact from tax benefits on equity-based compensation. This compares to an 18.5 percentage point positive impact in Q2 2020. This decrease was due to significantly fewer stock option exercises in Q2 of this year. We expect to see continued volatility in our effective tax rate related to these equity-based compensation tax benefits. 
Combining all of these elements, our second quarter net income was down $2 million or 1.7% versus Q2 2020. On a pretax basis, we were up $20.6 million or 16.5% over the prior year. Our diluted EPS in Q2 was $3.06 versus $2.99 in the prior year. Our diluted EPS as adjusted for the impact of the recapitalization transaction was $3.12, an increase of $0.13 or 4.3% over the prior year. 
Breaking down that $0.13 increase in our diluted EPS as adjusted, most notably, our improved operating results benefited us by $0.53. Net interest expense adjusted for the impact of the items affecting comparability I discussed previously negatively impacted us by $0.08. A lower diluted share count driven by share repurchases over the trailing 12 months benefited us by $0.12. And finally, our higher effective tax rate resulting from lower tax benefits on equity-based compensation negatively impacted us by $0.44. 
Shifting to cash. Our strong financial model continued to generate significant cash flow throughout the second quarter. During Q2, we generated net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $143 million. After deducting for CapEx, we generated free cash flow of approximately $126 million. Regarding our capital expenditures, we spent approximately $17 million on CapEx in Q2, primarily on our technology initiatives, including our next-generation point-of-sale system. 
As previously disclosed, during Q2, we also entered into an accelerated share repurchase transaction for $1 billion. We received and retired approximately 2 million shares at the beginning of the ASR. The ASR settled yesterday and we received and retired an additional 238,000 shares in connection with this transaction. In total, the average repurchase price throughout the ASR program was $444.29 per share. 
Additionally, and as noted in this morning's earnings release, subsequent to the end of the quarter, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program for up to $1 billion of our common stock. We also paid a $0.94 quarterly dividend on June 30. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.94 per share to be paid on September 30.  
In closing, our business continued its strong performance during the second quarter, and we are very pleased with the results our franchisees and team members around the world delivered. Thank you all for joining the call today. And now I will turn it back over to Ritch."

My answer has always been that we're not focused on managing to a 12-we",1730,"Thanks, Jessica. And I'll begin my comments with a look at our U.S. business. For months now, many of you have been asking how we would lap the tough comparisons from Q2 of last year. My answer has always been that we're not focused on managing to a 12-week quarter. We are focused on building the business for the long term. And that long-term focus on great product, service, image and technology is precisely why we were able to deliver a terrific quarter, highlighted by 7.4% U.S. retail sales growth, lapping 19.9% from Q2 2020. 
Turning to same-store sales. Perhaps the thing I'm most pleased about when I look at the 3.5% U.S. comp is the fact that we were able to hold orders flat while overlapping the big gains from Q2 2020. I'm also pleased that our ticket growth was driven by a very healthy balance of more items per order and modest menu price and delivery fee increases. 
We achieved positive comps in both our delivery and carryout businesses, with delivery driven by ticket and carryout driven by a balance of order count and ticket growth. We continued to see strong growth across our business in the quarter. You've often asked if our sales growth might be weaker in markets that had more fully reopened. But to the contrary, the opposite trend emerged through the second quarter, where we saw higher levels of sales growth in the second quarter in the markets with fewer COVID-related restrictions. 
Similar to Q1, we saw that comp growth in rural areas outperformed urban areas, and less affluent areas outperformed more affluent areas. These differences, combined with the impact of more aggressive fortressing, accounted for much of the same-store sales gap between our corporate store and franchise store businesses. 
We saw sales benefits during the quarter from the federal government stimulus, particularly the checks that were delivered back in March.  It's difficult to quantify the magnitude of the impact of the onetime distributions and the ongoing unemployment and other government payments to consumers, but we believe that they do continue to have some positive sales impact on our business. 
Due to the strong sales throughout the quarter, we once again elected not to run any of our aggressive boost week promotions but instead remain focused on providing great service and offering great value to our customers every day. As we continue to experience COVID overlaps, we believe it will be instructive to continue to look at the cumulative stack of comparable U.S. same-store sales anchored back to 2019 as a pre-COVID baseline. At 19.6% for Q2, we saw a material sequential improvement of the 2-year stack when compared to the first quarter. Beyond the comps, when you look at the absolute dollars, our second quarter same-store average weekly unit sales in the U.S. exceeded $27,000, another sequential uptick from the levels seen in the first quarter. 
Now turning to the other critical component of our retail sales growth, new store openings. Our addition of 35 net stores was softer than we expected. We have a very strong pipeline of future openings but had a number of stores delayed due to store-level staffing challenges and construction, permitting or equipment delays. We hope to accelerate the pace of openings during the second half of the year as some of the delays in unit growth may subside. 
I'll turn and speak now about the carryout and the delivery businesses. We saw the return of carryout order growth in Q2 and we continue to build awareness of Domino's Carside Delivery. We ran a brief 49% Off Carside Delivery awareness campaign during the quarter and just recently launched a campaign highlighting our Carside Delivery 2-minute Guarantee. This campaign hits on 2 key elements of the Domino's brand, service and value. Our franchisees and operators have fully embraced Carside Delivery, and we are consistently averaging below 2 minutes out the door and on our way to the customers' cars. This is a great technology-enabled way to serve our customers and will remain an important part of our strategy as we continue to evolve the carryout experience, not only to enhance the loyalty of our current carryout customers but also to reach a new, different and largely untapped drive-through-oriented customer going forward. 
For the delivery business, I was also very pleased to see positive delivery same-store sales growth during Q2 while facing very difficult overlaps. We brought back the Noid to highlight our partnership with Nuro for autonomous delivery. This campaign hits on our technology and innovation leadership while having a little bit of fun with our old nemesis, the Noid. We continue to learn as we pilot a true autonomous pizza delivery experience to select customers in the Houston market. 
Now turning to staffing, I'll reiterate something I said back in April. We continue to operate in a very difficult staffing environment for our stores and our supply chain centers. The combination of COVID, strong sales, the accelerating economic growth across the country and the ongoing government stimulus continue to result in one of the most difficult staffing environments that we've seen in a long time. And frankly, this led to higher margins in our corporate store business than we would like to see. The reality is that we were operating during the quarter with fewer team members than we would like to have in many of our stores. This puts pressure on our operators to meet demand while continuing to deliver great service. 
In the back half of the year, we expect to implement additional wage increases across certain corporate store markets and positions. In the face of these challenges, I want to thank our U.S. franchisees and our corporate store operators for their ongoing efforts to attract and retain great team members in a very tight labor market. 
And as we look forward in the U.S. business, we will continue to make the necessary investments to drive retail sales growth into the future. We recently announced our plans to build another supply chain center in Indiana, which we expect to complete by the end of 2022. We are making solid progress on the rewrite of our PULSE point-of-sale system, and we'll continue that multiyear investment, along with additional investment in our enterprise systems to support the business. 
We will continue to invest in technology, operations and product innovation to support our carryout and our delivery businesses. We are continuing to raise wages and invest in our hourly team members. And of course, as always, we will remain focused on value for our customers. So I'll close out our discussion of the U.S. business by simply saying that the Domino's brand has never been stronger, and I remain confident in our ability to drive sustainable long-term growth. 
Now let's move on to international. It was an outstanding quarter of performance for our international business. Our 29.5% international retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, was supported by an exceptional 13.9% comp, continuing the momentum we had in the first quarter. As I discussed earlier with our U.S. business, we're also watching the 2-year comp stacks for international, anchoring back to pre-COVID 2019 and we'll continue to do so throughout 2021. Q2 represented a 15.2% 2-year stack, a sequential improvement over the first quarter. 
I'm particularly pleased with our strong momentum on store growth as international provides a significant push toward our 2- to 3-year outlook of 6% to 8% global net unit growth. Our 203 net stores in Q2 increased our trailing 4-quarter pace of international store growth to 653 net stores. Our accelerating store growth continues to be driven by our outstanding unit-level economics and the strong commitment of our international master franchise partners. 
During the quarter, COVID continued to have a significant impact on many of our international markets and we expect COVID to remain a challenge in many parts of the world for some time to come. At the end of the quarter, we had fewer than 175 temporary store closures with many of those located in India, which has been hit particularly hard by COVID. 
And I want to take a minute here to thank Jubilant Foodworks, our master franchisee in India, for their outstanding commitment to their team members during this very difficult time. The company mounted a series of initiatives to support their employees and families through this unprecedented crisis. This included a cross-functional team that provided employee assistance 24/7 as well as several COVID isolation centers with oxygen concentrator banks. Jubilant mounted a massive vaccination drive for all their employees and dependent family members. Challenging times always bring out the best in Domino's franchisees, and I could not be more proud of our leaders in India and how they have responded to this crisis. 
I'd also like to highlight a few international markets that drove terrific growth during the quarter. China passed the 400-store milestone during Q2 and once again, Dash, our master franchise partner, delivered outstanding retail sales growth for the brand. China is, without question, one of the most exciting businesses in the Domino's system with significant long-term runway for growth. 
Japan reached the 800-store milestone in the weeks following the close of our second quarter and continued the outstanding performance under master franchisee, Domino's Pizza Enterprise's ownership. The U.K., Germany, Mexico and Turkey were also large market highlights and a strong quarter of performance across our international business. I am proud of our master franchisees and their operators for their great work thus far in 2021, and I remain optimistic about our international retail sales growth opportunity over the long term. 
So in closing, I'm very happy with our Q2 results. Great franchisees and operators, combined with outstanding unit-level economics, place us in an enviable position within our industry and give us a strong foundation for future growth. There is absolutely no question that Domino's is the global leader in QSR pizza.  But there is still so much opportunity ahead of us to drive global retail sales growth and to grow market share around the world in both our delivery and carryout businesses. 
As we look to the back half of the year and beyond, you can be confident that we will remain focused on winning the long game. So thank you again for joining us today, and we'll now be happy to take some of your questions."

Thanks for the question. And we do feel that it's instructive to take a look at the business comparing back to that pre-COVID anchor, if you will, of 2019 because there's so many dynamics that have occurred over the last 18 months that for us, as we look at the business internally and, we think, instructive for our investors as well, really understanding what is that longer-term trend and the growth in the business is important. 
We're not making any statements or projections today about the third or fourth quarters of this year. Just merely sharing with you how those trends are unfolding on a quarter-to-quarter basis because there's still so many factors there that are driving the business. Obviously, those things that we have under our control, but there are also many factors externally outside of our control that are difficult to predict. What happens with -- as COVID continues to unfold with the Delta variant, for example, what happens with respect to ongoing government stimulus and intervention in the economy, all of those things will continue to play a factor as we look at what happens with comps and what that resulting 1- and 2-year comp profile looks like over time. 
You asked about the dynamics going on in markets that are reopening. Like many of you, we've obviously been watching very studiously what happens as some of these markets around the country reopening. I think it's important to remember that our business is a delivery business but it's also a very robust carryout business. And so when markets closed down, and I've talked about this several times over the last year, it had a negative impact on our carryout business. So as we see markets reopen, we get some positive tailwind on the carryout business. 
And then also our -- for our delivery business, the fact that we've been able to stay very focused on value for our customers, we saw a positive comp in the second quarter on the delivery business as well, even though markets had reopened. So we'll keep tracking the 1- and 2-year basis, looking across both of those businesses. And as the year unfolds, on a quarterly basis, we'll continue to share those insights back with you."

You said that they're taking moderate amounts of pricing or there's a moderate amount of pricing in your -- maybe it's your company comps, maybe assume that's the franchise as well. Does that open the conversation about what the price point should be at Domino's, given this unique market environment? Should -- as you're sort of locked into these $5.99, $7.99 price points, is there more friction around that conversation, given the cost of labor? And if there is, how do you answer that question that the franchisees might ask about pricing?"

And this is certainly something that we think about all of the time. To the first part of your question, most certainly, when we look at the labor and the wage environment, wages are only going in 1 direction over time, and that is up.",417,"Sure. Thanks, John. And this is certainly something that we think about all of the time. To the first part of your question, most certainly, when we look at the labor and the wage environment, wages are only going in 1 direction over time, and that is up. Some of that obviously is dictated by some of the minimum wage changes that are happening, another round of which occurred in -- here in July.  But also just the general supply and demand equation in the labor market is causing wages to go up. And we're certainly continuing to invest more in our hourly team members, in our corporate store business to make sure that we can remain staffed and serve our customers. 
When we think about how do we offset those wage increases and still deliver a terrific 4-wall economic model, pricing is certainly one of the levers that is out there. And at the local level, we do this in our corporate stores and our franchisees have -- they have the latitude to do this for their businesses. We have taken some increases in our single transparent delivery fee -- we charge -- wherever we are, we charge a single fee, it varies significantly market-to-market based on the local dynamics. But that's certainly a lever that we and our franchisees have pulled. 
And then menu pricing, our franchisees have control of that. And in the higher wage markets, you will find higher menu prices at generally higher menu prices at Domino's. As it relates to the national offers, our $5.99 and $7.99 Hero offers, we continue to test those on a very frequent basis, not just looking at which offers would drive the most top line, but more importantly, what's going to drive the strongest 4-wall EBITDA for our stores. And $5.99 and $7.99 have continued to emerge from the many, many offers that we test on a frequent basis. 
But what I'll tell you is if we find an offer or if the dynamics change such that a different offer drives higher levels of profit for our franchisees, then we would move to that offer. $5.99 and $7.99 are not sacred. The only thing that is sacred is that we're going to bring value to the consumer because that's what drives order counts and ultimately, order counts, over time, are correlated with sales and with profitability at the store level. So something we are always looking at, John, and always talking to our franchisees about."

We are constantly testing a robust pipeline of new products and platforms for the menu. But we hold it to a pretty high standard in terms of what ultimately gets on our menu because we're not just looking to put things on the menu to drive sales for a limited amount of time. So that's -- you don't see us use LTOs and you shouldn't expect to see us using those into the future. 
What we are looking for are products that can drive incrementality in revenue and in profit. So we test products not only for where they would mix on the menu, but more importantly, once you take into effect the potential cannibalization from other menu items, are we delivering the incremental revenue and profit at the store level? 
You asked a little bit about premium and customers willing to pay more. When we introduced our 2 new specialty pizzas, the Chicken Taco and the Cheeseburger, those were all about bringing some more premium products to that specialty line, which gives the franchisee an opportunity for some incremental revenue over and above our more traditional products that are offered on the $5.99 menu. So we'll continue to look for opportunities there. 
And when we introduce something like those 2 specialty pizzas, it's not just to drive sales of those 2 pizzas, but we also see that, that elevate sales of the specialty line in general, which is a more premium line. So as we look forward, you should expect to see us continue to roll out new products. As has been in the past, you probably won't see us rolling them out as faster as significant quantity as some of the other players in the industry simply because we've just got a different strategy in terms of how we look at it. And I suspect it goes without saying, but a big part of that strategy is also just managing the level of change and complexity on our operators in our 6,000-plus stores across the country."

It's something that we're always actively engaged in discussions with our franchisees and those relationships. And frankly, one of the best things about the second quarter for myself personally is that I've been out on the road a lot, out in stores and visiting with our franchisees as we've gotten ourselves vaccinated and are able to get out there and interact a lot more. 
And franchisees, I think, certainly pleased with the top line growth that we've seen in the business and the fact that we've seen the sustained levels of sales that we've had here in the first and second quarters of the year. You won't be surprised because -- to hear that franchisees are, just as we are, concerned about staffing, about labor rates and where those are going over time, thinking about commodity costs and where those are going, all the things that you would expect restaurant operators to be concerned about. 
But when we take a look at the business in total, the 4-wall economics of the business are still incredibly strong. The cost of entry or what it takes to get a Domino's Pizza opened relative to other QSRs, still very modest. So the cash-on-cash returns in the business are still very strong, and that's really what drives the appetite for development. So I still see a strong appetite for development. That's not just true in the U.S. business but it's around the globe. 
And really kind of tying back to some of the comments I made earlier on this call, the real gating factor right now in terms of getting stores open is not the desire to do so. It is some of those other factors around staffing and just having teams ready to be in those stores day 1 when they open, given some of the labor constraints. But also, we have seen some continued delays in construction and permitting. And then also just in some specific equipment categories that go into our stores, you probably won't be surprised to hear that there are still some significant supply chain disruptions out there, and some of those have hit some of the equipment that we use to build out a Domino's Pizza store."

It would be great to address. 
And then secondly, your app gives you a lot of data that I mean, others would love to have. And some of that data may show customers that abandon their orders once they see a delivery time that has gotten to be quite long. Talk about how much of an issue that's become and if there is a way for you to think like, how much sales you could actually recapture or, I guess, in this case, actually grow if you were to get service levels materially down, which I assume would come through increased delivery driver staffing."

To address the first topic, we've had some turnover among the management team. But what I can tell you is that also creates opportunity for great leaders that we've had on the bench and who are ready to step up and take -- and really take things to the next level. So as I look across our team, and that's not just the direct reports to myself, but also as I look broadly across our senior management team within the company, we've never been stronger than we are today. 
We, like I'm sure some others out there, we've still got a few positions that we still need to fill. But when I look across, I feel very good about the leadership team at Domino's Pizza. And I don't think we could deliver the kind of results that we've been delivering if we didn't have a great leadership team. 
The second -- the question around taking a look at service and what we're seeing there in the business. With the challenges that we've had in staffing, we haven't made the service gains and improvements that I would like to see here in 2021. And we've slipped a minute or 2 in some places with respect to the average times in terms of getting food to our customers, and that is a big area of focus for us as we look going forward. 
We know because we've got all the data, as you referenced, we know that when our mean delivery times get better and when our standard deviations around delivery times get tighter, we get more sales -- delivery sales per household for those customers that are in our delivery area. So there's clearly an opportunity to continue to grow delivery by driving those service times down. Some of that will come from getting our staffing levels back to where we need them to be. 
But also, I can tell you, we are spending a lot of time looking at how we can get more efficient in our stores, and frankly, how we can deliver those -- deliver better delivery times with the same or, in some cases, even fewer drivers. Some of that is examining all of the wasted time that we have. If we want to be as efficient as we can possibly be, then a driver should never get out of his or her car and should spend all of their time getting pizzas to customers. So we're trying to take some of those other things out some of those other tasks, some of those things that drive inefficiencies so that we can keep the drivers moving. That's better for the customer in terms of delivery times. But it's also a lot better for the drivers if we can get more deliveries per driver per hour. That means more tips for those drivers. And we know that when they earn higher wages, their retention rates get better for us also. So we're working on all of those things, John, to try to continue to drive improvements in service because we know what the value of that is over time."

And if you take a look at where carryout is and the most important metric that we look at around it is what's -- where are we in terms of carryout orders per store? And basically, when we take a look at Q2, we were pretty well back to where we were in 2019 on carryout orders, slightly positive. A lot of benefit in ticket growth that we've seen in carryout, really driven by customers ordering more product per order. But we did see in the second quarter that we got back to the pre-COVID levels in terms of orders. 
In terms of the mix of our business, when you look at carryout orders versus delivery orders, we're still a little bit below where we were pre COVID, and that's really driven by the fact that our delivery order counts on a 2-year basis are significantly higher than they were back in 2019. So what I would say is that we are in kind of the first phase of that carryout order count growth resurgence that we've been thinking about and forecasting for a while internally. 
Carside Delivery, for us, is something that was on -- it was on our work plan even before COVID hit because we were looking at Carside Delivery really as the way at Domino's to compete for that drive-through customer. Now when COVID hit, we kind of reshuffled our work plan and pulled all of that forward to get it rolled out more quickly because it also provides a safe and contactless experience for the customer, which became so important during COVID. 
But we look at Carside as a fantastic way to compete against the drive-through because while we've got pickup windows in a number of our stores out there, the reality is we're never going to get to 100% pickup windows in Domino's Pizza stores. And so we've got to have a way to get the product out to the customer. I have been incredibly pleased with our franchisees and how they have embraced this, in particular, leading up to and now during our 2-minute guarantee that we're running on TV. We're averaging well below 2 minutes across our system of getting those pizzas out the door. And I don't know, David, if you've sat in a drive-through line recently, but I've sat at some QSRs for 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes. And if you can pull into our order ahead, pull into our parking lot and we can get that pizza in your car in 2 minutes, I think that's a great customer experience. 
And then for us, another fantastic benefit of Carside is the fact that these orders are they're preordered digitally and they're prepaid. So preordering digitally allows us to drive a higher ticket because we do a much better job of driving ticket for those digital orders because we've got all the technology built in there based on the A/B testing and everything else we do to give the customer a great experience and make sure they get in their basket the things that they would enjoy that even for dinner. 
And then on the prepayment, that's also great for us as well because it shortens the transaction time in the store and lets us get the customer out the door faster and using less labor. And the digital obviously also gives us an opportunity then to invite those customers into our loyalty program. So early stages of Carside but I'm really happy with the adoption across the system and what this could mean for us as we continue to compete for more occasions with our consumers."

Happy to touch on that. As you take a look really over the course of the last year or so, the bulk of the growth in our business really has come from existing customers, and that customer retention and purchase frequency and even more concentrated within our loyalty customer base, that 27-plus million active loyalty members that we have at Domino's. So I'm really pleased with what we've been able to do as the pandemic has unfolded in terms of driving customer retention, staying relevant and keeping those orders -- the order frequency up over time. 
When I look forward, I think we do have more opportunities to continue to prime the pump further around customer acquisition. Some of the most important tools that we've used historically to do that have been some of these periodic boost weeks that we've used. And we haven't run any of those for quite some time. So that's certainly an arrow in the quiver that we have going forward. 
Product introductions, certainly another opportunity to invite new customers in. And we do have some robust products in the pipeline, so you should expect to see some news from us on that in the quarters to come as another potential opportunity. And then what I'd tell you also, just kind of underlying all this, it's not a specific action or a catalyst for driving customer acquisition, but I fundamentally believe that staying focused on value is perhaps our greatest customer acquisition vehicle over time because as you see prices being raised significantly at a number of other restaurant chains around the country, and as we start to see some of this government stimulus come away as we go into the back half of this year, I think it's going to be really important for the families that we serve to stay focused on value. And I think that's always a consistent message from us and an opportunity to continue to bring new customers into the fold."

First, on the labor environment, we're absolutely working on technologies and operating procedures to help us run our stores more efficiently and with less labor. One of those I spoke about earlier as it relates to our delivery drivers, which is that we're trying to take a lot of things off of their plates that cause them to do anything other than being in a car delivering a pizza or on a bike delivering a pizza to a customer. 
So an example of that is, that drove me crazy for years, was pre-folding boxes, which was often a task that delivery drivers did. We've made enormous strides within our system and now have more than 2,000 of our stores in the U.S. that no longer pre-fold boxes. So that's taken work out of the store. And by the way, it also makes for a much cleaner and better-looking store as well. 
Other things that we've been working on, we've rolled out our GPS software out to our stores, and it's in the hands of our drivers on their smartphones. That allows drivers to get proficient much more quickly. In the old way at Domino's, a driver might take 2, 3 months to learn the delivery area. But with the GPS capability that we have, we can do a better job of routing and getting drivers to their -- to the location that they're headed to. 
We're working on other things as well around how we schedule and staff the stores, using machine learning to really help us do a better job of predicting what our sales are going to be and therefore, more appropriately matching the number of team members at the store at the times when we need them. So a lot going on there. 
Your second around digital, yes, around 75% of sales. How high is high? I don't know but I know it's higher than 75%. The benchmark that we use in the Domino's world to kind of inspire everybody else is China, where more than 19 out of every 20 orders come in through digital channels. So that's really the inspiration for us. So I guess until we get close to 100, I'm not going to stop pushing."

First, on third party, I mean, I don't think there's any question at this point that third-party delivery is here to stay. You can pretty well get any type of food delivered anywhere in the country and frankly, now broadly just about across anywhere",526,"Sure. First, on third party, I mean, I don't think there's any question at this point that third-party delivery is here to stay. You can pretty well get any type of food delivered anywhere in the country and frankly, now broadly just about across anywhere in the world today. So we don't think that competition is going away. And in fact, in many ways, we look at that as our primary competitive set. As the leader in the pizza category, obviously, we still continue to look at the pizza competition. But frankly, the biggest competition over the long term for us in delivery is that third-party aggregator channel. 
So when I think about what we've got to do, so let's assume regardless of where their economics sit today, we believe they're going to be here for the long haul. So we have to continue to make sure that we are the best value both for the consumer and for the restaurant operator. So we continue to believe that our owned fleet for us in our corporate stores and for our franchisees in their stores, having our own delivery drivers running point-to-point back and forth to the store, we continue to believe that's the most efficient operating model and gets even more efficient as we continue to fortress our markets. And so having that very efficient model is important in order to put us in a position to continue to offer a very competitive delivery fee and overall value proposition to the customer. 
We also believe that the fact that we use a single transparent delivery fee, we think, over time is an important competitive advantage. When I order third-party delivery, I have to really get my calculator out to figure out what I've actually paid to have that food delivered because maybe I got a discount on the delivery fee but maybe I paid a service fee. Maybe I paid a small order fee, maybe I paid a fee because I happened to be in a city where they were charging an incremental city fee. We very much believe around a single transparent delivery fee over time, we think, will be important to customers. 
And then back on the other side of the equation, staying as the best value for the restaurant operator. We charge for a digital order. We charge our franchisees. It's just a little bit over 1% of ticket, that $0.275 digital order fee. That is so much lower than what you're going to see in terms of what the third parties are charging restaurants out there. So we think that gives us a competitive advantage in terms of continuing to make sure that we've got great 4-wall economics for our operators because that's the only way we grow the business over time, and they open more stores as if the 4-wall economics continue to be strong. 
So I think, Chris, we don't exactly know yet how all this ultimately shakes out and what all of the dynamics that may shift over time, but we're really focused on maintaining a competitive position with both of those groups, the customers and the restaurant operators."

And in your answer, if you could really touch on the influence of third-party delivery as competition. And I don't want to lead the witness too much, but I'm thinking that the restaurants and the third-party players themselves may be passing along particularly rapid menu price inflation lately, which is perhaps less accepted in the less affluent areas, and that third party may also be pulling back in service levels in these less profitable low-density markets. But I'm just guessing there and you might have better data on this."

Thank you. I think if we start with less affluent versus more affluent, I think certainly, to the extent that these third-party delivery fees get more complex and increase over time, that less affluent customer is absolutely going to feel more of a pinch on that. And I think it's -- and with a brand the size of Domino's, a big portion of the customers that we serve out there are -- these are not super wealthy folks and value's really, really important to them. And so I suspect that in many of these less affluent areas, we stack up very favorably in terms of the all-in value of having delivered food to serve to your family. 
Whereas in some of the more affluent areas, there may be less price sensitivity to some of these more significant delivery charges and/or if those consumers are ordering a higher overall ticket. If they're ordering $75 worth of food from a casual dining restaurant, then paying the fee is less a pinch on a relative basis. So we're still looking at this and seeing how it evolves but I suspect that your hypothesis and ours there are reasonably well aligned. 
And then I think as it relates to the urban versus the rural, I do believe there that in those more rural environments, there's -- where there is less density, I think our -- the cost model around how we deliver probably shines even more in some of those places where we can keep drivers busy running point-to-point back and forth from our stores. So we're continuing to watch it and evolve it. There may be some other dynamics there, David, that we look at, such as some of just the migration of people out of some of the urban areas during COVID, and not all of those folks have returned yet back to the big cities or places where they previously lived. So still watching it, trends are still evolving. 
Well, folks, we really do appreciate your time, and thank you all for joining us on the call this morning, and we look forward to getting back together with you again in October to discuss our third quarter 2021 results."

Overall, I am very pleased with our results this quarter, which once again demonstrated the strength of the Domino's brand around the world. We are still navigating through the COVID pandemic across the globe. Throughout the last 18 months, our franchisees have continued to step up to the challenge in service of their customers, their communities and their team members. I continue to be extremely proud of our global franchisees and their extraordinary efforts to provide outstanding food through safe and reliable delivery and carryout experiences.
You've heard me speak often about the importance of global retail sales growth and how that drives our business model. During the second quarter, we delivered 17.1% global retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, driven by a powerful combination of growth in U.S. same-store sales, international same-store sales and global store counts. The second quarter marked our 41st consecutive quarter of U.S. same-store sales growth and our 110th consecutive quarter of international same-store sales growth. 
We also reinforced our leadership position in the pizza category with a very strong quarter of global store growth, highlighted by the opening of our 18,000th store. We celebrated this terrific milestone with the opening of a beautiful store in La Junta, Colorado. The pace of net store growth has accelerated significantly during the first half of this year. When you look at it on a trailing 4-quarter basis, our pace of net store growth has increased from 624 in Q4 2020 to 884 in Q2 2021. 
During the quarter, we also completed our $1.85 billion refinancing transaction, lowering the cost of our debt and giving us the capacity to return $1 billion to our shareholders through our recently completed accelerated share repurchase transaction. Overall, the Domino's brand continues to deliver as our strong same-store sales, store growth and resulting retail sales growth deliver great returns to our franchisees and our shareholders. 
I'll turn the call over now to Jessica Parrish, our Controller and Treasurer. She will take you through the details of the quarter. And then after that, I'll come back and share some additional observations about the quarter and some thoughts around how we are approaching the business going forward. Jessica, over to you."

We are excited to share our strong second quarter results with you today. Overall, Domino's team members and franchisees around the world generated impressive operating results, leading to a diluted EPS of $3.06 for Q2. Our diluted EPS, as adjusted for certain items related to our recapitalization transaction completed during the quarter, was $3.12. 
In Q2, we continued to see positive momentum in both the U.S. and international businesses in both same-store sales performance and net unit growth, leading to strong global retail sales growth. Global retail sales grew 21.6% in Q2 as compared to Q2 2020. When excluding the positive impact of foreign currency, global retail sales grew 17.1%. 
Breaking down total global retail sales growth, U.S. retail sales grew 7.4% and international retail sales grew 39.7%. When excluding the positive impact of foreign currency, international retail sales grew 29.5%, rolling over a prior year decrease of 3.4%. The prior year decrease in international retail sales, excluding foreign currency, resulted primarily from temporary store closures, changes in store hours and service method disruptions in certain international markets as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Turning to comps. During Q2, we continued to lead the broader restaurant industry with 41 straight quarters of positive U.S. comparable sales and 110 consecutive quarters of positive international comps. Same-store sales in the U.S. grew 3.5% in the quarter, lapping a prior year increase of 16.1%. Same-store sales for our international business grew 13.9%, rolling over a prior year increase of 1.3%. 
Breaking down the U.S. comp, our franchise business was up 3.9% in the quarter while our company-owned stores were down 2.6%. As we noted on our Q1 call, we continue to observe a larger spread between the top line performance of our franchised stores and our company-owned stores than we have historically seen. We believe this is primarily a function of the heavily urban and higher-income footprint of our company-owned store markets relative to a more diverse mix across our franchise space.
The U.S. comp this quarter was driven by ticket growth due to increases in items per order in our transparent delivery fee as well as the mix of products we sell. Order counts on a same-store basis were consistent with Q2 2020 levels, which were higher than Q2 2019 levels as a result of customer ordering behavior during the pandemic. 
The international comp was driven by order growth due to the return of nondelivery service methods, the resumption of normal store hours and the reopening of stores that were temporarily closed in certain of our international markets in Q2 2020. 
Shifting to unit count. We and our franchisees added 35 net stores in the U.S. during the second quarter, consisting of 39 store openings and 4 closures. Our international business added 203 net stores comprised of 217 store openings and 14 closures. 
Turning to revenues and operating margins. Total revenues for the second quarter were up approximately $112.4 million or 12.2% over the prior year quarter. The increase was driven by higher global retail sales, which generated higher revenues across all areas of our business. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted our international royalty revenues by $4 million in Q2 2021 as compared to the prior year quarter. 
Our consolidated operating margin as a percentage of revenues increased to 39.5% in Q2 2021 from 38.8% in the prior year due primarily to higher revenues from our U.S. franchise business. Company-owned store margin as a percentage of revenues increased to 24.5% from 23.1%, primarily as a result of lower labor costs, partially offset by higher food costs. Recall that we incurred additional bonus pay in the second quarter of last year for team members on the front lines during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Supply chain operating margin as a percentage of revenues decreased to 11% from 11.9% in the prior year quarter, resulting primarily from higher insurance and food costs as well as higher fixed operating costs driven by depreciation on our new supply chain facilities opened last year. These increases were partially offset by lower labor costs. 
G&A expenses increased approximately $12.3 million in Q2 as compared to Q2 2020, resulting from higher labor costs, including higher variable performance-based compensation and noncash compensation expense, partially offset by lower professional fees. Additionally, as we discussed in our Q1 call, we completed our most recent recapitalization transaction during the second quarter in April. In connection with the recapitalization, we incurred approximately $500,000 of pretax G&A expenses for certain professional fees, which is included as an item affecting comparability in this morning's earnings release. 
Net interest expense increased approximately $6.7 million in the quarter, driven by a higher average debt balance. This increase in interest expense also includes $2.3 million of pretax incremental interest related to the recapitalization transaction, which has been adjusted out as an item affecting comparability in this morning's earnings release. Our weighted average borrowing rate for Q2 2021 was 3.8%, down from 3.9% in Q2 2020. 
Our effective tax rate was 19.6% for the quarter as compared to 4.7% in Q2 2020. The effective tax rate in Q2 2021 includes a 2.3 percentage point positive impact from tax benefits on equity-based compensation. This compares to an 18.5 percentage point positive impact in Q2 2020. This decrease was due to significantly fewer stock option exercises in Q2 of this year. We expect to see continued volatility in our effective tax rate related to these equity-based compensation tax benefits. 
Combining all of these elements, our second quarter net income was down $2 million or 1.7% versus Q2 2020. On a pretax basis, we were up $20.6 million or 16.5% over the prior year. Our diluted EPS in Q2 was $3.06 versus $2.99 in the prior year. Our diluted EPS as adjusted for the impact of the recapitalization transaction was $3.12, an increase of $0.13 or 4.3% over the prior year. 
Breaking down that $0.13 increase in our diluted EPS as adjusted, most notably, our improved operating results benefited us by $0.53. Net interest expense adjusted for the impact of the items affecting comparability I discussed previously negatively impacted us by $0.08. A lower diluted share count driven by share repurchases over the trailing 12 months benefited us by $0.12. And finally, our higher effective tax rate resulting from lower tax benefits on equity-based compensation negatively impacted us by $0.44. 
Shifting to cash. Our strong financial model continued to generate significant cash flow throughout the second quarter. During Q2, we generated net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $143 million. After deducting for CapEx, we generated free cash flow of approximately $126 million. Regarding our capital expenditures, we spent approximately $17 million on CapEx in Q2, primarily on our technology initiatives, including our next-generation point-of-sale system. 
As previously disclosed, during Q2, we also entered into an accelerated share repurchase transaction for $1 billion. We received and retired approximately 2 million shares at the beginning of the ASR. The ASR settled yesterday and we received and retired an additional 238,000 shares in connection with this transaction. In total, the average repurchase price throughout the ASR program was $444.29 per share. 
Additionally, and as noted in this morning's earnings release, subsequent to the end of the quarter, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program for up to $1 billion of our common stock. We also paid a $0.94 quarterly dividend on June 30. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.94 per share to be paid on September 30. 
In closing, our business continued its strong performance during the second quarter. And we are very pleased with the results our franchisees and team members around the world delivered. Thank you all for joining the call today. And now I will turn it back over to Ritch."

For months now, many of you have been asking how we would lap the tough comparisons from Q2 of last year. My answer has always been that we're not focused on managing to a 12-week quarter. We are focused on building the business for the long term. And that long-term focus on great product, service, image and technology is precisely why we were able to deliver a terrific quarter, highlighted by 7.4% U.S. retail sales growth, lapping 19.9% from Q2 2020. 
Turning to same-store sales. Perhaps the thing I'm most pleased about when I look at the 3.5% U.S. comp is the fact that we were able to hold orders flat while overlapping the big gains from Q2 2020. I'm also pleased that our ticket growth was driven by a very healthy balance of more items per order and modest menu price and delivery fee increases. 
We achieved positive comps in both our delivery and carryout businesses, with delivery driven by ticket and carryout driven by a balance of order count and ticket growth. We continued to see strong growth across our business in the quarter. You've often asked if our sales growth might be weaker in markets that had more fully reopened. But to the contrary, the opposite trend emerged through the second quarter, where we saw higher levels of sales growth in the second quarter in the markets with fewer COVID-related restrictions. 
Similar to Q1, we saw that comp growth in rural areas outperformed urban areas, and less affluent areas outperformed more affluent areas. These differences, combined with the impact of more aggressive fortressing, accounted for much of the same-store sales gap between our corporate store and franchise store businesses. 
We saw sales benefits during the quarter from the federal government stimulus, particularly the checks that were delivered back in March. It's difficult to quantify the magnitude of the impact of the onetime distribution and the ongoing unemployment and other government payments to consumers, but we believe that they do continue to have some positive sales impact on our business. Due to the strong sales throughout the quarter, we once again elected not to run any of our aggressive boost week promotions but instead remain focused on providing great service and offering great value to our customers every day. 
As we continue to experience COVID overlaps, we believe it will be instructive to continue to look at the cumulative stack of comparable U.S. same-store sales anchored back to 2019 as a pre-COVID baseline. At 19.6% for Q2, we saw a material sequential improvement of the 2-year stack when compared to the first quarter. Beyond the comps, when you look at the absolute dollars, our second quarter same-store average weekly unit sales in the U.S. exceeded $27,000, another sequential uptick from the levels seen in the first quarter. 
Now turning to the other critical component of our retail sales growth, new store openings. Our addition of 35 net stores was softer than we expected. We have a very strong pipeline of future openings but had a number of stores delayed due to store-level staffing challenges and construction, permitting or equipment delays. We hope to accelerate the pace of openings during the second half of the year as some of the delays in unit growth may subside. 
I'll turn and speak now about the carryout and the delivery businesses. We saw the return of carryout order growth in Q2 and we continue to build awareness of Domino's Carside Delivery. We ran a brief 49% Off Carside Delivery awareness campaign during the quarter and just recently launched a campaign highlighting our Carside Delivery 2-minute guarantee. 
This campaign hits on 2 key elements of the Domino's brand: service and value. Our franchisees and operators have fully embraced Carside Delivery, and we are consistently averaging below 2 minutes out the door and on our way to the customers' cars. This is a great technology-enabled way to serve our customers and will remain an important part of our strategy as we continue to evolve the carryout experience, not only to enhance the loyalty of our current carryout customers but also to reach a new, different and largely untapped drive-through-oriented customer going forward. 
For the delivery business, I was also very pleased to see positive delivery same-store sales growth during Q2 while facing very difficult overlaps. We brought back the Noid to highlight our partnership with Nuro for autonomous delivery. This campaign hits on our technology and innovation leadership while having a little bit of fun with our old nemesis, the Noid. We continue to learn as we pilot a true autonomous pizza delivery experience to select customers in the Houston market. 
Now turning to staffing. I'll reiterate something I said back in April. We continue to operate in a very difficult staffing environment for our stores and our supply chain centers. The combination of COVID, strong sales, the accelerating economic growth across the country and the ongoing government stimulus continue to result in one of the most difficult staffing environments that we've seen in a long time. And frankly, this led to higher margins in our corporate store business than we would like to see. The reality is that we were operating during the quarter with fewer team members than we would like to have in many of our stores. This puts pressure on our operators to meet demand while continuing to deliver great service.
In the back half of the year, we expect to implement additional wage increases across certain corporate store markets and positions. In the face of these challenges, I want to thank our U.S. franchisees and our corporate store operators for their ongoing efforts to attract and retain great team members in a very tight labor market. 
And as we look forward in the U.S. business, we will continue to make the necessary investments to drive retail sales growth into the future. We recently announced our plans to build another supply chain center in Indiana, which we expect to complete by the end of 2022. We are making solid progress on the rewrite of our PULSE point-of-sale system. And we'll continue that multiyear investment, along with additional investment in our enterprise systems to support the business. 
We will continue to invest in technology, operations and product innovation to support our carryout and our delivery businesses. We are continuing to raise wages and invest in our hourly team members. And of course, as always, we will remain focused on value for our customers. 
 
So I'll close out our discussion of the U.S. business by simply saying that the Domino's brand has never been stronger. And I remain confident in our ability to drive sustainable long-term growth. 
Now let's move on to international. It was an outstanding quarter of performance for our international business. Our 29.5% international retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, was supported by an exceptional 13.9% comp, continuing the momentum we had in the first quarter. As I discussed earlier with our U.S. business, we're also watching the 2-year comp stacks for international, anchoring back to pre-COVID 2019 and we'll continue to do so throughout 2021. Q2 represented a 15.2% 2-year stack, a sequential improvement over the first quarter. 
I'm particularly pleased with our strong momentum on store growth as international provides a significant push toward our 2- to 3-year outlook of 6% to 8% global net unit growth. Our 203 net stores in Q2 increased our trailing 4-quarter pace of international store growth to 653 net stores. Our accelerating store growth continues to be driven by our outstanding unit-level economics and the strong commitment of our international master franchise partners. 
During the quarter, COVID continued to have a significant impact on many of our international markets. And we expect COVID to remain a challenge in many parts of the world for some time to come. At the end of the quarter, we had fewer than 175 temporary store closures with many of those located in India, which has been hit particularly hard by COVID. 
And I want to take a minute here to thank Jubilant Foodworks, our master franchisee in India, for their outstanding commitment to their team members during this very difficult time. The company mounted a series of initiatives to support their employees and families through this unprecedented crisis. This included a cross-functional team that provided employee assistance 24/7 as well as several COVID isolation centers with oxygen concentrator banks. Jubilant mounted a massive vaccination drive for all their employees and dependent family members. Challenging times always bring out the best in Domino's franchisees. And I could not be more proud of our leaders in India and how they have responded to this crisis.
I'd also like to highlight a few international markets that drove terrific growth during the quarter. China passed the 400-store milestone during Q2. And once again, Dash, our master franchise partner, delivered outstanding retail sales growth for the brand. China is, without question, one of the most exciting businesses in the Domino's system with significant long-term runway for growth. 
Japan reached the 800-store milestone in the weeks following the close of our second quarter and continued the outstanding performance under master franchisee, Domino's Pizza Enterprises ownership. The U.K., Germany, Mexico and Turkey were also large market highlights in a strong quarter of performance across our international business. I am proud of our master franchisees and their operators for their great work thus far in 2021. And I remain optimistic about our international retail sales growth opportunity over the long term. 
So in closing, I'm very happy with our Q2 results. Great franchisees and operators, combined with outstanding unit-level economics, place us in an enviable position within our industry and give us a strong foundation for future growth. There is absolutely no question that Domino's is the global leader in QSR pizza. But there is still so much opportunity ahead of us to drive global retail sales growth and to grow market share around the world in both our delivery and carryout businesses. 
As we look to the back half of the year and beyond, you can be confident that we will remain focused on winning the long game. So thank you again for joining us today, and we'll now be happy to take some of your questions."

Is pegging this 2-year trend relevant, in your mind, for the rest of the year, including the fourth quarter because sustaining it would imply a pretty big jump in the 1-year same-store sales in the fourth quarter?
And I just think in general, folks remain a bit confused how this accelerated business performance that Domino's is generating is able to occur in this reopening environment. You actually suggested that more reopened footprints are outperforming. So can you just put some insights into the core drivers of this dynamic that you're seeing within your business?"

Thanks for the question. And we do feel that it's instructive to take a look at the business comparing back to that pre-COVID anchor, if you will, of 2019 because there's so many dynamics that have occurred over the last 18 months that for us, as we look at the business internally and, we think, instructive for our investors as well, really understanding what is that longer-term trend and the growth in the business is important. 
We're not making any statements or projections today about the third or fourth quarters of this year. Just merely sharing with you how those trends are unfolding on a quarter-to-quarter basis because there's still so many factors there that are driving the business. Obviously, those things that we have under our control, but there are also many factors externally outside of our control that are difficult to predict. What happens with -- as COVID continues to unfold with the delta variant, for example, what happens with respect to ongoing government stimulus and intervention in the economy, all of those things will continue to play a factor as we look at what happens with comps and what that resulting 1- and 2-year comp profile looks like over time. 
You asked about the dynamics going on in markets that are reopening. Like many of you, we've obviously been watching very studiously what happens as some of these markets around the country reopen. And I think it's important to remember that our business is a delivery business but it's also a very robust carryout business. And so when markets closed down, and I've talked about this several times over the last year, it had a negative impact on our carryout business. So as we see markets reopen, we get some positive tailwind on the carryout business. 
And then also our -- for our delivery business, the fact that we've been able to stay very focused on value for our customers, we saw a positive comp in the second quarter on the delivery business as well, even though markets had reopened. So we'll keep tracking the 1- and 2-year basis, looking across both of those businesses. And as the year unfolds, on a quarterly basis, we'll continue to share those insights back with you."

You said that they're taking moderate amounts of pricing or there's a moderate amount of pricing in your -- maybe it's your company comps, maybe assume that's the franchise as well. Does that open the conversation about what the price point should be at Domino's, given this unique market environment? Should -- as you're sort of locked into these $5.99, $7.99 price points, is there more friction around that conversation, given the cost of labor? And if there is, how do you answer that question that the franchisees might ask about pricing?"

And this is certainly something that we think about all of the time. To the first part of your question, most certainly, when we look at the labor and the wage environment, wages are only going in one direction over time, and that is up. Some of that obviously is dictated by some of the minimum wage changes that are happening, another round of which occurred in -- here in July. But also just the general supply and demand equation in the labor market is causing wages to go up. And we're certainly continuing to invest more in our hourly team members, in our corporate store business to make sure that we can remain staffed and serve our customers. 
When we think about how do we offset those wage increases and still deliver a terrific 4-wall economic model, pricing is certainly one of the levers that is out there. And at the local level, we do this in our corporate stores. And our franchisees have -- they have the latitude to do this for their businesses. We have taken some increases in our single transparent delivery fee. We charge -- wherever we are, we charge a single fee. It varies significantly market-to-market based on the local dynamics. But that's certainly a lever that we and our franchisees have pulled. 
And then menu pricing, our franchisees have control of that. And in the higher wage markets, you will find higher menu prices at -- generally higher menu prices at Domino's. As it relates to the national offers, our $5.99 and $7.99 hero offers, we continue to test those on a very frequent basis, not just looking at which offers would drive the most top line, but more importantly, what's going to drive the strongest 4-wall EBITDA for our stores. And $5.99 and $7.99 have continued to emerge from the many, many offers that we test on a frequent basis. 
But what I'll tell you is if we find an offer or if the dynamics change such that a different offer drives higher levels of profit for our franchisees, then we would move to that offer. $5.99 and $7.99 are not sacred. The only thing that is sacred is that we're going to bring value to the consumer because that's what drives order counts. And ultimately, order counts, over time, are correlated with sales and with profitability at the store level. So something we are always looking at, John, and always talking to our franchisees about."

We are constantly testing a robust pipeline of new products and platforms for the menu. But we hold it to a pretty high standard in terms of what ultimately gets on our menu because we're not just looking to put things on the menu to drive sales for a limited amount of time. So that's -- you don't see us use LTOs and you shouldn't expect to see us using those into the future. 
What we are looking for are products that can drive incrementality in revenue and in profit. So we test products not only for where they would mix on the menu. But more importantly, once you take into effect the potential cannibalization from other menu items, are we delivering the incremental revenue and profit at the store level? 
You asked a little bit about premium and customers willing to pay more. When we introduced our 2 new specialty pizzas, the chicken taco and the cheeseburger, those were all about bringing some more premium products to that specialty line, which gives the franchisee an opportunity for some incremental revenue over and above our more traditional products that are offered on the $5.99 menu.
So we'll continue to look for opportunities there. And when we introduce something like those 2 specialty pizzas, it's not just to drive sales of those 2 pizzas. But we also see that, that elevates sales of the specialty line in general, which is a more premium line. 
So as we look forward, you should expect to see us continue to roll out new products. As has been in the past, you probably won't see us rolling them out as faster as significant quantity as some of the other players in the industry simply because we've just got a different strategy in terms of how we look at it. And I suspect it goes without saying, but a big part of that strategy is also just managing the level of change and complexity on our operators in our 6,000-plus stores across the country."

And it's something that we're always actively engaged in discussions with our franchisees and those relationships. And frankly, one of the best things about the second quarter for myself personally is that I've been out on the road a lot, out in stores and visiting with our franchisees as we've gotten ourselves vaccinated and are able to get out there and interact a lot more. 
And franchisees, I think, certainly pleased with the top line growth that we've seen in the business and the fact that we've seen the sustained levels of sales that we've had here in the first and second quarters of the year. You won't be surprised because -- to hear that franchisees are, just as we are, concerned about staffing, about labor rates and where those are going over time, thinking about commodity costs and where those are going, all the things that you would expect restaurant operators to be concerned about. 
But when we take a look at the business in total, the 4-wall economics of the business are still incredibly strong. The cost of entry or what it takes to get a Domino's Pizza opened relative to other QSRs, still very modest. So the cash-on-cash returns in the business are still very strong, and that's really what drives the appetite for development. So I still see a strong appetite for development. That's not just true in the U.S. business but it's around the globe. 
And really kind of tying back to some of the comments I made earlier on this call, the real gating factor right now in terms of getting stores open is not the desire to do so. It is some of those other factors around staffing and just having teams ready to be in those stores day 1 when they open, given some of the labor constraints. But also, we have seen some continued delays in construction and permitting. And then also just in some specific equipment categories that go into our stores, you probably won't be surprised to hear that there are still some significant supply chain disruptions out there. And some of those have hit some of the equipment that we use to build out a Domino's Pizza store."

First, Ritch, I mean could you address some of the senior-level turnover that you've seen? I mean it has been fairly chunky. I mean it kind of came in a wave more or less. And maybe some of the challenges but also opportunities that, that may bring as you kind of think about the Domino's over the next 5 to 10 years. So that's, I guess, is the first topic. It would be great to address. 
And then secondly, your app gives you a lot of data that, I mean, others would love to have. And some of that data may show customers that abandon their orders once they see a delivery time that has gotten to be quite long. Talk about how much of an issue that's become and if there is a way for you to think like how much sales you could actually recapture or, I guess in this case, actually grow if you were to get service levels materially down, which I assume would come through increased delivery driver staffing."

To address the first topic, we've had some turnover among the management team. But what I can tell you is that also creates opportunity for great leaders that we've had on the bench and who are ready to step up and take -- and really take things to the next level. So as I look across our team -- and that's not just the direct reports to myself. But also as I look broadly across our senior management team within the company, we've never been stronger than we are today. 
We, like I'm sure some others out there, we've still got a few positions that we still need to fill. But when I look across, I feel very good about the leadership team at Domino's Pizza. And I don't think we could deliver the kind of results that we've been delivering if we didn't have a great leadership team. 
The second -- the question around taking a look at service and what we're seeing there in the business. With the challenges that we've had in staffing, we haven't made the service gains and improvements that I would like to see here in 2021. And we've slipped a minute or 2 in some places with respect to the average times in terms of getting food to our customers. And that is a big area of focus for us as we look going forward. 
We know because we've got all the data, as you referenced, we know that when our mean delivery times get better and when our standard deviations around delivery times get tighter, we get more sales -- delivery sales per household for those customers that are in our delivery area. So there's clearly an opportunity to continue to grow delivery by driving those service times down. Some of that will come from getting our staffing levels back to where we need them to be. 
But also, I can tell you, we are spending a lot of time looking at how we can get more efficient in our stores, and frankly, how we can deliver those -- deliver better delivery times with the same or, in some cases, even fewer drivers. Some of that is examining all of the wasted time that we have. If we want to be as efficient as we can possibly be, then a driver should never get out of his or her car and should spend all of their time getting pizzas to customers. 
So we're trying to take some of those other things out some of those other tasks, some of those things that drive inefficiencies so that we can keep the drivers moving. That's better for the customer in terms of delivery times, but it's also a lot better for the drivers. If we can get more deliveries per driver per hour, that means more tips for those drivers. And we know that when they earn higher wages, the retention rates get better for us also. So we're working on all of those things, John, to try to continue to drive improvements in service because we know what the value of that is over time."

And if you take a look at where carryout is, the most important metric that we look at around it is what's -- where are we in terms of carryout orders per store? And basically, when we take a look at Q2, we were pretty well back to where we were in 2019 on carryout orders, slightly positive. A lot of benefit in ticket growth that we've seen in carryout, really driven by customers ordering more product per order. But we did see in the second quarter that we got back to the pre-COVID levels in terms of orders. 
In terms of the mix of our business, when you look at carryout orders versus delivery orders, we're still a little bit below where we were pre-COVID. And that's really driven by the fact that our delivery order counts on a 2-year basis are significantly higher than they were back in 2019. So what I would say is that we are in kind of the first phase of that carryout order count growth resurgence that we've been thinking about and forecasting for a while internally. 
Carside Delivery, for us, is something that was on -- it was on our work plan even before COVID hit because we were looking at Carside Delivery really as the way at Domino's to compete for that drive-through customer. Now when COVID hit, we kind of reshuffled our work plan and pulled all of that forward to get it rolled out more quickly because it also provides a safe and contactless experience for the customer, which became so important during COVID. 
But we look at Carside as a fantastic way to compete against the drive-through because while we've got pickup windows in a number of our stores out there, the reality is we're never going to get to 100% pickup windows in Domino's Pizza stores. And so we've got to have a way to get the product out to the customer.
I have been incredibly pleased with our franchisees and how they have embraced this. In particular, leading up to and now during our 2-minute guarantee that we're running on TV, we're averaging well below 2 minutes across our system of getting those pizzas out the door. And I don't know, David, if you've sat in a drive-through line recently, but I've sat at some QSRs for 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes. And if you can pull into our -- order ahead, pull into our parking lot and we can get that pizza in your car in 2 minutes, I think that's a great customer experience. 
And then for us, another fantastic benefit of Carside is the fact that these orders are -- they're preordered digitally and they're prepaid. So preordering digitally allows us to drive a higher ticket because we do a much better job of driving ticket for those digital orders because we've got all the technology built in there based on the A/B testing and everything else we do to give the customer a great experience and make sure they get in their basket the things that they would enjoy that even for dinner. 
And then on the prepayment, that's also great for us as well because it shortens the transaction time in the store and lets us get the customer out the door faster and using less labor. And the digital obviously also gives us an opportunity then to invite those customers into our loyalty program. So early stages of Carside but I'm really happy with the adoption across the system and what this could mean for us as we continue to compete for more occasions with our consumers."

I'm sure it's a bunch of things, but any thoughts around kind of what factors are most important for this? If it's that service level opportunity that you mentioned, if it's new menu items, value, boost weeks? Just curious how you -- what you're seeing and how you think about the opportunity."

Sure, Dennis. Happy to touch on that. As you take a look really over the course of the last year or so, the bulk of the growth in our business really has come from existing customers and that customer retention and purchase frequency and even more concentrated within our loyalty customer base, that 27-plus million active loyalty members that we have at Domino's. So I'm really pleased with what we've been able to do as the pandemic has unfolded in terms of driving customer retention, staying relevant and keeping those orders -- the order frequency up over time. 
When I look forward, I think we do have more opportunities to continue to prime the pump further around customer acquisition. Some of the most important tools that we've used historically to do that have been some of these periodic boost weeks that we've used. And we haven't run any of those for quite some time. So that's certainly an arrow in the quiver that we have going forward. 
Product introductions, certainly another opportunity to invite new customers in. And we do have some robust products in the pipeline. So you should expect to see some news from us on that in the quarters to come as another potential opportunity.
And then what I'd tell you also, just kind of underlying all this, it's not a specific action or a catalyst for driving customer acquisition. But I fundamentally believe that staying focused on value is perhaps our greatest customer acquisition vehicle over time because as you see prices being raised significantly at a number of other restaurant chains around the country and as we start to see some of this government stimulus come away as we go into the back half of this year, I think it's going to be really important for the families that we serve to stay focused on value. And I think that's always a consistent message from us and an opportunity to continue to bring new customers into the fold."

First, on the labor environment, we're absolutely working on technologies and operating procedures to help us run our stores more efficiently and with less labor. One of those I spoke about earlier as it relates to our delivery drivers, which is that we're trying to take a lot of things off of their plates that cause them to do anything other than being in a car delivering a pizza or on a bike delivering a pizza to a customer. 
So an example of that is -- that drove me crazy for years was pre-folding boxes, which was often a task that delivery drivers did. We've made enormous strides within our system and now have more than 2,000 of our stores in the U.S. that no longer pre-fold boxes. So that's taken work out of the store. And by the way, it also makes for a much cleaner and better-looking store as well. 
Other things that we've been working on. We've rolled out our GPS software out to our stores, and it's in the hands of our drivers on their smartphones. That allows drivers to get proficient much more quickly. In the old way at Domino's, a driver might take 2, 3 months to learn the delivery area. But with the GPS capability that we have, we can do a better job of routing and getting drivers to their -- to the location that they're headed to.
We're working on other things as well around how we schedule and staff the stores, using machine learning to really help us do a better job of predicting what our sales are going to be and therefore, more appropriately matching the number of team members at the store at the times when we need them. So a lot going on there. 
Your second around digital, yes, around 75% of sales. How high is high? I don't know but I know it's higher than 75%. The benchmark that we use in the Domino's world to kind of inspire everybody else is China, where more than 19 out of every 20 orders come in through digital channels. So that's really the inspiration for us. So I guess until we get close to 100, I'm not going to stop pushing."

First, on third party, I mean I don't think there's any question at this point that third-party delivery is here to stay.

First, on third party, I mean I don't think there's any question at this point that third-party delivery is here to stay. You can pretty well get any type of food delivered anywhere in the country and, frankly, now broadly just about across anywhere in the world today.
So we don't think that competition is going away. And in fact, in many ways, we look at that as our primary competitive set. As the leader in the pizza category, obviously, we still continue to look at the pizza competition. But frankly, the biggest competition over the long term for us in delivery is that third-party aggregator channel. 
So when I think about what we've got to do, so let's assume regardless of where their economics sit today, we believe they're going to be here for the long haul. So we have to continue to make sure that we are the best value both for the consumer and for the restaurant operator.
So we continue to believe that our owned fleet for us in our corporate stores and for our franchisees in their stores, having our own delivery drivers running point-to-point back and forth to the store, we continue to believe that's the most efficient operating model and gets even more efficient as we continue to fortress our markets. And so having that very efficient model is important in order to put us in a position to continue to offer a very competitive delivery fee and overall value proposition to the customer. 
We also believe that the fact that we use a single transparent delivery fee, we think, over time is an important competitive advantage. When I order third-party delivery, I have to really get my calculator out to figure out what I've actually paid to have that food delivered because maybe I got a discount on the delivery fee but maybe I paid a service fee. Maybe I paid a small order fee. Maybe I paid a fee because I happened to be in a city where they were charging an incremental city fee. We very much believe around a single transparent delivery fee over time, we think, will be important to customers. 
And then back on the other side of the equation, staying as the best value for the restaurant operator. We charge for a digital order. We charge our franchisees. It's just a little bit over 1% of ticket, that $0.275 digital order fee. That is so much lower than what you're going to see in terms of what the third parties are charging restaurants out there. So we think that gives us a competitive advantage in terms of continuing to make sure that we've got great 4-wall economics for our operators because that's the only way we grow the business over time, and they open more stores is if the 4-wall economics continue to be strong. 
So I think, Chris, we don't exactly know yet how all this ultimately shakes out and what -- all of the dynamics that may shift over time. But we're really focused on maintaining a competitive position with both of those groups, the customers and the restaurant operators."

And then your answer, if you could really touch on the influence of third-party delivery as competition. And I don't want to lead the witness too much, but I'm thinking that the restaurants and the third-party players themselves may be passing along particularly rapid menu price inflation lately, which is perhaps less accepted in the less affluent areas, and that third party may also be pulling back in service levels in these less profitable low-density markets.

Thank you. I think if we start with less affluent versus more affluent, I think certainly, to the extent that these third-party delivery fees get more complex and increase over time, that less affluent customer is absolutely going to feel more of a pinch on that. And I think it's -- and with a brand the size of Domino's, a big portion of the customers that we serve out there are -- these are not super wealthy folks and value's really, really important to them. And so I suspect that in many of these less affluent areas, we stack up very favorably in terms of the all-in value of having delivered food to serve to your family. 
Whereas in some of the more affluent areas, there may be less price sensitivity to some of these more significant delivery charges and/or if those consumers are ordering a higher overall ticket. If they're ordering $75 worth of food from a casual dining restaurant, then paying the fee is less a pinch on a relative basis. So we're still looking at this and seeing how it evolves. But I suspect that your hypothesis and ours there are reasonably well aligned. 
And then I think as it relates to the urban versus the rural, I do believe there that in those more rural environments, there's -- where there is less density, I think our -- the cost model around how we deliver probably shines even more in some of those places where we can keep drivers busy running point-to-point back and forth from our stores. 
So we're continuing to watch it and evolve it. There may be some other dynamics there, David, that we look at, such as some of just the migration of people out of some of the urban areas during COVID. And not all of those folks have returned yet back to the big cities or places where they previously lived. So still watching it. Trends are still evolving.

Throughout the Domino's system, we'll remain committed to serving our customers with outstanding food through safe and reliable delivery and carryout experiences. 
Now you've heard me say it many times, global retail sales growth is the engine that drives our business model. During the third quarter, we delivered 8.5% global retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, driven by a combination of store growth and same-store sales. That 8.5% result was lapping a 14.8% from the third quarter of 2020. The third quarter extended our unmatched streak of international same-store sales growth to 111 consecutive quarters. While our 41-quarter streak of positive same-store sales in the U.S. ended during the quarter, I'm pleased that we still grew our U.S. retail sales during the quarter while rolling over 21.3% retail sales growth in Q3 2020. 
During the quarter, we also accelerated our pace of global store growth. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, we have opened 1,124 net new stores. That's an increase of 500, relative to where we were in Q4 2020. Over the last 4 quarters, we've averaged just a touch above 3 net new stores every day. So overall, the Domino's brand continues to deliver. 
I'll turn the call over now to Jessica Parrish, our Controller and Treasurer. She will take you through the details of the quarter, and then I'll come back to share some additional thoughts about the business. Jessica, over to you."

We are pleased to share our third quarter results with you today. Overall, Domino's team members and franchisees around the world continue to generate healthy operating results, leading to a diluted EPS of $3.2",1541,"Thank you, Rich, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to share our third quarter results with you today. Overall, Domino's team members and franchisees around the world continue to generate healthy operating results, leading to a diluted EPS of $3.24 for Q3. In Q3, we sustained our positive momentum in both our U.S. and international businesses, resulting in year-over-year global retail sales growth. Global retail sales, excluding the positive impact of foreign currency, grew 8.5% in Q3 as compared to Q3 2020. Breaking down total global retail sales growth, U.S. retail sales grew 1.1%, rolling over a prior year increase of 21.3%. International retail sales, excluding the positive impact of foreign currency, grew 16.5%, rolling over a prior year increase of 8.5%. 
Turning to comps. During Q3, we continued our streak of 111 consecutive quarters of positive international comps. Same-store sales for our international business grew 8.8%, rolling over a prior year increase of 6.2%. The U.S. comp was negative in Q3, following 41 straight quarters of positive same-store sales growth. Same-store sales in the U.S. declined 1.9% in the quarter, rolling over a 17.5% increase in same-store sales in Q3 of 2020, the highest quarterly U.S. comp we have ever achieved since becoming a publicly-traded company in 2004. 
Breaking down the U.S. comp, our franchise business was down 1.5% in the quarter, while our company-owned stores were down 8.9%. We continue to observe a larger spread between the top line performance of our franchised stores and our company-owned stores than we've historically observed which we believe is a function of the heavily urban and higher-income footprint of our company-owned store markets relative to a more diverse mix across our franchise base. More aggressive fortressing in our company-owned store markets also contributed to the same-store sales gap between our corporate store and franchise store businesses. 
The decline in U.S. same-store sales this quarter was driven by lower order counts. Our U.S. order counts during Q3 were pressured by a very challenging staffing environment, which had certain operational impacts such as shortened store hours or customer service challenges in many of our stores. Additionally, since the onset of the pandemic, our comps had also benefited from significant economic stimulus activity in the U.S., the effects of which largely tapered off in the third quarter, which we believe pressured our order counts as compared to Q3 2020. 
Ticket growth partially offset the decline in order counts as we continue to see consumers order more items per transaction during Q3. The ticket comp also benefited from increases to our transparent delivery fee as well as the mix of products we sell. The international comp was primarily driven by order growth due to the return of nondelivery service methods across a number of international markets, as well as the resumption of normal store hours and the reopening of stores that were temporarily closed in certain of our international markets in Q3 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Shifting to unit count, we and our franchisees added 45 net stores in the U.S. during the third quarter, consisting of 46 store openings and only 1 closure. Our international business added 278 net stores comprised of 287 store openings and 9 closures. 
Turning to revenues and operating margins. Total revenues for the third quarter were up approximately $30.3 million or 3.1% over the prior year quarter. The increase was driven by higher retail sales, which generated higher international royalty, supply chain and U.S. franchise revenues. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted our international royalty revenues by $1.3 million in Q3. 
Our consolidated operating margin as a percentage of revenues increased to 38.6% in Q3 2021 from 37.4% in the prior year, due primarily to higher revenues from our global franchise businesses. Company-owned store margin as a percentage of revenues was flat year-over-year at 19.8%. As a percentage of revenues, food and occupancy costs were higher year-over-year, offset by lower labor costs. Recall that we incurred additional bonus pay in the third quarter of last year for frontline team members, and although we did make investments in frontline team member wage rates during Q3, we continue to experience staffing shortages in certain of our company-owned stores. 
Supply chain operating margin as a percentage of revenues increased to 10.7% from 10.2% in the prior year quarter. While the market basket increased 2.1% year-over-year, higher product and supplies expenses related to certain COVID-related safety and sanitizing equipment, negatively affected the supply chain operating margin in Q3 2020, which did not recur in the current quarter. This year-over-year decrease in product cost was partially offset by higher labor costs. 
G&A expenses increased approximately $4.7 million in Q3 as compared to Q3 2020, resulting from higher travel and labor costs, including higher noncash compensation expense, partially offset by lower professional fees. Net interest expense increased approximately $7.1 million in the quarter driven by a higher average debt balance due to our recent recapitalization transaction completed in Q2. Our weighted average borrowing rate for Q3 decreased to 3.8% from 3.9% in Q3 2020 due to lower interest rates on our outstanding debt as a result of this recapitalization transaction. 
Our effective tax rate was 10.7% for the quarter as compared to 19.9% in Q3 2020. The effective tax rate in Q3 2021 included a 10.4 percentage point positive impact from tax benefits on equity-based compensation. This compares to a 2.8 percentage point positive impact in Q3 2020. This increase was due to more stock option exercises in Q3 of this year. We expect to see continued volatility in our effective tax rate related to these tax benefits from equity-based compensation. 
Combining all of these elements, our third quarter net income was up $21.3 million or 21.5% versus Q3 2020. Our diluted EPS in Q3 was $3.24 versus $2.49 in the prior year quarter. Breaking down that $0.75 increase in our diluted EPS, most notably, our improved operating results benefited us by $0.36; our lower effective tax rate, primarily due to higher tax benefits on equity-based compensation, positively impacted us by $0.34; a lower diluted share count driven by share repurchases over the trailing 12 months benefited us by $0.19; and higher net interest expense negatively impacted us by $0.14. 
Shifting to cash. Our strong financial model continues to generate significant cash flows. During Q3, we generated net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $189 million. After deducting for CapEx, we generated free cash flow of approximately $172 million. Regarding our capital expenditures, we spent approximately $17 million on CapEx in Q3, primarily on our technology initiatives, including our next-generation point-of-sale system and our new supply chain center. Our strong free cash flow generation allowed us to continue our long-term commitment to returning cash to shareholders. 
As we discussed on the Q2 earnings call, we completed our $1 billion accelerated share repurchase transaction during Q3. Subsequent to the settlement of the ASR, during Q3, we repurchased and retired approximately 153,000 shares for $80 million or an average price of $521 per share. As of the end of Q3, we had approximately $920 million remaining under our current Board authorization for share repurchases. We have continued to repurchase and retire shares subsequent to the end of the quarter and through October 12, we had repurchased and retired an additional 205,000 shares for approximately $100 million or an average price of $488 per share. We also returned $35 million to our shareholders during Q3 in the form of a $0.94 per share quarterly dividend. 
Shifting gears, as we look toward our fourth quarter, we wanted to provide an update on our annual guidance measures for full year 2021 provided earlier this year. We previously provided guidance that our store food basket pricing in our U.S. system would increase approximately 2.5% to 3.5% over 2020 levels. We previously provided guidance that foreign currency could have a $4 million to $8 million positive impact on royalty revenues as compared to 2020. We previously provided guidance of $415 million to $425 million for G&A expense. 
Based on our current outlook, we expect each of these 3 measures to come in at the high end of these current estimates. We continue to expect that our full year CapEx investments will be approximately $100 million. Keep in mind that these metrics can change based on economic and other factors outside of our control. Our G&A expense is also affected by our own performance versus our plan, which affects variable performance-based compensation expense. These estimates also reflect our normal 16-week Q4, which will be rolling over the 17-week Q4 we had in 2020 due to the inclusion of a 53rd week in our fiscal year. Recall that the 53rd week last year contributed an incremental $0.39 to our EPS in Q4 2020 due to the additional week of revenue and the costs attributable to the 53rd week. This amount was adjusted as an item affecting comparability in our Q4 2020 earnings release. 
In closing, our business continued its solid performance during the third quarter and we are proud of the results our franchisees and team members around the world delivered. 
Thank you all for joining the call today. And now I will turn it back over to Rich."
3132512,1680743606,2406297,"Domino's Pizza, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 14, 2021",2021-10-14,"Earnings Calls","Domino's Pizza, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jessica. I'll begin my comments with a look at our U.S. business. Retail sales grew 1.1% in the third quarter, lapping a 21.3% increase from Q3 2020. Our 1.9% same-store sales decline during the quarter was offset by the positive impact of 232 net",1984,"Thanks, Jessica. I'll begin my comments with a look at our U.S. business. Retail sales grew 1.1% in the third quarter, lapping a 21.3% increase from Q3 2020. Our 1.9% same-store sales decline during the quarter was offset by the positive impact of 232 net new stores that we have opened over the trailing 4 quarters. Domino's trailing 4-quarter U.S. retail sales, excluding the impact of the 53rd week of 2020, were up 9.5%, a truly impressive achievement by our franchisees and operators, which shows the tremendous amount of growth in the brand across the U.S. 
Now let's take a few minutes to further break down the U.S. retail sales growth into its 2 components: store growth and same-store sales. Our 45 net new stores in Q3 was a sequential improvement over Q2, but still came in softer than we would like to see. While cash-on-cash returns remain very strong and we continue to see a robust pipeline of future openings, we and our franchisees had a number of store openings delayed due to a variety of factors. We and our franchisees saw delays in construction, equipment, utility hookups and inspections. In addition, franchisee staffing challenges also resulted in some delays. We remain very bullish on the unit growth potential in the U.S., but believe that we may continue to see some of these challenges in the months ahead. 
Now let's turn to same-store sales. As we continue to experience COVID overlaps, we believe it's instructive to look at the cumulative stack of comparable U.S. same-store sales anchored back to 2019 as a pre-COVID baseline, and we'll continue to do so for as long as we believe it is useful in understanding our business performance. At 15.6% for Q3, we saw a sequential decline of the 2-year stack when compared to the second quarter, bringing us back more in line with the 2-year stack we saw in Q1 of this year. 
So what changed from Q2 to Q3? Jessica highlighted several key drivers that I'll expand on here. we believe that government stimulus had an impact on our sales in Q2 that waned in the third quarter as we moved further away from the spring onetime payments and as other enhanced benefits tapered off. Second, we saw more pronounced staffing challenges across the country, resulting in reduced operating hours and service challenges in a number of stores across the network. We believe these challenges posed a more significant headwind on orders and sales during the third quarter than they did during the first half of this year. 
We and our franchisees are taking a number of actions to address the staffing issues. A new applicant tracking system rolled out a few weeks ago that will make it easier for candidates to apply for openings and to be onboarded at both corporate and franchise locations across our U.S. system. We're also sharing operational best practices to eliminate unnecessary time-consuming tasks in the operation of stores like pre-folding boxes, for example, that can drive both team member and customer satisfaction. In our corporate stores, we have recently implemented meaningful increases in team member compensation and are also piloting new approaches to team member onboarding, training and development. While I'm optimistic about the efforts that we and our franchisees have underway, we believe that staffing may remain a significant challenge in the near term as the labor market continues to evolve. 
Now I'll share a few thoughts specifically about the carryout and delivery businesses. We saw positive carryout same-store sales growth during Q3 as we continue to build awareness of Domino's Carside Delivery. We were on air for several months with a fun campaign highlighting our Carside Delivery 2-minute guarantee. This campaign hits on 2 key elements of the Domino's brand: service and value. I'm very pleased with our Carside Delivery performance, as our franchisees and operators have enthusiastically embraced this new service method. Our research shows it's also bringing in new customers. We have consistently averaged below 2 minutes out the door and on our way to the customers' cars. In fact, we have many stores across the country that are consistently below 1 minute. It's a great technology-enabled way to serve our customers and will remain an important part of our long-term strategy to serve our existing carryout customers and to attract new QSR drive-through-oriented customers going forward. 
I'm also excited to talk about our latest menu innovations. Just this past Monday, we went on air to launch 3 great new products to support our signature $7.99 carryout offer. We call them Dips & Twists and they hit the mark for great taste and consumer appeal with terrific economics for our franchisees. I'm excited about the impact these can have on sales and on store level profitability. I really hope you'll get out and try them. We have 1 sweet and 2 savory dip options in this new product line: baked apple, five cheese and my personal favorite, cheesy marinara. 
Turning to our delivery business, Q3 saw same-store sales decline relative to 2020 but delivery sales remained significantly above 2019 levels. During the quarter, we believe that the stimulus wind down and the staffing challenges that I referenced earlier had a disproportionate impact on our delivery business. Just a few weeks ago, we launched a new ad campaign to support the delivery business. It plays on a key attention that consumers have with third-party delivery apps, the surprised fees that are often charged for service, for small orders or simply because you live in a certain ZIP code. Consumers also tell us that they hate the fact that these charges are often confusing, hidden or buried in the receipt. Domino's and our franchisees never charge surprise fees. We charge one transparent delivery fee. 
So we decided to give our customers surprise, frees instead of surprise fees. Doing this campaign, 1 out of every 14 digital delivery orders receives a free item. That item could be a pizza, stuff cheesy bread, lava cakes, or any one of a number of other great items. Over the course of the campaign, Domino's and our franchisees will give away $50 million worth of surprise frees to delivery customers. Now this campaign supports 2 of our key brand attributes: value and transparency. 
I'll also share a few important milestones that occurred in the U.S. during the quarter. First, we broke ground just a few weeks ago on a new supply chain center in Indiana, which we expect to complete and open by the end of 2022. And second, we are now running a pilot version of our new PULSE point-of-sale system in a live store environment, and we will continue to invest in that multiyear project going forward. 
So as we look forward in the U.S. business, I remain optimistic about our ability to continue driving long-term growth. We'll manage through the staffing and other challenges in the short term. Frankly, that's what Domino's franchisees and operators do and have always done. And we'll continue to lead the brand with a clear focus on long-term profitable growth for our franchisees and DPZ. I'll end the U.S. discussion with a big thank you to our U.S. franchisees, our corporate store operators and our supply chain team members for their ongoing efforts to serve their customers, their team members and their communities. 
Now moving on to international. It was another outstanding quarter of performance for our international business. Our 16.5% international retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, was supported by a very strong 8.8% Comp. When you look at it on a trailing 4-quarter basis, excluding the impact of foreign currency and the 53rd week of 2020, Domino's international retail sales grew by 16.2%. As I discussed earlier with our U.S. business, we are also watching the 2-year comp stacks for international anchoring back to pre-COVID 2019. Q3 represented a 15% 2-year stack, which was very consistent with the second quarter. 
International store growth was a highlight during the quarter. Our international master franchisees opened 278 net new stores during the quarter, which increased the trailing 4-quarter pace to 892 stores for the international business. This and international store growth, combined with our U.S. store growth, has driven the global pace of store growth back into our 2- to 3-year outlook range of 6% to 8% global net unit growth. 
I was also very pleased to see that we had only 9 closures in international and only 10 closures on a global basis during the quarter. This low level of store closures is driven by 2 factors: first, our outstanding unit level economics; and second, and very importantly, the strong commitment of our franchisees across the globe. During the quarter, COVID continued to have a significant impact on many of our international markets, and we expect COVID to remain a challenge in many parts of the world for some time to come. At the end of the quarter, we estimate Domino's had fewer than 175 temporary store closures, with many of those located in India and New Zealand. I'll highlight a few of the international markets that contributed significantly to our growth during the quarter. 
We successfully converted 52 stores in Poland as Dominion Pizza rebranded to become part of the Domino's family. This provides important scale for us in Poland, fast-forwarding us to 119 total stores in the market at the end of the third quarter. We now have 24 international markets with 100 or more Domino's stores. We opened our 93rd international market during the quarter, officially welcoming Lithuania to the Domino's family. We're off to a great start there with the first store opening, and we have a second one coming very soon. 
India resumed an impressive pace of store growth by becoming the first Domino's market outside the U.S. to reach 1,400 stores. I could not be more proud of Jubilant, our master franchise partner, and the efforts they have made to fight through COVID, taking care of their people while still growing their business. 
Japan had another outstanding quarter, passing the 800-store milestone and continuing its impressive streak of growth., The transformation of the market by a master franchisee, Domino's Pizza Enterprises, has been remarkable. China delivered double-digit same-store sales growth, while continuing its strong pace of store growth. With each passing quarter, we become even more confident about the long-term growth potential for the Domino's brand in China. 
In addition to those markets, the U.K., Mexico, The Netherlands, Turkey and Colombia were additional large market highlights in a strong quarter of performance across our international business. And along with those markets, we also saw robust regional growth across the Middle East and Northern Africa during the quarter. 
I've long been convinced that we have the best international franchise partners in the restaurant business, and they certainly proved me right during the third quarter. As we look forward, we have so much opportunity ahead of us to continue driving long-term growth for Domino's outside the U.S. 
So in closing, I'm pleased with our third quarter results. Our outstanding franchisees and operators continue to battle through a challenging set of circumstances, while delivering strong growth for the Domino's brand around the world. These passionate Dominoids, combined with our outstanding unit level economics, position us incredibly well for the future. 
There is no doubt that we will continue to experience challenges with COVID, with staffing and other factors. We also expect inflationary headwinds to continue impacting Domino's and the broader restaurant industry over the coming quarters, but we will face all of these challenges and headwinds from a position of strength and with the unwavering commitment of our franchisees and team members who proudly wear the Domino's logo. My team and I are proud to serve them each and every day. 
So thank you again for joining us today, and we'll now be happy to take your questions."

Staffing has been a challenge, most certainly during the quarter as we highlighted. It's -- I don't have a lot to share with you today in terms of specific stats about what that headwind is on the comp, because it's always difficult to say what sales might have been without staffing challenges. 
But what I can tell you is that when you look at the third quarter relative to the first half of the year, we certainly saw more of an impact in the system around some things like reduced operating hours and some challenges with respect to delivery service times in particular. And when we look in our own corporate store business, we certainly stall our staffing levels relative to ideal were lower than we saw during the first half of the year. So the impact on the comp in the U.S. was more pronounced in the third quarter than it was in the second quarter. 
And as it relates to how we think about the business going forward, the staffing challenges do impact our ability to be more aggressive as it relates to promotional activities in the marketplace. So we're continuing, obviously, to monitor the levels across our system. In our corporate store business, we are doing things proactively, like looking at our wages, compensation for our team members. And as I spoke about earlier, working across the system, rolling out an applicant tracking system to help with team member acquisition and hiring. 
And then we're also working on a number of operational improvements inside of our stores to allow us to operate more efficiently, and frankly, with less labor for every order that goes out. And then finally, I'd just highlight the carryout business will continue to be a focus of ours, given the significantly lower amount of labor involved in those transactions and the fact that's been a big growth driver for us anyway. We're going to continue pushing there."

But drivers, in particular, have been challenging as we look over the last -- the third quarter.

And we always take -- when we do get it on a quarterly basis, we always like to see a few quarters of trend before we get really comfortable about what those external views of the market look like.

And in fact, only about 15% of customers would go back and forth between the 2. But it's an interesting question that I think opens up to your point, as we work our way out of COVID and as we and across the industry, continue to see some of these staffing challenges and labor cost increases, which do result in higher delivery fees. 
As Jessica highlighted earlier, we've seen some increase in our single transparent delivery fees across markets. And we've certainly seen prices go up as it relates to delivery charges or even what it takes you to go across town when you hail an Uber or a Lyft. So I think it is an open question as to how much more switching we might see when the cost of delivery continues to rise for consumers. So those are some of the things that we're obviously thinking about and testing here. 
We're also really pushing on this Carside Delivery as a service method to try to make things significantly more convenient for customers to pick up product, eliminating the need to go into the store and pay and carry your own food out, we think is a significant improvement in the consumer experience and may tip some more consumers over to come into the carryout channel as opposed to delivering."

Certainly, we understand labor, we understand the construction-related issues, but there was a comment made that fortressing is affecting company stores more than franchise stores. And if you look at -- excuse me, company store development is up something like 5% year-over-year, the comp is down, whatever it is, 8.9%. If one were to assume that half of that comp decline is due to fortressing, would basically mean that the new stores actually aren't -- are basically getting all their volume from nearby stores? I know that's -- it's very bad math to mention this on the conference call, but the numbers are -- could potentially look fairly exaggerated in terms of the amount of sales transfer that's happening to a new store that acts as a fortress store. 
So can you comment on just kind of what the current algorithm is in fortressing? I mean when you open new stores for both company and franchise, the percentage of sales that it expects to get on its own versus the percentage of sales that it expects to get elsewhere. And considering the labor and the construction environment that we've talked about, are you prepared to talk about how materially lower potentially fiscal '22 development in the U.S. could be relative to '21, which I think would be consistent with some comments that you made of units being delayed in the overall U.S. system."

There is still a very healthy demand out there among our franchisee base for unit development. I've highlighted some of the challenges in the near term of getting these stores open. But when we take a look at the profit of [ four-wall ] profitability at the store level and the resulting cash-on-cash returns for Domino's, which is ultimately what drives store growth, it's still very, very strong. 
And as we continue to dust off our models to take a look at what the U.S. holding capacity is for Domino's stores, we continue to be very bullish about that holding capacity. I've talked about 8,000 store potential in the past, and we believe it's at least that, if not more as we continue to dust it off. When we open new stores, a significant portion of those are fortress stores in that they do take some number of addresses from existing store service areas. When we take a look at the impact that, that has on the comp, I have spoken in the past about that being 1 point, 1.5 points or so. If you take a look at the third quarter, it was about 1 point when you look across the system and a bit higher than that on the corporate store side, because to your point, we have been a little bit more aggressive in terms of percentage opens off the base, but also basically every store we open in our corporate store business is a fortressed store. 
But when we take a look at what the cash-on-cash return expectations are for those openings. And we look at it not only on the individual new store, but we look at it on the impact of the store cluster that, that store is a part of, we still see very positive returns on those stores, and that's why we continue to be aggressive in the our corporate stores. So it's fortressing, you're going to continue to a key part of our strategy, John. And I haven't seen anything in the quarter that gives me any sense that we should be slowing down. There is still a lot of opportunity out there to continue opening Domino's stores around the country."

It varies pretty significantly market by market because of the labor markets around the country are so unique. And obviously, we've got direct visibility into the corporate store markets that we operate, but not direct visibility into all of our franchise locations, who obviously manage their own employment base. 
On tech, I made a brief reference to this earlier in my prepared remarks, but we've had a really exciting milestone over the course of the last several months where we now have our new version of PULSE operating on a continuous basis in a live store. So the team has just done a terrific job of developing that to the point where we've got the minimum viable product to have out in a store today that allows us to continue to test and learn. And our expectation is that we continue to expand the initial phase of that rollout with a few more stores this year. And then as we continue to learn and improve the product, we'll be able to come back to you in subsequent quarters to give you a little bit more of a sense of the pace of rollout of that product. 
But when we go in and have a look at how it's operating in stores, is easier to manage transactions inside the store and significantly easier to get new team members up to speed on the use of PULSE. And then as it relates to our ongoing development and evolution of the product, the architecture that we've used with PULSE is a -- is transformational for us in terms of our ability to respond more quickly and add enhancements and updates to the product versus the architecture that the current version of PULSE is on. So we're excited about it, and you'll hear a lot more about it from us in the future."

When you think about what has to happen in the labor market",587,"Yes, David, it's a great question, and I can tell you it's something we spend a lot of time on here each and every day and have a lot of conversations with our operators and franchisees about it. When you think about what has to happen in the labor market, for our industry, I think there are a couple of things that are under our control. And then there are a couple of things that are more macro factors. If I start with kind of with the macro factors, most certainly, there have been a significant number of Americans who have removed themselves from the workforce over the course of COVID and haven't come back yet. 
If you look at labor force participation rates, they are down rather significantly from pre-COVID. We have not seen it yet as much as we would like, but we do expect there to be some relaxing of the labor market as COVID continues to subside and as folks get more comfortable, have more options to care for their children, et cetera, to get back out into the workforce. I have no doubt that this Delta variant over the course of the last several months, has made that recovery more challenging. 
We have not had much in the way of immigration into the U.S. here over the course of the last couple of years. And in a country whose population is not growing as it used to, we, in our industry and a number of others, we'll need more immigration, I think, to continue to have a robust workforce, particularly in the younger age groups. So those are some macro things that we can't really control. What we spend our time thinking about is what we can control. 
Wages is one of those levers. I spoke earlier about the fact that we have made some significant moves in our own corporate store business, and we've done that in our supply chain business as well. And as we talk to franchisees, we don't control their employment practices or wages, but we hear from many franchisees that they are also investing in their team members. And frankly, with the profitability levels that we have in our stores, we are much better positioned than many players in the restaurant industry to be able to invest in our teams. 
But then also as an industry and as a company, we also have to think about the jobs themselves and how do we make those jobs easier and more appealing to team members, and we're spending a lot of time on that inside our business and piloting a number of exciting things in our corporate stores, where we're looking fundamentally at the jobs themselves. How do we make them easier? How do we keep drivers in their cars 100% of the time and not have them do task inside the stores that they don't enjoy doing and that don't drive tips for them? How do we bring more technology into the stores to allow us to operate more efficiently with fewer labor hours per unit of sales? 
So we're looking at all of these elements. And while it's a challenge, I feel like we're very well positioned with the profitability that we've got in our stores and also really well positioned just based on the innovation and technology teams that we've built over time, who -- this is power alley for them to go in and figure out how to solve these problems alongside our great operators."

And we're looking at that really in several areas of our business. At the store level, which we've spent most of the time talking about today, one of the key things that we're working on is in an environment where driver staffing is one of the constraints, key question is how do you keep drivers in their car more and how do you get more deliveries per hour through those drivers. 
We introduced some time ago, our GPS tools that are in the hands of drivers, that's a core technology that helps them to be more efficient. The technology underpinning of Domino's Carside Delivery, and the operational practices that we've instituted around that, are also key ways for us to think about driving more efficiency with our delivery drivers, because we can identify when a customer pulls into the parking lot and run a pizza out to that customer's car. There's no reason why, and we're doing it in a lot of stores around the country. No reason why we can't just run pizzas out to drivers' cars as well. 
And when I think about the Domino's I would like to see in the future, I don't see why drivers should ever have to get out of their cars. Why can't we keep them turning to the store back to the customer and maximizing deliveries per driver per hour, which also maximizes the wages that those drivers earn. So there are a number of different things going on there inside the stores, our next-generation version of our point-of-sale system, along with other store technology innovations are also helping us to get more productivity, to drive more productivity in the stores. 
And then lastly, outside of the stores, if I shift gears over to our supply chain centers, as we build these new centers and as we go back and replace assets in existing centers, we're putting in place equipment and technology that reduce the amount of labor that is required to produce our dough balls and to manage the distribution of product out to our stores as well."

And I think it really -- it plays on attention, a consumer attention. And that's one of the things we think about always when we think about great advertising at Domino's is how does it play on a consumer attention. And consumers tell us that they get increasingly irritated about all of these fees that they get charged. So we decided to do the flip side of that and do surprise frees. 
So far, we're pleased with the customer reception to the campaign. We're going to continue to run it in the weeks ahead and excited about how that can continue to position Domino's as the transparent and value-oriented player in the market. So we remain excited about it. Look forward to sharing results as we -- as the program continues to evolve and as we see how it behaves in the quarter, we'll look forward to talking to you about it in more depth when we report our fourth quarter results out.

Overall, I'm happy with our results this quarter, which, once again, demonstrated the powerful growth potential of the Domino's brand around the world. The third quarter presented significant challenges related to COVID and specifically the rise in the Delta variant. Across the U.S. and around the world, our system had to pivot yet again in response to the resulting changes in public health guidance and requirements. 
As this pandemic extends deep into its second year, I'm proud to say that our franchisees have continued to step up to meet the ongoing challenge in service of their customers, their communities and their team members. Throughout the Domino's system, we remain committed to serving our customers with outstanding food through safe and reliable delivery and carryout experiences. 
Now you've heard me say it many times, global retail sales growth is the engine that drives our business model. During the third quarter, we delivered 8.5% global retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, driven by a combination of store growth and same-store sales. That 8.5% result was lapping a 14.8% from the third quarter of 2020. 
The third quarter extended our unmatched streak of international same-store sales growth to 111 consecutive quarters. While a 41-quarter streak of positive same-store sales in the U.S. ended during the quarter, I'm pleased that we still grew our U.S. retail sales during the quarter while rolling over 21.3% retail sales growth in Q3 2020. 
During the quarter, we also accelerated our pace of global store growth. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, we have opened 1,124 net new stores. That's an increase of 500 relative to where we were in Q4 2020. Over the last 4 quarters, we've averaged just a touch above 3 net new stores every day. So overall, the Domino's brand continues to deliver. 
I'll turn the call over now to Jessica Parrish, our Controller and Treasurer. She will take you through the details of the quarter, and then I'll come back to share some additional thoughts about the business. Jessica, over to you."

We are pleased to share our third quarter results with you today. Overall, Domino's team members and franchisees around the world continued to generate healthy operating results, leading to a diluted EPS of $3.24 for Q3. 
In Q3, we sustained our positive momentum in both our U.S. and international businesses, resulting in year-over-year global retail sales growth. Global retail sales, excluding the positive impact of foreign currency, grew 8.5% in Q3 as compared to Q3 2020. 
Breaking down total global retail sales growth, U.S. retail sales grew 1.1%, rolling over a prior year increase of 21.3%. International retail sales, excluding the positive impact of foreign currency, grew 16.5%, rolling over a prior year increase of 8.5%. 
Turning to comps. During Q3, we continued our streak of 111 consecutive quarters of positive international comps. Same-store sales for our international business grew 8.8%, rolling over a prior year increase of 6.2%. The U.S. comp was negative in Q3, following 41 straight quarters of positive same-store sales growth. Same-store sales in the U.S. declined 1.9% in the quarter, rolling over a 17.5% increase in same-store sales in Q3 of 2020, the highest quarterly U.S. comp we have ever achieved since becoming a publicly traded company in 2004. 
Breaking down the U.S. comp, our franchise business was down 1.5% in the quarter, while our company-owned stores were down 8.9%. We continue to observe a larger spread between the top line performance of our franchised stores and our company-owned stores than we've historically observed which we believe is a function of the heavily urban and higher-income footprint of our company-owned store markets relative to a more diverse mix across our franchise base. More aggressive fortressing in our company-owned store markets also contributed to the same-store sales gap between our corporate store and franchised store businesses. 
The decline in U.S. same-store sales this quarter was driven by lower order counts. Our U.S. order counts during Q3 were pressured by a very challenging staffing environment, which had certain operational impacts, such as shortened store hours or customer service challenges in many of our stores. Additionally, since the onset of the pandemic, our comps had also benefited from significant economic stimulus activity in the U.S., the effects of which largely tapered off in the third quarter, which we believe pressured our order counts as compared to Q3 2020. 
Ticket growth partially offset the decline in order counts as we continued to see consumers order more items per transaction during Q3. The ticket comp also benefited from increases to our transparent delivery fee as well as the mix of products we sell. 
The international comp was primarily driven by order growth due to the return of nondelivery service methods across a number of international markets as well as the resumption of normal store hours and the reopening of stores that were temporarily closed in certain of our international markets in Q3 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Shifting to unit count. We and our franchisees added 45 net stores in the U.S. during the third quarter, consisting of 46 store openings and only 1 closure. Our international business added 278 net stores comprised of 287 store openings and 9 closures. 
Turning to revenues and operating margins. Total revenues for the third quarter were up approximately $30.3 million or 3.1% over the prior year quarter. The increase was driven by higher retail sales which generated higher international royalty, supply chain and U.S. franchise revenues. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted our international royalty revenues by $1.3 million in Q3. 
Our consolidated operating margin as a percentage of revenues increased to 38.6% in Q3 2021 from 37.4% in the prior year due primarily to higher revenues from our global franchise businesses. Company-owned store margin as a percentage of revenues was flat year-over-year at 19.8%. As a percentage of revenues, food and occupancy costs were higher year-over-year, offset by lower labor costs. Recall that we incurred additional bonus pay in the third quarter of last year for frontline team members. And although we did make investments in frontline team member wage rates during Q3, we continue to experience staffing shortages in certain of our company-owned stores. 
Supply chain operating margin as a percentage of revenues increased to 10.7% from 10.2% in the prior year quarter. While the market basket increased 2.1% year-over-year, higher product and supplies expenses related to certain COVID-related safety and sanitizing equipment negatively affected the supply chain operating margin in Q3 2020 which did not recur in the current quarter. This year-over-year decrease in product cost was partially offset by higher labor cost. 
G&A expenses increased approximately $4.7 million in Q3 as compared to Q3 2020, resulting from higher travel and labor cost, including higher noncash compensation expense, partially offset by lower professional fees. 
Net interest expense increased approximately $7.1 million in the quarter driven by a higher average debt balance due to our recent recapitalization transaction completed in Q2. 
Our weighted average borrowing rate for Q3 decreased to 3.8% from 3.9% in Q3 2020 due to lower interest rates on our outstanding debt as a result of this recapitalization transaction. 
Our effective tax rate was 10.7% for the quarter as compared to 19.9% in Q3 2020. The effective tax rate in Q3 2021 included a 10.4 percentage point positive impact from tax benefits on equity-based compensation. This compares to a 2.8 percentage point positive impact in Q3 2020. This increase was due to more stock option exercises in Q3 of this year. We expect to see continued volatility in our effective tax rate related to these tax benefits from equity-based compensation.
Combining all of these elements, our third quarter net income was up $21.3 million or 21.5% versus Q3 2020. 
Our diluted EPS in Q3 was $3.24 versus $2.49 in the prior year quarter. Breaking down that $0.75 increase in our diluted EPS, most notably, our improved operating results benefited us by $0.36; our lower effective tax rate, primarily due to higher tax benefits on equity-based compensation, positively impacted us by $0.34; a lower diluted share count driven by share repurchases over the trailing 12 months benefited us by $0.19; and higher net interest expense negatively impacted us by $0.14. 
Shifting to cash. Our strong financial model continues to generate significant cash flows. During Q3, we generated net cash provided by operating activities of approximately $189 million. After deducting for CapEx, we generated free cash flow of approximately $172 million. Regarding our capital expenditures, we spent approximately $17 million on CapEx in Q3, primarily on our technology initiatives, including our next-generation point-of-sale system and our new supply chain center. Our strong free cash flow generation allowed us to continue our long-term commitment to returning cash to shareholders.
As we discussed on the Q2 earnings call, we completed our $1 billion accelerated share repurchase transaction during Q3. Subsequent to the settlement of the ASR, during Q3, we repurchased and retired approximately 153,000 shares for $80 million or an average price of $521 per share. As of the end of Q3, we had approximately $920 million remaining under our current Board authorization for share repurchases. We have continued to repurchase and retire shares subsequent to the end of the quarter. And through October 12, we had repurchased and retired an additional 205,000 shares for approximately $100 million or an average price of $488 per share. We also returned $35 million to our shareholders during Q3 in the form of a $0.94 per share quarterly dividend.
Shifting gears, as we look toward our fourth quarter, we wanted to provide an update on our annual guidance measures for full year 2021 provided earlier this year. We previously provided guidance that our store food basket pricing in our U.S. system would increase approximately 2.5% to 3.5% over 2020 levels. We previously provided guidance that foreign currency could have a $4 million to $8 million positive impact on royalty revenues as compared to 2020. We previously provided guidance of $415 million to $425 million for G&A expense. Based on our current outlook, we expect each of these 3 measures to come in at the high end of these current estimates. We continue to expect that our full year CapEx investments will be approximately $100 million. 
Keep in mind that these metrics can change based on economic and other factors outside of our control. Our G&A expense is also affected by our own performance versus our plan, which affects variable performance-based compensation expense. These estimates also reflect our normal 16-week Q4 which will be rolling over the 17-week Q4 we had in 2020 due to the inclusion of a 53rd week in our fiscal year. Recall that the 53rd week last year contributed an incremental $0.39 to our EPS in Q4 2020 due to the additional week of revenues and the costs attributable to the 53rd week. This amount was adjusted as an item affecting comparability in our Q4 2020 earnings release.
In closing, our business continued its solid performance during the third quarter, and we are proud of the results our franchisees and team members around the world delivered. 
Thank you all for joining the call today, and now I will turn it back over to Rich."

I'll begin my comments with a look at our U.S. business. Retail sales grew 1.1% in the third quarter, lapping a 21.3% increase from Q3 2020. Our 1.9% same-store sales decline during the quarter was offset by the positive impact of 232 net",1982,"Thanks, Jessica. I'll begin my comments with a look at our U.S. business. Retail sales grew 1.1% in the third quarter, lapping a 21.3% increase from Q3 2020. Our 1.9% same-store sales decline during the quarter was offset by the positive impact of 232 net new stores that we have opened over the trailing 4 quarters. Domino's trailing 4-quarter U.S. retail sales, excluding the impact of the 53rd week of 2020, were up 9.5%, a truly impressive achievement by our franchisees and operators which shows the tremendous amount of growth in the brand across the U.S.
Now let's take a few minutes to further break down the U.S. retail sales growth into its 2 components: store growth and same-store sales. Our 45 net new stores in Q3 was a sequential improvement over Q2 but still came in softer than we would like to see. While cash-on-cash returns remained very strong and we continue to see a robust pipeline of future openings, we and our franchisees had a number of store openings delayed due to a variety of factors. We and our franchisees saw delays in construction, equipment, utility hook-ups and inspections. In addition, franchisee staffing challenges also resulted in some delays. We remain very bullish on the unit growth potential in the U.S. but believe that we may continue to see some of these challenges in the months ahead.
Now let's turn to same-store sales. As we continue to experience COVID overlaps, we believe it's instructive to look at the cumulative stack of comparable U.S. same-store sales anchored back to 2019 as a pre-COVID baseline, and we'll continue to do so for as long as we believe it is useful in understanding our business performance. At 15.6% for Q3, we saw a sequential decline of the 2-year stack when compared to the second quarter, bringing us back more in line with the 2-year stack we saw in Q1 of this year.
So what changed from Q2 to Q3? Jessica highlighted several key drivers that I'll expand on here. First, we believe that government stimulus had an impact on our sales in Q2 that waned in the third quarter as we moved further away from the spring onetime payments and as other enhanced benefits tapered off. Second, we saw more pronounced staffing challenges across the country, resulting in reduced operating hours and service challenges in a number of stores across the network. We believe these challenges posed a more significant headwind on orders and sales during the third quarter than they did during the first half of this year.
We and our franchisees are taking a number of actions to address the staffing issues. A new applicant tracking system rolled out a few weeks ago that will make it easier for candidates to apply for openings and to be onboarded at both corporate and franchise locations across our U.S. system. We are also sharing operational best practices to eliminate unnecessary time-consuming tasks in the operation of stores, like pre-folding boxes, for example, that can drive both team member and customer satisfaction. In our corporate stores, we have recently implemented meaningful increases in team member compensation and are also piloting new approaches to team member onboarding, training and development. While I'm optimistic about the efforts that we and our franchisees have underway, we believe that staffing may remain a significant challenge in the near term as the labor market continues to evolve.
Now I'll share a few thoughts specifically about the carryout and delivery businesses. We saw positive carryout same-store sales growth during Q3 as we continue to build awareness of Domino's Carside Delivery. We were on air for several months with a fun campaign highlighting our Carside Delivery 2-minute guarantee. This campaign hits on 2 key elements of the Domino's brand: service and value. I'm very pleased with our Carside Delivery performance as our franchisees and operators have enthusiastically embraced this new service method. Our research shows it's also bringing in new customers. We have consistently averaged below 2 minutes out the door and on our way to the customers' cars. In fact, we have many stores across the country that are consistently below 1 minute. It's a great technology-enabled way to serve our customers and will remain an important part of our long-term strategy to serve our existing carryout customers and to attract new QSR drive-through-oriented customers going forward.
I'm also excited to talk about our latest menu innovations. Just this past Monday, we went on air to launch 3 great new products to support our signature $7.99 carryout offer. We call them Dips & Twists, and they hit the mark for great taste and consumer appeal with terrific economics for our franchisees. I'm excited about the impact these can have on sales and on store-level profitability. I really hope you'll get out and try them. We have 1 sweet and 2 savory dip options in this new product line: baked apple, five cheese, and my personal favorite, cheesy marinara.
Turning to our delivery business, Q3 saw same-store sales decline relative to 2020, but delivery sales remained significantly above 2019 levels. During the quarter, we believe that the stimulus wind-down and the staffing challenges that I referenced earlier had a disproportionate impact on our delivery business. 
Just a few weeks ago, we launched a new ad campaign to support the delivery business. It plays on a key tension that consumers have with third-party delivery apps: the surprise fees that are often charged for service, for small orders or simply because you live in a certain ZIP code. Consumers also tell us that they hate the fact that these charges are often confusing, hidden or buried in the receipt. Domino's and our franchisees never charge surprise fees. We charge one transparent delivery fee. So we decided to give our customers surprise: frees instead of surprise fees. Doing this campaign, 1 out of every 14 digital delivery orders receives a free item. That item could be a pizza, stuffed cheesy bread, lava cakes,or any one of a number of other great items. Over the course of the campaign, Domino's and our franchisees will give away $50 million worth of surprise frees to delivery customers. Now this campaign supports 2 of our key brand attributes: value and transparency.
I'll also share a few important milestones that occurred in the U.S. during the quarter. First, we broke ground just a few weeks ago on a new supply chain center in Indiana, which we expect to complete and open by the end of 2022. And second, we are now running a pilot version of our new PULSE point-of-sale system in a live store environment, and we will continue to invest in that multiyear project going forward.
So as we look forward in the U.S. business, I remain optimistic about our ability to continue driving long-term growth. We'll manage through the staffing and other challenges in the short term. Frankly, that's what Domino's franchisees and operators do and have always done. And we'll continue to lead the brand with a clear focus on long-term profitable growth for our franchisees and DPZ. I'll end the U.S. discussion with a big thank you to our U.S. franchisees, our corporate store operators and our supply chain team members for their ongoing efforts to serve their customers, their team members and their communities. 
Now moving on to international. It was another outstanding quarter of performance for our international business. Our 16.5% international retail sales growth, excluding foreign currency impact, was supported by a very strong 8.8% comp. When you look at it on a trailing 4-quarter basis, excluding the impact of foreign currency and the 53rd week of 2020, Domino's international retail sales grew by 16.2%. As I discussed earlier with our U.S. business, we are also watching the 2-year comp stacks for international anchoring back to pre-COVID 2019. Q3 represented a 15% 2-year stack, which was very consistent with the second quarter.
International store growth was a highlight during the quarter. Our international master franchisees opened 278 net new stores during the quarter, which increased the trailing 4-quarter pace to 892 stores for the international business. This acceleration in international store growth, combined with our U.S. store growth, has driven the global pace of store growth back into our 2- to 3-year outlook range of 6% to 8% global net unit growth.
I was also very pleased to see that we had only 9 closures in international and only 10 closures on a global basis during the quarter. This low level of store closures is driven by 2 factors: first, our outstanding unit-level economics; and second, and very importantly, the strong commitment of our franchisees across the globe. 
During the quarter, COVID continued to have a significant impact on many of our international markets, and we expect COVID to remain a challenge in many parts of the world for some time to come. At the end of the quarter, we estimate Domino's had fewer than 175 temporary store closures with many of those located in India and New Zealand. I'll highlight a few of the international markets that contributed significantly to our growth during the quarter.
We successfully converted 52 stores in Poland as Dominium Pizza rebranded to become part of the Domino's family. This provides important scale for us in Poland, fast-forwarding us to 119 total stores in the market at the end of the third quarter. We now have 24 international markets with 100 or more Domino's stores. 
We opened our 93rd international market during the quarter, officially welcoming Lithuania to the Domino's family. We're off to a great start there with the first store opening, and we have a second one coming very soon.
India resumed an impressive pace of store growth by becoming the first Domino's market outside the U.S. to reach 1,400 stores. I could not be more proud of Jubilant, our master franchise partner, and the efforts they have made to fight through COVID, taking care of their people while still growing their business.
Japan had another outstanding quarter, passing the 800-store milestone and continuing its impressive streak of growth. The transformation of the market by a master franchisee, Domino's Pizza Enterprises, has been remarkable. 
China delivered double-digit same-store sales growth while continuing its strong pace of store growth. With each passing quarter, we become even more confident about the long-term growth potential for the Domino's brand in China.
In addition to those markets, the U.K., Mexico, The Netherlands, Turkey and Colombia were additional large market highlights and a strong quarter of performance across our international business. And along with those markets, we also saw robust regional growth across the Middle East and Northern Africa during the quarter.
I've long been convinced that we have the best international franchise partners in the restaurant business, and they certainly proved me right during the third quarter. As we look forward, we have so much opportunity ahead of us to continue driving long-term growth for Domino's outside the U.S.
So in closing, I'm pleased with our third quarter results. Our outstanding franchisees and operators continued to battle through a challenging set of circumstances while delivering strong growth for the Domino's brand around the world. These passionate Dominoids, combined with our outstanding unit-level economics, position us incredibly well for the future.
There is no doubt that we will continue to experience challenges with COVID, with staffing and other factors. We also expect inflationary headwinds to continue impacting Domino's and the broader restaurant industry over the coming quarters, but we will face all of these challenges and headwinds from a position of strength and with the unwavering commitment of our franchisees and team members who proudly wear the Domino's logo. My team and I are proud to serve them each and every day.
So thank you again for joining us today, and we'll now be happy to take your questions."

Staffing has been a challenge, most certainly during the quarter, as we highlighted. It's -- I don't have a lot to share with you today in terms of specific stats about what that headwind is on the comp because it's always difficult to say what sales might have been without staffing challenges.
But what I can tell you is that when you look at the third quarter relative to the first half of the year, we certainly saw more of an impact in the system around some things like reduced operating hours and some challenges with respect to delivery service times in particular. 
And when we look in our own corporate store business, we certainly saw our staffing levels, relative to ideal, were lower than we saw during the first half of the year. So the impact on the comp in the U.S. was more pronounced in the third quarter than it was in the second quarter. 
And as it relates to how we think about the business going forward, the staffing challenges do impact our ability to be more aggressive as it relates to promotional activities in the marketplace. So we're continuing, obviously, to monitor the levels across our system. In our corporate store business, we are doing things proactively, like looking at our wages, compensation for our team members, and as I spoke about earlier, working across the system, rolling out an applicant tracking system to help with team member acquisition and hiring. And then we're also working on a number of operational improvements inside of our stores to allow us to operate more efficiently, and frankly, with less labor for every order that goes out.

In terms of how that's impacting independents, I don't have great statistics for you about what's going on with closures there, but I can tell you that I think the impact of staffing and rising labor costs and also, frankly, rising commodity costs, where independents are typically less able to buy -- are less able to buy with the scale and also to lock in pricing as the larger players, like we are, I suspect that there is a lot of pressure on the P&L among some of the independents and smaller regionals out there."

And in fact, only about 15% of customers would go back and forth between the 2. But it's an interesting question that I think opens up to your point as we work our way out of COVID and as we and across the industry continue to see some of these staffing challenges and labor cost increases which do result in higher delivery fees.
As Jessica highlighted earlier, we've seen some increase in our single transparent delivery fees across markets. And we've certainly seen prices go up as it relates to delivery charges or even what it takes you to go across town when you hail an Uber or a Lyft. So I think it is an open question as to how much more switching we might see when the cost of delivery continues to rise for consumers. So those are some of the things that we're obviously thinking about and testing here.
We're also really pushing on this Carside Delivery as a service method to try to make things significantly more convenient for customers to pick up product. Eliminating the need to go into the store and pay and carry your own food out, we think is a significant improvement in the consumer experience and may tip some more consumers over to come into the carryout channel as opposed to delivery."

We understand the construction-related issues, but there was a comment made that fortressing is affecting company stores more than franchise stores. And if you look at -- excuse me, company store development is up something like 5% year-over-year. The comp is down whatever it is, 8.9%. If one were to assume that half of that comp decline is due to fortressing, would basically mean that the new stores actually aren't -- are basically getting all their volume from nearby stores? I know that's -- it's very bad math to mention this on a conference call, but the numbers are -- could potentially look fairly exaggerated in terms of the amount of sales transfer that's happening to a new store that acts as a fortress store.
So can you comment on just kind of what the current algorithm is in fortressing, I mean, when you open new stores for both company and franchise, the percentage of sales that it expects to get on its own versus the percentage of sales that it expects to get elsewhere. And considering the labor and the construction environment that we've talked about, are you prepared to talk about how materially lower potentially fiscal '22 development in the U.S. could be relative to '21, which I think would be consistent with some comments that you made of units being delayed in the overall U.S. system."

There is still a very healthy demand out there among our franchisee base for unit development. I've highlighted some of the challenges in the near term of getting these stores open. But when we take a look at the profit of the 4-wall profitability at the store level and the resulting cash-on-cash returns for Domino's, which is ultimately what drives store growth, it's still very, very strong.
And as we continue to dust off our models to take a look at what the U.S. holding capacity is for Domino's stores, we continue to be very bullish about that holding capacity. I've talked about 8,000 store potential in the past, and we believe it's at least that, if not more, as we continue to dust it off. 
When we open new stores, a significant portion of those are fortress stores in that they do take some number of addresses from existing store service areas. When we take a look at the impact that, that has on the comp, I have spoken in the past about that being 1 point, 1.5 points or so. If you take a look at the third quarter, it was about 1 point when you look across the system and a bit higher than that on the corporate store side because, to your point, we have been a little bit more aggressive in terms of percentage opens off the base, but also basically every store we open in our corporate store business is a fortress store. 
But when we take a look at what the cash-on-cash return expectations are for those openings and we look at it, not only on the individual new store, but we look at it on the impact of the store cluster that, that store is a part of, we still see very positive returns on those stores, and that's why we continue to be aggressive in the growth of our corporate stores. 
So it -- fortressing is going to continue to be a key part of our strategy, John, and I haven't seen anything in the quarter that gives me any sense that we should be slowing down. There is still a lot of opportunity out there to continue opening Domino's stores around the country."

It varies pretty significantly market by market because the labor markets around the country are so unique. And obviously, we've got direct visibility into the corporate store markets that we operate but not direct visibility into all of our franchise locations who obviously manage their own employment base. 
On tech, I made brief reference to this earlier in my prepared remarks, but we've had a really exciting milestone over the course of the last several months where we now have our new version of PULSE operating on a continuous basis in a live store. So the team has just done a terrific job of developing that to the point where we've got the minimum viable product to have out in a store today that allows us to continue to test and learn. And our expectation is that we continue to expand the initial phase of that rollout with a few more stores this year. And then as we continue to learn and improve the product, we'll be able to come back to you in subsequent quarters and give you a little bit more of a sense of the pace of rollout of that product. 
But when we go in and have a look at how it's operating in the stores, it is easier to manage transactions inside the store and significantly easier to get new team members up to speed on the use of PULSE. 
And then as it relates to our ongoing development and evolution of the product, the architecture that we've used with PULSE is a -- is transformational for us in terms of our ability to respond more quickly and add enhancements and updates to the product versus the architecture that the current version of PULSE is on. So we're excited about it, and you'll hear a lot more about it from us in the future."

It's a great question, and I can tell you it's something we spend a lot of time on around here each and every day and have a lot of conversations with our operators and franchisees about it. When you think about what has to happen in the labor market,for our industry, I think there are a couple of things that are under our control, and then there are a couple of things that are more macro factors. If I start with kind of -- with the macro factors, most certainly, there have been a significant number of Americans who have removed themselves from the workforce over the course of COVID and haven't come back yet. If you look at labor force participation rates, they are down rather significantly from pre-COVID. 
We have not seen it yet, as much as we would like, but we do expect there to be some relaxing of the labor market as COVID continues to subside and as folks get more comfortable, have more options to care for their children, et cetera, to get back out into the workforce. I have no doubt that this Delta variant, over the course of the last several months, has made that recovery more challenging. 
We also have not had much in the way of immigration into the U.S. here over the course of the last couple of years. And in a country whose population is not growing as it used to, we, in our industry and a number of others, will need more immigration, I think, to continue to have a robust workforce, particularly in the younger age groups. 
So those are some macro things that we can't really control. What we spend our time thinking about is what we can control. Wages is one of those levers. I spoke earlier about the fact that we have made some significant moves in our own corporate store business, and we've done that in our supply chain business as well. And as we talk to franchisees, we don't control their employment practices or wages, but we hear from many franchisees that they are also investing in their team members. And frankly, with the profitability levels that we have in our stores, we are much better positioned than many players in the restaurant industry to be able to invest in our teams. 
But then also, as an industry and as a company, we also have to think about the jobs themselves and how do we make those jobs easier and more appealing to team members. And we're spending a lot of time on that inside our business and piloting a number of exciting things in our corporate stores where we're looking fundamentally at the jobs themselves. How do we make them easier? How do we keep drivers in their cars 100% of the time and not have them do tasks inside the stores that they don't enjoy doing and that don't drive tips for them? How do we bring more technology into the stores to allow us to operate more efficiently with fewer labor hours per unit of sales?
So we're looking at all of these elements. And while it's a challenge, I feel like we're very well positioned with the profitability that we've got in our stores and also really well positioned, just based on the innovation and technology teams that we've built over time, who -- this is power alley for them to go in and figure out how to solve these problems alongside our great operators."

We saw a boost back in the second quarter when the $1,400 stimulus payments went out.

And I think what we saw was, as consumers spent off that $1,400 and as some of those unemployment benefits waned, the impact was really more pronounced, we believe, on our delivery business than it was on the carryout business. So I think we had more customers with money in their pockets also worried about COVID, and more of those were ordering delivery into their homes, and we saw that taper off in the third quarter relative to what we saw in the second quarter."

More broadly, it feels like some structural headwinds, increased competition from 3P platforms, people have left the industry and then just higher manual labor costs. A follow-up to your response to David's question, can you expand on the technology you're exploring to address labor headwinds over the medium to long term like automation perhaps more so than you would have considered, call it, 6 to 12 months ago?"

And we're looking at that really in several areas of our business. At the store level, which we've spent most of the time talking about today, one of the key things that we're working on is in an environment where driver staffing is one of the constraints, key question is how do you keep drivers in their car more? And how do you get more deliveries per hour through those drivers?
We introduced some time ago our GPS tools that are in the hands of drivers. That's a core technology that helps them to be more efficient. The technology underpinning of Domino's Carside Delivery and the operational practices that we've instituted around that are also key ways for us to think about driving more efficiency with our delivery drivers. Because if we can identify when a customer pulls into the parking lot and run a pizza out to that customer's car, there's no reason why -- and we're doing it in a lot of stores around the country, no reason why we can't just run pizzas out to drivers' cars as well. 
And when I think about the Domino's I would like to see in the future, I don't see why drivers should ever have to get out of their cars. Why can't we keep them turning to the store, back to the customer and maximizing deliveries per driver per hour which also maximizes the wages that those drivers earn? So there are a number of different things going on there inside the stores. Our next-generation version of our point-of-sale system, along with other store technology innovations, are also helping us to get more productivity, to drive more productivity in the stores. 
And then lastly, outside of the stores, if I shift gears over to our supply chain centers, as we build these new centers and as we go back and replace assets in existing centers, we're putting in place equipment and technology that reduce the amount of labor that is required to produce our dough balls and to manage the distribution of product out to our stores as well."

And I think it really -- it plays on a tension, a consumer tension. And that's one of the things we think about always when we think about great advertising at Domino's is how does it play on a consumer tension. And consumers tell us that they get increasingly irritated about all of these fees that they get charged, so we've decided to do the flip side of that and do surprise frees.
So far, we're pleased with the customer reception to the campaign. We're going to continue to run it in the weeks ahead and excited about how that can continue to position Domino's as the transparent and value-oriented player in the market. So we remain excited about it. Look forward to sharing results as we -- as the program continues to evolve. And as we see how it behaves in the quarter, we look forward to talking to you about it in more depth when we report our fourth quarter results out. 
All right, folks. Well, thank you so much for joining us on the call this morning, and I look forward to getting back together with you in February to discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results."
