The impact from the global pandemic created both unprecedented challenges and opportunities. The demand for our products was unparalleled. The challenges to keep up with that demand while remaining safe were extraordinary, but we found innovative ways to get things done and deliver amazing results. I could not be prouder of our employees and all their accomplishments as they proved once again why the POOLCORP team is simply the best. 
Despite uncertain times brought on by COVID, thousands of families affirmed that only a pool, a patio or an outdoor kitchen is a wonderful way to enjoy the great outdoors in a safe, family-friendly environment. This heightened interest in enjoying existing pools and outdoor living spaces, combined with the insatiable demand for new pools, created an amazing opportunity for our industry. 
In 2020, our total sales came in at $3.9 billion, a 23% increase over 2019. In the fourth quarter, we saw sales grow an amazing 44%, capping off a phenomenal year by any measure. From a base business perspective, our sales grew 39% in the quarter and 22% on a year-to-date basis. Demand in virtually all of our geographies remained strong with particular strength noted in our seasonal markets. 
For context, as I recap the quarter and the year, I think it may be helpful to remind you of how 2020 played out. The year started out strong with revenues up 13% in the first quarter before any real impact of COVID could be felt. The second quarter which started off with sharp declines as COVID-related shutdowns took effect quickly rebounded, and we finished up 14%. In the third quarter, the business fueled by high demand and strong execution, continued to accelerate and ended up with sales up 27%. And as we reported, the fourth quarter was even better, up 44%. 
2020 was also a busy year for us on the acquisition front as we completed 4 acquisitions: 3 on the blue side of the business and 1 for Horizon. Master Tile, Northeast Transforming Pool Distributors, Jet Line products and our newest addition, TWC Distributors, all joined the POOLCORP family and are integrating well. 
Now let me provide a little more color on how the business performed in our 4 largest markets for the quarter and for the year. As you can imagine, all benefited from strong demand and favorable weather conditions. Florida saw revenue in the quarter up 25%, bringing the year-to-date growth of 16%. Arizona posted a 36% gain in the quarter and 23% for the year, while Texas revenues grew by 47% in the quarter and 23% for the year. 
California, still the largest market in the country and the last to recover from the shutdowns, grew by 26% in the quarter and 13% for the year. Overall, our year-round markets were up by 32% for the quarter and 18% for the year, while seasonal markets were up 50% in the quarter and 27% for the year. All markets benefited from strong pool construction trends, which we believe grew about 25% for the year from approximately 80,000 new pools in 2019 to approximately 100,000 new pools in 2020. Considering the slow start to the year, this was a big step forward for the industry in 2020 as milder weather late in the year enabled builders to make up for lost time. 
Looking at our end markets. Our commercial pool category was down 8% for the quarter and 10% for the year, comprising 4% of total sales for the company. Continued softness in the public pool and travel industry is behind the slowdown, and we don't see that recovering in 2021. There are some projects starting to bid, but the lack of travel is likely to continue to weigh heavily on this market. 
Retail sales, on the other hand, were up 34% in the quarter and 24% for the year. A larger installed base, more in-season pool usage and consumers trying to stretch the season all increased demand for pool supplies and maintenance products. Retail-sized chemicals, automatic, pool cleaners and above-ground pools and spas all had strong growth. 
At the key product level, the story is much the same. Demand is strong. Equipment sales, which includes pumps, filters, heaters and lights, were up 51% in the quarter and 31% for the year. Due to significant construction backlogs and favorable weather conditions, most of our dealers kept building and remodeling, which helped drive the strong increase in equipment sales. 
Chemical sales in the fourth quarter were up 16% and 10% for the year. As I mentioned, demand for consumer-sized chemicals was very strong throughout the quarter and the year but commercial -- but pool -- commercial pool chemical demand declined with the COVID-driven diminished use. 
For the upcoming 2021 season, I'd expect the supplies to be tight but manageable for most chemical products with TriCore, a very popular pool-sanitizing product being a notable exception. In this case, the industry lost significant production when a major plant was destroyed by a fire in August, which accounted for approximately 40% of the industry's capacity of this product. I'd expect to see the supply of TriCore be very tight, and price is elevated depending on how much additional capacity comes online and how much import product can be sourced to supplement the constrained supply. Certainly, weather will play a role in determining how the supply and demand balance works out for chemicals. 
Building material sales is a great indicator of the health of the construction and remodel segment are strong. In the fourth quarter, we saw sales grow by 42%, bringing the year-to-date 2020 sales increase to 23%. We are quite happy with this result given, as I said earlier, the uncertain and delayed start to the construction season in many of our seasonal and some of our year-round markets. 
When you look at the results of our business across the category, it's evident that we took significant share in 2020. The contributions from our seasoned and customer-focused teams utilizing unique tools and resources available to us allowed us to adapt and thrive in the COVID environment better than anyone in the industry. 
Turning to Europe. This is a continuation of the same strong story that we discussed during our third quarter update. Europe had a very robust quarter once again and grew revenues by 48% in the quarter and 24% for the year. Continued strong demand, favorable weather and excellent execution all contributed to a great year for Europe as well. What makes this result even more impressive is that Europe felt the impact of the virus sooner and experienced more pervasive shutdowns and restrictions than most of the North American markets. 
Now I'd like to switch gears and provide some commentary on our green business, Horizon. We're pleased to see this business continue to gain momentum and grow. For the quarter, Horizon-based business was up 13% and 9% for the year. Strong demand for residential construction and outdoor living fueled by growth in the year-round markets that we serve. Additionally, in December, we completed the acquisition of TWC Distributors with 10 locations in the strategically important market of Central and Southwest Florida. We continue to invest and improve in Horizon and remain very optimistic about the future growth opportunities in the green business. 
Moving to gross margins. We saw our overall gross margin increase to 28.5% in the quarter, a 70 basis point increase from the same period last year. For the full year, we finished at 28.7%, down 20 bps when compared to full year 2019. Despite decline on a year-to-date basis was primarily driven by stronger big-ticket, lower-margin product sales, as we discussed in prior quarters. 
Turning to operating expenses. We are very proud of our performance in this area as we saw operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved by over 300 basis points for the total business and over 400 basis points for our base business in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, we improved by 130 basis points in the total business and 150 basis points in the base business. Contributing to our success was continued strong growth in sales through our POOL360 B2B tool, which became especially useful for customers with the onset of COVID and restricted access to our sales centers for order processing. For the year, we saw POOL360 sales increase 40%, and this is on top of a 30% increase in 2019. Clearly, our focus on capacity creation and the hard work of our team is paying off. 
Wrapping up the P&L. I'm thrilled to report that our operating income for the quarter was $74.4 million. This is an amazing increase of 188%. For the year, operating income was $464 million, an increase of 36%. Operating margins were 11.8% for the full year 2020 compared to 10.7% for the full year 2019. 
As you can all see, 2020 was an incredible year for the business on every level. Our team's focus on service and value-driven organic growth, combined with stellar concentration on safety, capacity creation and execution, all while working towards being the employer of choice, were second to none. Our team performed at an amazing level, and we are humbled by their efforts. If that's not impressive enough, we added 4 strategic acquisitions and opened 2 greenfields in what had to be the most challenging operating year imaginable. 
In addition, in October, we celebrated 25 years as a public company, having delivered a remarkable 28% total shareholder return over the time period. And we were recognized for our consistent growth by being added to the S&P 500. 
2020 is now in the rearview mirror, but the operating environment and market conditions are largely unchanged. As we turn the page to 2021, builders report large backlogs in virtually every market that should carry us through the first half of the year and perhaps beyond. 
Strong housing market with the continuation of the de-urbanization and southern migration trends and the public's desire to find safe outdoor spaces for family recreation and entertainment are helping position 2021 as another strong year. The work-from-home trend is likely to continue expanding, which bodes well for investments around the home, particularly in the backyard. 
Our supply chains, which were certainly stretched the capacity in many areas, held up well in 2020. Our size and scale allowed us to keep product flowing to provide unparalleled service in a challenging year. As we exited the year, we saw our back orders drop and our inventory increased as the manufacturers work to clear backlog and shift the early buy orders. 
As the season starts, we are in great shape to provide the products that our customers need. Early indications are new pool construction activity will remain robust. Keep in mind, the weather and labor availability are the 2 most significant external factors in the industry's ability to satisfy the increased demand that we are seeing. 
Lastly, we should start to see the benefit of the Department of Energy's regulation on variable speed pump applications in the back half of this year, but most of the benefit will be seen in 2022 as the channel inventory is depleted. 
In the first half of the year, our comps will be much easier than we will face in the second half as the industry will no doubt bounce up against labor constraints and potentially less favorable weather than we saw in a very strong second half of 2020. We also realized growth from acquisitions closed in 2020 and expect overall inflation to be 2 to 3 -- in the 2% to 3% range in 2021. 
Taking all of this into consideration, we expect to see revenues grow in the upper-single to low double-digit range for the year with some pressure on gross margins, as Mark will discuss, and operating margins growing in line with our historical 20 to 40 basis point improvement range. 
From a capital allocation perspective, our approach remains essentially unchanged. We will invest what we need to maintain our business and add growth capacity, provide an increased dividend to our shareholders and continue to buy back shares opportunistically in line with our authorization from the Board of Directors. We anticipate opening an additional 8 to 10 sales centers in key locations for both the blue and the green business and expect to make additional acquisitions as we continue to hunt for strategically important businesses to add to our platform both here and in Europe. 
Considering these assumptions, we would expect EPS to be between $9.12 a share and $9.62 per share, which includes an $0.11 benefit from ASU 2016-09. Excluding the ASU benefit in both years, this is an increase of 7% to 13% over our very strong 2020 results. 
In closing, I would like to thank our customers, suppliers and especially the POOLCORP team for their support and dedication. 
I will now turn the call over to Mark Joslin, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, for his commentary and perspective."

I'm going to provide some financial highlights of our results for the quarter and year and then comment on 2021 and how we see that rolling out at a high level. 
First, the fourth quarter. In case it wasn't clear from Pete's comments how we felt about our fourth quarter performance, I'll start with my own perspectives. If you were somehow able to hire Michelangelo to paint a picture of the perfect quarter, it would look a lot like our fourth quarter: phenomenal sales growth, significantly improved gross margin and low expense growth relative to the level of sales and gross profit growth resulting in double the operating margin from a year ago and operating income that was on the cusp of 3x last year. Add to that improved working capital management, strong cash generation, very low leverage, year-end ROIC of almost 40% and execution on 2 strategic acquisitions, and you end up with the kind of quarter that, for me at least, is a once-in-a-career event. 
Yes, COVID-inspired home confinement and favorable weather conditions helped supercharge industry demand, but the ability of our team to execute through all the challenges and frenzy and stay focused on meeting our customers' needs, as they've done all year long, has been remarkable, and as Pete said, very humbling to us. We truly appreciate all of the efforts in response to adversity our team has demonstrated. 
A couple of highlights of our financial results, starting with the acquisitions. As I mentioned on our third quarter call, acquisitions added the expected 4% to our top line in Q4 and had a dilutive impact on operating income. This is because these businesses are predominantly northern market-focused and have a lower gross margin profile relative to the rest of our business. I'll discuss how we expect these businesses to impact our results in 2021 in a few minutes. 
Focusing on our base business results. Our gross margin was up 90 basis points in the quarter, which was primarily the result of volume-based incentives earned from manufacturers given our performance for the quarter and year. For the year, these volume incentive gains were offset by lower margins from the sales of big-ticket items, as we've discussed all year, resulting in our 20 basis point decline in gross margin for the year. 
Moving to expenses. As we've discussed on past calls and in our release, significantly higher performance-based compensation impacted our results for the quarter and year. These costs were up $12 million for the quarter and $44 million for the year compared to last year. Excluding incentive cost increases, our base business expenses were up 5% for both the quarter and year, which is remarkable given our sales growth. As Pete mentioned, this demonstrates the success we've had from expanding the use of our POOL360 B2B platform and other capacity-creation initiatives as well as reduced spending on discretionary items. 
Incentive-based compensation is an important part of our culture of rewarding our employees for the value they create while keeping our fixed cost trim when times are tough. The merits of this model are apparent in 2020, where both stockholders and employees shared in the company's substantial success proportionately. About 15% of total operating income was earned by employees through these incentive systems in 2020, providing substantial pay-for-performance for our employees but leaving the bulk of the gains in the business. Our incentive pay opportunities exist for employees at all levels, and for 2020, included $5.5 million earned by our hourly employees who work on the front lines of our organization primarily in customer fulfillment and logistics roles, which are very important to our success, and in 2020 carried an unprecedented set of challenges. About half of these employees are in the maximum $2,400 cash award for the year. 
Moving down to operating income. The leverage we generated from expense management resulted in a more than doubling of our base business operating margin in the quarter from 4.5% last year to 9.7% this year, resulting in a tripling of our operating income from a year ago. On a year-to-date basis, our operating margin climbed 120 basis points to 12%, which is a new high for us. 
On the tax line, we benefited from option exercises that reduced our tax rate by $6 million or $0.15 per share for the quarter and $29 million or $0.70 per share for the year. Excluding this, our tax rate for the year was just over 25%, similar to what we've done in the past and, for now at least, what we expect for the future. 
Moving to our balance sheet and cash flow statement. There are a few things here I'd like to point out. First, growth in our primary operating assets over last year with total net receivables up 28% and inventory is up 11% reflects our business growth, additions from acquisitions and improved asset management throughout the course of the year. For receivables, we ended the year with DSO or day sales outstanding of 26.5 days, an improvement of 9% from 29 days last year, while we improved inventory turns 19% from 3.2x last year to 3.8x in 2020. Combined with our exceptional earnings growth, these improvements helped us achieve an all-time high ROIC or return on invested capital of 39% this year compared to 29% last year and cash flow from operations that was 108% of net income. 
Other highlights here include our prioritization of cash used for acquisitions, on which we spent $125 million in 2020 for the 4 businesses we've discussed. We've also returned money to shareholders through dividends, which at $92 million were up 10% over last year, and through share repurchases, which were $76 million for the year. Doing that, we still ended up with debt, which was down $95 million year-over-year. 
Our year-end leverage was virtually half of what it was a year ago at 0.86x compared to 1.61x a year ago, giving us tremendous amount of financial flexibility. Despite being below our target leverage range of 1.5 to 2x, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged for the foreseeable future. 
Turning to our expectations for 2021. I'll start with our fully diluted share count estimate by quarter, excluding any potential share repurchases. For each quarter, except the first, I'll give you 2 numbers, our estimates for the quarter followed by year-to-date: for Q1, 40,992,000 shares; for Q2, 41,128,000 shares; and for year-to-date, 41,083,000; for Q3, 41,215,000; year-to-date, 41,135,000; and for Q4, 41,297,000 and year-to-date of 41,150,000. 
Now let me give you some added color on our 2021 guidance. You notice that we have a fairly wide EPS guidance range, reflecting more uncertainty than usual in the year ahead. First on the list is weather, which given the warm and dry conditions we experienced in most of our markets for much of 2020 will likely be a headwind in 2021. The impact of COVID on stay-at-home trends, including consumer spending on home living and entertainment was, of course, a very positive influence on our business that started midway through the second quarter and accelerated throughout the balance of the year. Those trends are continuing, and we expect to start off 2021 with demand conditions similar to our ending in 2020 and which could carry us well into the year. 
How those conditions evolve in the back half of the year, where we have strong comps from 2020, remains to be seen, although we are optimistic about the long-term implications for our business. The heightened demand we are experiencing as well as COVID impacts to both carriers and suppliers could disrupt our supply chain. We managed to work through supply issues in 2020 to minimize the impact on our business and are building inventory ahead of the 2021 season to help mitigate some of this risk. 
Industry capacity is another potential concern given -- particularly in the peak seasonal second and third quarters. All of these issues create uncertainty in our outlook, particularly in the back half of the year. 
For sales, we expect the greatest growth in the first half of the year, particularly the first quarter, with less favorable comparisons in the back half of the year, including a likely decline in Q4 if the weather is not as favorable or demand slows. Overall, including acquisitions, which we expect to add 4% to 5% to base business growth for the first 3 quarters, sales growth is projected to be in the upper single-digit range or even low double digits for the entire year. 
Specific to our 2021 gross margin, there are 3 issues here, which impact our historical normal flat gross margin expectation for the year. Similar to last year, we expect greater sales mix of big-ticket items with lower margins, particularly in the first half of the year. Second, vendor volume incentives that offset lower big-ticket margin margins in 2020 are likely to be a headwind in 2021 as some tiered vendor incentive programs reset off last year's high-volume levels. Finally, our 2020 acquisitions came with substantially lower gross margin than our existing business, which longer term is an opportunity for us. Altogether, we could see gross margins decline 20 to 40 basis points for the year, with margin gains early followed by increasing declines as we move through the year. 
Moving down to our expectation on operating expenses for the year. We have opposing forces of work here. The level of business activity we had experienced and expect as well as the deferral of hiring needs throughout the 2020 season has created some greater-than-normal staff growth needs heading into the 2021 season. At the same time, our expenses should benefit significantly from a decline in incentive-based compensation costs of $35 million in 2021, with higher year-over-year costs in the first quarter and declines in the ensuing quarters. 
As noted in our release, we also anticipate a $4.5 million or $0.11 benefit in the first quarter from vesting of restricted stock and options that will expire if not exercised. We don't attempt to forecast other ASU tax benefits for the year. 
Finally, after pausing capital spending early last year in response to COVID, we expect to resume new location development, adding 8 to 10 new sales centers in 2021, with capital spending returning to our historical range of approximately 1% of sales. 
In summary, there are a number of moving parts to our expectations for 2021, but we are confident our team will respond, and we will see solid growth and execution for the year.

The biggest difference in total as it affects new construction, but it's still such a small percentage, is fiberglass. So if I look at our fiberglass pool sales, they're almost double in terms of units and dollars too on a year-over-year basis. And the reason is because it's much faster to install fiberglass pool than a vinyl pool and certainly a gun pool, but it also makes up a very small percentage of the total. 
So there isn't a whole lot of innovation that goes on. I mean you still -- when you build a concrete pool, it still has to set for the same number of days before you can finish it. So you really can't speed up the curing of the product. So I don't really see much changing in the amount of time that it takes to build a pool, and I don't see a ton more labor coming into the system. So I would say new construction, fairly stable. 
On the maintenance side, there is more remote monitoring, although the things that can be monitored remotely are still more rudimentary. There's not a complete package out there for remote monitoring. And you still -- from a pool cleaning perspective, the professional still have to visit the pool to physically do the things that they have to do, like clean the strainer baskets and brush the pool and such."

So we've changed our processes and some of the equipment that we use to pick orders. We actually measure time to -- median time to serve our customers at the branch. So everybody is focused on bringing that time down. That's with some warehouse innovation, it's some process innovation. That is certainly helping. POOL360 is helping. The remodeled showrooms where we have some of the maintenance items that people use on a day in, day out basis rather than having to put those orders in and wait for somebody to pull them, they can walk in. They grab and walk to the counter and sign for them. 
We have our technology tools. POOL360 has seen a very nice increase in use. So a lot of customers are entering the orders before they come, if they even come. We're delivering them. There are BlueStreak, which is another app we use, which certainly speeds the speed to the counter. Our app -- our NPT app, which allows folks to do a lot of the work that they would normally do when they're designing a pool before they get to the NPT center, even if they come to the NPT design center because they can envision their pool and basically place it in their backyard with that augmented reality app. So it really is a host of things that we have been doing. 
And on the delivery side, our truck utilization and routing improvement software is also helping. So Ken, it's not -- there's not one thing. There probably isn't 10 things, but they all contribute to what we have going on. Plus, frankly, just a whole lot of hard work by our team."

So we had planned to open 8 to 10 last year as well because the market continues to expand and our value proposition is creating time for our dealers, and a lot of that has to do with the location of our branches. So as the markets grow, as we soak up the capacity that we have, we add new locations. 
Last year, we paused new locations early on in the season. And you don't really want to open up -- you can't open up locations during the season because nobody has time for that. So if you're not really set by the time the season opens, the chances of deriving any benefit during the season are muted. So when we tap the brakes, we really took a pause, and we went from the 8 to 10 that we would normally add down to 2. 
So basically going back on the trail to open, that takes us back to the 8 to 10. And certainly, in a very robust market, as you can imagine, the payback on the branches, which is really tied to revenue growth and gross profit growth and expense management, certainly that gets better the faster you grow."

The demand for our products",2187,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning to everyone on the call. Never in my wildest imagination could I have envisioned a year like 2020. The impact from the global pandemic created both unprecedented challenges and opportunities. 
The demand for our products was unparalleled. The challenges to keep up with that demand while remaining safe were extraordinary, but we found innovative ways to get things done and deliver amazing results. I could not be prouder of our employees and all their accomplishments as they proved once again why the POOLCORP team is simply the best. 
Despite uncertain times brought on by COVID, thousands of families affirmed that only a pool, a patio or an outdoor kitchen is a wonderful way to enjoy the great outdoors in a safe, family-friendly environment. This heightened interest in enjoying existing pools and outdoor living spaces, combined with the insatiable demand for new pools, created an amazing opportunity for our industry. 
In 2020, our total sales came in at $3.9 billion, a 23% increase over 2019. In the fourth quarter, we saw sales grow an amazing 44%, capping off a phenomenal year by any measure. From a base business perspective, our sales grew 39% in the quarter and 22% on a year-to-date basis. Demand in virtually all of our geographies remained strong, with particular strength noted in our seasonal markets. 
For context, as I recap the quarter and the year, I think it may be helpful to remind you of how 2020 played out. The year started out strong, with revenues up 13% in the first quarter, before any real impact of COVID could be felt. The second quarter, which started off with sharp declines as COVID-related shutdowns took effect, quickly rebounded, and we finished up 14%. In the third quarter, the business fueled by high demand and strong execution, continued to accelerate and ended up with sales up 27%. And as we reported, the fourth quarter was even better, up 44%. 
2020 was also a busy year for us on the acquisition front as we completed 4 acquisitions: 3 on the blue side of the business and 1 for Horizon. Master Tile, Northeast Swimming Pool Distributors, Jet Line products and our newest addition, TWC Distributors, all joined the POOLCORP family and are integrating well. 
Now let me provide a little more color on how the business performed in our 4 largest markets for the quarter and for the year. As you can imagine, all benefited from strong demand and favorable weather conditions. Florida saw revenue in the quarter up 25%, bringing the year-to-date growth of 16%. Arizona posted a 36% gain in the quarter and 23% for the year, while Texas revenues grew by 47% in the quarter and 23% for the year. California, still the largest market in the country and the last to recover from the shutdowns, grew by 26% in the quarter and 13% for the year. 
Overall, our year-round markets were up by 32% for the quarter and 18% for the year, while seasonal markets were up 50% in the quarter and 27% for the year. All markets benefited from strong pool construction trends, which we believe grew about 25% for the year from approximately 80,000 new pools in 2019 to approximately 100,000 new pools in 2020. Considering the slow start to the year, this was a big step forward for the industry in 2020 as milder weather late in the year enabled builders to make up for lost time. 
Looking at our end markets. Our commercial pool category was down 8% for the quarter and 10% for the year, comprising 4% of total sales for the company. Continued softness in the public pool and travel industry is behind the slowdown, and we don't see that recovering into 2021. There are some projects starting to bid, but the lack of travel is likely to continue to weigh heavily on this market. 
Retail sales, on the other hand, were up 34% in the quarter and 24% for the year. A larger installed base, more in-season pool usage and consumers trying to stretch the season all increased demand for pool supplies and maintenance products. Retail-sized chemicals, automatic, pool cleaners and above-ground pools and spas all had strong growth. 
At the key product level, the story is much the same. Demand is strong. Equipment sales, which includes pumps, filters, heaters and lights, were up 51% in the quarter and 31% for the year. Due to significant construction backlogs and favorable weather conditions, most of our dealers kept building and remodeling, which helped drive the strong increase in equipment sales. 
Chemical sales in the fourth quarter were up 16% and 10% for the year. As I mentioned, demand for consumer-sized chemicals was very strong throughout the quarter and the year, but commercial -- but pool -- commercial pool chemical demand declined with the COVID-driven diminished use. For the upcoming 2021 season, I'd expect the supplies to be tight but manageable for most chemical products, with trichlor, a very popular pool-sanitizing product, being a notable exception. 
In this case, the industry lost significant production when a major plant was destroyed by a fire in August, which accounted for approximately 40% of the industry's capacity of this product. I'd expect to see the supply of trichlor be very tight and price is elevated, depending on how much additional capacity comes online and how much import product can be sourced to supplement the constrained supply. Certainly, weather will play a role in determining how the supply-and-demand balance works out for chemicals. 
Building material sales, a great indicator of the health of the construction and remodel segment, are strong. In the fourth quarter, we saw sales grow by 42%, bringing the year-to-date 2020 sales increase to 23%. We are quite happy with this result, given, as I said earlier, the uncertain and delayed start to the construction season in many of our seasonal and some of our year-round markets. 
When you look at the results of our business across the category, it's evident that we took significant share in 2020. The contributions from our seasoned and customer-focused teams utilizing unique tools and resources available to us allowed us to adapt and thrive in the COVID environment better than anyone in the industry. 
Turning to Europe. This is a continuation of the same strong story that we discussed during our third quarter update. Europe had a very robust quarter once again and grew revenues by 48% in the quarter and 24% for the year. Continued strong demand, favorable weather and excellent execution all contributed to a great year for Europe as well. What makes this result even more impressive is that Europe felt the impact of the virus sooner and experienced more pervasive shutdowns and restrictions than most of the North American markets. 
Now I'd like to switch gears and provide some commentary on our green business, Horizon. We're pleased to see this business continue to gain momentum and grow. For the quarter, Horizon-based business was up 13% and 9% for the year. Strong demand for residential construction and outdoor living is fueled by growth in the year-round markets that we serve. 
Additionally, in December, we completed the acquisition of TWC Distributors, with 10 locations in the strategically important market of Central and Southwest Florida. We continue to invest and improve in Horizon and remain very optimistic about the future growth opportunities in the green business. 
Moving to gross margins. We saw our overall gross margin increase to 28.5% in the quarter, a 70 basis point increase from the same period last year. For the full year, we finished at 28.7%, down 20 bps when compared to the full year of 2019. Despite decline, on a year-to-date basis, was primarily driven by stronger big-ticket, lower-margin product sales, as we discussed in prior quarters. 
Turning to operating expenses. We're very proud of our performance in this area as we saw operating expenses as a percentage of sales improved by over 300 basis points for the total business and over 400 basis points for our base business in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, we improved by 130 basis points in the total business and 150 basis points in the base business. 
Contributing to our success was continued strong growth in sales through our POOL360 B2B tool, which became especially useful for customers with the onset of COVID and restricted access to our sales centers for order processing. For the year, we saw POOL360 sales increase 40%, and this is on top of a 30% increase in 2019. Clearly, our focus on capacity creation and the hard work of our team is paying off. 
Wrapping up the P&L. I'm thrilled to report that our operating income for the quarter was $74.4 million. This is an amazing increase of 188%. For the year, operating income was $464 million, an increase of 36%. Operating margins were 11.8% for the full year of 2020 compared to 10.7% for the full year 2019. 
As you can all see, 2020 was an incredible year for the business on every level. Our team's focus on service and value-driven organic growth, combined with stellar concentration on safety, capacity creation and execution, all while working towards being the employer of choice, were second to none. Our team performed at an amazing level, and we are humbled by their efforts. 
If that's not impressive enough, we added 4 strategic acquisitions and opened 2 greenfields in what had to be the most challenging operating year imaginable. In addition, in October, we celebrated 25 years as a public company, having delivered a remarkable 28% total shareholder return over the time period. And we were recognized for our consistent growth by being added to the S&P 500. 
2020 is now in the rearview mirror, but the operating environment and market conditions are largely unchanged. As we turn the page to 2021, builders report large backlogs in virtually every market. That should carry us through the first half of the year and perhaps beyond. 
Strong housing market, with the continuation of the de-urbanization and southern migration trends and the public's desire to find safe outdoor spaces for family recreation and entertainment, are helping position 2021 as another strong year. The work-from-home trend is likely to continue expanding, which bodes well for investments around the home, particularly in the backyard. 
Our supply chains, which were certainly stretched to capacity in many areas, held up well in 2020. Our size and scale allowed us to keep product flowing to provide unparalleled service in a challenging year. 
As we exited the year, we saw our back orders drop and our inventory increase as the manufacturers worked to clear backlog and ship the early-buy orders. As the season starts, we are in great shape to provide the products that our customers need. Early indications are new pool construction activity will remain robust. 
Keep in mind, the weather and labor availability are the 2 most significant external factors in the industry's ability to satisfy the increased demand that we are seeing. Lastly, we should start to see the benefit of the Department of Energy's regulation on variable speed pump applications in the back half of this year, but most of the benefit will be seen in 2022 as the channel inventory is depleted. 
In the first half of the year, our comps will be much easier than we will face in the second half as the industry will no doubt bounce up against labor constraints and potentially less favorable weather than we saw in a very strong second half of 2020. We also realized growth from acquisitions closed in 2020 and expect overall inflation to be 2 to 3 -- in the 2% to 3% range in 2021. 
Taking all of this into consideration, we expect to see revenues grow in the upper-single to low-double-digit range for the year, with some pressure on gross margins, as Mark will discuss, and operating margins growing in line with our historical 20 to 40 basis point improvement range. 
From a capital allocation perspective, our approach remains essentially unchanged. We will invest what we need to maintain our business and add growth capacity, provide an increased dividend to our shareholders and continue to buy back shares opportunistically, in line with our authorization from the Board of Directors. We anticipate opening an additional 8 to 10 sales centers in key locations for both the blue and the green business, and expect to make additional acquisitions as we continue to hunt for strategically important businesses to add to our platform, both here and in Europe. 
Considering these assumptions, we would expect EPS to be between $9.12 a share and $9.62 per share, which includes an $0.11 benefit from ASU 2016-09. Excluding the ASU benefit in both years, this is an increase of 7% to 13% over our very strong 2020 results. 
In closing, I would like to thank our customers, suppliers and especially the POOLCORP team for their support and dedication. I will now turn the call over to Mark Joslin, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, for his commentary and perspective."
34117,702621182,2206463,"Pool Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2021",2021-02-11,"Earnings Calls","Pool Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Pete.

I'm going to provide some financial highlights of our results for the quarter and year, and then comment on 2021 and how we see that rolling out at a high level. 
First, the fourth quarter. In case it wasn't clear from Pete's comments how we felt about our fourth quarter performance, I'll start with my own perspectives. If you were somehow able to hire Michelangelo to paint a picture of the perfect quarter, it would look a lot like our fourth quarter: phenomenal sales growth, significantly improved gross margin and low expense growth relative to the level of sales and gross profit growth, resulting in double the operating margin from a year ago and operating income that was on the cusp of 3x last year. Add to that improved working capital management, strong cash generation, very low leverage, year-end ROIC of almost 40% and execution on 2 strategic acquisitions, and you end up with the kind of quarter that, for me, at least, is a once-in-a-career event. 
Yes, COVID-inspired home confinement and favorable weather conditions helped supercharge industry demand, but the ability of our team to execute through all the challenges and frenzy and stay focused on meeting our customers' needs, as they've done all year long, has been remarkable and, as Pete said, very humbling to us. We truly appreciate all of the efforts in response to adversity our team has demonstrated. 
A couple of highlights of our financial results, starting with the acquisitions. As I mentioned on our third quarter call, acquisitions added the expected 4% to our top line in Q4 and had a dilutive impact on operating income. This is because these businesses are predominantly northern market-focused and have a lower gross margin profile relative to the rest of our business. I'll discuss how we expect these businesses to impact our results in 2021 in a few minutes. 
Focusing on our base business results. Our gross margin was up 90 basis points in the quarter, which was primarily the result of volume-based incentives earned from manufacturers, given our performance for the quarter and year. For the year, these volume incentive gains were offset by lower margins from the sales of big-ticket items, as we've discussed all year, resulting in our 20 basis point decline in gross margin for the year. 
Moving to expenses. As we've discussed on past calls and in our release, significantly higher performance-based compensation impacted our results for the quarter and year. These costs were up $12 million for the quarter and $44 million for the year compared to last year. Excluding incentive cost increases, our base business expenses were up 5% for both the quarter and year, which is remarkable, given our sales growth. As Pete mentioned, this demonstrates the success we've had from expanding the use of our POOL360 B2B platform and other capacity-creation initiatives as well as reduced spending on discretionary items. 
Incentive-based compensation is an important part of our culture of rewarding our employees for the value they create while keeping our fixed cost trim when times are tough. The merits of this model are apparent in 2020, where both stockholders and employees shared in the company's substantial success proportionately. About 15% of total operating income was earned by employees through these incentive systems in 2020, providing substantial pay-for-performance for our employees, but leaving the bulk of the gains in the business. 
Our incentive pay opportunities exist for employees at all levels and, for 2020, included $5.5 million earned by our hourly employees who work on the front lines of our organization, primarily in customer fulfillment and logistics roles, which are very important to our success and, in 2020, carried an unprecedented set of challenges. About half of these employees are in the maximum $2,400 cash award for the year. 
Moving down to operating income. The leverage we generated from expense management resulted in a more than doubling of our base business operating margin in the quarter, from 4.5% last year to 9.7% this year, resulting in a tripling of our operating income from a year ago. On a year-to-date basis, our operating margin climbed 120 basis points to 12%, which is a new high for us. 
On the tax line, we benefited from option exercises that reduced our tax rate by $6 million or $0.15 per share for the quarter and $29 million or $0.70 per share for the year. Excluding this, our tax rate for the year was just over 25%, similar to what we've done in the past and, for now, at least, what we expect for the future. 
Moving to our balance sheet and cash flow statement. There are a few things here I'd like to point out. First, growth in our primary operating assets over last year, with total net receivables up 28% and inventory is up 11%, reflects our business growth, additions from acquisitions and improved asset management throughout the course of the year. For receivables, we ended the year with DSO, or days sales outstanding, of 26.5 days, an improvement of 9% from 29 days last year, while we improved inventory turns 19% from 3.2x last year to 3.8x in 2020. 
Combined with our exceptional earnings growth, these improvements helped us achieve an all-time-high ROIC or return on invested capital of 39% this year compared to 29% last year, and cash flow from operations that was 108% of net income. 
Other highlights here include our prioritization of cash used for acquisitions, on which we spent $125 million in 2020 for the 4 businesses we've discussed. We've also returned money to shareholders through dividends, which, at $92 million, were up 10% over last year, and through share repurchases, which were $76 million for the year. Doing that, we still ended up with debt, which was down $95 million year-over-year. 
Our year-end leverage was virtually half of what it was a year ago at 0.86x compared to 1.61x a year ago, giving us tremendous amount of financial flexibility. Despite being below our target leverage range of 1.5 to 2x, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged for the foreseeable future. 
Turning to our expectations for 2021. I'll start with our fully diluted share count estimate by quarter, excluding any potential share repurchases. For each quarter, except the first, I'll give you 2 numbers: our estimates for the quarter, followed by year-to-date. For Q1, 40,992,000 shares; for Q2, 41,128,000 shares; and for year-to-date, 41,083,000; for Q3, 41,215,000; year-to-date, 41,135,000; and for Q4, 41,297,000 and year-to-date of 41,150,000. 
Now let me give you some added color on our 2021 guidance. You notice that we have a fairly wide EPS guidance range, reflecting more uncertainty than usual in the year ahead. First on the list is weather, which, given the warm and dry conditions we experienced in most of our markets for much of 2020, will likely be a headwind in 2021. 
The impact of COVID on stay-at-home trends, including consumer spending on home living and entertainment was, of course, a very positive influence on our business that started midway through the second quarter and accelerated throughout the balance of the year. Those trends are continuing, and we expect to start off 2021 with demand conditions similar to our ending in 2020, and which could carry us well into the year. 
How those conditions evolve in the back half of the year, where we have strong comps from 2020, remains to be seen, although we are optimistic about the long-term implications for our business. The heightened demand we are experiencing, as well as COVID impacts to both carriers and suppliers, could disrupt our supply chain. We managed to work through supply issues in 2020 to minimize the impact on our business and are building inventory ahead of the 2021 season to help mitigate some of this risk. 
Industry capacity is another potential concern, given -- particularly in the peak seasonal second and third quarters. All of these issues create uncertainty in our outlook, particularly in the back half of the year. 
For sales, we expect the greatest growth in the first half of the year, particularly in the first quarter, with less favorable comparisons in the back half of the year, including a likely decline in Q4 if the weather is not as favorable or demand slows. Overall, including acquisitions, which we expect to add 4% to 5% to base business growth for the first 3 quarters, sales growth is projected to be in the upper single-digit range or even low double digits for the entire year. 
Specific to our 2021 gross margin. There are 3 issues here, which impact our historical normal flat gross margin expectation for the year. Similar to last year, we expect greater sales mix of big-ticket items with lower margins, particularly in the first half of the year. Second, vendor volume incentives that offset lower big-ticket margins in 2020 are likely to be a headwind in 2021 as some tiered vendor incentive programs reset off last year's high-volume levels. 
Finally, our 2020 acquisitions came with substantially lower gross margin than our existing business, which, longer term, is an opportunity for us. Altogether, we could see gross margins decline 20 to 40 basis points for the year, with margin gains early, followed by increasing declines as we move through the year. 
Moving down to our expectation on operating expenses for the year, we have opposing forces of work here. The level of business activity we have experienced and expect as well as the deferral of hiring needs throughout the 2020 season has created some greater-than-normal staff growth needs heading into the 2021 season. At the same time, our expenses should benefit significantly from a decline in incentive-based compensation cost of $30 million to $35 million in 2021, with higher year-over-year costs in the first quarter and declines in the ensuing quarters. 
As noted in our release, we also anticipate a $4.5 million or $0.11 benefit in the first quarter from vesting of restricted stock and options that will expire if not exercised. We don't attempt to forecast other ASU tax benefits for the year. 
Finally, after pausing capital spending early last year in response to COVID, we expect to resume new location development, adding 8 to 10 new sales centers in 2021, with capital spending returning to our historical range of approximately 1% of sales. In summary, there are a number of moving parts to our expectations for 2021, but we are confident our team will respond, and we will see solid growth and execution for the year.

So it doesn't justify us to pay a huge premium to go buy somebody else. So is there some upward movement? Yes, but I would tell you, it's nothing that's really notable."

The biggest difference in total as it affects new construction, but it's still such a small percentage, is fiberglass. So if I look at our fiberglass pool sales, they're almost double in terms of units and dollars, too, on a year-over-year basis. And the reason is because it's much faster to install fiberglass pool than a vinyl pool and certainly a gun pool, but it also makes up a very small percentage of the total. 
So there isn't a whole lot of innovation that goes on. I mean you still -- when you build a concrete pool, it still has to set for the same number of days before you can finish it. So you really can't speed up the curing of the product. So I don't really see much changing in the amount of time that it takes to build a pool, and I don't see a ton more labor coming into the system. So I would say new construction, fairly stable. 
On the maintenance side, there is more remote monitoring, although the things that can be monitored remotely are still more rudimentary. There's not a complete package out there for remote monitoring. And you still -- from a pool cleaning perspective, the professional still have to visit the pool to physically do the things that they have to do, like clean the strainer baskets and brush the pool and such."

So we've changed our processes and some of the equipment that we use to pick orders. We actually measure time to -- meaning time to serve our customers at the branch. So everybody is focused on bringing that time down. 
That's with some warehouse innovation, it's some process innovation. That is certainly helping. POOL360 is helping. The remodeled showrooms, where we have some of the maintenance items that people use on a day in, day out basis, rather than having to put those orders in and wait for somebody to pull them, they can walk in. They grab and walk to the counter and sign for them. 
We have our technology tools. POOL360 has seen a very nice increase in use. So a lot of customers are entering the orders before they come, if they even come. We're delivering them. There are BlueStreak, which is another app we use, which certainly speeds the speed to the counter. 
Our app -- our NPT app, which allows folks to do a lot of the work that they would normally do when they're designing a pool before they get to the NPT center. Even if they come to the NPT design center because they can envision their pool and basically place it in their backyard with that augmented reality app. 
So it really is a host of things that we have been doing. And on the delivery side, our truck utilization and routing improvement software is also helping. So Ken, it's not -- there's not one thing. There probably isn't 10 things, but they all contribute to what we have going on. Plus, frankly, just a whole lot of hard work by our team."

So we had planned to open 8 to 10 last year as well because the market continues to expand and our value proposition is creating time for our dealers, and a lot of that has to do with the location of our branches. So as the markets grow, as we soak up the capacity that we have, we add new locations. 
Last year, we paused new locations early on in the season. And you don't really want to open up -- you can't open up locations during the season because nobody has time for that. So if you're not really set by the time the season opens, the chances of deriving any benefit during the season are muted. So when we tap the brakes, we really took a pause, and we went from the 8 to 10 that we would normally add down to 2. 
So basically, going back on the trail to open, that takes us back to the 8 to 10. And certainly, in a very robust market, as you can imagine, the payback on the branches, which is really tied to revenue growth and gross profit growth and expense management, certainly that gets better the faster you grow."

I simply could not be prouder of our team or more energized by these results. As you saw this morning, we announced that our first quarter sales came in at $1.1 billion, which is the first time in",1583,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning to everyone on the call. I simply could not be prouder of our team or more energized by these results. As you saw this morning, we announced that our first quarter sales came in at $1.1 billion, which is the first time in our history that we have crossed the $1 billion mark in the first quarter. This represents a 57% increase over the same period last year and was the result of strong demand and strong execution in virtually all our markets in North America, both blue and green, and even stronger market conditions and execution in Europe. Our dedicated and talented teams have worked very hard to ensure we provide the very best service to our customers, allowing them to help families enjoy the healthy outdoor living lifestyle that we support. 
From a geographic perspective, our 4 largest North American markets were strong. California saw a very robust 30% gain in the quarter. In Florida, we saw sales grow by 33%. In Arizona, sales grew by 29%, while Texas grew by 68% in the quarter. The February storm in Texas positively impacted our total sales by approximately 1% to 2% or $15 million to $20 million. Overall, these year-round markets are experiencing the same elevated demand and saw a 40% increase for the quarter, while seasonal markets, sales increased by 66%, highlighting the strength and depth of the industry order backlog. 
Turning to product sales. No surprises here with equipment sales posting gains of 61%, driven by strong demand for heaters, lighting, pumps, filters, all used in the maintenance and construction and remodel of swimming pools. This is following the fourth quarter gains of 51%. 
Chemical sales were up 18% in the quarter, including the effects of the increased dichlor and trichlor product pricing resulting from the previously discussed industry supply shortages for these products. We are encouraged by this growth given that the installed base grew by approximately 2% overall, which highlights greater pool usage by homeowners. 
Building Materials sales increased 34% in the quarter, reflecting a very healthy demand for construction and remodeling products. Retail-related product sales were up 43% in the quarter, reflecting strong confidence by our dealers and increased early buy activity compared to last year. We believe that new pool construction was approximately 96,000 units in 2020. And with very strong permit data from our major markets, we are anticipating that 2021 new pool construction will exceed 110,000 units for the first time since the Great Recession, but still well below historical peak levels. 
Commercial pool category sales growth turned positive for the first time since the onset of the pandemic, posting 3% growth after declining for the past 3 quarters. This is an encouraging sign. With people beginning to travel more, we expect this market to continue to strengthen. For perspective, this is a relatively small part of our business, making up only 4% of our total sales. 
Our 2020 acquisitions are performing well and as expected, contributed significantly to overall growth, adding approximately $45 million in sales or about 4% of total net sales for the quarter. Now let me provide some commentary on our European operations. 
Our team in Europe posted some astonishing results in the first quarter with sales up 115%, with the month of March being the largest month ever for the POOLCORP team in Europe. Like in North America, consumers are investing in their backyards and keeping our dealer base extremely busy. Our team in Europe has done a tremendous job focusing on the customer experience and operating execution, which has enabled share gains in a competitive market. All countries in our Europe business are experiencing record growth, highlighted by particularly strong growth in France, Spain and Germany, the 3 largest markets. 
I would now like to provide some commentary on Horizon. We could not be happier with the trajectory that this business is on. Building on a strong fourth quarter, Horizon posted 24% base business growth in the first quarter and is poised to gain momentum throughout the year. We are confident that this platform will continue to excel, with strong execution, our team's intense focus on the customer and a robust housing market fueling demand. 
The team is assimilating the TWC distributors acquisition that we closed in December, expanding our Florida market presence with 9 additional sales centers. Horizon is also expanding its footprint with 2 new greenfield locations opening soon in key markets in Florida and California. We will continue to strategically invest in this business. 
Turning to gross margins. We are pleased to see a 40 basis point gain for the quarter, including a 70 basis point growth in the base business. Higher volume-based purchasing incentives, a favorable sales mix and some inflation benefit combined to provide a slight lift year-over-year. 
Switching our discussions to operating expenses. We have a very good story to share. In total, operating expenses were up 17% net of the impairment expense in Q1 of 2020 and including the impact from our 4 acquisitions that we closed in 2020. Excluding the impairment last year, our base business operating expense increased only 10% on revenue growth of 51%. This led to a reduction of our overall OpEx of 650 basis points as a percentage of sales for the quarter. 
Driving this operating leverage improvements are the benefits from our capacity creation leverage, improvements are the benefit from our -- driving this operating leverage improvement are the benefits from our capacity creation activities, and the tremendous effort and dedication of our teams. 
Of note, our POOL360 sales accounted for 11% of our total sales. We saw an incredible 90% increase in revenue through the tool compared to the same period last year and a 45% increase in line volume process. 
Wrapping up the P&L brings us to the operating income line. For the quarter, we reported operating income of $129 million. This is a 263% increase over last year and brought our first quarter operating margin to 12.2% compared to 5.3% last year at the same time. This is truly an amazing performance and one that we are all quite proud of. Once again, I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the incredible execution and tireless effort that our team displayed to accomplish these amazing results. 
Now with the first quarter behind us, let me try and provide some context for how we see the remaining portion of the year shaping up. First, as noted in our previous call, our builders ended the year with a considerable backlog. This has continued to grow as homeowners' desire for a family-friendly outdoor living environment is increasing. Contractors continue reporting strong leads and contracts deep into the 2021 season with many quoting 2022 completions. 
The flexibility of the new work-from-home norm that many professionals have switched to has proven to be a catalyst for investing in home improvements, with the backyard being near the top of the list. This, along with the continuation of the de-urbanization trends, strengthening of the southern migration and more active participation of the millennial population in the housing market should be great for our industry. 
Second, we previously said that inflation would be in the 2% to 3% range, but now believe it will be in the 4% to 5% range with some products into double digits. We don't anticipate any of this getting hung up in the channel, so that will provide a tailwind for the year. Considering that most of our -- most of the cost of constructing a new pool or remodeling an existing pool is tied up in labor, we don't anticipate this inflation having a meaningful effect on demand. As it relates to nondiscretionary products such as chemicals, inflation is simply passed through again with no real effect on demand. 
Third, with demand being so strong and some manufacturers struggling to keep up, we have experienced some product shortages that, up to this point, have been manageable by utilizing the strength of our network to keep critical product flowing to our dealers and providing alternative options when certain products are in short supply. Our back orders have certainly increased in most markets, but our team has done a remarkable job taking care of our customers in a very challenging environment. 
Fourth, labor is in very high demand across all construction segments. And this continues to pressurize the industry, keeping demand greater than supply, which we have seen for many years. Crews are working longer and the fair weather has helped expand capacity for the industry, but the labor market tightness is something that we continue to watch. 
Finally, we just announced that we have acquired Pool Source, a single source -- a single location pool distributor in the strategic Nashville, Tennessee market. We have a robust M&A pipeline that we continue to develop. Greenfield activity has picked up as well as we expect to open 7 or more new locations on the blue side this year in addition to the Horizon locations I mentioned earlier. 
Considering all of this and the amazing first quarter, our confidence in growth for the season and the rest of the year has improved considerably. As a result, we are raising our guidance for the year to $11.85 to $12.60 earnings per share from the previous guidance of $9.12 to $9.62. 
I will now turn the call over to Mark Joslin, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, for his commentary and perspective. Mark?"

I'm going to start by commenting on the change in our guidance range for the year, which at the midpoint is up 30% from the guidance we gave on our year-end call just over 2 months ago. So what changed in that relatively short period of time",1327,"Thanks, Pete. I'm going to start by commenting on the change in our guidance range for the year, which at the midpoint is up 30% from the guidance we gave on our year-end call just over 2 months ago. So what changed in that relatively short period of time? The answer is there are a number of reasons for a more optimistic outlook, which I'll describe in order of magnitude. 
First is our very strong Q1 results and our short-term expectations as we move into the second quarter despite relatively average U.S. weather, Q1 market conditions built on the exceptionally strong 2020 end of year, and we're able to capitalize on that to deliver phenomenal results. This momentum has continued into the second quarter, and taken together, is meaningfully better than what we expected in February. 
Second, we've seen an acceleration in inflationary price increases announced by our vendors over the last couple of months, roughly doubling the inflationary impact we expect to see for the year from our earlier guidance of 2% to 3% on average across our product portfolio to 4% to 5% now. As under price increases are primarily pass-throughs in the pool industry, these increases should add to our sales and gross profit opportunity for the year. 
Third, we have more clarity on positive external factors impacting our business throughout the remainder of the year. These factors include our increased confidence that new normal will be many more people working from home in the future than in the past, with greater focus on home improvement spending. This spending will be fueled in the short term by favorable homeowner dynamics, including rising home valuations, low interest rates, a healthy job market, government stimulus and greater millennial participation in the housing market. 
As our first quarter demonstrated, we generate significant operating leverage by effectively managing expense growth in vibrant market conditions. While I expect our operating leverage to decline as we progress through the year, it should be better for the year overall than our typical annual target. Finally, adding to our opportunity since February are slightly larger contributions from 2020 acquisitions and our just completed Pool Source acquisition in the Nashville market. 
Tempering our enthusiasm, to some degree, are the strains on our supply chain as many suppliers struggle to maintain product flow in the midst of this vigorous market environment and constraints on customer labor that could impact their ability to fulfill demand. Our suppliers' ability to maintain adequate product flow, particularly as we head into and through the season, will be a challenge but we believe we've adequately factored this into our projections. 
With that color on the conditions that resulted in our guidance change, I will comment briefly on our Q1 results before summarizing our expectations for the rest of the year. As I mentioned on our year-end call, a present day Michael Angelo painting a picture of a perfect quarter might have painted our fourth quarter results. With our first quarter now behind us, it's clear that our fourth quarter was just a warm up for a true masterpiece. 
Every aspect of our first quarter performance was exceptional, top to bottom, on the P&L with excellent working capital management and cash generation. Compared to a strong Q1 last year, sales were up 57%. Operating income was more than 3.5x greater. Operating margin was more than 2x better and return on invested capital was 44% on a trailing 4-quarter basis, all record levels of performance. Obviously, our teams in the field stay focused on their customers' needs in the face of the many significant challenges facing them each and every day took advantage of the resources available to them to create capacity, and in general, were just phenomenal. 
Now rather than doing my usual line-by-line results commentary, I believe it would be more helpful to discuss our expectations for the remainder of the year, starting with sales. As mentioned, the demand environment is very strong, and we don't see any letup here as we head into the heart of the season with acquisitions and inflation adding to our growth opportunity. These positives are tempered by potential vendor contractor labor constraints as well as our own increasingly difficult sales comps as the year progresses. 
As a reminder, our base business sales growth by quarter last year was 13%, 14%, 27% and 39%. Capacity and supply constraints potentially become more of an issue mid-season, but our year-over-year sales gains should be highest in Q2, with diminished growth as the year progresses. As usual, weather will have an important but as yet unknown impact. For the full year, we now expect the year-over-year total sales growth to be in the range of 20% plus, assuming supply constraints don't accelerate significantly. Along with the additional sales volume, our gross margin expectations for the year have also improved. On our year-end call, I forecast 20 to 40 basis points of margin decline for 2021. I would temper that now with a more modest flat to 20 basis points decline in gross margin, with the biggest challenges here coming later in the year. 
Very modest operating expense growth in relation to our sales and gross profit growth has characterized our results for the last year. While that should be the case for the year overall, our operating margin improvement should decline sequentially throughout the year as we lap favorable comps and ramp up using in some discretionary expense categories that benefited our results over the last year. For the full year, I expect our operating margin will improve in excess of 100 basis points, which would be far more than our typical annual target of 20, 40 basis points -- 20 to 40 basis points. We obviously have a good start on that based on our Q1 results. 
Our tax line is an area of continued focus, so I have a couple of comments here. First, we continue to see -- continue to expect our tax rate, excluding the ASU impact, to be around 25%, as has been the case for the last several years with a lower effective rate as we book ASU-related tax gains on the exercise of stock options and the vesting of restricted stock. As we mentioned in our release, our guidance range doesn't include additional ASU benefit beyond the $0.10 we realized in the first quarter. 
Of note, there's obviously been a lot of discussion about raising corporate federal taxes, both by the administration and in Congress, with varying proposals ranging up to a 7% tax rate increase which most likely would be effective in 2022. Given the high proportion of our profit earned in the U.S., any rate increase would likely have a direct and proportional increase in our taxes paid and a corresponding reduction in earnings. The good news, if you can call it that, is that investors seem to have anticipated this and already priced it into our stock. 
Looking at our share count, you'll note that we were able to complete $66 million in share repurchases in the quarter, which resulted in 198,000 shares being repurchased at an average price of $332 a share. As has been the case historically, we believe share repurchases remain our best use for excess cash balanced with our desire to keep a relatively conservative balance sheet so expect more of this to come in the year ahead. For share count forecasting purposes, I laid out a detailed forecast on our last call, which I would now reduce by 300,000 shares for each remaining quarter and year-to-date period based on the Q1 repurchases completed. 
Finally, as we announced previously, I plan to retire later this year with no specific departure date set at this point. Melanie Hart, who is our current Chief Accounting Officer, has been named as my successor and is preparing to assume our CFO responsibilities. With that, I'll turn the call back to our operator to begin our question-and-answer session."

Now that simply means that people are going to move their method of sanitization to another product, either a granular product or a liquid product. But there's no shortage of ways to sanitize the pool. It just simply means at a certain point, people will shift. We've also seen certain parts of the country accelerating the use of salt as a method of sanitization, too."

So the -- if I think about it from a -- you mentioned in the Sunbelt, a lot of construction and remodel. That is absolutely true. So the backlogs in the Sunbelt for both of those things are very strong. The seasonal markets also have a very strong backlog. And because of the -- frankly, I think it was as much because of the backlog because the weather was, I would call average for us. Because of that, I think people kept working in as best they could and/or started earlier. So what we've seen is a big increase in new pool construction. And we've also seen a big backlog in the remodel. 
Now as it relates to usage, the only way that we look at that is what's going on in the maintenance side. So we use chemical usage as a proxy for that. And as I mentioned in my comments, with the installed base only being up about 2%, the fact that the chemical usage was up by like 18, that leads us to believe that more people are using the pools, which is good for the maintenance part of our business.

As far as the capacity creation and the run rate that we're seeing, you have to consider that -- you really can't think through that unless you parse it into seasonal markets and year-round markets. 
So the year-round markets are very busy, right? But they're busy with construction and remodel because in places like Dallas, Texas and such, there aren't a whole lot of people swimming yet. But there's a lot of construction going on. So we'll see an uptick in those areas in the products that are used in the maintenance products, if you will. So our chemical spend, if the water warms up, chemical spend will go up significantly in the seasonal markets as people start using the pools more -- I'm sorry, in the year-round market. So people, even this time of year, usage is vastly diminished over what it is in the summer months, except for places like South Florida. 
So what we'll see is that there'll be -- there'll continue to be an increase, and the capacity creation initiatives that we have will continue to pay dividends in both those markets because the nature of the business will shift. So POOL360, for instance, will be -- will continue to be a big part of our productivity result. The truck utilization, the velocity slotting, all of those things continue to help us.

I tend to think of less demand, the fact that we have so much of our business tied to maintenance as well as the leverage we have in our model, which has a fair amount of incentive compensation that goes down in a kind of downside environment. But I don't know. Instead of adding a person when demand picks up, we don't have that person to let go, let's say, when the volume drops.

Given the current ramp in new pool construction, when do you think we get to a point where you need to expand existing locations, add another centralized shipping site or make some other expansion decisions to fulfill demand? And I asked this because I wasn't covering the company back in the early 2000s when new pool construction peaked. So I'm just not sure how you manage capacity back then, if it was any different. And I'm just trying to figure out if something's changed."

I think this year, given the strong demand, it will be 110,000 plus. If you think about historically how POOLCORP has grown, we've grown by continuing to expand our network. So we try and add capacity within the 4 walls and grow the business, which was what creates the operating leverage that we've been able to do. But at a certain point, as new pool construction continues to grow and the installed base continues to grow, proximity of our locations to those pools matters. 
So there's 2 reasons for us to expand our footprint. One is we're simply out of capacity. And then when we look at the geographic circle that an individual branch or sales center covers, we simply look at and say, all right, where is the market growing? We take a piece of the existing branch. That becomes seed business for the new branch, and we push it out further and closer to where the pool density is increasing. That takes load off of the existing branch, which allows them to grow again. And then by having a new sales center on the ground in a new growing area, that allows us to grow."

And I'm with the homeowners have more money, there's a lifestyle focus outdoors. In our view, Paul, the money is tied to rising co-owners equity. But can you just walk us through and update us because it is remarkable. In terms of construction versus remodeling, what is the current landscape of -- to support what Mark has been talking about on the new construction side, what is generally your impression of how people finance or purchase pools as opposed to the repair of the remodel, which I assume is strictly out of pocket? Can you give us a little background on that, just so we can have a context for how this demand is being funded?"

Historically, there is a second mortgage market, which did a lot of the financing for pools. That market doesn't exist in the same form. However, there's a lot of home equity out there that consumers have tapped into with home equity loans, lines of credit. And they're using that for expansions of the home environment, remodeling and additions. 
At the same time, the stock market has been healthy, as you know. And so people have more discretionary spending coming from that. They've cut back other discretionary expenses. So I would say, in general, there's more discretionary funds that people have available. But at the same time, they're taking advantage of, let's call it, easy financing from home values, which have accelerated significantly over the last several years. 
So it's a combination, and it's -- roughly, my guess would be 50% to 60% of new pool purchases, which are big spends, right? So the pool itself might be $40,000 to $50,000 and then you throw in the landscaping and patio and maybe some furniture, could be $80,000, $100,000 spend. And for most people, that would be some financing involved in getting that spend completed."

So employer of choice is where this activity that you're talking about comes into play. So it starts out with making sure that we have the right resources, and frankly, that you have a plan. 
So the -- if you look at the depth of our experience bench at the leadership level, whether you're talking about the region manager or the general managers, these folks have been doing it for a very long time. And even though you're busy, when you're organized and when you're structured and you have a plan, it just works. 
Now we're busier, certainly, no question. But it's about organization and structure and tools. So the efforts that we put on capacity creation, whether it's the velocity slotting in the warehouse or POOL360 training or Blue Street. All of those things, for instance, we did a lot we felt even as busy as we were in the first quarter. Our first quarter results will pale in comparison to the second quarter. So that's where we had time and even in the fourth quarter to work on some of those things so that they pay dividends for us as we ramp up and get even busier. 
It's a process. We don't take for granted the dedication and the hard work of our folks. The results that we posted are -- would be impossible without people working very, very hard and very good leadership. But I think our bonus plan rewards those folks, right?

I simply could not be prouder of our team or more energized by these results. As you saw this morning, we announced that our first quarter sales came in at $1.1 billion, which is the first time in our history that we have crossed the $1 billion mark in the first quarter. This represents a 57% increase over the same period last year and was the result of strong demand and strong execution in virtually all our markets in North America, both blue and green, and even stronger market conditions and execution in Europe. Our dedicated and talented teams have worked very hard to ensure we provide the very best service to our customers, allowing them to help families enjoy the healthy outdoor living lifestyle that we support. 
From a geographic perspective, our 4 largest North American markets were strong. California saw a very robust 30% gain in the quarter. In Florida, we saw sales grow by 33%. In Arizona, sales grew by 29%, while Texas grew by 68% in the quarter. The February storm in Texas positively impacted our total sales by approximately 1% to 2% or $15 million to $20 million. Overall, these year-round markets are experiencing the same elevated demand and saw a 40% increase for the quarter, while seasonal markets, sales increased by 66%, highlighting the strength and depth of the industry order backlog. 
Turning to product sales. No surprises here with equipment sales posting gains of 61%, driven by strong demand for heaters, lighting, pumps, filters, all used in the maintenance and construction and remodel of swimming pools. This is following the fourth quarter gains of 51%. 
Chemical sales were up 18% in the quarter, including the effects of the increased dichlor and trichlor product pricing resulting from the previously discussed industry supply shortages for these products. We are encouraged by this growth given that the installed base grew by approximately 2% overall, which highlights greater pool usage by homeowners. 
Building material sales increased 34% in the quarter, reflecting a very healthy demand for construction and remodeling products. Retail-related product sales were up 43% in the quarter, reflecting strong confidence by our dealers and increased early-buy activity compared to last year. We believe that new pool construction was approximately 96,000 units in 2020. And with very strong permit data from our major markets, we are anticipating that 2021 new pool construction will exceed 110,000 units for the first time since the Great Recession, but still well below historical peak levels. 
Commercial pool category sales growth turned positive for the first time since the onset of the pandemic, posting 3% growth after declining for the past 3 quarters. This is an encouraging sign. With people beginning to travel more, we expect this market to continue to strengthen. For perspective, this is a relatively small part of our business, making up only 4% of our total sales. Our 2020 acquisitions are performing well and as expected, contributed significantly to overall growth, adding approximately $45 million in sales or about 4% of total net sales for the quarter. 
Now let me provide some commentary on our European operations. Our team in Europe posted some astonishing results in the first quarter with sales up 115%, with the month of March being the largest month ever for the POOLCORP team in Europe. Like in North America, consumers are investing in their backyards and keeping our dealer base extremely busy. Our team in Europe has done a tremendous job focusing on the customer experience and operating execution, which has enabled share gains in a competitive market. All countries in our Europe business are experiencing record growth, highlighted by particularly strong growth in France, Spain and Germany, the 3 largest markets. 
I would now like to provide some commentary on Horizon. We could not be happier with the trajectory that this business is on. Building on a strong fourth quarter, Horizon posted 24% base business growth in the first quarter and is poised to gain momentum throughout the year. We are confident that this platform will continue to excel, with strong execution, our team's intense focus on the customer and a robust housing market fueling demand. 
The team is assimilating the TWC Distributors acquisition that we closed in December, expanding our Florida market presence with 9 additional sales centers. Horizon is also expanding its footprint with 2 new greenfield locations opening soon in key markets in Florida and California. We will continue to strategically invest in this business. 
Turning to gross margins. We are pleased to see a 40 basis point gain for the quarter, including a 70 basis point growth in the base business. Higher volume-based purchasing incentives, a favorable sales mix and some inflation benefit combined to provide a slight lift year-over-year. 
Switching our discussion to operating expenses. We have a very good story to share. In total, operating expenses were up 17% net of the impairment expense in Q1 of 2020 and including the impact from our 4 acquisitions that we closed in 2020. Excluding the impairment last year, our base business operating expense increased only 10% on revenue growth of 51%. This led to a reduction of our overall OpEx of 650 basis points as a percentage of sales for the quarter. 
Driving this operating leverage improvements are the benefits from our capacity creation leverage, improvements are the benefit from our -- driving this operating leverage improvement are the benefits from our capacity creation activities, and the tremendous effort and dedication of our teams. 
Of note, our POOL360 sales accounted for 11% of our total sales. We saw an incredible 90% increase in revenue through the tool compared to the same period last year and a 45% increase in line volume process. 
Wrapping up the P&L brings us to the operating income line. For the quarter, we reported operating income of $129 million. This is a 263% increase over last year and brought our first quarter operating margin to 12.2% compared to 5.3% last year at the same time. This is truly an amazing performance and one that we are all quite proud of. Once again, I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the incredible execution and tireless effort that our team displayed to accomplish these amazing results. 
Now with the first quarter behind us, let me try and provide some context for how we see the remaining portion of the year shaping up. First, as noted in our previous call, our builders ended the year with a considerable backlog. This has continued to grow as homeowners' desire for a family-friendly outdoor living environment is increasing. Contractors continue reporting strong leads and contracts deep into the 2021 season with many quoting 2022 completions. 
The flexibility of the new work-from-home norm that many professionals have switched to has proven to be a catalyst for investing in home improvements, with the backyard being near the top of the list. This, along with the continuation of the de-urbanization trends, strengthening of the southern migration and more active participation of the millennial population in the housing market should be great for our industry. 
Second, we previously said that inflation would be in the 2% to 3% range, but now believe it will be in the 4% to 5% range with some products into double digits. We don't anticipate any of this getting hung up in the channel, so that will provide a tailwind for the year. Considering that most of our -- most of the cost of constructing a new pool or remodeling an existing pool is tied up in labor, we don't anticipate this inflation having a meaningful effect on demand. As it relates to nondiscretionary products such as chemicals, inflation is simply passed through again with no real effect on demand. 
Third, with demand being so strong and some manufacturers struggling to keep up, we have experienced some product shortages that, up to this point, have been manageable by utilizing the strength of our network to keep critical product flowing to our dealers and providing alternative options when certain products are in short supply. Our back orders have certainly increased in most markets, but our team has done a remarkable job taking care of our customers in a very challenging environment. 
Fourth, labor is in very high demand across all construction segments. And this continues to pressurize the industry, keeping demand greater than supply, which we have seen for many years. Crews are working longer, and the fair weather has helped expand capacity for the industry, but the labor market tightness is something that we continue to watch. 
Finally, we just announced that we have acquired Pool Source, a single source -- a single location pool distributor in the strategic Nashville, Tennessee market. We have a robust M&A pipeline that we continue to develop. Greenfield activity has picked up as well as we expect to open 7 or more new locations on the blue side this year in addition to the Horizon locations I mentioned earlier. 
Considering all of this and the amazing first quarter, our confidence in growth for the season and the rest of the year has improved considerably. As a result, we are raising our guidance for the year to $11.85 to $12.60 earnings per share from the previous guidance of $9.12 to $9.62. 
I will now turn the call over to Mark Joslin, Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, for his commentary and perspective. Mark?"

I'm going to start by commenting on the change in our guidance range for the year, which at the midpoint is up 30% from the guidance we gave on our year-end call just over 2 months ago. So what changed in that relatively short period of time",1323,"Thanks, Pete. I'm going to start by commenting on the change in our guidance range for the year, which at the midpoint is up 30% from the guidance we gave on our year-end call just over 2 months ago. So what changed in that relatively short period of time? The answer is there are a number of reasons for a more optimistic outlook, which I'll describe in order of magnitude. 
First is our very strong Q1 results and our short-term expectations as we move into the second quarter. Despite relatively average U.S. weather, Q1 market conditions built on the exceptionally strong 2020 end of year, and we're able to capitalize on that to deliver phenomenal results. This momentum has continued into the second quarter, and taken together, is meaningfully better than what we expected in February. 
Second, we've seen an acceleration in inflationary price increases announced by our vendors over the last couple of months, roughly doubling the inflationary impact we expect to see for the year from our earlier guidance of 2% to 3% on average across our product portfolio to 4% to 5% now. As vender price increases are primarily pass-throughs in the pool industry, these increases should add to our sales and gross profit opportunity for the year. 
Third, we have more clarity on positive external factors impacting our business throughout the remainder of the year. These factors include our increased confidence that new normal will be many more people working from home in the future than in the past, with greater focus on home improvement spending. This spending will be fueled in the short term by favorable homeowner dynamics, including rising home valuations, low interest rates, a healthy job market, government stimulus and greater millennial participation in the housing market. 
As our first quarter demonstrated, we generate significant operating leverage by effectively managing expense growth in vibrant market conditions. While I expect our operating leverage to decline as we progress through the year, it should be better for the year overall than our typical annual target. Finally, adding to our opportunity since February are slightly larger contributions from 2020 acquisitions and our just completed Pool Source acquisition in the Nashville market. 
Tempering our enthusiasm, to some degree, are the strains on our supply chain as many suppliers struggle to maintain product flow in the midst of this vigorous market environment and constraints on customer labor that could impact their ability to fulfill demand. Our suppliers' ability to maintain adequate product flow, particularly as we head into and through the season, will be a challenge but we believe we've adequately factored this into our projections. 
With that color on the conditions that resulted in our guidance change, I will comment briefly on our Q1 results before summarizing our expectations for the rest of the year. As I mentioned on our year-end call, a present-day Michael Angelo painting a picture of a perfect quarter might have painted our fourth quarter results. With our first quarter now behind us, it's clear that our fourth quarter was just a warmup for a true masterpiece. 
Every aspect of our first quarter performance was exceptional, top to bottom, on the P&L with excellent working capital management and cash generation. Compared to a strong Q1 last year, sales were up 57%. Operating income was more than 3.5x greater. Operating margin was more than 2x better and return on invested capital was 44% on a trailing 4-quarter basis, all record levels of performance. Obviously, our teams in the field stay focused on their customers' needs in the face of the many significant challenges facing them each and every day, took advantage of the resources available to them to create capacity, and in general, were just phenomenal. 
Now rather than doing my usual line-by-line results commentary, I believe it would be more helpful to discuss our expectations for the remainder of the year, starting with sales. As mentioned, the demand environment is very strong, and we don't see any letup here as we head into the heart of the season with acquisitions and inflation adding to our growth opportunity. These positives are tempered by potential vendor contractor labor constraints as well as our own increasingly difficult sales comps as the year progresses. 
As a reminder, our base business sales growth by quarter last year was 13%, 14%, 27% and 39%. Capacity and supply constraints potentially become more of an issue mid-season, but our year-over-year sales gains should be highest in Q2, with diminished growth as the year progresses. As usual, weather will have an important but as yet unknown impact. For the full year, we now expect the year-over-year total sales growth to be in the range of 20% plus, assuming supply constraints don't accelerate significantly. Along with the additional sales volume, our gross margin expectations for the year have also improved. On our year-end call, I forecast 20 to 40 basis points of margin decline for 2021. I would temper that now with a more modest flat to 20 basis points decline in gross margin, with the biggest challenges here coming later in the year. 
Very modest operating expense growth in relation to our sales and gross profit growth has characterized our results for the last year. While that should be the case for the year overall, our operating margin improvement should decline sequentially throughout the year as we lap favorable comps and ramp up in some discretionary expense categories that benefited our results over the last year. For the full year, I expect our operating margin will improve in excess of 100 basis points, which would be far more than our typical annual target of 20, 40 basis points -- 20 to 40 basis points. We obviously have a good start on that based on our Q1 results. 
Our tax line is an area of continued focus, so I have a couple of comments here. First, we continue to see -- continue to expect our tax rate, excluding the ASU impact, to be around 25%, as has been the case for the last several years, with a lower effective rate as we book ASU-related tax gains on the exercise of stock options and divesting of restricted stock. As we mentioned in our release, our guidance range doesn't include additional ASU benefit beyond the $0.10 we realized in the first quarter. 
Of note, there's obviously been a lot of discussion about raising corporate federal taxes, both by the administration and in Congress, with varying proposals ranging up to a 7% tax rate increase which most likely would be effective in 2022. Given the high proportion of our profit earned in the U.S., any rate increase would likely have a direct and proportional increase in our taxes paid and a corresponding reduction in earnings. The good news, if you can call it that, is that investors seem to have anticipated this and already priced it into our stock. 
Looking at our share count, you'll note that we were able to complete $66 million in share repurchases in the quarter, which resulted in 198,000 shares being repurchased at an average price of $332 a share. As has been the case historically, we believe share repurchases remain our best use for excess cash, balanced with our desire to keep a relatively conservative balance sheet, so expect more of this to come in the year ahead. For share count forecasting purposes, I laid out a detailed forecast on our last call, which I would now reduce by 300,000 shares for each remaining quarter and year-to-date period based on the Q1 repurchases completed. 
Finally, as we announced previously, I plan to retire later this year with no specific departure date set at this point. Melanie Hart, who is our current Chief Accounting Officer, has been named as my successor and is preparing to assume our CFO responsibilities. With that, I'll turn the call back to our operator to begin our question-and-answer session."

Now that simply means that people are going to move their method of sanitization to another product, either a granular product or a liquid product. But there's no shortage of ways to sanitize the pool. It just simply means at a certain point, people will shift.

So the -- if I think about it from a -- you mentioned in the Sunbelt, a lot of construction and remodel. That is absolutely true. So the backlogs in the Sunbelt for both of those things are very strong. The seasonal markets also have a very strong backlog. And because of the -- frankly, I think it was as much because of the backlog because the weather was, I would call, average for us. Because of that, I think people kept working as best they could and/or started earlier. So what we've seen is a big increase in new pool construction. And we've also seen a big backlog in the remodel. 
Now as it relates to usage, the only way that we look at that is what's going on in the maintenance side. So we use chemical usage as a proxy for that. And as I mentioned in my comments, with the installed base only being up about 2%, the fact that the chemical usage was up by like 18%, that leads us to believe that more people are using the pools, which is good for the maintenance part of our business.

As far as the capacity creation and the run rate that we're seeing, you have to consider that -- you really can't think through that unless you parse it into seasonal markets and year-round markets. 
So the year-round markets are very busy, right? But they're busy with construction and remodel because in places like Dallas, Texas and such, there aren't a whole lot of people swimming yet. But there's a lot of construction going on. So we'll see an uptick in those areas in the products that are used in the maintenance products, if you will. So our chemical spend, if the water warms up, chemical spend will go up significantly in the seasonal markets as people start using the pools more -- I'm sorry, in the year-round market. So people -- even this time of year, usage is vastly diminished over what it is in the summer months except for places like South Florida. 
So what we'll see is that there'll be -- there'll continue to be an increase, and the capacity creation initiatives that we have will continue to pay dividends in both those markets because the nature of the business will shift. So POOL360, for instance, will be -- will continue to be a big part of our productivity result. The truck utilization, the velocity slotting, all of those things continue to help us.

I tend to think of less demand, the fact that we have so much of our business tied to maintenance as well as the leverage we have in our model, which has a fair amount of incentive compensation that goes down in a kind of downside environment. But I don't know. Instead of adding a person when demand picks up, we don't have that person to let go, let's say, when the volume drops.

So there are certain positions that are in short supply for virtually every business drivers, for instance. In the construction trade, though, I mean labor has been tight for quite some time. There's certainly been some inflation on that side, but I haven't heard of crazy increases.

We -- if you go into the equipment category, so heat is in very high demand and frankly, has been for almost a year now. But again, this is where we really distinguish ourselves for our customers. Because if many of our competitors may have 1 or 2 locations in a market, and if they don't have it, they simply don't have it. But given the density that we have in most of the major markets, if I don't have it in one location, chances are I have it in another location or I have another brand. So the dealers are becoming much more brand agnostic for the products that are in the highest shortage position, which has been good for them and good ultimately for the pool owner that wants to use the pool."

I think this year, given the strong demand, it will be 110,000 plus. If you think about historically how POOLCORP has grown, we've grown by continuing to expand our network. So we try and add capacity within the 4 walls and grow the business, which is what creates the operating leverage that we've been able to do. But at a certain point, as new pool construction continues to grow and the installed base continues to grow, proximity of our locations to those pools matters. 
So there's 2 reasons for us to expand our footprint. One is we're simply out of capacity. And then when we look at the geographic circle that an individual branch or sales center covers, we simply look at and say, all right, where is the market growing? We take a piece of the existing branch. That becomes seed business for the new branch, and we push it out further and closer to where the pool density is increasing. That takes load off of the existing branch, which allows them to grow again. And then by having a new sales center on the ground in a new growing area, that allows us to grow."

And I'm with the homeowners have more money, there's a lifestyle focus outdoors. In our view, Paul, the money is tied to rising homeowners' equity. But can you just walk us through and update us because it is remarkable. In terms of construction versus remodeling, what is the current landscape of -- to support what Mark has been talking about on the new construction side, what is generally your impression of how people finance or purchase pools as opposed to the repair or the remodel, which I assume is strictly out of pocket? Can you give us a little background on that, just so we can have a context for how this demand is being funded?"

Historically, there is a second mortgage market, which did a lot of the financing for pools. That market doesn't exist in the same form. However, there's a lot of home equity out there that consumers have tapped into with home equity loans lines of credit. And they're using that for expansions of the home environment, remodeling and additions. 
At the same time, the stock market has been healthy, as you know. And so people have more discretionary spending coming from that. They've cut back other discretionary expenses. So I would say, in general, there's more discretionary funds that people have available. But at the same time, they're taking advantage of, let's call it, easy financing from home values, which have accelerated significantly over the last several years. 
So it's a combination, and it's -- roughly, my guess would be 50% to 60% of new pool purchases, which are big spends, right? So the pool itself might be $40,000 to $50,000 and then you throw in the landscaping and patio and maybe some furniture, could be $80,000, $100,000 spend. And for most people, that would be some financing involved in getting that spend completed."

So employer of choice is where this activity that you're talking about comes into play. So it starts out with making sure that we have the right resources, and frankly, that you have a plan. 
So the -- if you look at the depth of our experience bench at the leadership level, whether you're talking about the region manager or the general managers, these folks have been doing it for a very long time. And even though you're busy, when you're organized and when you're structured and you have a plan, it just works. 
Now we're busier, certainly, no question. But it's about organization and structure and tools. So the efforts that we put on capacity creation, whether it's the velocity slotting in the warehouse or POOL360 training or BlueStreak, all of those things, for instance, we did a lot we felt even as busy as we were in the first quarter. Our first quarter results will pale in comparison to the second quarter. So that's where we had time and even in the fourth quarter to work on some of those things so that they pay dividends for us as we ramp up and get even busier. 
It's a process. We don't take for granted the dedication and the hard work of our folks. The results that we posted are -- would be impossible without people working very, very hard and very good leadership. But I think our bonus plan rewards those folks, right? Because it's a total add them up for everybody. So the better the company does, then the better they do.

The steady growth that we had seen over the years kicked into overdrive as people realize that investing in their own backyard, they could enjoy a family-friendly, safe, healthy outdoor living experience right at home. 
Demand for in-ground pools, above-ground pools, luxury patios and outdoor kitchens spiked, creating demand that quickly soaked up any available builder capacity. This surge in demand has not let up and continues through today as our builders and remodelers are telling us, for the most part, they are booked through year-end, and in many cases, into 2022. Our retailers are also reporting robust store traffic as well. 
This morning, following an exceptional first quarter, we reported that our second quarter total earning -- or total sales came in at a record $1.8 billion, which is a 40% increase over the second quarter of 2020, which was up 14% over 2019. This is our largest quarter ever and our seasonally most significant quarter of the year. Thanks to the tremendous efforts and hard work of our team that is executing at an incredible level, the support from our supplier partners and the perseverance of our customers, together, we helped more people enjoy the healthy safe outdoor living experience than ever before. 
From a base business perspective, sales increased 32% with acquisitions accounting for 8% of our quarterly growth. 
Inflation, as we have previously mentioned, has been above-average this year and is trending to 5% to 6% for the year in total. This has had no meaningful impact on demand and has passed through the channel as is typically the case. Overall, the unprecedented demand for our products has strained the manufacturing capacity and supply chains in the industry. In times like this, we use our strong balance sheet, the robust network of sales centers and tremendous execution to help our customers keep projects moving forward so families can enjoy their backyard escape. By and large, the manufacturers are finding ways to increase production, which when combined with the industry seasonality, should ease some of the shortages that have plagued the industry this year, allowing supply chains to function more normally as the year progresses. 
Looking at base business in our 4 largest markets. California saw sales increase 33%, Florida sales increased 35%, Texas saw sales climbed by 30% and Arizona sales increased 24% for the quarter. Overall, our year-round base business markets increased by 31% while the seasonal markets increased by 33%. This growth is a testament to the strong demand throughout the entire business. 
Now let me provide some product sales details for our base business. Even with the strained supply chains, equipment sales, which include heaters, pumps, filters, lighting and automation, all used in the construction, remodel and maintenance of swimming pools, posted record sales up 35% in the quarter following a 62% gain in the first quarter. Again, what is most significant about this result is that it occurred in our seasonally biggest quarter when industry capacity is most challenged and our comps, the most difficult from an industry perspective. 
Chemicals, which have been a challenge to supply this year, with the widely known industry shortages, saw sales increase by 28% in the quarter. Pricing represented 19% of the increase, while volume accounted for 9. Persistent shortages in trichlor and dichlor have driven increased demand for alternatives such as liquid chlorine and calcium hypochlorite, which most recently have seen supply interruptions of their own in elevated stock-outs across our network as teams grapple with industry shortages. In most cases, this results in intermittent stock-outs across some of our network that can last a day or 2. As seasonal demand for chemicals is peaking soon, we expect the situation to ease in the coming months. 
Building material demand remains strong as construction and remodel activity is brisk. Our sales in this product category grew by 33% in the quarter, following a similar growth number in the first quarter. Retail products posted a 20% gain, driven by a larger installed base and elevated usage levels, although here too, the shortage in chemicals and other products is limiting growth. 
Commercial pool products continue to rebound as leisure travel has resumed and resort hotel and municipal pools reopened. For the quarter, sales in this product group increased 45%, coming off a weak second quarter in 2021 where sales fell by 21% due to the COVID lockdowns. Currently, sales in this category are being dominated by maintenance and repair products as large commercial construction projects are just beginning to get traction again. 
Last year, we completed 4 acquisitions, 3 blue and 1 green, and to date, we have completed 2 more blue acquisition. All are performing well and being integrated into our network, which will make them even better. Our deal pipeline and expansion plans are robust and remain a focus area for the business. Year-to-date 2021, we have opened 9 new locations, 7 on the blue side and 2 on the green side. 
Let me now take you across the Atlantic and provide some commentary on our European business. Sales remains brisk and growth strong. For the second quarter, we saw sales grow by 42%, bringing the year-to-date growth to an incredible 62%. Our team is executing at the highest level and benefiting from a similarly strong market that we are seeing in North America. Being a multiline distributor versus a distributor manufacturer allows us to be more flexible and provide customers more options in a supply-constrained environment. This has allowed us to take significant share. 
Turning to our Horizon business. We are very pleased to report that sales growth continues to be strong as the business posted another terrific quarter, with sales up 31%. For the same period, base business sales increased 24% versus last year. As mentioned above, year-to-date, we have opened 2 new locations, one in California and the other in Florida, while continuing to execute our strategic plan of organic growth, greenfield expansion and acquisitions as we develop our pipeline in targeted areas. 
Let me now switch my commentary to gross margin, expenses and operating income. First, on gross margins, we are very pleased to have reported a gain of 170 basis points for the quarter and a 200 basis point gain from our base business. This improvement was driven by supply chain execution, inflation benefits and product mix. Melanie will provide more color on this topic. 
Operating expense performance was spectacular, given the volume growth. Our OpEx as a percentage of sales improved by 117 basis points for the quarter has been driven by the team's execution and a relentless focus on capacity creation activity. POOL360 sales grew by 56% and accounted for 12% of our sales for the quarter. The importance of this tool continues to increase as it enables both our customers and  POOLCORP to be more efficient in how we operate. 
Wrapping up the income statement, I could not be prouder of what our team delivered in operating income. The record $339 million in operating income for the quarter was a 64% increase over the same period last year. Our team's skilled dedication and commitment to the customer experience is second to none. This, along with the benefits of our business model, continue to set us apart from the competition and enable us to continue to take share in this challenging environment. Our ability to consistently drive organic growth and manage our cost structure through execution and capacity creation is a testament to the team here at POOLCORP. 
With this in mind, and the half of the year behind us, we are raising and narrowing our EPS guidance for the year from previously $11.85 to $12.60 to $13.75 to $14.25 per diluted share, including the $0.29 year-to-date tax benefit that we have received. 
Looking forward, there are several factors and trends that give us confidence for continued growth beyond 2021. First, single-family -- the single-family housing market remained strong, driven by millennials entering the housing market for the first time, de-urbanization and the southern migration, all of which are very positive factors for both the blue and the green business. As people move to the Sunbelt states with longer outdoor living season, they see the value of investing in a pool, patio, outdoor kitchen or remodel project, which is driving demand for our products. 
Second, the work-from-home change that has swept across North America is also creating more time to enjoy a luxury backyard retreat. This trend looks like it will continue longer term. 
Third, new products such as automation and the connected pool simply increase our sales opportunity on every project as people become familiar with this new user-friendly technology. Fourth, new in-ground pool installations were 96,000 pools last year and our forecast to more than 110,000 pools this year as our business -- as our builders are reporting stronger backlogs that continue into 2022. Each new pool adds to the maintenance and repair market, which going forward, which by far is the largest part of our industry. 
Fifth, inflation, which is higher than normal this year, will likely continue with elevated levels into 2022. Sixth, the new variable speed pump legislation that goes into effect this month will add $30 million to $40 million of incremental revenue opportunity going forward. Seventh, our relentless focus on the customer experience and our expansion plans are allowing us to take significant share, and we see that continuing going forward. 
Finally, acquisitions will continue to play a role in our growth as we continue to build and execute our deal pipeline as part of our strategic plan. As you can see, we have many reasons to be optimistic about the future, and we expect to continue the track record of success that we have demonstrated over the years. 
I will now turn the call over to Melanie Hart for her financial commentary."

As Pete has provided an overview of our sales activity in the quarter, I will begin my commentary with some additional discussions on gross margin. 
Gross margins increased 170 basis points during the quarter, with base business gross margins up 200 basis points. These increases exceeded the expectations expressed on our first quarter call. First, we saw benefits from our supply chain initiatives, which included a focus on accelerating purchases ahead of vendor price increases to limit stock out where possible in today's tight supply conditions. Next, with our increased purchase volumes, we also expect improvements in the rate under our vendor programs. Additionally, we realized some improvements in gross margin during the 2021 second quarter from product mix changes as a larger portion of our sales was comprised of lower margin, bigger ticket items in prior year. Lastly, customer mix changes also had a positive impact on margins for the quarter. 
Moving down the P&L to expenses. Our consolidated quarter-to-date operating expenses were up 27%, with base business operating expenses increasing 18% over prior year on base business sales growth of 32%. Base business operating expenses were down 140 basis points as a percentage of sales. Variable expenses, such as those related to personnel and freight costs, that are necessary to serve our increased business activity, were very well-managed by the team during the quarter. Included in these expenses is our performance-based compensation. We recorded an additional $7 million over prior year during the quarter and $19 million more year-to-date, given our exceptionally strong performance. 
Operating margin grew 280 basis points to 18.9% for the quarter. The 5 acquisitions added since the second quarter of last year have performed well, contributing $11 million or 11% operating margin. The operating margin contribution from these acquisitions was below our base business operating margins and like underperforming sales centers and new locations, of which we opened 9 new locations in the past 12 months, represent additional opportunity for operating income growth over time. 
Interest expense declined from the same time last year as lower debt levels resulted in lower overall borrowing costs. Our average debt for second quarter 2021 was $376.8 million compared to the same period last year of $493.4 million. Our recurring tax rate continues to be around 25% on pretax earnings. We realized an additional ASU tax benefit of $7.7 million or $0.19 per share from stock option exercises that occurred during the quarter, bringing the reported rate to 22.9% for the quarter. 
I'll now move to our balance sheet and cash flows. Our growth in current assets over last year reflects an increase in total net receivables of 29%, including the effect of acquisitions made after the second quarter of last year. This was driven by sales growth in the quarter, offset by strong collections activity. We realized a reduction in DSO or day sales outstanding, to 25.8 days, down from 28.5 days during the same quarter last year. Inventories were up in total 42% or 36%, not considering the inventories we added for acquisitions. We continue to leverage our capital strength and sourcing scale to add to inventories to support the demand increases and maintain customer service levels. 
Inventory turns on a trailing 4-quarter basis increased to 4.1 from 3.5 in second quarter of 2020. Cash provided by operations through the end of June was $187.2 million. This is down $33.9 million from the same quarter last year, primarily due to increased inventory investments. Prior year also benefited from deferred tax payments that shifted from June to July in 2020 and as part of the COVID Relief Package. Cash flows for the year are expected to remain strong, but we may continue to prioritize investments in inventory over cash generation as we believe our strong inventory position has allowed us to gain share. 
For the year, we've also been focused on returning excess cash to shareholders. In May, the Board increased the authorization of share buyback by $450 million. During the quarter, we spent $19 million in addition to the $66 million repurchased in first quarter, returning a total of $85 million to shareholders year-to-date. These repurchases resulted in total shares acquired of almost 243,000 for an average price paid of $348, leaving $542 million on our repurchase authority. We also increased the quarterly dividend rate during the quarter by 38%. Our debt levels remained lower than our targeted range with a trailing 12-month ratio of 0.5 at quarter end, giving us substantial capacity and flexibility to support our business needs and execute on capital investment opportunities. 
I'll now turn the call over to Mark to provide comments on our expectations for the remainder of the year."

I'll start my comments today with some perspective on our second quarter financial results. 
For each of the last 2 quarters, I've alluded to our results looking like the work of some sort of modern-day renaissance master. In hindsight, I think I should have saved my superlatives for the Q2 results, which are the real work of the master. At the peak of the season, when demand is greatest, our customers' needs are most urgent and our supply chain is the most stretched. Delivering the kind of results we achieved this quarter is the embodiment of a team effort that is truly exceptional and demonstrates an incredibly high level of execution. Our second quarter was a culmination of a frenetic year in the pool industry that really showcased the talent of our team as well as the value of our business model. 
Looking back over the last year, our trailing 12 months of financial highlights included 40% revenue growth and cumulative sales of $4.8 billion, 84 basis points of gross margin expansion and 350 basis points of operating margin expansion while delivering a return on invested capital of 50%, all remarkable results. In addition, we had a balanced deployment of capital over this 12-month period, with $125 million in capital used to acquire 5 companies and nearly $200 million returned to shareholders, evenly split between dividends and share repurchases. And we invested $26 million in PP&E, primarily to support investments in technology in new locations. 
We also invested just over $200 million in working capital in 2021, ahead of our seasonal business peak to be in the best position possible to serve our customers throughout our supply-constrained environment. As a matter of note, our sales growth over the last year of $1.4 billion was just a bit more than our total sales when I joined the company back in 2004. Clearly, our marketplace has evolved at a rapid pace over the course of the last year and has our performance and our outlook for the future, which continues to be very positive. 
At this point, I'll share some insights into the factors included in our guidance range. Using the midpoint of our new guidance range is a majoring stick and comparing the new range to the old, you can see that we raised our expectations by 15% for the year. This is a result of 3 factors: better overall Q2 performance than expected with higher sales growth and bigger gross margin gains than we had factored into our previous range; expectations for somewhat higher sales growth and better gross margin performance for the remainder of the year; and lastly, the $7.7 million or $0.19 share benefit from our ASU tax gain in the second quarter that was not in our previous range. 
Our previous range had anticipated sales growth for the year in excess of 20%. Our new range, which, of course, has Q2 baked into it, anticipate sales growth in excess of 25% for the year, with greater growth in Q3 than in Q4 as costs become increasingly difficult. As a reminder, our Q3 2020 sales growth was 27%, while Q4 2020 sales growth was 44%, which was aided by very favorable weather conditions and included acquisitions which will be lacked this year. 
While we assume normal weather for the rest of the year in our guidance range, favorable fourth quarter weather this year, could see us reach a milestone of $5 billion in revenue for the full year. As I noted, our gross margin expectations for the remainder of the year have also improved, with year-over-year gross margin gains now anticipated in both the third and fourth quarters, though much less improvement in the fourth quarter, given the 70 basis points of margin pickup we recorded in Q4 of 2020. 
Despite inflationary pressures on our operating costs and growth in certain discretionary business expenses that have been pared back during the pandemic, we expect to continue to manage expense as well and could achieve as much as 250 to 300 basis points operating margin improvement in 2021 over 2020, with the majority of additional gains for the back half of the year coming in Q3. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to our operator to begin our question-and-answer session."

I guess, structural versus transitory. That's an interesting way, I guess, phrasing it. I think, first of all, when you look at the margin gains in the second quarter, as Melanie kind of went through them, we got some benefit from last year, a little bit of margin pressure from the bigger ticket, lower-margin sales that we had that we didn't have in the second quarter this year. And frankly, we don't expect going forward. So that's really not transitory. 
The -- one benefit we mentioned, customer mix. Part of that relates to Internet sales. So we do sell to Internet retailers and store-based retailers. And given the lower margin on Internet and the supply outages, we didn't have as much growth there as we had in our store-based retail. Is that going to come back in the future? It's possible, but I see that being longer term, perhaps not necessarily over the next year or more, given the higher pace of revenue growth in the industry and the need to continue to prioritize store-based sales for us. 
We have those kind of supply chain initiatives that we discussed, which also involve the inflation that we've seen. And as Pete mentioned in his comments, we expect continued inflation as we move through the rest of this year and into next year. So that may not -- well, certainly won't be a long-term issue. I don't see that being an issue over the next 12 to 18 months. And then vendor incentives, Melanie mentioned as well. And that's something that we'll be working through with our vendors in terms of what that looks like going forward. And I don't want to try to predict that at this point. 
So I think there's a combination there. But I feel pretty positive about the margin gains, certainly continuing through the rest of this year and into next year, and then we'll see what happens after that. So a long answer to your question. A good question and hopefully give you a little bit of insight."

And second, if we could talk about the kind of deconstructing the growth. Pete, I think you mentioned that chemicals unit volumes are up like 9%, which if I think about that 60% of your business, which is maintenance and minor repair that probably correlates fairly well. So the outsized growth you're seeing has to be coming from the refurb of the new pools. And I think you've talked about new pools being up like from 96,000 last year to 110,000 this year, which is kind of teens growth. So that leaves us with the refurbishment as well as the content in those pools. Can you just touch on kind of when you see this outsized growth and we sort of know the pieces that aren't growing at 40%, sort of what pieces do you see driving those? And how sustainable are those factors?"

So last year, new construction was up 26%. So this year, we think the new number is going to be 110. So when you have new cool construction that you're bringing in to play a lot of different product groups, right? So you're bringing in building materials, which from a year-over-year comp perspective, remember, the second quarter of last year, we had essentially little to no construction in many markets across the country because of restrictions due to COVID. So that has certainly rebounded. So we see the building materials or construction materials, product sales driving growth, and that's a function that's going into 2 places, right? It's going into remodel, which by far is the bigger portion of the market. I mean, a lot of folks zero in on the new construction, is new construction going to be 110, 112, 115, whatever. To me, that is -- it's all good, but the lion's share of the market and where we're seeing a lot of activity as well is in remodel. 
So when I look at the growth and one of the major drivers of our growth is, A, the pools are being used more, right? So just general maintenance equipment is a piece of that as technology. We're seeing more homeowners adopt or opt for technology or more high-tech products, smarter products, which is, again, driving the value of the ticket for us. And then when you do a remodel project, those can go from a few thousand dollars for a new piece of equipment to -- all the way up to resurfacing the pool and adding decks and patios around it, changing tiles and changing structural features in the pool, all of which are very good. And again, the opportunity for that, given the age of the installed base is very, very good."

But when you look at it in terms of days of inventory, we're actually down. We -- this is where -- in this environment is where a company like POOLCORP really excels because we use the strength of the balance sheet to kind of lean in to make sure that we have product available for our builders. So part of it is that there's still periodic shortages of product. And every -- but that's a widely known fact. 
But what happens is it could be one product, right? So if I look at the inventory balance in total, it could be a couple of products that are missing for -- to ship a job complete. So when that comes in, it will go. But by and large, it's a couple of factors. One, business is up. So our days of inventory are down because of the shortages. We are buying ahead certainly to make sure that we have as much product as we can. And then we're still dealing with intermittent shortages of specific items that may be holding up the shipment of of a complete job."

But I think given the -- how desirable the space is, outdoor living and pools and patios and such, I think builders are growing more comfortable and more confident in the opportunity, and they're starting to add labor to their teams. Now there hasn't been a step function increase in that yet. But I can tell you, having been here for almost 5 years, that's not been a common thread that we see crews expanding.

So by the time, it has a meaningful impact on the industry, it will be later in the year. So from a chemicals perspective, I don't see a whole lot of change in that area.

So in terms of maintenance and repair, if you need a filter, you need a filter. And if you need a pump, you need a pump.

So it's nothing you'd say, wow, I'm not going to change the filter because it costs 5% more. I have to do it in order to keep the pool operating. 
So in terms of maintenance and repair, we see very little impact. Your question on inflation as it relates to construction is a little bit different because depending on the type of pool construction, it can have a a bigger impact on the total project. But one of the things that we have -- you have to consider when you think that through, is that most of the cost of a backyard project, whether it's a renovation or whether it's a new construction project, most of that cost, in most cases, is labor, right? So in terms of a material cost increase and if there is inflation next year, is, again, what we think, above normal, I don't think it will have a material impact on demand and somebody deciding that I am going to do the project or I'm not given how the cost lays into the project."

And in part, I think I've mentioned this before, at some point, leverage is easier when sales growth is higher. So we've had obviously great sales growth over the last year and this year, and that makes getting that SG&A leverage a little bit easier. 
But at the same time, we've talked a lot about capacity creation initiatives, and those are things that we do throughout the organization to focus on getting more out of existing investments. And that is a big part of our operational initiatives, and we've made good progress there. We have more to come. We also pared back expenses during the pandemic initially. We talked about that last year. We're seeing some growth in those costs and gross and other cost areas. As we mentioned, things like leases and labor. Insurance is another area. And then incentives, we talked about incentive costs were up substantially last year. We thought they'd be down this year, year-over-year. We talked about that earlier in the year. And in fact, they're going to be up. So those are a big component of the cost structure and should be coming down next year. Most likely, it will be a tailwind for. So a lot of different components there. I think that if I look at our long-term model, I feel good about the opportunity to continue to provide operating leverage. And that is going to continue to be a big focus for us, which is in that kind of mid-teens plus area in terms of operating leverage we expect.

We're always going after price, prebuying, creating these swings in demand, which affected pricing. came to that category via needing to get price, and then they just realize margins can be better.

I mean, I can't express how hard our teams are working to do what we do in a tight constrained environment because they are having to move product from one location to another and to coordinate deliveries and really look very specifically at what days people need things so that we get product to them. 
This is where we separate ourselves, though, because in most markets, we're the only ones that have multiple locations. And nobody has as many locations as we do. Nobody has the buying power to place the orders as big as we do in the beginning anyway. So we're doing that. We're working very hard to make sure that we can take care of the customers.

Beginning in May of last year, as the country came to grips with the pandemic and its effects on everyday life across North America and Europe, homeowners' interest in swimming pools and anythin",1695,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning to everyone on the call. 
Beginning in May of last year, as the country came to grips with the pandemic and its effects on everyday life across North America and Europe, homeowners' interest in swimming pools and anything to do with outdoor living surged. The steady growth that we had seen over the years kicked into overdrive as people realized that investing in their own backyard, they could enjoy a family-friendly, safe, healthy outdoor living experience right at home. 
Demand for in-ground pools, above-ground pools, luxury patios and outdoor kitchens spiked, creating demand that quickly soaked up any available builder capacity. This surge in demand has not let up and continues through today as our builders and remodelers are telling us, for the most part, they are booked through year-end, and in many cases, into 2022. Our retailers are also reporting robust store traffic as well. 
This morning, following an exceptional first quarter, we reported that our second quarter total earning -- or total sales came in at a record $1.8 billion, which is a 40% increase over the second quarter of 2020, which was up 14% over 2019. This is our largest quarter ever and our seasonally most significant quarter of the year. Thanks to the tremendous efforts and hard work of our team that is executing at an incredible level, the support from our supplier partners and the perseverance of our customers, together, we helped more people enjoy the healthy, safe outdoor living experience than ever before. From a base business perspective, sales increased 32% with acquisitions accounting for 8% of our quarterly growth. 
Inflation, as we have previously mentioned, has been above-average this year and is trending to 5% to 6% for the year in total. This has had no meaningful impact on demand and has passed through the channel as is typically the case. Overall, the unprecedented demand for our products has strained the manufacturing capacity and supply chains in the industry. In times like this, we use our strong balance sheet, the robust network of sales centers and tremendous execution to help our customers keep projects moving forward so families can enjoy their backyard escape. By and large, the manufacturers are finding ways to increase production, which when combined with the industry seasonality, should ease some of the shortages that have plagued the industry this year, allowing supply chains to function more normally as the year progresses. 
Looking at base business in our 4 largest markets. California saw sales increase 33%, Florida sales increased 35%, Texas saw sales climb by 30% and Arizona sales increased 24% for the quarter. Overall, our year-round base business markets increased by 31% while the seasonal markets increased by 33%. This growth is a testament to the strong demand throughout the entire business. 
Now let me provide some product sales details for our base business. Even with the strained supply chains, equipment sales, which include heaters, pumps, filters, lighting and automation, all used in the construction, remodel and maintenance of swimming pools, posted record sales up 35% in the quarter following a 62% gain in the first quarter. Again, what is most significant about this result is that it occurred in our seasonally biggest quarter when industry capacity is most challenged and our comps, the most difficult from an industry perspective. 
Chemicals, which have been a challenge to supply this year, with the widely known industry shortages, saw sales increase by 28% in the quarter. Pricing represented 19% of the increase, while volume accounted for 9%. Persistent shortages in trichlor and dichlor have driven increased demand for alternatives such as liquid chlorine and calcium hypochlorite, which most recently have seen supply interruptions of their own in elevated stock-outs across our network as teams grapple with industry shortages. In most cases, this results in intermittent stock-outs across some of our network that can last a day or 2. As seasonal demand for chemicals is peaking soon, we expect the situation to ease in the coming months. 
Building material demand remains strong as construction and remodel activity is brisk. Our sales in this product category grew by 33% in the quarter, following a similar growth number in the first quarter. Retail products posted a 20% gain, driven by a larger installed base and elevated usage levels, although here too, the shortage in chemicals and other products is limiting growth. 
Commercial pool products continue to rebound as leisure travel has resumed and resort, hotel and municipal pools reopened. For the quarter, sales in this product group increased 45%, coming off a weak second quarter in 2021 where sales fell by 21% due to the COVID lockdowns. Currently, sales in this category are being dominated by maintenance and repair products as large commercial construction projects are just beginning to get traction again. 
Last year, we completed 4 acquisitions, 3 blue and 1 green, and to date, we have completed 2 more blue acquisition. All are performing well and being integrated into our network, which will make them even better. Our deal pipeline and expansion plans are robust and remain a focus area for the business. Year-to-date 2021, we have opened 9 new locations, 7 on the blue side and 2 on the green side. 
Let me now take you across the Atlantic and provide some commentary on our European business. Sales remains brisk and growth strong. For the second quarter, we saw sales grow by 42%, bringing the year-to-date growth to an incredible 62%. Our team is executing at the highest level and benefiting from a similarly strong market that we are seeing in North America. Being a multiline distributor versus a distributor manufacturer allows us to be more flexible and provide customers more options in a supply-constrained environment. This has allowed us to take significant share. 
Turning to our Horizon business. We are very pleased to report that sales growth continues to be strong as the business posted another terrific quarter, with sales up 31%. For the same period, base business sales increased 24% versus last year. As mentioned above, year-to-date, we have opened 2 new locations, one in California and the other in Florida, while continuing to execute our strategic plan of organic growth, greenfield expansion and acquisitions as we develop our pipeline in targeted areas. 
Let me now switch my commentary to gross margin, expenses and operating income. First, on gross margins, we are very pleased to have reported a gain of 170 basis points for the quarter and a 200 basis point gain from our base business. This improvement was driven by supply chain execution, inflation benefits and product mix. Melanie will provide more color on this topic. 
Operating expense performance was spectacular, given the volume growth. Our OpEx as a percentage of sales improved by 117 basis points for the quarter has been driven by the team's execution and a relentless focus on capacity creation activity. POOL360 sales grew by 56% and accounted for 12% of our sales for the quarter. The importance of this tool continues to increase as it enables both our customers and  POOLCORP to be more efficient in how we operate. 
Wrapping up the income statement, I could not be prouder of what our team delivered in operating income. The record $339 million in operating income for the quarter was a 64% increase over the same period last year. Our team's skilled dedication and commitment to the customer experience is second to none. This, along with the benefits of our business model, continue to set us apart from the competition and enable us to continue to take share in this challenging environment. Our ability to consistently drive organic growth and manage our cost structure through execution and capacity creation is a testament to the team here at POOLCORP. 
With this in mind, and the half of the year behind us, we are raising and narrowing our EPS guidance for the year from previously $11.85 to $12.60 to $13.75 to $14.25 per diluted share, including the $0.29 year-to-date tax benefit that we have received. 
Looking forward, there are several factors and trends that give us confidence for continued growth beyond 2021. First, single-family -- the single-family housing market remained strong, driven by millennials entering the housing market for the first time, de-urbanization and the Southern migration, all of which are very positive factors for both the blue and the green business. As people move to the Sun Belt states with longer outdoor living season, they see the value of investing in a pool, patio, outdoor kitchen or remodel project, which is driving demand for our products. 
Second, the work-from-home change that has swept across North America is also creating more time to enjoy a luxury backyard retreat. This trend looks like it will continue longer term. 
Third, new products such as automation and the connected pool simply increase our sales opportunity on every project as people become familiar with this new user-friendly technology. 
Fourth, new in-ground pool installations were 96,000 pools last year and our forecast is to grow to more than 110,000 pools this year as our business -- as our builders are reporting stronger backlogs that continue into 2022. Each new pool adds to the maintenance and repair market, which going forward, which by far is the largest part of our industry. 
Fifth, inflation, which is higher than normal this year, will likely continue with elevated levels into 2022. 
Sixth, the new variable speed pump legislation that goes into effect this month will add $30 million to $40 million of incremental revenue opportunity going forward. 
Seventh, our relentless focus on the customer experience and our expansion plans are allowing us to take significant share, and we see that continuing going forward. 
Finally, acquisitions will continue to play a role in our growth as we continue to build and execute our deal pipeline as part of our strategic plan. As you can see, we have many reasons to be optimistic about the future, and we expect to continue the track record of success that we have demonstrated over the years. 
I will now turn the call over to Melanie Hart for her financial commentary."

As Pete has provided an overview of our sales activity in the quarter, I will begin my commentary with some additional discussions on gross margin. 
Gross margins increased 170 basis points during the quarter, with base business gross margins up 200 basis points. These increases exceeded the expectations expressed on our first quarter call. First, we saw benefits from our supply chain initiatives, which included a focus on accelerating purchases ahead of vendor price increases to limit stock-outs where possible in today's tight supply conditions. Next, with our increased purchase volumes, we also expect improvements in the rate earned under our vendor programs. Additionally, we realized some improvements in gross margin during the 2021 second quarter from product mix changes as a larger portion of our sales was comprised of lower margin, bigger ticket items in prior year. Lastly, customer mix changes also had a positive impact on margins for the quarter. 
Moving down the P&L to expenses. Our consolidated quarter-to-date operating expenses were up 27%, with base business operating expenses increasing 18% over prior year on base business sales growth of 32%. Base business operating expenses were down 140 basis points as a percentage of sales. Variable expenses, such as those related to personnel and freight costs that are necessary to serve our increased business activity, were very well-managed by the team during the quarter. Included in these expenses is our performance-based compensation. We recorded an additional $7 million over prior year during the quarter and $19 million more year-to-date, given our exceptionally strong performance. 
Operating margin grew 280 basis points to 18.9% for the quarter. The 5 acquisitions added since the second quarter of last year have performed well, contributing $11 million -- or 11% operating margin. The operating margin contribution from these acquisitions was below our base business operating margins and like underperforming sales centers and new locations, of which we opened 9 new locations in the past 12 months, represent additional opportunity for operating income growth over time. 
Interest expense declined from the same time last year as lower debt levels resulted in lower overall borrowing costs. Our average debt for second quarter 2021 was $376.8 million compared to the same period last year of $493.4 million. Our recurring tax rate continues to be around 25% on pretax earnings. We realized an additional ASU tax benefit of $7.7 million or $0.19 per share from stock option exercises that occurred during the quarter, bringing the reported rate to 22.9% for the quarter. 
I'll now move to our balance sheet and cash flows. Our growth in current assets over last year reflects an increase in total net receivables of 29%, including the effect of acquisitions made after the second quarter of last year. This was driven by sales growth in the quarter, offset by strong collections activity. We realized a reduction in DSO, or day sales outstanding, to 25.8 days, down from 28.5 days during the same quarter last year. Inventories were up in total 42% or 36%, not considering the inventories we added for acquisitions. We continue to leverage our capital strength and sourcing scale to add to inventories to support the demand increases and maintain customer service levels. 
Inventory turns on a trailing 4-quarter basis increased to 4.1 from 3.5 in second quarter of 2020. Cash provided by operations through the end of June was $187.2 million. This is down $33.9 million from the same quarter last year, primarily due to increased inventory investments. Prior year also benefited from deferred tax payments that shifted from June to July in 2020 as part of the COVID relief package. Cash flows for the year are expected to remain strong, but we may continue to prioritize investments in inventory over cash generation as we believe our strong inventory position has allowed us to gain share. 
For the year, we've also been focused on returning excess cash to shareholders. In May, the Board increased the authorization of share buyback by $450 million. During the quarter, we spent $19 million in addition to the $66 million repurchased in first quarter, returning a total of $85 million to shareholders year-to-date. These repurchases resulted in total shares acquired of almost 243,000 for an average price paid of $348, leaving $542 million on our repurchase authority. We also increased the quarterly dividend rate during the quarter by 38%. Our debt levels remained lower than our targeted range with a trailing 12-month ratio of 0.5 at quarter end, giving us substantial capacity and flexibility to support our business needs and execute on capital investment opportunities. 
I'll now turn the call over to Mark to provide comments on our expectations for the remainder of the year."

I'll start my comments today with some perspective on our second quarter financial results. 
For each of the last 2 quarters, I've alluded to our results looking like the work of some sort of modern-day renaissance master. In hindsight, I think I should have saved my superlatives for the Q2 results, which are the real work of the master. At the peak of the season, when demand is greatest, our customers' needs are most urgent and our supply chain is the most stretched. Delivering the kind of results we achieved this quarter is the embodiment of a team effort that is truly exceptional and demonstrates an incredibly high level of execution. Our second quarter was the culmination of a frenetic year in the pool industry that really showcased the talent of our team as well as the value of our business model. 
Looking back over the last year, our trailing 12 months of financial highlights included 40% revenue growth and cumulative sales of $4.8 billion, 84 basis points of gross margin expansion and 350 basis points of operating margin expansion while delivering a return on invested capital of 50%, all remarkable results. In addition, we had a balanced deployment of capital over this 12-month period, with $125 million in capital used to acquire 5 companies and nearly $200 million returned to shareholders, evenly split between dividends and share repurchases. And we invested $26 million in PP&E, primarily to support investments in technology in new locations. 
We also invested just over $200 million in working capital in 2021, ahead of our seasonal business peak to be in the best position possible to serve our customers throughout our supply-constrained environment. As a matter of note, our sales growth over the last year of $1.4 billion was just a bit more than our total sales when I joined the company back in 2004. Clearly, our marketplace has evolved at a rapid pace over the course of the last year and has our performance and our outlook for the future, which continues to be very positive. 
At this point, I'll share some insights into the factors included in our guidance range. Using the midpoint of our new guidance range as a measuring stick and comparing the new range to the old, you can see that we raised our expectations by 15% for the year. This is a result of 3 factors: better overall Q2 performance than expected with higher sales growth and bigger gross margin gains than we had factored into our previous range; expectations for somewhat higher sales growth and better gross margin performance for the remainder of the year; and lastly, the $7.7 million or $0.19 share benefit from our ASU tax gain in the second quarter that was not in our previous range. 
Our previous range had anticipated sales growth for the year in excess of 20%. Our new range, which, of course, has Q2 baked into it, anticipate sales growth in excess of 25% for the year, with greater growth in Q3 than in Q4 as costs become increasingly difficult. As a reminder, our Q3 2020 sales growth was 27%, while Q4 2020 sales growth was 44%, which was aided by very favorable weather conditions and included acquisitions which will be lacked this year. 
While we assume normal weather for the rest of the year in our guidance range, favorable fourth quarter weather this year could see us reach a milestone of $5 billion in revenue for the full year. As I noted, our gross margin expectations for the remainder of the year have also improved, with year-over-year gross margin gains now anticipated in both the third and fourth quarters, though much less improvement in the fourth quarter, given the 70 basis points of margin pickup we recorded in Q4 of 2020. 
Despite inflationary pressures on our operating costs and growth in certain discretionary business expenses that have been pared back during the pandemic, we expect to continue to manage expenses well and could achieve as much as 250 to 300 basis points operating margin improvement in 2021 over 2020, with the majority of additional gains for the back half of the year coming in Q3. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to our operator to begin our question-and-answer session."

This quarter, you clearly jumped outside of the typical band for a second quarter. And you sort of implied that the back half would continue to be higher year-on-year.

I guess structural versus transitory, that's an interesting way, I guess, phrasing it. I think, first of all, when you look at the margin gains in the second quarter, as Melanie kind of went through them, we got some benefit from last year, a little bit of margin pressure from the bigger ticket, lower-margin sales that we had that we didn't have in the second quarter this year. And frankly, we don't expect going forward. So that's really not transitory. 
The one benefit we mentioned, customer mix. Part of that relates to Internet sales. So we do sell to Internet retailers and store-based retailers. And given the lower margin on Internet and the supply outages, we didn't have as much growth there as we had in our store-based retail. Is that going to come back in the future? It's possible, but I see that being longer term, perhaps not necessarily over the next year or more, given the higher pace of revenue growth in the industry and the need to continue to prioritize store-based sales for us. 
We have those kind of supply chain initiatives that we discussed, which also involve the inflation that we've seen. And as Pete mentioned in his comments, we expect continued inflation as we move through the rest of this year and into next year. So that may not -- well, certainly won't be a long-term issue. I don't see that being an issue over the next 12 to 18 months. And then vendor incentives, Melanie mentioned as well. And that's something that we'll be working through with our vendors in terms of what that looks like going forward. And I don't want to try to predict that at this point. 
So I think there's a combination there. But I feel pretty positive about the margin gains certainly continuing through the rest of this year and into next year, and then we'll see what happens after that. So a long answer to your question. A good question and hopefully gave you a little bit of insight."

And second, if we could talk about the kind of deconstructing the growth. Pete, I think you mentioned that chemicals' unit volumes are up like 9%, which if I think about that 60% of your business, which is maintenance and minor repair, that probably correlates fairly well. So the outsized growth you're seeing has to be coming from the refurb of the new pools. And I think you've talked about new pools being up like from 96,000 last year to 110,000 this year, which is kind of teens growth. So that leaves us with the refurbishment as well as the content in those pools. Can you just touch on kind of when you see this outsized growth and we sort of know the pieces that aren't growing at 40%, sort of what pieces do you see driving those? And how sustainable are those factors?"

I think when you try and deconstruct the growth, we commented on the chemical volume, you zeroed in on a couple of things. The new construction going from 96,000. So last year, new construction was up 26%. So this year, we think the new number is going to be 110,000. So when you have new pool construction that you're bringing into play a lot of different product groups, right? 
So you're bringing in building materials, which from a year-over-year comp perspective, remember, the second quarter of last year, we had essentially little to no construction in many markets across the country because of restrictions due to COVID. So that has certainly rebounded. So we see the building materials or construction materials' product sales driving growth, and that's a function that's going into 2 places, right? It's going into remodel, which by far is the bigger portion of the market. I mean a lot of folks zero in on the new construction. Is new construction going to be 110,000, 112,000, 115,000, whatever? To me, that is -- it's all good, but the lion's share of the market and where we're seeing a lot of activity as well is in remodel. 
So when I look at the growth and one of the major drivers of our growth is, a, the pools are being used more, right? So just general maintenance equipment is a piece of that as technology. We're seeing more homeowners adopt or opt for technology or more high-tech products, smarter products, which is, again, driving the value of the ticket for us. And then when you do a remodel project, those can go from a few thousand dollars for a new piece of equipment to all the way up to resurfacing the pool and adding decks and patios around it, changing tiles and changing structural features in the pool, all of which are very good. And again, the opportunity for that, given the age of the installed base, is very, very good."

But if you focus just on construction, so with pool builds going from, let's call it, 75,000, 80,000 to 90,000 to 100,000, 110,000, those are typically larger customers that are doing the construction",167,"I mean the mix question is kind of a complicated one.

But that's just one part of the overall story in margin. There's a lot of other things going on there. We're selling more building materials which are a higher-margin category for us, and that's growing. And we have other product categories that are higher-margin growing as well. So I wouldn't focus just on the construction and that piece of it because if you look back over time, our margins have been very stable. Even with growth from 2010, really up through 2020 of construction, we've managed a very stable gross margin story. So does that answer your question, Susan?"

And as you know, labor has been the single biggest limiting factor on the industry growth over time. But I think given the -- how desirable the space is, outdoor living and pools and patios and such, I think builders are growing more comfortable and more confident in the opportunity, and they're starting to add labor to their teams. 
Now there hasn't been a step function increase in that yet. But I can tell you, having been here for almost 5 years, that's not been a common thread that we see crews expanding. But I think what we've seen year-to-date this year are some very positive signs in that area."

I think if I deconstruct what you said for a moment, on the chemical side, I don't think the chemical situation will return to normal, in my opinion, until probably the third quarter, end of third quarter, fourth quarter of next year because our information on when the plant come back online puts it out into the end of second quarter for a start-up. So by the time, it has a meaningful impact on the industry, it will be later in the year. So from a chemicals perspective, I don't see a whole lot of change in that area.

You mentioned you haven't seen any impact from inflation on demand. But if we're going to be in a modest inflationary environment again next year, I mean, is there a point in which inflation is going to start to impact volumes? I mean, I guess do you worry at all about price elasticity at all? Or are there are any lessons from this experience this year that makes you feel even more confident about the, I guess, the pool owners' ability to withstand much higher pricing?"

I think you got to break down the inflation and where it -- and how it impacts the business. So in terms of maintenance and repair, if you need a filter, you need a filter. And if you need a pump, you need a pump. And if it costs 5% more than it did",247,"Yes. I think you got to break down the inflation and where it -- and how it impacts the business. So in terms of maintenance and repair, if you need a filter, you need a filter. And if you need a pump, you need a pump. And if it costs 5% more than it did last year, a, that's not typically for a pool owner, an insurmountable amount. So it's nothing you'd say, ""Wow, I'm not going to change the filter because it costs 5% more."" I have to do it in order to keep the pool operating. So in terms of maintenance and repair, we see very little impact. 
Your question on inflation as it relates to construction is a little bit different because depending on the type of pool construction, it can have a bigger impact on the total project. But one of the things that we have -- you have to consider when you think that through is that most of the cost of a backyard project, whether it's a renovation or whether it's a new construction project, most of that cost, in most cases, is labor, right? So in terms of a material cost increase and if there is inflation next year, it is again what we think above normal, I don't think it will have a material impact on demand and somebody deciding that I am going to do the project or I'm not given how the cost lays into the project."

Well, we see it certainly versus the prior years. So can you -- and I tend to think about your company as whether you [ get it into ] gross or SG&A, it's not such a concern to me. But I mean, we are getting questions on that gross margin. So can you talk to if that SG&A is kind of something's changed in that relative to where you were a few years ago?

Your question or your comment about gross -- or SG&A coming down, you're referring to SG&A as a percent of sales. SG&A is obviously growing and business is growing. We've added people and the support at locations, facilities, vehicles, so our SG&A has obviously gone up. 
It's come down as a percent of sales over the last couple of years. And in part, I think I've mentioned this before at some point, leverage is easier when sales growth is higher. So we've had obviously great sales growth in the last year and this year, and that makes getting that SG&A leverage a little bit easier. 
But at the same time, we've talked a lot about capacity creation initiatives, and those are things that we do throughout the organization to focus on getting more out of existing investments. And that is a big part of our operational initiatives, and we've made good progress there. We have more to come. We also pared back expenses during the pandemic initially. We talked about that last year. We're seeing some growth in those costs and gross and other cost areas. As we mentioned, things like leases and labor. Insurance is another area. 
And then incentives, we talked about incentive costs were up substantially last year. We thought they'd be down this year year-over-year. We talked about that earlier in the year. And in fact, they're going to be up. So those are a big component of the cost structure and should be coming down next year. Most likely, it will be a tailwind for us. 
So a lot of different components there. I think that if I look at our long-term model, I feel good about the opportunity to continue to provide operating leverage. And that is going to continue to be a big focus for us, which is in that kind of mid-teens plus area in terms of operating leverage we expect. So I don't know if that covered both parts of your question, but that's kind of how we [ think about it ]."

You came from, obviously, roofing which is a different category. Before that you're doing other things in distribution.

I mean I can't express how hard our teams are working to do what we do in a tight constrained environment because they are having to move product from one location to another and to coordinate deliveries and to really look very specifically at what days people need things so that we get product to them. 
This is where we separate ourselves, though, because in most markets, we're the only ones that have multiple locations. And nobody has as many locations as we do. Nobody has the buying power to place the orders as big as we do in the beginning anyway. So we're doing that. We're working very hard to make sure that we can take care of the customers.

This morning, following exceptional first half results and up against a very difficult comparison from the third quarter of 2020, the POOLCORP team once again raised the bar to record heights.",1680,"Thank you, Melanie, and good morning to everyone on the call. This morning, following exceptional first half results and up against a very difficult comparison from the third quarter of 2020, the POOLCORP team once again raised the bar to record heights. We proudly posted net sales for the third quarter of 2021 of $1.4 billion, which is a 24% increase over the prior year quarter. Our base business grew 19% in the quarter with acquisitions contributing 5%. 
Our diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $4.54, which is a 55% increase over the very strong third quarter of 2020. The earnings per share were $4.44, a 64% improvement when excluding the ASU benefit from both periods -- or from the period in both '20 and '21. People's desire to spend more time outside in the comfort and safety of their backyard pool or outdoor living space remains strong. Our builders and remodelers are reporting very solid backlogs going into 2022 and in some cases, through the 2022 season. Our retailers are reporting elevated demand and our service professionals are working long hours just to keep up with service requests. 
From a supply perspective, lead times for our products are still above normal and in some cases, well above normal.  Component shortages, a tight labor market and the global logistics crisis made keeping up with the elevated demand of the industry a challenge for most of our vendors. Our talented teams have leveraged the unmatched scale of our network and the powerful balance sheet to mitigate supply interruptions by providing more products and options for our customers that is typically available everywhere else. 
Our teams have worked tirelessly in the most challenging environment of our times to make sure we can provide unparalleled service to our customers. Our network is strong, our people are skilled and creative with a tenacious work ethic, and this combination has allowed us to once again prove we are the best in the business as we continue to take share from our competitors. In accordance with our strategic plan, we have opened 10 new locations and completed 2 strategic acquisitions during the year as we relentlessly pursue service excellence and capacity creation. 
Now let me share the specific results from our 4 largest markets. Florida and Texas continue to benefit from favorable demographic trends with base business growth of 26% and 25%, respectively. California grew 17%, while Arizona grew 18%, further proof that the industry is seeing strength in all major markets. In total, year-round markets had base business growth of 22% in the quarter, which was slightly better than the 20% growth that we reported for the third quarter of 2020. Seasonal base business markets grew 16%, but this compares to a very strong third quarter of the previous year, where we recorded 33% growth for the same quarter. For context here, weather conditions were generally favorable in most markets for the quarter. 
Looking at end markets and excluding the impact of acquisitions, I am happy to report that commercial pool product demand has come back to greater than prepandemic levels. For the quarter, commercial product sales increased 25%, bringing the total year-to-date growth rate to 24%. We saw more pools reopened with elevated usage, driving maintenance and repair spend and construction projects are starting to flow again. This is a very encouraging sign as this market was impacted the most during the COVID travel and public gathering restrictions. 
Retail product sales were encouraging with demand up 16%, which compares to the 28% growth that we reported in this end market for the same quarter of 2020. Chemical shortages have impacted this part of the business more severely than others as it is a key product for a retail-focused customer. 
From a product perspective, equipment sales growth was strong, posting gains of 23% for the period. This category includes pumps, heaters, lights, filters and automation. Chemical sales were up 10% for the quarter as the industry grappled with shortages and managed rolling stock outs on key products. As mentioned previously, the reduction in industry capacity after a major fire at the BioLab Plant last year left the industry in a net short position on trichlor and drove significant inflation on available product. Fortunately, there are several ways to sanitize a pool, and the industry has adapted and improvised to keep pools clean and safe. 
This tightness in chemical supply is likely to continue into next season as BioLab rebuilds its plant. In the meantime, capacity expansion from the remaining players, product substitutions and imports should mitigate the effects, albeit at elevated price levels. Lastly, building material demand remains strong in all markets. Sales for this product line grew 24% in the quarter, and this is on top of the 29% growth that we posted in the third quarter of 2020. On a year-to-date basis, we are up 30%, which is driven by a very robust construction and remodel market. 
Turning to Europe, sales grew 5% in the quarter. But bear in mind, we had a very difficult comp here as last year for the same period, our European sales grew 45%. Like North America, demand remained strong, but cooler and wetter weather and supply shortages had a significant impact on the team in the third quarter. 
Horizon continues to accelerate, posting overall revenue growth of 25% in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date sales growth to 28%. Base business sales growth was 20% and 22%, respectively for the quarter-to-date and year-to-date results. We are very pleased with how this business is performing, and we continue to invest in this platform. Like the Blue business, supply shortages and extended lead times continue to be a challenge for our team, but their grit, determination and focus on the customer have driven solid share gains in the industry. 
Now let me turn to gross margins. For the quarter, our overall gross margin was 31.3%, which is a 240 basis point improvement over 2020. On a year-to-date basis, we are up 170 basis points. Like last year and last quarter, this improvement is driven by supply chain execution, certain volume-related incentives, inflation benefits and product mix. In addition, we have been focused on more strategic and disciplined pricing, which is helping us in the current environment and will continue to help us going forward. 
Our ability to strategically leverage our balance sheet has been a key factor in our success in both the 2020 and 2021 season. This is a key differentiator for POOLCORP, and it has allowed us to provide industry-leading customer service while capturing greater value and positioning us for a great start to the 2022 season. 
From an expense perspective, the team again delivered incredible results. Our operating expenses for the quarter were up 13%, which is outstanding given our 24% revenue growth for the quarter. Yet again, the team's focus on execution, hard work and capacity creation initiatives allowed us to achieve record levels of operating leverage. POOL360 continues to be a cornerstone of our business, comprising 12% of our revenue and growing 47% in the quarter. We are excited to announce that beginning in the fourth quarter, we will be rolling out the next generation of this strategic platform that we think will further drive adoption and help our customers be more efficient. 
Wrapping up the income statement, I could not be more pleased to report that our operating income increased 60% in the quarter to $237.3 million, by any measure a masterful performance and a true reflection of the incredible team and unmatched capabilities at POOLCORP. Finally, with 3 full quarters behind us and a very favorable outlook for the balance of the year, we are updating our earnings guidance for the full year of 2021 to $14.85 per share to $15.35 per share. Excluding the ASU benefit, the range is $14.46 to $14.96 per share. 
Before turning the call over to Melanie, let me offer some closing thoughts. Beginning with the onset of the pandemic in 2020, we saw a change in consumer behavior that created a significant increase in demand for our products as people with pools use them more and those without a pool or outdoor living area began looking for someone to build them their own backyard retreat. We believe that this trend will endure as the flexible work-from-home arrangements continue and people recognize the many benefits of an enjoyable outdoor living lifestyle. 
When you add this to a healthy housing market where equity levels have increased nicely in the last couple of years and with pools now regarded as a highly desirable feature, according to the National Association of Realtors, it simply furthers our confidence in the long-term growth prospects for the industry. We believe people will continue to move away from urban and higher cost of living areas to more affordable suburban housing in pool-friendly markets, furthering their desire to invest in the outdoor living lifestyle. We feel that the southern migration will continue for the foreseeable future, giving those people a year-round environment to enjoy pools, patios, hot tubs and outdoor kitchens. 
Further, we have been encouraged to see industry capacity start to expand as our customers seek to expand their businesses albeit in a very challenging labor environment. From a supply perspective, manufacturers are also adding capacity, which should allow them to capture more of the elevated industry demand. Inflation this year will likely be in the 6% to 7% range, up from our previous estimate of 5% to 6%. And it looks like that will repeat again for next year given the global supply chain issues. To date, this has done little to temper demand and in time, this inflation passes through the supply chain. 
All in all, we are positioned incredibly well to continue our tremendous performance. Demand is strong. The team is focused. And by working very closely with our vendors and customers, we bring outdoor living to life. Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Melanie Hart, our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, for her commentary."
34117,1684676309,2409057,"Pool Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2021",2021-10-21,"Earnings Calls","Pool Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Pete, and good morning, everyone. I am thrilled to provide some additional commentary on our exceptional third quarter financial results. We have continued to see positive growth trends in the third quarter related to both our net sales growth",1456,"Thank you, Pete, and good morning, everyone. I am thrilled to provide some additional commentary on our exceptional third quarter financial results. We have continued to see positive growth trends in the third quarter related to both our net sales growth and gross margin. Net sales benefited approximately 7% from inflation and 5% from acquisitions in the quarter. 
We once again realized higher-than-normal increases in gross margins. Gross margin saw an increase of 240 basis points during the quarter, with base business gross margins up 250 basis points. Consistent with our discussion on our second quarter earnings call to address the anticipated supply chain constraints, we took the opportunity to purchase ahead in product areas where we forecasted continued high demand. Our strong inventory position has allowed us to gain share and to continue to provide exceptional service in a high demand and tight supply chain environment. 
As we have seen product cost increases come more frequently than in the past, we have established systematic pricing updates to ensure we quickly adjust to the more rapidly changing environment. Additionally, we have an ongoing process in place to focus on a judicious evaluation of all customer pricing, taking into consideration the cost to serve each specific customer. 
Having the capital strength to be able to confidently move forward with increasing the amount of materials in the supply chain is a strength for POOLCORP that sets us apart from many of our competitors. Our higher purchasing levels resulted in higher volume-driven vendor incentives, which also benefited gross margins for the quarter. Given the better-than-expected third quarter results, we now anticipate gross margin improvements of more than 170 basis points for the full year 2021 compared to 2020, versus the 100 basis point improvement we were expecting at the end of the second quarter. 
Record sales growth and improving gross margins only tell a portion of the story of our results for the quarter. We have also reduced our quarter-to-date consolidated operating expenses as a percentage of net sales by 130 basis points. These expenses, excluding the note recovery, were up 14%, while consolidated net sales grew 24% in the quarter. Base business operating expenses were down 160 basis points at 14.2% of net sales for the quarter on sales growth of 19%. We have seen inflationary cost increases in the areas of compensation, health care, freight and rent. Our continued effort on capacity creation in our existing locations has generated strong operating expense leverage. 
Our gross margin expansion and strong operating expense management has allowed our operating margin to grow by 380 basis points, coming in at 16.8% of net sales for the third quarter compared to 13% in third quarter of prior year. Interest expense of $2.3 million is up slightly compared to $1.9 million in prior year. Third quarter 2021 average debt was $354.3 million compared to $331.5 million for 2020. Our trailing 12-month leverage ratio was right around 0.5 at quarter end. 
During the third quarter, we amended our revolving credit agreement to increase the total borrowing capacity from $750 million to $1 billion. The renewal allows for lower available interest rates and favorable terms and covenants and also provides us substantial capacity and liquidity to maintain our strong balance sheet and efficiently manage our capital structure going forward. 
Our annual tax rate, excluding the [ ASU ] benefit, is expected to be around 25% on pretax earnings for the full year, coming in slightly lower for the third quarter at 23.2%. Our ASU tax benefit in the third quarter was $4.2 million or $0.10 per share. This was less than the $8.5 million or $0.21 realized in the same quarter of last year. As these benefits result from employee stock option exercises that occurred during the quarter, the timing is difficult to forecast and therefore, not included in our guidance range until realized. We do have an additional $1.4 million of ASU benefit related to stock options that should be recognized between fourth quarter of 2021 and first quarter 2022 based on expiration dates and calculated at the current stock price. 
Next, I'll discuss our balance sheet and cash flows. Increases in our total net receivables of 30% reflects our sales growth in the quarter. Our day sales outstanding at the end of the quarter was 25.7, down from 27.6 days in 2020. Looking at inventory compared to 2020 reflects an increase of 70%, or 63% on a base business comparison, as we invested in inventory to efficiently serve our customers and better manage supply chain disruptions. We have also added inventory to support our 10 new locations opened since last year. 
Inventory levels at September of 2020 were less than we would have liked and virtually flat with 2019 coming off of the strong selling season. Our third quarter 2-year sales growth was 57%. Our deliberate purchasing actions have us well positioned to support ongoing sales growth into 2022.  We saw our inventory turn days improved from 97.5 in 2020 to 94.7 in 2021. 
Cash from operating activities is $359 million on a year-to-date basis, driven by strong earnings contribution and also reflecting the investments made into inventory. Our return on invested capital of 50.9% is up from the prior year of 36.4% and highlights our sound deployment of capital. Operating cash flows for the quarter benefited from deferred income tax payments as we took advantage of the IRS release for those impacted by Hurricane Ida. We are able to defer payments that would typically be made in third and fourth quarters of 2021 until January of 2022. In the ordinary course, we would have made our third quarter estimated federal tax payments of $56 million. 
I want to pause to thank all of our teams that were in the areas impacted by Ida. Certain of our sales centers were operating on generator power to get products to our customers so they could begin repairs as quickly as possible. Many of our support teams relocated out of the area to continue to serve our field. Overall, our disaster recovery plans operated flawlessly and without major disruptions to our customers. In support of our employer of choice initiatives, we have established during the quarter the POOLCORP Employees First Fund to support any employees that are impacted by natural disasters. 
So far in 2021, we have executed on 132 million of our authorized share buybacks, leaving 495 million available under our repurchase authorization. Share buyback so far in 2021 fix the amounts repurchased in 2019 and 2020 combined and continue to be an area of value add to the shareholders as part of our overall strategic plan. We have repurchased 343,000 shares year-to-date at an average price of $386 per share. 
Acquisitions added 5% to our sales growth for the third quarter and 7% for the year-to-date results. However, as we move into the fourth quarter, we began to lap several of the larger acquisitions completed in 2020. So the impact of acquisitions on the results for the remainder of the year will not have as significant of an impact. We would expect acquisitions to add only about 1% to our sales growth in the fourth quarter. 
As we look at how we think we expect to close out the year, sales growth momentum from the third quarter has shown that demand continues to be strong. For 2021, we have 1 less selling day than we did in the fourth quarter of 2020. We expect sales growth of over 30% for the full year. This considers our projected fourth quarter sales growth rate to moderate with 1 less selling day. Normal weather assumptions for the fourth quarter this year compared to the favorable weather last year and that results from our deadline acquisition are included in both comparable periods. Fourth quarter prior year sales growth was 39% for base business. 
Gross margins should remain with a positive outlook as a result of our inventory investments, with improvements in the range of what we were able to achieve in both second quarter and third quarter of this year. Purposeful expense management will allow for a full year of operating margin improvement of 350 basis points. This improvement is well in excess of our historical results. And while it may have been bolstered by exceptional top line and gross margin growth, the principles underlying our ability to improve over time remains strong. 
We have increased the range for the full year 2021 to consider earnings results for the third quarter, including an additional $0.10 from ASU, expected positive demand trends and have provided updated guidance of $14.85 to $15.35 per diluted share. I will now turn the call back over to our operator for a question-and-answer session."

And I guess I would unpack that a little bit and look at the elements, right? So you have inflation, which, again, a little bit early to tell you what the total inflationary effect is going to be for 2022, but inflation is certainly going to be elevated. 
We think new pool construction this year will be between 110,000 and 115,000 units, which puts new pool construction up 20%. So the installed base has grown nicely over the last couple of years. Demand is still strong. The commercial business has come back and backlogs are good. So I would say for -- again, we're not ready to call a 2022 number, but I would just go back and look at the elements that we think are driving demand. 
I think the work-from-home dynamic is going to stay in place. I think the southern migration will stay in place. The housing market is in good shape. So we're encouraged by the results. And if you break down what drives our growth,  we'll have -- I think we said we opened 10 locations this year. We should have a similar number for next year. A couple of acquisitions this year. We have a good M&A pipeline going. So it's -- the elements are in place for another good year."

But really, outside of that, there's more direct factors that I would want you to take into account. So I know that we've talked a lot about capacity creation, so we've covered those historically. But the other thing that's really not evident in these numbers, because of the hard work that the team has put through, is the fact that within this environment, a lot of the market share that we've gotten and a lot of the share gains have come from our ability to serve our customers. But doing that is not without additional cost.

And the way I would think about it is you really have to think -- you have to consider what products we're talking about. So if you look at the major equipment suppliers in North America, they -- I think they're going to be in better shape for next year. Certainly, they would -- you'll ask them the same question, as I'm sure. 
But based on what we are seeing, they won't have the COVID hangover that they started the year with. So I think production rates, at least the amount of inventory that we're getting, is much better than it was. So we feel good about their ability to -- and I think I mentioned that in my comments, that they'll be able to pace better with us going into the 2022 season and -- number one; and number two, our inventory position starting the 2022 season is going to be better, which again creates a little breathing room for them. 
One exception, notable exception, would be on chemicals, as I said. Because in that situation, with the BioLab fire, that was a huge chunk of the industry's capacity at the trichlor product. So that whole is being made up a couple of different ways. So in that case, there is some import product that is coming in. And as you know, with the [indiscernible] supply chains, it's taking longer and it's more expensive when it gets here. 
But I think the domestic -- the remaining domestic producers are also going to be in a better position from an capacity perspective to provide more product. And then there's also alternatives for sanitization, which is primarily the either salt system or liquids, chlorine shock, which will, again, I think, be in a better position. So all in all, I think the industry is ramping up and it has ramped up and worked very, very hard. 
We mentioned our folks working very hard this year. Our suppliers have worked equally as hard trying to keep pace with the industry. But I think we'll be in a better position going forward. I don't really see major changes in the supplier landscape."

But they're having to contend with the tight labor market that the entire world is having to manage through right now. So from a new construction basis, we think that new pools are going to be up, as I mentioned, about 20%, could be a little bit more plus or minus, depending on what happens in the shoulder or in the remaining months of the fourth quarter, but activity is very strong. So it's going to lead them with a very good backlog to start the season. 
So I think from a new construction,  it's -- there's plenty of work, and we feel good about that continuing. Remodel is another area, which is also a big portion of our business.

And we think that in the long run, that wins out. So if you have the right product -- we have the right locations, that's why we're expanding our footprint so that we have capacity and that we're conveniently located for our dealers and that we have robust inventory management programs in place so that we have more product than anybody else available, that we have the technical expertise, that we have the marketing programs, that we appreciate the time with them at our sales centers and don't ever take that for granted, and we try and get them in as quickly -- in and out as quickly as possible, we think that in the end, that's going to serve us best. And that gives us the best chance of retaining the share gains that we have received."

And we are in -- we talked to the -- our customers, we talk to them each and every day. And I can tell you right now, the amount of leads that they have and the amount of work that they have booked would suggest that, for the time being, they're in very good shape. 
But then I fall back to the kind of the macroeconomic conditions that we think are driving the result. I would tell you that, as I mentioned, this work-from-home dynamic has certainly enhanced people's desire for a pool or a patio and outdoor living because, frankly, they're spending more time and probably less time in the car commuting or at an office. 
We think that people moving out of high-cost living areas -- and when they're exiting those areas, they're exiting with very nice gains on home equity. So they're armed with very good down payments that they can use for renovations and remodels on the new home that they purchased in a lower-cost living area. In many cases, that happens to be in more year-round markets. 
So quite frankly, we're very encouraged by the outlook. We don't look at it as a short-term gain. We look at the underlying fundamentals and say that things are good. Now that -- a lot of that is tied to the housing market. So if the housing market -- as long as the housing market stays strong, people feel that their financial condition is good and improving, then we think that the desire to spend money on outdoor -- the outdoor living experience, whether it's a pool or patio or a hot tub or an outdoor kitchen, we think has a lot of length and will continue."

So I would say that I don't think that the percentages have shifted all that much, but I can tell you that they're both -- they both have significant backlogs."

This year, so far, we've completed 2 additional acquisitions. And so from a long-term perspective, we certainly see the benefit in adding to the network and including those acquisitions.

And what makes employer of choice so important is that there's really nothing that you can buy from me that you can't buy from anybody else. It simply is the team and the value proposition that they create around those products that you can get from other folks that make the difference. 
We are very fortunate, very blessed to have an extremely dedicated team, and I couldn't be prouder of the results and more appreciative of the results and the hard work that they have put in, in order for us to accomplish and to, frankly, to facilitate our dealers and our customers' ability to accomplish what they've done. So we strive to take very good care of our employees we have. 
I think Melanie mentioned that our incentive compensation, which a year ago we were telling you, well, could be the source of some cost savings, our operating -- sorry, our bonus program this year, incentive compensation, whatever you want to call it, is up significantly and will be up. So we're basically taking the mounting of the terrific results we have, and we are sharing it with the folks. 
But it's not just about money. It's about appreciation and recognition of their effort. And I think we've done more of that this year than we ever have done. And it's something that has allowed us to keep the workforce together behind us and engaged."

I think what you have to keep in context is that -- Melanie pointed out in her comments that the inventory is up in dollars quite a bit. But if you look at it in days, our days of inventory are actually down. So it really is about getting your head wrapped around and what the true demand signal is and making sure that we have products in place. 
Now the demand signal from the market is very strong. right? So the backlog, the amount of work that they have today and the amount of work that they have for going into 2022, and as I mentioned, sometimes all the way through the 2022 season, if you simply just look at the amount of product that is on order and you turn the crank on how much product we're going to need through the balance of the 2022 season, it doesn't really give me much concern at all in terms of, wow, we have too much product. 
Frankly, at this point, I'd really rather err on the high side because it allows flexibility on our customer side keep them moving forward, because every time one of our dealers has to go back to a job to complete it because they -- maybe they didn't have the whole goods that they needed or the part that they needed, that simply is a huge productivity [ drain ] on them. So we've worked very hard to make sure that we have as much of that product on a first-time fill rate to allow them to keep going. 
So again, given the dollars, given the seasonality that this is the time of the year when we should be ramping up from inventory to start and be prepared for the 2022 season. So I'm not really concerned with the amount of product that's on order because we will certainly go through it."

This morning, following exceptional first half results and up against a very difficult comparison from the third quarter of 2020, the POOLCORP team once again raised the bar to record heights.",1680,"Thank you, Melanie, and good morning to everyone on the call. This morning, following exceptional first half results and up against a very difficult comparison from the third quarter of 2020, the POOLCORP team once again raised the bar to record heights. We proudly posted net sales for the third quarter of 2021 of $1.4 billion, which is a 24% increase over the prior year quarter. Our base business grew 19% in the quarter with acquisitions contributing 5%. 
Our diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $4.54, which is a 55% increase over the very strong third quarter of 2020. The earnings per share were $4.44, a 64% improvement when excluding the ASU benefit from both periods -- or from the period in both '20 and '21. 
People's desire to spend more time outside in the comfort and safety of their backyard pool or outdoor living space remains strong. Our builders and remodelers are reporting very solid backlogs going into 2022 and in some cases, through the 2022 season. Our retailers are reporting elevated demand and our service professionals are working long hours just to keep up with service requests. 
From a supply perspective, lead times for our products are still above normal and, in some cases, well above normal. Component shortages, a tight labor market and the global logistics crisis made keeping up with the elevated demand of the industry a challenge for most of our vendors. Our talented teams have leveraged the unmatched scale of our network and the powerful balance sheet to mitigate supply interruptions by providing more products and options for our customers than is typically available everywhere else. 
Our teams have worked tirelessly in the most challenging environment of our times to make sure we can provide unparalleled service to our customers. Our network is strong, our people are skilled and creative with a tenacious work ethic. And this combination has allowed us to once again prove we are the best in the business as we continue to take share from our competitors. In accordance with our strategic plan, we have opened 10 new locations and completed 2 strategic acquisitions during the year as we relentlessly pursue service excellence and capacity creation. 
Now let me share the specific results from our 4 largest markets. Florida and Texas continued to benefit from favorable demographic trends with base business growth of 26% and 25%, respectively. California grew 17% while Arizona grew 18%, a further proof that the industry is seeing strength in all major markets. 
In total, year-round markets had base business growth of 22% in the quarter, which was slightly better than the 20% growth that we reported for the third quarter of 2020. Seasonal base business markets grew 16%, but this compares to a very strong third quarter of the previous year, where we recorded 33% growth for the same quarter. For context here, weather conditions were generally favorable in most markets for the quarter. 
Looking at end markets and excluding the impact of acquisitions, I am happy to report that commercial pool product demand has come back to greater than prepandemic levels. For the quarter, commercial product sales increased 25%, bringing the total year-to-date growth rate to 24%. We saw more pools reopen with elevated usage, driving maintenance and repair spend and construction projects are starting to flow again. This is a very encouraging sign as this market was impacted the most during the COVID travel and public gathering restrictions. 
Retail product sales were encouraging with demand up 16%, which compares to the 28% growth that we reported in this end market for the same quarter of 2020. Chemical shortages have impacted this part of the business more severely than others as it is a key product for a retail-focused customer. 
From a product perspective, equipment sales growth was strong, posting gains of 23% for the period. This category includes pumps, heaters, lights, filters and automation. Chemical sales were up 10% for the quarter as the industry grappled with shortages and managed rolling stockouts on key products. As mentioned previously, the reduction in industry capacity after a major fire at the BioLab Plant last year left the industry in a net short position on trichlor and drove significant inflation on available product. Fortunately, there are several ways to sanitize a pool, and the industry has adapted and improvised to keep pools clean and safe. 
This tightness in chemical supply is likely to continue into next season as BioLab rebuilds its plant. In the meantime, capacity expansion from the remaining players, product substitutions and imports should mitigate the effects albeit at elevated price levels. 
Lastly, building material demand remains strong in all markets. Sales for this product line grew 24% in the quarter, and this is on top of the 29% growth that we posted in the third quarter of 2020. On a year-to-date basis, we are up 30%, which is driven by a very robust construction and remodel market. 
Turning to Europe, sales grew 5% in the quarter. But bear in mind, we had a very difficult comp here as last year for the same period, our European sales grew 45%. Like North America, demand remained strong, but cooler and wetter weather and supply shortages had a significant impact on the team in the third quarter. 
Horizon continues to accelerate, posting overall revenue growth of 25% in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date sales growth to 28%. Base business sales growth was 20% and 22%, respectively, for the quarter-to-date and year-to-date results. 
We are very pleased with how this business is performing, and we continue to invest in this platform. Like the blue business, supply shortages and extended lead times continue to be a challenge for our team, but their grit, determination and focus on the customer have driven solid share gains in the industry. 
Now let me turn to gross margins. For the quarter, our overall gross margin was 31.3%, which is a 240 basis point improvement over 2020. On a year-to-date basis, we are up 170 basis points. Like last year and last quarter, this improvement is driven by supply chain execution, certain volume-related incentives, inflation benefits and product mix. In addition, we have been focused on more strategic and disciplined pricing, which is helping us in the current environment and will continue to help us going forward. 
Our ability to strategically leverage our balance sheet has been a key factor in our success in both the 2020 and 2021 season. This is a key differentiator for POOLCORP, and it has allowed us to provide industry-leading customer service while capturing greater value and positioning us for a great start to the 2022 season. 
From an expense perspective, the team again delivered incredible results. Our operating expenses for the quarter were up 13%, which is outstanding given our 24% revenue growth for the quarter. Yet again, the team's focus on execution, hard work and capacity creation initiatives allowed us to achieve record levels of operating leverage. 
POOL360 continues to be a cornerstone of our business, comprising 12% of our revenue and growing 47% in the quarter. We are excited to announce that beginning in the fourth quarter, we will be rolling out the next generation of this strategic platform that we think will further drive adoption and help our customers be more efficient. 
Wrapping up the income statement, I could not be more pleased to report that our operating income increased 60% in the quarter to $237.3 million, by any measure a masterful performance and a true reflection of the incredible team and unmatched capabilities at POOLCORP. 
Finally, with 3 full quarters behind us and a very favorable outlook for the balance of the year, we are updating our earnings guidance for the full year of 2021 to $14.85 per share to $15.35 per share. Excluding the ASU benefit, the range is $14.46 to $14.96 per share. 
Before turning the call over to Melanie, let me offer some closing thoughts. Beginning with the onset of the pandemic in 2020, we saw a change in consumer behavior that created a significant increase in demand for our products as people with pools use them more and those without a pool or outdoor living area began looking for someone to build them their own backyard retreat. We believe that this trend will endure as the flexible work-from-home arrangements continue and people recognize the many benefits of an enjoyable outdoor living lifestyle. 
When you add this to a healthy housing market where equity levels have increased nicely in the last couple of years and with pools now regarded as a highly desirable feature, according to the National Association of REALTORS, it simply furthers our confidence in the long-term growth prospects for the industry. We believe people will continue to move away from urban and higher cost of living areas to more affordable suburban housing in pool-friendly markets, furthering their desire to invest in the outdoor living lifestyle. We feel that the southern migration will continue for the foreseeable future, giving those people a year-round environment to enjoy pools, patios, hot tubs and outdoor kitchens. Further, we have been encouraged to see industry capacity start to expand as our customers seek to expand their businesses albeit in a very challenging labor environment. 
From a supply perspective, manufacturers are also adding capacity, which should allow them to capture more of the elevated industry demand. Inflation this year will likely be in the 6% to 7% range, up from our previous estimate of 5% to 6%. And it looks like that will repeat again for next year given the global supply chain issues. To date, this has done little to temper demand, and in time, this inflation passes through the supply chain. 
All in all, we are positioned incredibly well to continue our tremendous performance. Demand is strong. The team is focused. And by working very closely with our vendors and customers, we bring outdoor living to life. 
Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Melanie Hart, our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, for her commentary."
34117,1684676309,2409161,"Pool Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2021",2021-10-21,"Earnings Calls","Pool Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Pete, and good morning, everyone. I am thrilled to provide some additional commentary on our exceptional third quarter financial results. We have continued to see positive growth trends in the third quarter related to both our net sales growth",1454,"Thank you, Pete, and good morning, everyone. I am thrilled to provide some additional commentary on our exceptional third quarter financial results. We have continued to see positive growth trends in the third quarter related to both our net sales growth and gross margin. Net sales benefited approximately 7% from inflation and 5% from acquisitions in the quarter. 
We once again realized higher-than-normal increases in gross margins. Gross margin saw an increase of 240 basis points during the quarter, with base business gross margins up 250 basis points. Consistent with our discussion on our second quarter earnings call to address the anticipated supply chain constraints, we took the opportunity to purchase ahead in product areas where we forecasted continued high demand. Our strong inventory position has allowed us to gain share and to continue to provide exceptional service in a high demand and tight supply chain environment. 
As we have seen product cost increases come more frequently than in the past, we have established systematic pricing updates to ensure we quickly adjust to the more rapidly changing environment. Additionally, we have an ongoing process in place to focus on a judicious evaluation of all customer pricing, taking into consideration the cost to serve each specific customer. 
Having the capital strength to be able to confidently move forward with increasing the amount of materials in the supply chain is a strength for POOLCORP that sets us apart from many of our competitors. Our higher purchasing levels resulted in higher volume-driven vendor incentives, which also benefited gross margins for the quarter. 
Given the better-than-expected third quarter results, we now anticipate gross margin improvements of more than 170 basis points for the full year 2021 compared to 2020, versus the 100 basis point improvement we were expecting at the end of the second quarter. 
Record sales growth and improving gross margins only tell a portion of the story of our results for the quarter. We have also reduced our quarter-to-date consolidated operating expenses as a percentage of net sales by 130 basis points. These expenses, excluding the note recovery, were up 14%, while consolidated net sales grew 24% in the quarter. 
Base business operating expenses were down 160 basis points at 14.2% of net sales for the quarter on sales growth of 19%. We have seen inflationary cost increases in the areas of compensation, health care, freight and rent. Our continued effort on capacity creation in our existing locations has generated strong operating expense leverage. 
Our gross margin expansion and strong operating expense management has allowed our operating margin to grow by 380 basis points, coming in at 16.8% of net sales for the third quarter compared to 13% in third quarter of prior year. 
Interest expense of $2.3 million is up slightly compared to $1.9 million in prior year. Third quarter 2021 average debt was $354.3 million compared to $331.5 million for 2020. Our trailing 12-month leverage ratio was right around 0.5 at quarter end. 
During the third quarter, we amended our revolving credit agreement to increase the total borrowing capacity from $750 million to $1 billion. The renewal allows for lower available interest rates and favorable terms and covenants and also provides us substantial capacity and liquidity to maintain our strong balance sheet and efficiently manage our capital structure going forward. 
Our annual tax rate, excluding the ASU benefit, is expected to be around 25% on pretax earnings for the full year, coming in slightly lower for the third quarter at 23.2%. 
Our ASU tax benefit in the third quarter was $4.2 million or $0.10 per share. This was less than the $8.5 million or $0.21 realized in the same quarter of last year. As these benefits result from employee stock option exercises that occurred during the quarter, the timing is difficult to forecast and, therefore, not included in our guidance range until realized. We do have an additional $1.4 million of ASU benefit related to stock options that should be recognized between fourth quarter of 2021 and first quarter 2022 based on expiration dates and calculated at the current stock price. 
Next, I'll discuss our balance sheet and cash flows. Increases in our total net receivables of 30% reflects our sales growth in the quarter. Our day sales outstanding at the end of the quarter was 25.7, down from 27.6 days in 2020. 
Looking at inventory compared to 2020 reflects an increase of 70%, or 63% on a base business comparison as we invested in inventory to efficiently serve our customers and better manage supply chain disruptions. We have also added inventory to support our 10 new locations opened since last year. 
Inventory levels at September of 2020 were less than we would have liked and virtually flat with 2019 coming off of the strong selling season. Our third quarter 2-year sales growth was 57%. Our deliberate purchasing actions have us well positioned to support ongoing sales growth into 2022. We saw our inventory turn days improved from 97.5 in 2020 to 94.7 in 2021. 
Cash from operating activities is $359 million on a year-to-date basis driven by strong earnings contribution and also reflecting the investments made into inventory. Our return on invested capital of 50.9% is up from the prior year of 36.4% and highlights our sound deployment of capital. 
Operating cash flows for the quarter benefited from deferred income tax payments as we took advantage of the IRS release for those impacted by Hurricane Ida. We are able to defer payments that would typically be made in third and fourth quarters of 2021 until January of 2022. In the ordinary course, we would have made our third quarter estimated federal tax payments of $56 million. 
I want to pause to thank all of our teams that were in the areas impacted by Ida. Certain of our sales centers were operating on generator power to get products to our customers so they could begin repairs as quickly as possible. Many of our support teams relocated out of the area to continue to serve our field. 
Overall, our disaster recovery plans operated flawlessly and without major disruptions to our customers. In support of our employer of choice initiatives, we have established during the quarter the POOLCORP Employees 1st Fund to support any employees that are impacted by natural disasters. 
So far in 2021, we have executed on 132 million of our authorized share buybacks, leaving 495 million available under our repurchase authorization. Share buyback so far in 2021 exceed the amounts repurchased in 2019 and 2020 combined and continue to be an area of value add to the shareholders as part of our overall strategic plan. We have repurchased 343,000 shares year-to-date at an average price of $386 per share. 
Acquisitions added 5% to our sales growth for the third quarter and 7% for the year-to-date results. However, as we move into the fourth quarter, we began to lap several of the larger acquisitions completed in 2020. So the impact of acquisitions on the results for the remainder of the year will not have as significant of an impact. We would expect acquisitions to add only about 1% to our sales growth in the fourth quarter. 
As we look at how we think we expect to close out the year, sales growth momentum from the third quarter has shown that demand continues to be strong. For 2021, we have 1 less selling day than we did in the fourth quarter of 2020. We expect sales growth of over 30% for the full year. This considers our projected fourth quarter sales growth rate to moderate with 1 less selling day. Normal weather assumptions for the fourth quarter this year compared to the favorable weather last year and net results from our Jet Line acquisition are included in both comparable periods. Fourth quarter prior year sales growth was 39% for base business. 
Gross margins should remain with a positive outlook as a result of our inventory investments, with improvements in the range of what we were able to achieve in both second quarter and third quarter of this year. Purposeful expense management will allow for a full year operating margin improvement of 350 basis points. This improvement is well in excess of our historical results. And while it may have been bolstered by exceptional top line and gross margin growth, the principles underlying our ability to improve over time remain strong. 
We have increased the range for the full year 2021 to consider earnings results for the third quarter, including an additional $0.10 from ASU, expected positive demand trends and have provided updated guidance of $14.85 to $15.35 per diluted share. 
I will now turn the call back over to our operator for a question-and-answer session."

And I guess I would unpack that a little bit and look at the elements, right? So you have inflation, which again, a little bit early to tell you what the total inflationary effect is going to be for 2022, but inflation is certainly going to be elevated. 
We think new pool construction this year will be between 110,000 and 115,000 units, which puts new pool construction up 20%. So the installed base has grown nicely over the last couple of years. Demand is still strong. The commercial business has come back and backlogs are good. 
So I would say for -- again, we're not ready to call a 2022 number, but I would just go back and look at the elements that we think are driving demand. I think the work-from-home dynamic is going to stay in place. I think southern migration will stay in place. The housing market is in good shape. 
So we're encouraged by the results. And if you break down what drives our growth, we'll have -- I think we said we opened 10 locations this year. We should have a similar number for next year, a couple of acquisitions this year. We have a good M&A pipeline going. So it's -- the elements are in place for another good year."

And in fact, our projections for this year now, we're thinking that we're actually going to be $10 million to $15 million higher than where we were in 2020. So that gives us quite a range of flexibility in -- on the incentive compensation side. 
But really, outside of that, there's more direct factors that I would want you to take into account. So I know that we've talked a lot about capacity creation, so we've covered those historically. But the other thing that's really not evident in these numbers, because of the hard work that the team has put through, is the fact that within this environment, a lot of the market share that we've gotten and a lot of the share gains have come from our ability to serve our customers. But doing that is not without additional cost. 
So we have had the opportunity where we've had to move product around in order to serve our customers and do other things that have -- from an out-the-door operating expense side has cost us more in the current year. And so those costs, we also expect to come out of the next year base, when the supply chain is more in line."

And the way I would think about it is you really have to think -- you have to consider what products we're talking about. So if you look at the major equipment suppliers in North America, they -- I think they're going to be in better shape for next year. Certainly, they would -- you'll ask them the same question, as I'm sure. But based on what we are seeing, they won't have the COVID hangover that they started the year with. 
So I think production rates, at least the amount of inventory that we're getting, is much better than it was. So we feel good about their ability to -- and I think I mentioned that in my comments, that they'll be able to pace better with us going into the 2022 season and -- number one; and number two, our inventory position starting the 2022 season is going to be better, which again creates a little breathing room for them. 
One exception, notable exception, would be on chemicals, as I said. Because in that situation, with the BioLab fire, that was a huge chunk of the industry's capacity at the trichlor product. So that whole is being made up a couple of different ways. So in that case, there is some import product that is coming in. And as you know, with the smaller supply chains, it's taking longer and it's more expensive when it gets here.
But I think the domestic -- the remaining domestic producers are also going to be in a better position from a capacity perspective to provide more product. And then there's also alternatives for sanitization, which is -- would primarily be either salt system or liquids, chlorine shock, which will, again, I think, be in a better position. 
So all in all, I think the industry is ramping up and it has ramped up and worked very, very hard we mentioned our folks working very hard this year. Our suppliers have worked equally as hard, trying to keep pace with the industry. But I think we'll be in a better position going forward. I don't really see major changes in the supplier landscape."

And in virtually all of the geographies, the dealers are -- have very robust backlogs. And I mentioned one of the things that's also very encouraging is that many of our dealers are now looking to expand their own capacity. But they're having to contend with the tight labor market that the entire world is having to manage through right now. 
So from a new construction basis, we think that new pools are going to be up, as I mentioned, about 20%. It could be a little bit more plus or minus, depending on what happens in the shoulder or in the remaining months of the fourth quarter, but activity is very strong. So it's going to leave them with a very good backlog to start the season. So I think from a new construction, it's -- there's plenty of work, and we feel good about that continuing. 
Remodel is another area which is also a big portion of our business. And with the strong housing market and strong home equity values, the remodel and renovation market is good. And our -- many of our dealers are also booked out for many months with pending remodel and renovation projects. So again, it just gives us further confidence in the long-term outlook for the industry."

What I will tell you is that we are very focused on the customer experience. So we recognize that we are busy. We recognize that demand is elevated and people need product, but we also don't take that for granted. So our team works tirelessly to make sure that we provide the best value for our customers. 
So it's not just about having the product. It's about having a product and it's competitively priced. And it's available when they need it, and other tools that allow the dealers to be more productive, tools that allow the dealers to expand and grow their business, whether it's our marketing programs or whether it's our digital marketing tools or whether it's the POOL360, which allows remote access. They can look up schematics. They can order parts. They can put things in priority pick. 
So I can tell you that we measure things like speed at the counter. And for our dealers, time is one of their most critical resources. So it's not just -- we don't just look at sales dollars. Even as busy as we have been, we still measure cycle time to serve a customer at the counter because in a business like ours, approximately 70% of our transactions take place at the counter. 
So nobody knows for sure how much of the share gains will remain with us. But I can tell you that my entire team, all the way down, right through every employee in POOLCORP, is very focused on providing the very best customer experience. And we think that in the long run, that wins out. 
So if you have the right product, have the right locations -- that's why we're expanding our footprint so that we have capacity and that we're conveniently located for our dealers and that we have robust inventory management programs in place so that we have more product than anybody else available; that we have the technical expertise, that we have the marketing programs, that we appreciate the time with them at our sales centers and don't ever take that for granted, and we try and get them in as quickly -- in and out as quickly as possible, we think that in the end, that's going to serve us best.

And I can tell you right now, the amount of leads that they have and the amount of work that they have booked would suggest that, for the time being, they're in very good shape. 
But then I fall back to the kind of the macroeconomic conditions that we think are driving the result. I would tell you that, as I mentioned, this work-from-home dynamic has certainly enhanced people's desire for a pool or a patio and outdoor living because, frankly, they're spending more time at home and less time in the car commuting or at an office. 
We think that people moving out of high-cost living areas -- and when they're exiting those areas, they're exiting with very nice gains on home equity. So they're armed with very good down payments that they can use for renovations and remodels on the new home that they purchased in a lower-cost living area. In many cases, that happens to be in more year-round markets. 
So quite frankly, we're very encouraged by the outlook. We don't look at it as a short-term gain. We look at the underlying fundamentals and say that things are good. Now that -- a lot of that is tied to the housing market. So if the housing market -- as long as the housing market stays strong, people feel that their financial condition is good and improving, then we think that the desire to spend money on outdoor -- the outdoor living experience, whether it's a pool or patio or a hot tub or an outdoor kitchen, we think has a lot of length and will continue."

So -- and it kind of goes hand-in-hand with our Bluestreak kind of a kiosk or counter application that we're using. We're also arming our BDRs to be able to use the Bluestreak tool when they're actually out with the customer. 
So we are investing nicely in kind of the whole customer experience as it relates to technology. So I think customers will be very pleased and very happy with the improved functionality and that we listen to them with things that they suggested would make the tool more user-friendly for them and certainly make them more inclined to use it."

Certainly, fuel is up considerably over where it was a year ago, and even the cost of vehicles is up. 
But if you remember, a few years ago, we started our capacity creation initiative in earnest. And one of the things -- one of the key elements of that was truck utilization. So the key for us is actually getting higher utilization rates on the truck, which allow us to absorb the increase in operating cost but still create operating leverage with the truck.
So in the type of environment that we're in, given that most of our products that are delivered, are delivered at our own trucks. That actually has worked in our favor. So it's -- the team works very, very hard on execution as it relates to the truck utilization and the overall transportation rate, because we know what's coming down the pipe with fuel and driver cost and other associated maintenance and repair."

And it's just generally net short in the industry. If it doesn't exist, like some key products were early on in the season, then there is another alternative or another vendor. 
So if you need a pump, you may have wanted vendor A, and that pump wasn't available. But it's not like we said, ""Hey, I don't have anything to offer you."" We said, ""You wanted -- you asked for pump A, but we have B, C and D that we can offer you, which will get you up and running and get your water running so you can use your pool.""

But in those cases that we still didn't have the particular item because it was sold out and backed up on the -- and the vendors unable to produce, then we had another product. 
So it wasn't like we said, ""I don't have anything to offer you,"" in most cases. I'm sure there were some cases where a specific product, we may not have had an alternative.

I think what you have to keep in context is that -- Melanie pointed out in her comments that the inventory is up in dollars quite a bit. But if you look at it in days, our days of inventory are actually down. So it really is about getting your head wrapped around what the true demand signal is and making sure that we have products in place. 
Now the demand signal from the market is very strong, right? So the backlog, the amount of work that they have today and the amount of work that they have for -- going into 2022, and as I mentioned, sometimes all the way through the 2022 season. If you simply just look at the amount of product that is on order and you turn the crank on how much product we're going to need through the balance of the 2022 season, it doesn't really give me much concern at all in terms of, wow, we have too much product. 
Frankly, at this point, I'd really rather err on the high side because it allows flexibility on our customer side to keep them moving forward. Because every time one of our dealers has to go back to a job to complete it because they -- maybe they didn't have the whole goods that they needed or the part that they needed, that simply is a huge productivity drain on them. So we've worked very hard to make sure that we have as much of that product on a first-time fill rate to allow them to keep going. 
So again, given the dollars, given the seasonality that this is the time of the year, then we should be ramping up from inventory to start and be prepared for the 2022 season. So I'm not really concerned with the amount of product that's on order because we will certainly go through it."

This morning, following exceptional first half results and up against a very difficult comparison from the third quarter of 2020, the POOLCORP team once again raised the bar to record heights.",1679,"Thank you, Melanie, and good morning to everyone on the call. This morning, following exceptional first half results and up against a very difficult comparison from the third quarter of 2020, the POOLCORP team once again raised the bar to record heights. We proudly posted net sales for the third quarter of 2021 of $1.4 billion, which is a 24% increase over the prior year quarter. Our base business grew 19% in the quarter with acquisitions contributing 5%. 
Our diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $4.54, which is a 55% increase over the very strong third quarter of 2020. The earnings per share were $4.44, a 64% improvement when excluding the ASU benefit from both periods -- or from the period in both '20 and '21. 
People's desire to spend more time outside in the comfort and safety of their backyard pool or outdoor living space remains strong. Our builders and remodelers are reporting very solid backlogs going into 2022 and in some cases, through the 2022 season. Our retailers are reporting elevated demand and our service professionals are working long hours just to keep up with service requests. 
From a supply perspective, lead times for our products are still above normal and, in some cases, well above normal. Component shortages, a tight labor market and the global logistics crisis made keeping up with the elevated demand of the industry a challenge for most of our vendors. Our talented teams have leveraged the unmatched scale of our network and the powerful balance sheet to mitigate supply interruptions by providing more products and options for our customers than is typically available everywhere else. 
Our teams have worked tirelessly in the most challenging environment of our times to make sure we can provide unparalleled service to our customers. Our network is strong, our people are skilled and creative with a tenacious work ethic. And this combination has allowed us to once again prove we are the best in the business as we continue to take share from our competitors. In accordance with our strategic plan, we have opened 10 new locations and completed 2 strategic acquisitions during the year as we relentlessly pursue service excellence and capacity creation. 
Now let me share the specific results from our 4 largest markets. Florida and Texas continued to benefit from favorable demographic trends with base business growth of 26% and 25%, respectively. California grew 17% while Arizona grew 18%, further proof that the industry is seeing strength in all major markets. 
In total, year-round markets had base business growth of 22% in the quarter, which was slightly better than the 20% growth that we reported for the third quarter of 2020. Seasonal base business markets grew 16%, but this compares to a very strong third quarter of the previous year, where we reported 33% growth for the same quarter. For context here, weather conditions were generally favorable in most markets for the quarter. 
Looking at end markets and excluding the impact of acquisitions, I am happy to report that commercial pool product demand has come back to greater than prepandemic levels. For the quarter, commercial product sales increased 25%, bringing the total year-to-date growth rate to 24%. We saw more pools reopen with elevated usage, driving maintenance and repair spend and construction projects are starting to flow again. This is a very encouraging sign as this market was impacted the most during the COVID travel and public gathering restrictions. 
Retail product sales were encouraging with demand up 16%, which compares to the 28% growth that we reported in this end market for the same quarter of 2020. Chemical shortages have impacted this part of the business more severely than others as it is a key product for a retail-focused customer. 
From a product perspective, equipment sales growth was strong, posting gains of 23% for the period. This category includes pumps, heaters, lights, filters and automation. Chemical sales were up 10% for the quarter as the industry grappled with shortages and managed rolling stockouts on key products. As mentioned previously, the reduction in industry capacity after a major fire at the BioLab plant last year left the industry in a net short position on trichlor and drove significant inflation on available product. Fortunately, there are several ways to sanitize a pool, and the industry has adapted and improvised to keep pools clean and safe. 
This tightness in chemical supply is likely to continue into next season as BioLab rebuilds its plant. In the meantime, capacity expansion from the remaining players, product substitutions and imports should mitigate the effects albeit at elevated price levels. 
Lastly, building material demand remains strong in all markets. Sales for this product line grew 24% in the quarter, and this is on top of the 29% growth that we posted in the third quarter of 2020. On a year-to-date basis, we are up 30%, which is driven by a very robust construction and remodel market. 
Turning to Europe, sales grew 5% in the quarter. But bear in mind, we had a very difficult comp here as last year for the same period, our European sales grew 45%. Like North America, demand remained strong, but cooler and wetter weather and supply shortages had a significant impact on the team in the third quarter. 
Horizon continues to accelerate, posting overall revenue growth of 25% in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date sales growth to 28%. Base business sales growth was 20% and 22%, respectively, for the quarter-to-date and year-to-date results. 
We are very pleased with how this business is performing, and we continue to invest in this platform. Like the blue business, supply shortages and extended lead times continue to be a challenge for our team, but their grit, determination and focus on the customer have driven solid share gains in the industry. 
Now let me turn to gross margins. For the quarter, our overall gross margin was 31.3%, which is a 240 basis point improvement over 2020. On a year-to-date basis, we are up 170 basis points. Like last year and last quarter, this improvement is driven by supply chain execution, certain volume-related incentives, inflation benefits and product mix. In addition, we have been focused on more strategic and disciplined pricing, which is helping us in the current environment and will continue to help us going forward. 
Our ability to strategically leverage our balance sheet has been a key factor in our success in both the 2020 and 2021 season. This is a key differentiator for POOLCORP, and it has allowed us to provide industry-leading customer service while capturing greater value and positioning us for a great start to the 2022 season. 
From an expense perspective, the team again delivered incredible results. Our operating expenses for the quarter were up 13%, which is outstanding given our 24% revenue growth for the quarter. Yet again, the team's focus on execution, hard work and capacity creation initiatives allowed us to achieve record levels of operating leverage. 
POOL360 continues to be a cornerstone of our business, comprising 12% of our revenue and growing 47% in the quarter. We are excited to announce that, beginning in the fourth quarter, we will be rolling out the next generation of this strategic platform that we think will further drive adoption and help our customers be more efficient. 
Wrapping up the income statement, I could not be more pleased to report that our operating income increased 60% in the quarter to $237.3 million, by any measure a masterful performance and a true reflection of the incredible team and unmatched capabilities at POOLCORP. 
Finally, with 3 full quarters behind us and a very favorable outlook for the balance of the year, we are updating our earnings guidance for the full year of 2021 to $14.85 per share to $15.35 per share. Excluding the ASU benefit, the range is $14.46 to $14.96 per share. 
Before turning the call over to Melanie, let me offer some closing thoughts. Beginning with the onset of the pandemic in 2020, we saw a change in consumer behavior that created a significant increase in demand for our products as people with pools used them more and those without a pool or outdoor living area began looking for someone to build them their own backyard retreat. We believe that this trend will endure as the flexible work-from-home arrangements continue and people recognize the many benefits of an enjoyable outdoor living lifestyle. 
When you add this to a healthy housing market where equity levels have increased nicely in the last couple of years and with pools now regarded as a highly desirable feature, according to the National Association of REALTORS, it simply furthers our confidence in the long-term growth prospects for the industry. We believe people will continue to move away from urban and higher cost of living areas to more affordable suburban housing in pool-friendly markets, furthering their desire to invest in the outdoor living lifestyle. We feel that the southern migration will continue for the foreseeable future, giving those people a year-round environment to enjoy pools, patios, hot tubs and outdoor kitchens. Further, we have been encouraged to see industry capacity start to expand as our customers seek to expand their businesses albeit in a very challenging labor environment. 
From a supply perspective, manufacturers are also adding capacity, which should allow them to capture more of the elevated industry demand. Inflation this year will likely be in the 6% to 7% range, up from our previous estimate of 5% to 6%. And it looks like that will repeat again for next year given the global supply chain issues. To date, this has done little to temper demand and, in time, this inflation passes through the supply chain. 
All in all, we are positioned incredibly well to continue our tremendous performance. Demand is strong. The team is focused. And by working very closely with our vendors and customers, we bring outdoor living to life. 
Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Melanie Hart, our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, for her commentary."
34117,1684676309,2420423,"Pool Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2021",2021-10-21,"Earnings Calls","Pool Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Pete, and good morning, everyone. I am thrilled to provide some additional commentary on our exceptional third quarter financial results. We have continued to see positive growth trends in the third quarter related to both our net sales growth",1455,"Thank you, Pete, and good morning, everyone. I am thrilled to provide some additional commentary on our exceptional third quarter financial results. We have continued to see positive growth trends in the third quarter related to both our net sales growth and gross margin. Net sales benefited approximately 7% from inflation and 5% from acquisitions in the quarter. 
We once again realized higher-than-normal increases in gross margins. Gross margin saw an increase of 240 basis points during the quarter, with base business gross margins up 250 basis points. Consistent with our discussion on our second quarter earnings call to address the anticipated supply chain constraints, we took the opportunity to purchase ahead in product areas where we forecasted continued high demand. Our strong inventory position has allowed us to gain share and to continue to provide exceptional service in a high demand and tight supply chain environment. 
As we have seen product cost increases come more frequently than in the past, we have established systematic pricing updates to ensure we quickly adjust to the more rapidly changing environment. Additionally, we have an ongoing process in place to focus on a judicious evaluation of all customer pricing, taking into consideration the cost to serve each specific customer. 
Having the capital strength to be able to confidently move forward with increasing the amount of materials in the supply chain is a strength for POOLCORP that sets us apart from many of our competitors. Our higher purchasing levels resulted in higher volume-driven vendor incentives, which also benefited gross margins for the quarter. 
Given the better-than-expected third quarter results, we now anticipate gross margin improvements of more than 170 basis points for the full year 2021 compared to 2020, versus the 100 basis point improvement we were expecting at the end of the second quarter. 
Record sales growth and improving gross margins only tell a portion of the story of our results for the quarter. We have also reduced our quarter-to-date consolidated operating expenses as a percentage of net sales by 130 basis points. These expenses, excluding the note recovery, were up 14%, while consolidated net sales grew 24% in the quarter. 
Base business operating expenses were down 160 basis points at 14.2% of net sales for the quarter on sales growth of 19%. We have seen inflationary cost increases in the areas of compensation, health care, freight and rent. Our continued effort on capacity creation in our existing locations has generated strong operating expense leverage. 
Our gross margin expansion and strong operating expense management has allowed our operating margin to grow by 380 basis points, coming in at 16.8% of net sales for the third quarter compared to 13% in third quarter of prior year. 
Interest expense of $2.3 million is up slightly compared to $1.9 million in prior year. Third quarter 2021 average debt was $354.3 million compared to $331.5 million for 2020. Our trailing 12-month leverage ratio was right around 0.5 at quarter end. 
During the third quarter, we amended our revolving credit agreement to increase the total borrowing capacity from $750 million to $1 billion. The renewal allows for lower available interest rates and favorable terms on covenants and also provides us substantial capacity and liquidity to maintain our strong balance sheet and efficiently manage our capital structure going forward. 
Our annual tax rate, excluding the ASU benefit, is expected to be around 25% on pretax earnings for the full year, coming in slightly lower for the third quarter at 23.2%. 
Our ASU tax benefit in the third quarter was $4.2 million or $0.10 per share. This was less than the $8.5 million or $0.21 realized in the same quarter of last year. As these benefits result from employee stock option exercises that occurred during the quarter, the timing is difficult to forecast and, therefore, not included in our guidance range until realized. We do have an additional $1.4 million of ASU benefit related to stock options that should be recognized between fourth quarter of 2021 and first quarter 2022 based on expiration dates and calculated at the current stock price. 
Next, I'll discuss our balance sheet and cash flows. Increases in our total net receivables of 30% reflects our sales growth in the quarter. Our day sales outstanding at the end of the quarter was 25.7, down from 27.6 days in 2020. 
Looking at inventory compared to 2020 reflects an increase of 70%, or 63% on a base business comparison, as we invested in inventory to efficiently serve our customers and better manage supply chain disruptions. We have also added inventory to support our 10 new locations opened since last year. 
Inventory levels at September of 2020 were less than we would have liked and virtually flat with 2019 coming off of the strong selling season. Our third quarter 2-year sales growth was 57%. Our deliberate purchasing actions have us well positioned to support ongoing sales growth into 2022. We saw our inventory turn days improve from 97.5 in 2020 to 94.7 in 2021. 
Cash from operating activities is $359 million on a year-to-date basis driven by strong earnings contribution and also reflecting the investments made into inventory. Our return on invested capital of 50.9% is up from the prior year of 36.4% and highlights our sound deployment of capital. 
Operating cash flows for the quarter benefited from deferred income tax payments as we took advantage of the IRS relief for those impacted by Hurricane Ida. We are able to defer payments that would typically be made in third and fourth quarters of 2021 until January of 2022. In the ordinary course, we would have made our third quarter estimated federal tax payments of $56 million. 
I want to pause to thank all of our teams that were in the areas impacted by Ida. Certain of our sales centers were operating on generator power to get products to our customers so they could begin repairs as quickly as possible. Many of our support teams relocated out of the area to continue to serve our field. 
Overall, our disaster recovery plans operated flawlessly and without major disruptions to our customers. In support of our employer of choice initiatives, we have established during the quarter the POOLCORP Employees 1st Fund to support any employees that are impacted by natural disasters. 
So far in 2021, we have executed on 132 million of our authorized share buybacks, leaving 495 million available under our repurchase authorization. Share buyback so far in 2021 exceed the amounts repurchased in 2019 and 2020 combined and continue to be an area of value add to the shareholders as part of our overall strategic plan. We have repurchased 343,000 shares year-to-date at an average price of $386 per share. 
Acquisitions added 5% to our sales growth for the third quarter and 7% for the year-to-date results. However, as we move into the fourth quarter, we begin to lap several of the larger acquisitions completed in 2020. So the impact of acquisitions on the results for the remainder of the year will not have as significant of an impact. We would expect acquisitions to add only about 1% to our sales growth in the fourth quarter. 
As we look at how we think -- we expect to close out the year, sales growth momentum from the third quarter has shown that demand continues to be strong. For 2021, we have 1 less selling day than we did in the fourth quarter of 2020. We expect sales growth of over 30% for the full year. This considers our projected fourth quarter sales growth rate to moderate with 1 less selling day. Normal weather assumptions for the fourth quarter this year compared to the favorable weather last year and net results from our Jet Line acquisition are included in both comparable periods. Fourth quarter prior year sales growth was 39% for base business. 
Gross margins should remain with a positive outlook as a result of our inventory investments, with improvements in the range of what we were able to achieve in both second quarter and third quarter of this year. Purposeful expense management will allow for a full year operating margin improvement of 350 basis points. This improvement is well in excess of our historical results. And while it may have been bolstered by exceptional top line and gross margin growth, the principles underlying our ability to improve over time remain strong. 
We have increased the range for the full year 2021 to consider earnings results for the third quarter, including an additional $0.10 from ASU, expected positive demand trends and have provided updated guidance of $14.85 to $15.35 per diluted share. 
I will now turn the call back over to our operator for a question-and-answer session."

And I guess I would unpack that a little bit and look at the elements, right? So you have inflation, which again, a little bit early to tell you what the total inflationary effect is going to be for 2022, but inflation is certainly going to be elevated. 
We think new pool construction this year will be between 110,000 and 115,000 units, which puts new pool construction up 20%. So the installed base has grown nicely over the last couple of years. Demand is still strong. The commercial business has come back and backlogs are good. 
So I would say for -- again, we're not ready to call a 2022 number, but I would just go back and look at the elements that we think are driving demand. I think the work-from-home dynamic is going to stay in place. I think southern migration will stay in place. The housing market is in good shape. 
So we're encouraged by the results. And if you break down what drives our growth, we'll have -- I think we said we opened 10 locations this year. We should have a similar number for next year, a couple of acquisitions this year. We have a good M&A pipeline going. So it's -- the elements are in place for another good year."

But really, outside of that, there's more direct factors that I would want you to take into account. So I know that we've talked a lot about capacity creation, so we've covered those historically. But the other thing that's really not evident in these numbers, because of the hard work that the team has put through, is the fact that within this environment, a lot of the market share that we've gotten and a lot of the share gains have come from our ability to serve our customers.

And the way I would think about it is you really have to think -- you have to consider what products we're talking about. So if you look at the major equipment suppliers in North America, they -- I think they're going to be in better shape for next year. Certainly, they would -- you'll ask them the same question, as I'm sure. But based on what we are seeing, they won't have the COVID hangover that they started the year with. 
So I think production rates, at least the amount of inventory that we're getting, is much better than it was. So we feel good about their ability to -- and I think I mentioned that in my comments, that they'll be able to pace better with us going into the 2022 season and -- number one; and number two, our inventory position starting the 2022 season is going to be better, which again creates a little breathing room for them. 
One exception, notable exception, would be on chemicals, as I said. Because in that situation, with the BioLab fire, that was a huge chunk of the industry's capacity of the trichlor product. So that whole is being made up a couple of different ways. So in that case, there is some import product that is coming in. And as you know, with the snarled supply chains, it's taking longer and it's more expensive when it gets here.
But I think the domestic -- the remaining domestic producers are also going to be in a better position from a capacity perspective to provide more product. And then there's also alternatives for sanitization, which is -- would primarily be either salt system or liquids, chlorine shock, which will, again, I think, be in a better position. 
So all in all, I think the industry is ramping up and it has ramped up and worked very, very hard. We mentioned our folks working very hard this year. Our suppliers have worked equally as hard, trying to keep pace with the industry. But I think we'll be in a better position going forward. I don't really see major changes in the supplier landscape."

But they're having to contend with the tight labor market that the entire world is having to manage through right now. 
So from a new construction basis, we think that new pools are going to be up, as I mentioned, about 20%. It could be a little bit more plus or minus, depending on what happens in the shoulder or in the remaining months of the fourth quarter, but activity is very strong. So it's going to leave them with a very good backlog to start the season. So I think from new construction, it's -- there's plenty of work, and we feel good about that continuing. 
Remodel is another area which is also a big portion of our business. And with the strong housing market and strong home equity values, the remodel and renovation market is good. And our -- many of our dealers are also booked out for many months with pending remodel and renovation projects.

What I will tell you is that we are very focused on the customer experience. So we recognize that we are busy. We recognize that demand is elevated and people need product, but we also don't take that for granted. So our team works tirelessly to make sure that we provide the best value for our customers. 
So it's not just about having the product. It's about having a product and it's competitively priced. And it's available when they need it, and other tools that allow the dealers to be more productive, tools that allow the dealers to expand and grow their business, whether it's our marketing programs or whether it's our digital marketing tools or whether it's the POOL360, which allows remote access. They can look up schematics. They can order parts. They can put things in priority pick. 
So I can tell you that we measure things like speed at the counter. And for our dealers, time is one of their most critical resources. So it's not just -- we don't just look at sales dollars. Even as busy as we have been, we still measure cycle time to serve a customer at the counter because in a business like ours, approximately 70% of our transactions take place at the counter. 
So nobody knows for sure how much of the share gains will remain with us. But I can tell you that my entire team, all the way down, right through every employee in POOLCORP, is very focused on providing the very best customer experience. And we think that in the long run, that wins out. 
So if you have the right product, have the right locations -- that's why we're expanding our footprint so that we have capacity and that we're conveniently located for our dealers and that we have robust inventory management programs in place so that we have more product than anybody else available; that we have the technical expertise, that we have the marketing programs, that we appreciate the time with them at our sales centers and don't ever take that for granted. And we try and get them in as quickly -- in and out as quickly as possible, we think that in the end, that's going to serve us best. And that gives us the best chance of retaining the share gains that we have received."

And I can tell you right now, the amount of leads that they have and the amount of work that they have booked would suggest that, for the time being, they're in very good shape. 
But then I fall back to the -- kind of the macroeconomic conditions that we think are driving the result. I would tell you that, as I mentioned, this work-from-home dynamic has certainly enhanced people's desire for a pool or a patio and outdoor living because, frankly, they're spending more time at home and less time in the car commuting or at an office. 
We think that people moving out of high-cost living areas -- and when they're exiting those areas, they're exiting with very nice gains on home equity. So they're armed with very good down payments that they can use for renovations and remodels on the new home that they purchased in a lower-cost living area. In many cases, that happens to be in more year-round markets. 
So quite frankly, we're very encouraged by the outlook. We don't look at it as a short-term gain. We look at the underlying fundamentals and say that things are good. Now that -- a lot of that is tied to the housing market. So if the housing market -- as long as the housing market stays strong, people feel that their financial condition is good and improving, then we think that the desire to spend money on outdoor -- the outdoor living experience, whether it's a pool, a patio, a hot tub or an outdoor kitchen, we think has a lot of legs and will continue."

My 4 operating principles are safety, growth, profitability and employer of choice. And what makes employer of choice so important is that there's really nothing that you can buy from me that you can't buy from anybody else. It simply is the team and the value proposition that they create around those products that you can get from other folks that make the difference. 
We are very fortunate, very blessed to have an extremely dedicated team. And I couldn't be prouder of the results and more appreciative of the results and the hard work that they have put in, in order for us to accomplish and, frankly, to facilitate our dealers and our customers' ability to accomplish what they've done. 
So we strive to take very good care of our employees we have. I think Melanie mentioned that our incentive compensation, which a year ago we were telling you, well, could be the source of some cost savings. Our operating -- sorry, our bonus program this year, incentive compensation, whatever you want to call it, is up significantly and will be up. So we're basically taking the bounty of the terrific results we have, and we are sharing it with the folks. 
But it's not just about money. It's about appreciation and recognition of their efforts. And I think we've done more of that this year than we ever have done. And it's something that has allowed us to keep the workforce together behind us and engaged."

We're seeing that distributors are perhaps over ordering, right, 130. They really want to get 100 units. Can you give a little context for why you think that dynamic, which you also expressed, might not be sending the wrong signal through the chain, through the manufacturers, i.e., if everybody is over ordering a little bit, right, backlogs for everybody look a little stronger when they're not there?"

I think what you have to keep in context is that -- Melanie pointed out in her comments that the inventory is up in dollars quite a bit. But if you look at it in days, our days of inventory are actually down. So it really is about getting your head wrapped around what the true demand signal is and making sure that we have products in place. 
Now the demand signal from the market is very strong, right? So the backlog, the amount of work that they have today and the amount of work that they have for -- going into 2022, and as I mentioned, sometimes all the way through the 2022 season. If you simply just look at the amount of product that is on order and you turn the crank on how much product we're going to need through the balance of the 2022 season, it doesn't really give me much concern at all in terms of, wow, we have too much product. 
Frankly, at this point, I'd really rather err on the high side because it allows flexibility on our customer side to keep them moving forward. Because every time one of our dealers has to go back to a job to complete it because they -- maybe they didn't have the whole goods that they needed or the part that they needed, that simply is a huge productivity drain on them. So we've worked very hard to make sure that we have as much of that product on a first-time fill rate to allow them to keep going. 
So again, given the dollars, given the seasonality that this is the time of the year that we should be ramping up from inventory to start and be prepared for the 2022 season. So I'm not really concerned with the amount of product that's on order because we will certainly go through it."
