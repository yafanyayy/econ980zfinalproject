Eric and I will address your questions at the end of our remarks.
Signature Bank continues to experience extraordinary growth during the country's protracted and challenging recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Our business philosophy of a client-centric, single point of contact model led by experienced group directors continues to distinguish us particularly in times of distress. Additionally, the bank has an accelerating multifaceted growth profile with traditional private client banking teams leading the charge in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Further fortifying the bank's market position are a multitude of national businesses, including Signature Financial; asset-based lending; fund banking; venture banking; digital banking; including Signet; and specialized mortgage banking solutions. The collective strength of our franchise led to an unbelievable quarter of record deposit growth, record loan growth, record pretax pre-provision earnings and record net income. We look forward to a healthier 2021 as recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic commences. 
Now let's take a look at earnings. Let's take a close look at earnings. Pretax pre-provision earnings for the 2020 fourth quarter were $261.5 million, an increase of $45 million or 21% compared with $21.3 million for the 2019 fourth quarter. Net income for the 2020 fourth quarter was a record $173 million or $3.26 diluted earnings per share compared with $147.6 million or $2.76 diluted earnings per share reported in the same period last year. The increase in income was predominantly driven by substantial asset growth of $23.3 billion, offset by the investments we made in new businesses, including our West Coast expansion. 
Looking at deposits. Deposits increased a record $9 billion or 16.5% to $63.3 billion this quarter, while average deposits grew a record $10.4 billion. For the year, deposits increased to record $22.9 billion, and average deposits increased a record $12.5 billion. Noninterest-bearing deposits of $18.8 billion represent a high 30% of total deposits. Our deposit and loan growth led to a record increase of $23.3 billion or 46% in total assets for the year, which reached nearly $74 billion. 
Now let's take a look at our lending businesses. Core loans, or loans excluding PPP during the 2020 fourth quarter, increased a record $2.7 billion or 6.2% to $47 billion. For the year, core loans grew a record $7.8 billion or 20%. The increase in loans this quarter was again driven primarily by new fund banking capital call facilities. This is the ninth consecutive quarter where C&I outpaced CRE growth, furthering the rapid transformation of the balance sheet to include more floating rate assets as we continue to diversify our portfolio. 
Nonaccrual loans were $120 million or 25 basis points of total loans compared with $81 million or 18 basis points for the 2020 third quarter. Our date -- 30- to [ 89-day ] past due loans increased to $234.9 million. It is important to note that $88.3 million of the 30- to 89-day past dues were caused by processing and documentation delays given COVID-19 circumstances, and we are now current. Our 90-day-plus past due loans remained very low at $5.8 million. 
Net charge-offs for the 2020 fourth quarter were $11.4 million or 10 basis points compared with $10.5 million for the 2020 third quarter. The provision for credit losses for the 2020 fourth quarter was $35.6 million compared with $52.7 million for the 2020 third quarter. This brought the bank's allowance for credit losses to 1.04%, and the coverage ratio stands at a healthy 42%. I would like to point out that if we took -- if we look at the ACL ratio, excluding very well-secured fund banking loans and government-guaranteed PPP loans would be much higher at 1.41%. 
Turning to modifications. As of December 31, 2020, the bank has entered into COVID-19 principal and interest modifications of $1.3 billion or 2.7%. Of that balance, $107 million remain in short-term modifications. 
We fully anticipate that we will have increased nonaccrual loans and charge-offs in the coming quarters due to the effect of COVID. But given the level of our allowance for credit losses, where we prudently doubled the allowance, adding $258 million since the adoption of CECL, we believe we are adequately covered for what may come. 
Now on to the greatly expanding team front, where we had much success. In 2020, we added a total of 20 private client banking teams, 2 in New York, 5 in San Francisco and 13 in the Greater Los Angeles area, marking our entry into the Southern California marketplace. The bank now has a total of 116 product client banking teams, of which 23 are located on the West Coast. 
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Eric, and he will review the quarter's financial results in greater detail."
913010,701281811,2177805,"Signature Bank, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2021",2021-01-21,"Earnings Calls","Signature Bank","Executives","Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by reviewing net interest income and margin. Net interest income for the fourth quarter reached $395 million, an increase of $6.3 million from the 2020 third quarter. Net interest margin for the quart",579,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by reviewing net interest income and margin. Net interest income for the fourth quarter reached $395 million, an increase of $6.3 million from the 2020 third quarter. Net interest margin for the quarter declined 32 basis points to 2.23% compared with 2.55% for the 2020 third quarter. The entire decrease and then some was due to excess cash balances from significant deposit flows, which impacted margin by 46 basis points. 
Let's look at asset yields and funding costs for a moment. Interest-earning asset yields for the 2020 fourth quarter decreased 41 basis points from the linked quarter to 2.75%. The decrease in overall asset yields was again driven by the excess average cash balances, which grew from $5.6 billion to $12.5 billion during the quarter. Additionally, asset yields continue to be affected by lower reinvestment rates in all of our asset classes. Yields on the securities portfolio decreased 46 basis points linked quarter to 2.13% due to the decline in market rates as well as the bank investing in floating rate securities, and our portfolio duration remained low at 2.2 years. 
Turning to our loan portfolio. Yields on average commercial loans and commercial mortgages decreased 6 basis points to 3.6% compared with the 2020 third quarter. This was mostly due to lower origination yields. And excluding prepayment penalties from both quarters, yields decreased by 4 basis points. 
Now looking at liabilities. Our overall deposit cost this quarter decreased 9 basis points to 42 basis points due to the low interest rate environment. We anticipate this downward trend to continue in 2021. 
During the quarter, average borrowing balances decreased by $744 million to $3 billion. The overall cost of funds for the quarter decreased 9 basis points to 57 basis points driven by the reduction in deposit costs and decreased average borrowings, which was slightly offset by the addition of subordinated debt with a 4% coupon. 
On to noninterest income and expense. Noninterest income for the 2020 fourth quarter was $24.2 million, an increase of $8.2 million or 51% when compared with the 2019 fourth quarter. The increase is mostly due to a rise of $5.5 million in fees and service charges as well as an increase of $2.4 million in trading income. Noninterest expense for the 2020 fourth quarter was $157.7 million versus $138 million for the same period a year ago, and $19.6 million or 14% increase was principally due to the addition of new private client banking teams. 
And despite our significant team hirings and margin compression from significant cash balances, the banks actually gained operating leverage. And as a result, our efficiency ratio improved to 37.6% for the 2020 fourth quarter versus 39% in for the comparable period last year and 38.9% for the 2020 third quarter. 
And turning to capital. During the quarter, the bank successfully raised $730 million in noncumulative perpetual Series A preferred stock, which qualifies as Tier 1 capital. Additionally, the bank issued $375 million in subordinated debt, which qualifies as Tier 2 capital. All capital ratios remained well in excess of regulatory requirements that augment the relatively low-risk profile of the balance sheet as evidenced by a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 8.55% and a total risk-based ratio of 13.4% as of the 2020 fourth quarter. And finally, the bank paid a cash dividend of $0.56 per share of common stock. 
And now I'll turn the call back to Joe. Thank you."

I'd like to thank my colleagues, a number of who are listening on the call today, who have demonstrated their dedication to our clients and their needs during this pandemic. Times like these, our clients truly value the level of care and advice that my colleagues provide. And our performance for the year reflects their extraordinary efforts and the strength of our franchise as we continue to execute on many, many fronts. 
2020 was truly a remarkable year of growth and achievement for Signature Bank. On the deposit front, which is our key metric, we delivered unbelievable record deposit growth of $23 billion or 57%, and we reduced the cost of deposits from a high of 121 basis points in Q3 2019 to 42 basis points at year-end with room for further reductions. 
Demand deposits increased a record $5.7 million -- excuse me, $5.7 billion for the year and remain at a high 30% of total deposits. And most importantly, our deposit growth came across the board from our existing teams to all of our new businesses. There were literally 26 traditional banking teams in New York that grew over $100 million each. Our newly established teams on the West Coast grew over $1 billion. The specialized mortgage banking solutions team grew over $3.5 billion. The Venture Banking Group grew nearly $1 billion, and our digital banking team grew over $8 billion in deposits. We have clearly distinguished ourselves as the predominant bank in the digital space. 
Turning to loans. We had record core loan growth of nearly $8 billion, driven by another of our new businesses, the Fund Banking Division, which delivered nearly $7 billion in loan growth. Additionally, Signature Financial had another strong year and surpassed $5 billion in outstanding loans that ranks as the 15th largest bank lender in this space, a truly remarkable accomplishment for that team. Congratulations, guys. 
Furthermore, as planned, we held our commercial real estate loan balances flat over the last 2 years and made great strides in reducing our CRE concentration to 376% and from 51% at year-end 2018. 
Looking at earnings. The bank's pretax pre-provision earnings grew by $136 million or 16% on for the year, and we had a strong ROE of 10.75% despite a heavy amount of provisioning and margin compression due to excess cash balances. Fee income or noninterest income grew by 22% or $13.5 million for the year, and several of our fee income initiatives are just starting to take hold. Additionally, we improved our already best-in-class efficiency ratio during the year to 37.6%. 
On the capital front, we meaningfully improved our capital position by over $1 billion with the issuance of $375 million in subordinated debt and $730 million in preferred stock. Moreover, we maintained our dividend while turning off our buyback program to support the tremendous level of growth. And most importantly, we set the stage for future growth with the hiring of 20 private client banking teams and the opening of 5 new offices in the Los Angeles marketplace. 
Everything we said we would do this year, we did. Everything we said we would do this year, we did. Our growth for 2020 was equivalent to acquiring a top 50 bank, but we did it organically and without expanding shareholder value. Signature Bank enters 2020 as a strong financial institution, and we very much look forward to years to come. 
Now we are happy to answer any questions you might have. Lori, I'll turn it back to you."

We do, as Joe pointed out, we hope to get the deposit cost down another 9 basis points or so, and we'll be in the mid- to low 30s come quarter end. Certainly, we have ability to deploy on the asset side. We can really put $1 billion to $2 billion per quarter to work in the securities portfolio and another $1 billion to $2 billion per quarter to work on the loan side. So we're going to have $2 billion to $4 billion in asset growth. I mean that's a little bit easier for us to predict. The hard part is the deposit flows. Thus far, this quarter, it slowed down a little bit, but we still have growth. We certainly don't anticipate $8 billion worth of deposit flows this coming quarter, but we expect it to continue to happen, which is great. So all that being said, the NII will be up, and that much we can predict. And I think it should be up pretty nicely. The NIM is impossible at this point to predict because of the nature of the deposit flows, and it's hard to say. More are going to come in, and we'll be able to make a meaningful impact to all the cash that we're sitting on. But we should have some pretty substantial NII growth."

And I'm not sure if you're able to disclose, but going back to the earlier question around bringing in deposits at may be marginally higher rates than what the market offers. Like, I'm assuming the new deposits that are coming in are fairly much lower than the low to mid-30s where you expect the total cost of deposits going through. Any color around that? And just talk to us, Eric, in terms of why it is worth paying up for these deposits in terms of what franchise value these add in the near term and over time for Signature? Well, I think, for an example, the mortgage servicing, specialized mortgage servicing team. They bring in, on a daily basis, tremendous number of accounts of DDA noninterest-bearing and then some of the escrows that had big dollars that stay -- that flow in and out much less frequently. We're paying right now in the 30 basis point range. But when you combine the 2, 30 and then the DDA, you're coming down below 30. So I think everyone focuses on NIM, but the real place the focus is on the efficiency because we're a lot more efficient bringing these deposits in than a retail group. A retail group will have much lower deposit costs, but they will have high real estate costs high marketing and higher advertising costs, where we don't have that. So that bodes well for the efficiency ratio. But we have a lot of room. Like I said earlier, we brought the cost down to 37 basis points from 41 basis points in December to January now. So 1 month, we're down 4 basis points, and we continue to drive it down further. We don't have that retail component. So we don't have the expense, but we also don't have the retail component where we can drop the rates as quickly as you look for the large clients that we have in our portfolio."

Eric and I will address your questions at the end of our remarks. 
Signature Bank continues to experience extraordinary growth during the country's protracted and challenging recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Our business philosophy of a client-centric, single point of contact model led by experienced group directors continues to distinguish us particularly in times of distress. Additionally, the bank has an accelerating multifaceted growth profile with traditional private client banking teams leading the charge in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Further fortifying the bank's market position are a multitude of national businesses, including Signature Financial, asset-based lending, fund banking; venture banking; digital banking, including Signet; and specialized mortgage banking solutions. The collective strength of our franchise led to an unbelievable quarter of record deposit growth, record loan growth, record pretax pre-provision earnings and record net income. We look forward to a healthier 2021 as recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic commences.
Now let's take a look at earnings. Let's take a close look at earnings. Pretax pre-provision earnings for the 2020 fourth quarter were $261.5 million, an increase of $45 million or 21% compared with $216.3 million for the 2019 fourth quarter. Net income for the 2020 fourth quarter was a record $173 million or $3.26 diluted earnings per share compared with $147.6 million or $2.76 diluted earnings per share reported in the same period last year. The increase in income was predominantly driven by substantial asset growth of $23.3 billion offset by the investments we made in new businesses, including our West Coast expansion.
Looking at deposits. Deposits increased a record $9 billion or 16.5% to $63.3 billion this quarter, while average deposits grew a record $10.4 billion. For the year, deposits increased to record $22.9 billion, and average deposits increased a record $12.5 billion. Noninterest-bearing deposits of $18.8 billion represent a high 30% of total deposits. Our deposit and loan growth led to a record increase of $23.3 billion or 46% in total assets for the year, which reached nearly $74 billion.
Now let's take a look at our lending businesses. Core loans or loans excluding PPP during the 2020 fourth quarter increased a record $2.7 billion or 6.2% to $47 billion. For the year, core loans grew a record $7.8 billion or 20%. The increase in loans this quarter was again driven primarily by new fund banking capital call facilities. This is the ninth consecutive quarter where C&I outpaced CRE growth, furthering the rapid transformation of the balance sheet to include more floating rate assets as we continue to diversify our portfolio.
Nonaccrual loans were $120 million or 25 basis points of total loans compared with $81 million or 18 basis points for the 2020 third quarter. Our date -- 30- to 89-day past due loans increased to $234.9 million. It is important to note that $88.3 million of the 30- to 89-day past dues were caused by processing and documentation delays given COVID-19 circumstances, and are now current. Our 90-day-plus past due loans remained very low at $5.8 million.
Net charge-offs for the 2020 fourth quarter were $11.4 million or 10 basis points compared with $10.5 million for the 2020 third quarter. The provision for credit losses for the 2020 fourth quarter was $35.6 million compared with $52.7 million for the 2020 third quarter. This brought the bank's allowance for credit losses to 1.04%, and the coverage ratio stands at a healthy 423%. I would like to point out that if we took -- if we look at the ACL ratio, excluding very well-secured fund banking loans and government-guaranteed PPP loans would be much higher at 1.41%.
Turning to modifications. As of December 31, 2020, the bank has entered into COVID-19 principal and interest modifications of $1.3 billion or 2.7%. Of that balance, $107 million remain in short-term modifications. We fully anticipate that we will have increased nonaccrual loans and charge-offs in the coming quarters due to the effect of COVID. But given the level of our allowance for credit losses, where we prudently doubled the allowance, adding $258 million since the adoption of CECL, we believe we are adequately covered for what may come.
Now on to the greatly expanding team front, where we had much success. In 2020, we added a total of 20 private client banking teams: 2 in New York, 5 in San Francisco and 13 in the Greater Los Angeles area, marking our entry into the Southern California marketplace. The bank now has a total of 116 private client banking teams, of which 23 are located on the West Coast.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Eric, and he will review the quarter's financial results in greater detail."
913010,701281811,2177967,"Signature Bank, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2021",2021-01-21,"Earnings Calls","Signature Bank","Executives","Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by reviewing net interest income and margin. Net interest income for the fourth quarter reached $395 million, an increase of $6.3 million from the 2020 third quarter. Net interest margin for the quart",579,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by reviewing net interest income and margin. Net interest income for the fourth quarter reached $395 million, an increase of $6.3 million from the 2020 third quarter. Net interest margin for the quarter declined 32 basis points to 2.23% compared with 2.55% for the 2020 third quarter. The entire decrease and then some was due to excess cash balances from significant deposit flows, which impacted margin by 46 basis points.
Let's look at asset yields and funding costs for a moment. Interest-earning asset yields for the 2020 fourth quarter decreased 41 basis points from the linked quarter to 2.75%. The decrease in overall asset yields was again driven by the excess average cash balances, which grew from $5.6 billion to $12.5 billion during the quarter. Additionally, asset yields continue to be affected by lower reinvestment rates in all of our asset classes. Yields on the securities portfolio decreased 46 basis points linked quarter to 2.13% due to the decline in market rates as well as the bank investing in floating rate securities, and our portfolio duration remained low at 2.2 years.
Turning to our loan portfolio. Yields on average commercial loans and commercial mortgages decreased 6 basis points to 3.6% compared with the 2020 third quarter. This was mostly due to lower origination yields. And excluding prepayment penalties from both quarters, yields decreased by 4 basis points.
Now looking at liabilities. Our overall deposit cost this quarter decreased 9 basis points to 42 basis points due to the low interest rate environment. We anticipate this downward trend to continue in 2021. During the quarter, average borrowing balances decreased by $744 million to $3 billion. The overall cost of funds for the quarter decreased 9 basis points to 57 basis points driven by the reduction in deposit costs and decreased average borrowings, which was slightly offset by the addition of subordinated debt with a 4% coupon.
On to noninterest income and expense. Noninterest income for the 2020 fourth quarter was $24.2 million, an increase of $8.2 million or 51% when compared with the 2019 fourth quarter. The increase is mostly due to a rise of $5.5 million in fees and service charges as well as an increase of $2.4 million in trading income. Noninterest expense for the 2020 fourth quarter was $157.7 million versus $138 million for the same period a year ago and $19.6 million or 14% increase was principally due to the addition of new private client banking teams.
And despite our significant team hirings and margin compression from significant cash balances, the banks actually gained operating leverage. And as a result, our efficiency ratio improved to 37.6% for the 2020 fourth quarter versus 39% in for the comparable period last year and 38.9% for the 2020 third quarter.
And turning to capital. During the quarter, the bank successfully raised $730 million in noncumulative perpetual Series A preferred stock, which qualifies as Tier 1 capital. Additionally, the bank issued $375 million in subordinated debt, which qualifies as Tier 2 capital. All capital ratios remained well in excess of regulatory requirements that augment the relatively low-risk profile of the balance sheet as evidenced by a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 8.55% and a total risk-based ratio of 13.54% as of the 2020 fourth quarter. And finally, the bank paid a cash dividend of $0.56 per share of common stock.
And now I'll turn the call back to Joe. Thank you."

I'd like to thank my colleagues, a number of who are listening on the call today, who have demonstrated their dedication to our clients and their needs during this pandemic. Times like these, our clients truly value the level of care and advice that my colleagues provide. And our performance for the year reflects their extraordinary efforts and the strength of our franchise as we continue to execute on many, many fronts.
2020 was truly a remarkable year of growth and achievement for Signature Bank. On the deposit front, which is our key metric, we delivered unbelievable record deposit growth of $23 billion or 57%, and we reduced the cost of deposits from a high of 121 basis points in Q3 2019 to 42 basis points at year-end with room for further reductions. Demand deposits increased a record $5.7 million -- excuse me, $5.7 billion for the year and remain at a high 30% of total deposits.
And most importantly, our deposit growth came across the board from our existing teams to all of our new businesses. There were literally 26 traditional banking teams in New York that grew over $100 million each. Our newly established teams on the West Coast grew over $1 billion. The specialized mortgage banking solutions team grew over $3.5 billion. The Venture Banking Group grew nearly $1 billion, and our digital banking team grew over $8 billion in deposits. We have clearly distinguished ourselves as the predominant bank in the digital space.
Turning to loans. We had record core loan growth of nearly $8 billion, driven by another of our new businesses, the Fund Banking Division, which delivered nearly $7 billion in loan growth. Additionally, Signature Financial had another strong year and surpassed $5 billion in outstanding loans that ranks as the 15th largest bank lender in this space, a truly remarkable accomplishment for that team. Congratulations, guys. Furthermore, as planned, we held our commercial real estate loan balances flat over the last 2 years and made great strides in reducing our CRE concentration to 376% and from 551% at year-end 2018.
Looking at earnings. The bank's pretax pre-provision earnings grew by $136 million or 16% on for the year, and we had a strong ROE of 10.75% despite a heavy amount of provisioning and margin compression due to excess cash balances. Fee income or noninterest income grew by 22% or $13.5 million for the year, and several of our fee income initiatives are just starting to take hold. Additionally, we improved our already best-in-class efficiency ratio during the year to 37.6%.
On the capital front, we meaningfully improved our capital position by over $1 billion with the issuance of $375 million in subordinated debt and $730 million in preferred stock. Moreover, we maintained our dividend while turning off our buyback program to support the tremendous level of growth. And most importantly, we set the stage for future growth with the hiring of 20 private client banking teams and the opening of 5 new offices in the Los Angeles marketplace.
Everything we said we would do this year, we did. Everything we said we would do this year, we did. Our growth for 2020 was equivalent to acquiring a top 50 bank, but we did it organically and without expanding shareholder value. Signature Bank enters 2020 as a strong financial institution, and we very much look forward to years to come.
Now we are happy to answer any questions you might have. Lori, I'll turn it back to you."

We do, as Joe pointed out, we hope to get the deposit cost down another 9 basis points or so, and we'll be in the mid- to low 30s come quarter end. Certainly, we have ability to deploy on the asset side. We can really put $1 billion to $2 billion per quarter to work in the securities portfolio and another $1 billion to $2 billion per quarter to work on the loan side. So we're going to have $2 billion to $4 billion in asset growth. I mean that's a little bit easier for us to predict. The hard part is the deposit flows. Thus far, this quarter, it slowed down a little bit, but we still have growth. We certainly don't anticipate $8 billion worth of deposit flows this coming quarter, but we expect it to continue to happen, which is great.
So all that being said, the NII will be up, and that much we can predict. And I think it should be up pretty nicely. The NIM is impossible at this point to predict because of the nature of the deposit flows, and it's hard to say. More are going to come in, and we'll be able to make a meaningful impact to all the cash that we're sitting on. But we should have some pretty substantial NII growth."

A retail group will have much lower deposit costs, but they will have high real estate costs, high marketing and high advertising costs, but we don't have that. So that bodes well for the efficiency ratio.
But we have a lot of room. Like I said earlier, we brought the cost down to 37 basis points from 41 basis points in December to January now. So in 1 month, we're down 4 basis points, and we continue to drive it down further. We don't have that retail component.

I will provide some overview into the quarterly and annual results. And then Eric Howell, our Senior EVP of Corporate and Business Development, will review the bank's financial performance in greater detail. Eric and I will address your questions at the end of our remarks. 
Signature Bank continued to experience extraordinary growth during the country's protracted and challenging recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Our business philosophy of a client-centric, single point of contact model led by experienced group directors continues to distinguish us particularly in times of distress. Additionally, the bank has an accelerating multifaceted growth profile with traditional private client banking teams leading the charge in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles. 
Further fortifying the bank's market position are a multitude of national businesses, including Signature Financial, asset-based lending, fund banking; venture banking; digital banking, including Signet; and specialized mortgage banking solutions. The collective strength of our franchise led to an unbelievable quarter of record deposit growth, record loan growth, record pretax pre-provision earnings and record net income. We look forward to a healthier 2021 as recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic commences. 
Now let's take a look at earnings. Let's take a close look at earnings. Pretax pre-provision earnings for the 2020 fourth quarter were $261.5 million, an increase of $45 million or 21% compared with $216.3 million for the 2019 fourth quarter. Net income for the 2020 fourth quarter was a record $173 million or $3.26 diluted earnings per share compared with $147.6 million or $2.76 diluted earnings per share reported in the same period last year. The increase in income was predominantly driven by substantial asset growth of $23.3 billion offset by the investments we made in new businesses, including our West Coast expansion. 
Looking at deposits. Deposits increased a record $9 billion or 16.5% to $63.3 billion this quarter, while average deposits grew a record $10.4 billion. For the year, deposits increased a record $22.9 billion, and average deposits increased a record $12.5 billion. Noninterest-bearing deposits of $18.8 billion represent a high 30% of total deposits. Our deposit and loan growth led to a record increase of $23.3 billion or 46% in total assets for the year, which reached nearly $74 billion. 
Now let's take a look at our lending businesses. Core loans or loans excluding PPP during the 2020 fourth quarter increased a record $2.7 billion or 6.2% to $47 billion. For the year, core loans grew a record $7.8 billion or 20%. The increase in loans this quarter was again driven primarily by new fund banking capital call facilities. This is the ninth consecutive quarter where C&I outpaced CRE growth, furthering the rapid transformation of the balance sheet to include more floating rate assets as we continue to diversify our portfolio. 
Nonaccrual loans were $120 million or 25 basis points of total loans compared with $81 million or 18 basis points for the 2020 third quarter. Our date -- 30- to 89-day past due loans increased to $234.9 million. It is important to note that $88.3 million of the 30- to 89-day past dues were caused by processing and documentation delays given COVID-19 circumstances, but we are now current. Our 90-day-plus past due loans remained very low at $5.8 million. 
Net charge-offs for the 2020 fourth quarter were $11.4 million or 10 basis points compared with $10.5 million for the 2020 third quarter. The provision for credit losses for the 2020 fourth quarter was $35.6 million compared with $52.7 million for the 2020 third quarter. This brought the bank's allowance for credit losses to 1.04%, and the coverage ratio stands at a healthy 423%. I would like to point out that if we took -- if we look at the ACL ratio, excluding very well-secured fund banking loans, the government-guaranteed PPP loans would be much higher at 1.41%. 
Turning to modifications. As of December 31, 2020, the bank has entered into COVID-19 principal and interest modifications of $1.3 billion or 2.7%. Of that balance, $107 million remain in short-term modifications. We fully anticipate that we will have increased nonaccrual loans and charge-offs in the coming quarters due to the effect of COVID. But given the level of our allowance for credit losses, where we prudently doubled the allowance, adding $258 million since the adoption of CECL, we believe we are adequately covered for what may come. 
Now on to the greatly expanding team front, where we had much success. In 2020, we added a total of 20 private client banking teams: 2 in New York, 5 in San Francisco and 13 in the Greater Los Angeles area, marking our entry into the Southern California marketplace. The bank now has a total of 116 private client banking teams, of which 23 are located on the West Coast. 
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Eric, and he will review the quarter's financial results in greater detail."
913010,701281811,2233104,"Signature Bank, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2021",2021-01-21,"Earnings Calls","Signature Bank","Executives","Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by reviewing net interest income and margin. Net interest income for the fourth quarter reached $395 million, an increase of $6.3 million from the 2020 third quarter. Net interest margin for the quart",578,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by reviewing net interest income and margin. Net interest income for the fourth quarter reached $395 million, an increase of $6.3 million from the 2020 third quarter. Net interest margin for the quarter declined 32 basis points to 2.23% compared with 2.55% for the 2020 third quarter. The entire decrease and then some was due to excess cash balances from significant deposit flows, which impacted margin by 46 basis points. 
Let's look at asset yields and funding costs for a moment. Interest-earning asset yields for the 2020 fourth quarter decreased 41 basis points from the linked quarter to 2.75%. The decrease in overall asset yields was again driven by the excess average cash balances, which grew from $5.6 billion to $12.5 billion during the quarter. Additionally, asset yields continue to be affected by lower reinvestment rates in all of our asset classes. Yields on the securities portfolio decreased 46 basis points linked quarter to 2.13% due to the decline in market rates as well as the bank investing in floating rate securities, and our portfolio duration remained low at 2.2 years. 
Turning to our loan portfolio. Yields on average commercial loans and commercial mortgages decreased 6 basis points to 3.6% compared with the 2020 third quarter. This was mostly due to lower origination yields. And excluding prepayment penalties from both quarters, yields decreased by 4 basis points. 
Now looking at liabilities. Our overall deposit cost this quarter decreased 9 basis points to 42 basis points due to the low interest rate environment. We anticipate this downward trend to continue in 2021. During the quarter, average borrowing balances decreased by $744 million to $3 billion. The overall cost of funds for the quarter decreased 9 basis points to 57 basis points driven by the reduction in deposit costs and decreased average borrowings, which was slightly offset by the addition of subordinated debt with a 4% coupon. 
On to noninterest income and expense. Noninterest income for the 2020 fourth quarter was $24.2 million, an increase of $8.2 million or 51% when compared with the 2019 fourth quarter. The increase is mostly due to a rise of $5.5 million in fees and service charges as well as an increase of $2.4 million in trading income. Noninterest expense for the 2020 fourth quarter was $157.7 million versus $138 million for the same period a year ago and $19.6 million or 14% increase was principally due to the addition of new private client banking teams. 
And despite our significant team hirings and margin compression from significant cash balances, the banks actually gained operating leverage. And as a result, our efficiency ratio improved to 37.6% for the 2020 fourth quarter versus 39% for the comparable period last year and 38.9% for the 2020 third quarter. 
And turning to capital. During the quarter, the bank successfully raised $730 million in noncumulative perpetual Series A preferred stock, which qualifies as Tier 1 capital. Additionally, the bank issued $375 million in subordinated debt, which qualifies as Tier 2 capital. All capital ratios remained well in excess of regulatory requirements and augment the relatively low-risk profile of the balance sheet as evidenced by a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 8.55% and a total risk-based ratio of 13.54% as of the 2020 fourth quarter. And finally, the bank paid a cash dividend of $0.56 per share of common stock. 
And now I'll turn the call back to Joe. Thank you."

I'd like to thank my colleagues, a number of who are listening on the call today, who have demonstrated their dedication to our clients and their needs during this pandemic. Times like these, our clients truly value the level of care and advice that my colleagues provide. And our performance for the year reflects their extraordinary efforts and the strength of our franchise as we continue to execute on many, many fronts. 
2020 was truly a remarkable year of growth and achievement for Signature Bank. On the deposit front, which is our key metric, we delivered unbelievable record deposit growth of $23 billion or 57%. And we reduced the cost of deposits from a high of 121 basis points in Q3 2019 to 42 basis points at year-end with room for further reductions. Demand deposits increased a record $5.7 million -- excuse me, $5.7 billion for the year and remain at a high 30% of total deposits. 
And most importantly, our deposit growth came across the board from our existing teams to all of our new businesses. There were literally 26 traditional banking teams in New York that grew over $100 million each. Our newly established teams on the West Coast grew over $1 billion. The specialized mortgage banking solutions team grew over $3.5 billion. The Venture Banking Group grew nearly $1 billion, and our digital banking team grew over $8 billion in deposits. We have clearly distinguished ourselves as the predominant bank in the digital space. 
Turning to loans. We had record core loan growth of nearly $8 billion, driven by another of our new businesses, the Fund Banking Division, which delivered nearly $7 billion in loan growth. Additionally, Signature Financial had another strong year and surpassed $5 billion in outstanding loans and ranks as the 15th largest bank lender in this space, a truly remarkable accomplishment for that team. Congratulations, guys. Furthermore, as planned, we held our commercial real estate loan balances flat over the last 2 years and made great strides in reducing our CRE concentration to 276% from 551% at year-end 2018. 
Looking at earnings. The bank's pretax pre-provision earnings grew by $136 million or 16% for the year, and we had a strong ROE of 10.75% despite a heavy amount of provisioning and margin compression due to excess cash balances. Fee income or noninterest income grew by 20% or $13.5 million for the year, and several of our fee income initiatives are just starting to take hold. Additionally, we improved our already best-in-class efficiency ratio during the year to 37.6%. 
On the capital front, we meaningfully improved our capital position by over $1 billion with the issuance of $375 million in subordinated debt and $730 million in preferred stock. Moreover, we maintained our dividend while turning off our buyback program to support the tremendous level of growth. And most importantly, we set the stage for future growth with the hiring of 20 private client banking teams and the opening of 5 new offices in the Los Angeles marketplace. 
Everything we said we would do this year, we did. Everything we said we would do this year, we did. Our growth for 2020 was equivalent to acquiring a top 50 bank, but we did it organically and without expending shareholder value. Signature Bank enters 2020 (sic, 2021) as a strong financial institution, and we very much look forward to years to come. 
Now we are happy to answer any questions you might have. Lori, I'll turn it back to you."

We do, as Joe pointed out, we hope to get the deposit cost down another 9 basis points or so, and we'll be in the mid- to low 30s come quarter end. 
Certainly, we have ability to deploy on the asset side. We can really put $1 billion to $2 billion per quarter to work in the securities portfolio and another $1 billion to $2 billion per quarter to work on the loan side. So we're going to have $2 billion to $4 billion in asset growth. I mean that's a little bit easier for us to predict. The hard part is the deposit flows. Thus far, this quarter, it slowed down a little bit, but we still have growth. We certainly don't anticipate $8 billion worth of deposit flows this coming quarter, but we expect it to continue to happen, which is great. 
So all that being said, the NII will be up, and that much we can predict. And it should be up pretty nicely. The NIM is impossible at this point to predict because of the nature of deposit flows, and it's hard to say. More are going to come in, and we'll be able to make a meaningful impact to all the cash that we're sitting on. But we should have some pretty substantial NII growth."

But when you combine the 2, 30 and then the DDA, you're coming down below 30. So I think everyone focuses on NIM, but the real place to focus is on the efficiency because we're a lot more efficient bringing these deposits in than a retail group. A retail group will have much lower deposit costs, but they will have high real estate costs, high marketing and high advertising costs, but we don't have that. So that bodes well for the efficiency ratio. 
But we have a lot of room. Like I said earlier, we brought the cost down to 37 basis points from 41 basis points in December to January now. So within 1 month, we're down 4 basis points, and we continue to drive it down further. We don't have that retail component.

Signature Bank continued to experience extraordinary growth during the country's protracted and challenging recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Our business philosophy of a client-centric, single point of contact model led by experienced group directors continues to distinguish us particularly in times of distress. Additionally, the bank has an accelerating multifaceted growth profile with traditional private client banking teams leading the charge in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles. 
Further fortifying the bank's market position are a multitude of national businesses, including Signature Financial, asset-based lending, fund banking; venture banking; digital banking, including Signet; and specialized mortgage banking solutions. The collective strength of our franchise led to an unbelievable quarter of record deposit growth, record loan growth, record pretax pre-provision earnings and record net income. We look forward to a healthier 2021 as recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic commences. 
Now let's take a look at earnings. Let's take a close look at earnings. Pretax pre-provision earnings for the 2020 fourth quarter were $261.5 million, an increase of $45 million or 21% compared with $216.3 million for the 2019 fourth quarter. Net income for the 2020 fourth quarter was a record $173 million or $3.26 diluted earnings per share compared with $147.6 million or $2.76 diluted earnings per share reported in the same period last year. The increase in income was predominantly driven by substantial asset growth of $23.3 billion offset by the investments we made in new businesses, including our West Coast expansion. 
Looking at deposits. Deposits increased a record $9 billion or 16.5% to $63.3 billion this quarter, while average deposits grew a record $10.4 billion. For the year, deposits increased a record $22.9 billion, and average deposits increased a record $12.5 billion. Noninterest-bearing deposits of $18.8 billion represent a high 30% of total deposits. Our deposit and loan growth led to a record increase of $23.3 billion or 46% in total assets for the year, which reached nearly $74 billion. 
Now let's take a look at our lending businesses. Core loans or loans excluding PPP during the 2020 fourth quarter increased a record $2.7 billion or 6.2% to $47 billion. For the year, core loans grew a record $7.8 billion or 20%. The increase in loans this quarter was again driven primarily by new fund banking capital call facilities. This is the ninth consecutive quarter where C&I outpaced CRE growth, furthering the rapid transformation of the balance sheet to include more floating rate assets as we continue to diversify our portfolio. 
Nonaccrual loans were $120 million or 25 basis points of total loans compared with $81 million or 18 basis points for the 2020 third quarter. Our date -- 30- to 89-day past due loans increased to $234.9 million. It is important to note that $88.3 million of the 30- to 89-day past dues were caused by processing and documentation delays given COVID-19 circumstances, but we are now current. Our 90-day-plus past due loans remained very low at $5.8 million. 
Net charge-offs for the 2020 fourth quarter were $11.4 million or 10 basis points compared with $10.5 million for the 2020 third quarter. The provision for credit losses for the 2020 fourth quarter was $35.6 million compared with $52.7 million for the 2020 third quarter. This brought the bank's allowance for credit losses to 1.04%, and the coverage ratio stands at a healthy 423%. I would like to point out that if we took -- if we look at the ACL ratio, excluding very well-secured fund banking loans, the government-guaranteed PPP loans would be much higher at 1.41%. 
Turning to modifications. As of December 31, 2020, the bank has entered into COVID-19 principal and interest modifications of $1.3 billion or 2.7%. Of that balance, $107 million remain in short-term modifications. We fully anticipate that we will have increased nonaccrual loans and charge-offs in the coming quarters due to the effect of COVID. But given the level of our allowance for credit losses, where we prudently doubled the allowance, adding $258 million since the adoption of CECL, we believe we are adequately covered for what may come. 
Now on to the greatly expanding team front, where we had much success. In 2020, we added a total of 20 private client banking teams: 2 in New York, 5 in San Francisco and 13 in the Greater Los Angeles area, marking our entry into the Southern California marketplace. The bank now has a total of 116 private client banking teams, of which 23 are located on the West Coast. 
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Eric, and he will review the quarter's financial results in greater detail."
913010,701281811,2233105,"Signature Bank, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 21, 2021",2021-01-21,"Earnings Calls","Signature Bank","Executives","Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by reviewing net interest income and margin. Net interest income for the fourth quarter reached $395 million, an increase of $6.3 million from the 2020 third quarter. Net interest margin for the quart",578,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by reviewing net interest income and margin. Net interest income for the fourth quarter reached $395 million, an increase of $6.3 million from the 2020 third quarter. Net interest margin for the quarter declined 32 basis points to 2.23% compared with 2.55% for the 2020 third quarter. The entire decrease and then some was due to excess cash balances from significant deposit flows, which impacted margin by 46 basis points. 
Let's look at asset yields and funding costs for a moment. Interest-earning asset yields for the 2020 fourth quarter decreased 41 basis points from the linked quarter to 2.75%. The decrease in overall asset yields was again driven by the excess average cash balances, which grew from $5.6 billion to $12.5 billion during the quarter. Additionally, asset yields continue to be affected by lower reinvestment rates in all of our asset classes. Yields on the securities portfolio decreased 46 basis points linked quarter to 2.13% due to the decline in market rates as well as the bank investing in floating rate securities, and our portfolio duration remained low at 2.2 years. 
Turning to our loan portfolio. Yields on average commercial loans and commercial mortgages decreased 6 basis points to 3.6% compared with the 2020 third quarter. This was mostly due to lower origination yields. And excluding prepayment penalties from both quarters, yields decreased by 4 basis points. 
Now looking at liabilities. Our overall deposit cost this quarter decreased 9 basis points to 42 basis points due to the low interest rate environment. We anticipate this downward trend to continue in 2021. During the quarter, average borrowing balances decreased by $744 million to $3 billion. The overall cost of funds for the quarter decreased 9 basis points to 57 basis points driven by the reduction in deposit costs and decreased average borrowings, which was slightly offset by the addition of subordinated debt with a 4% coupon. 
On to noninterest income and expense. Noninterest income for the 2020 fourth quarter was $24.2 million, an increase of $8.2 million or 51% when compared with the 2019 fourth quarter. The increase is mostly due to a rise of $5.5 million in fees and service charges as well as an increase of $2.4 million in trading income. Noninterest expense for the 2020 fourth quarter was $157.7 million versus $138 million for the same period a year ago and $19.6 million or 14% increase was principally due to the addition of new private client banking teams. 
And despite our significant team hirings and margin compression from significant cash balances, the banks actually gained operating leverage. And as a result, our efficiency ratio improved to 37.6% for the 2020 fourth quarter versus 39% for the comparable period last year and 38.9% for the 2020 third quarter. 
And turning to capital. During the quarter, the bank successfully raised $730 million in noncumulative perpetual Series A preferred stock, which qualifies as Tier 1 capital. Additionally, the bank issued $375 million in subordinated debt, which qualifies as Tier 2 capital. All capital ratios remained well in excess of regulatory requirements and augment the relatively low-risk profile of the balance sheet as evidenced by a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 8.55% and a total risk-based ratio of 13.54% as of the 2020 fourth quarter. And finally, the bank paid a cash dividend of $0.56 per share of common stock. 
And now I'll turn the call back to Joe. Thank you."

I'd like to thank my colleagues, a number of who are listening on the call today, who have demonstrated their dedication to our clients and their needs during this pandemic. Times like these, our clients truly value the level of care and advice that my colleagues provide. And our performance for the year reflects their extraordinary efforts and the strength of our franchise as we continue to execute on many, many fronts. 
2020 was truly a remarkable year of growth and achievement for Signature Bank. On the deposit front, which is our key metric, we delivered unbelievable record deposit growth of $23 billion or 57%. And we reduced the cost of deposits from a high of 121 basis points in Q3 2019 to 42 basis points at year-end with room for further reductions. Demand deposits increased a record $5.7 million -- excuse me, $5.7 billion for the year and remain at a high 30% of total deposits. 
And most importantly, our deposit growth came across the board from our existing teams to all of our new businesses. There were literally 26 traditional banking teams in New York that grew over $100 million each. Our newly established teams on the West Coast grew over $1 billion. The specialized mortgage banking solutions team grew over $3.5 billion. The Venture Banking Group grew nearly $1 billion, and our digital banking team grew over $8 billion in deposits. We have clearly distinguished ourselves as the predominant bank in the digital space. 
Turning to loans. We had record core loan growth of nearly $8 billion, driven by another of our new businesses, the Fund Banking Division, which delivered nearly $7 billion in loan growth. Additionally, Signature Financial had another strong year and surpassed $5 billion in outstanding loans and ranks as the 15th largest bank lender in this space, a truly remarkable accomplishment for that team. Congratulations, guys. Furthermore, as planned, we held our commercial real estate loan balances flat over the last 2 years and made great strides in reducing our CRE concentration to 276% from 551% at year-end 2018. 
Looking at earnings. The bank's pretax pre-provision earnings grew by $136 million or 16% for the year, and we had a strong ROE of 10.75% despite a heavy amount of provisioning and margin compression due to excess cash balances. Fee income or noninterest income grew by 20% or $13.5 million for the year, and several of our fee income initiatives are just starting to take hold. Additionally, we improved our already best-in-class efficiency ratio during the year to 37.6%. 
On the capital front, we meaningfully improved our capital position by over $1 billion with the issuance of $375 million in subordinated debt and $730 million in preferred stock. Moreover, we maintained our dividend while turning off our buyback program to support the tremendous level of growth. And most importantly, we set the stage for future growth with the hiring of 20 private client banking teams and the opening of 5 new offices in the Los Angeles marketplace. 
Everything we said we would do this year, we did. Everything we said we would do this year, we did. Our growth for 2020 was equivalent to acquiring a top 50 bank, but we did it organically and without expending shareholder value. Signature Bank enters 2020 (sic, 2021) as a strong financial institution, and we very much look forward to years to come. 
Now we are happy to answer any questions you might have. Lori, I'll turn it back to you."

We do, as Joe pointed out, we hope to get the deposit cost down another 9 basis points or so, and we'll be in the mid- to low 30s come quarter end. 
Certainly, we have ability to deploy on the asset side. We can really put $1 billion to $2 billion per quarter to work in the securities portfolio and another $1 billion to $2 billion per quarter to work on the loan side. So we're going to have $2 billion to $4 billion in asset growth. I mean that's a little bit easier for us to predict. The hard part is the deposit flows. Thus far, this quarter, it slowed down a little bit, but we still have growth. We certainly don't anticipate $8 billion worth of deposit flows this coming quarter, but we expect it to continue to happen, which is great. 
So all that being said, the NII will be up, and that much we can predict. And it should be up pretty nicely. The NIM is impossible at this point to predict because of the nature of deposit flows, and it's hard to say. More are going to come in, and we'll be able to make a meaningful impact to all the cash that we're sitting on. But we should have some pretty substantial NII growth."

But when you combine the 2, 30 and then the DDA, you're coming down below 30. So I think everyone focuses on NIM, but the real place to focus is on the efficiency because we're a lot more efficient bringing these deposits in than a retail group. A retail group will have much lower deposit costs, but they will have high real estate costs, high marketing and high advertising costs, but we don't have that. So that bodes well for the efficiency ratio. 
But we have a lot of room. Like I said earlier, we brought the cost down to 37 basis points from 41 basis points in December to January now. So within 1 month, we're down 4 basis points, and we continue to drive it down further. We don't have that retail component.

When looking at earnings, we had another quarter of record net interest income driven by record deposit growth, strong loan growth and record securities purchases. Additionally, we had record fee income and contained expense growth, which culminated in record net income. Bottom line, we are delivering strong results for our shareholders even with significant excess liquidity. This liquidity bodes well for future earnings as the unlocking of excess cash, especially for higher-yielding loan growth has a far greater impact than any Fed or political action. 
In retrospect, it's really not that astonishing to see we deliver another quarter of record earnings and growth as we have done for the past 20 years. In fact, our 20-year anniversary is less than 2 weeks away on May 1. We've remained true to our founding principles of a team-based single point of contact model that caters to privately-owned businesses and their owners and managers. 
This focused model has allowed us to distinguish ourselves from the pack and deliver outstanding performance consistently throughout Signature Bank's existence. It's hard to believe that the bank started with nearly $50 million in assets and grew organically without ever making an acquisition to an $85 billion bank. 
Separately, I would be remiss not to mention how proud we are of the recently issued 2020 annual report, highlighting essential frontline health care workers that are closely associated with our colleagues. We wanted to showcase the unrelenting dedication and sacrifices of these frontline heroes, including our own and thank them for their service. 
Now let's take a look at earnings. Pretax pre-provision earnings for the 2021 first quarter were a record $272.8 million an increase of $54 million or 25% compared with $218.5 million for the 2020 first quarter. Net income for the 2021 first quarter was a record $191 million or $3.24 diluted earnings per share compared with $99.6 million or $1.88 diluted earnings per share reported in the same period last year. 
The increase in income was predominantly driven by substantial asset growth of $32.3 billion over the last 12 months as well as the decrease in the provision for credit losses, which was substantially impacted by COVID-19 in the first quarter of 2020. 
Looking at deposits. Deposits increased a record $10.7 billion or 17% to $74 billion this quarter while average deposits grew $6.8 billion. This quarter's growth which was across the board, was driven by the digital asset banking team, which grew deposits by $4.4 billion. 
The specialized mortgage banking solutions team, which grew to $2.3 billion. The fund banking team, which was up nearly $700 million, our Venture Banking Group, which increased over $300 million and 9 private client banking teams across the spectrum of Metro New York which grew over $100 million each, including 5 of the teams that exceeded $200 million. 
Since the end of the 2020 first quarter deposits increased a remarkable $31.7 billion or 75% and average deposits increased nearly $28 billion. Noninterest-bearing deposits increased $3.8 billion to $22.5 billion which represent a high of 30.5% of total deposits. 
Our deposit growth plus capital raises as well as earnings retention led to an increase of $32.3 billion or 61% in total assets since the first quarter of last year. 
Now let's take a look at our lending businesses. Core loans or loans excluding PPP during the 2021 first quarter increased $1.3 billion or 2.8% to $48 billion. For the prior 12 months, core loans grew $7.3 billion or 17.8%. The increase in loans this quarter was again driven primarily by new fund banking capital call facilities. This is the tenth quarter or tenth consecutive quarter where C&I outpaced CRE growth furthering the rapid transformation of the balance sheet to include more floating rate assets as we continue to diversify our portfolio. 
We are well positioned in all our lending businesses to capitalize on opportunities based on our pipeline and a recovering economy. Turning to credit quality. Our portfolio continues to perform well. Nonaccrual loans were $134 million or 26 basis points of total loans compared with $120 million or 25 basis points for the 20,204th quarter. 
Our past due loans returned to the pre-COVID-19 levels with 30 to 89 past due loans decreasing to $39 million, and our 90-day-plus past due loans remained very low at $4.9 million. Net charge-offs for the 2021 first quarter was $17.9 million or 15 basis points of average loans compared with $11.4 million in the 2020 fourt quarter. The provision for credit losses for the 2021 first quarter was $30.9 million compared with $35.6 million in the 2020 fourth quarter. This brought the bank's allowance for credit losses to 1.02%. And the coverage ratio stands at a healthy 390%. 
I would like to point out that excluding well, very well secured fund banking loans and government-guaranteed PPP loans, the allowance of credit loss ratio would be much higher at 1.43%. 
Turning to modifications. As of April 15, the bank's COVID-19 related nonpayment modifications reduced by $329 million to $983 million or 1.9% of loans when compared with the balance at the end of the 2020 fourth quarter. 
Now onto the expanding team front where we continue to have success. In the 2021 first quarter, the bank onboarded 3 private client banking teams, including 2 in the West Coast. Additionally, the bank added 4 private client banking group directors to existing California teams and Signet financial and 7 executive sales offices throughout its national footprint. 
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Eric, and he will review the quarter's financial results in greater detail."
913010,711402625,2254479,"Signature Bank, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2021",2021-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Signature Bank","Executives","Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by reviewing net interest income and margin. Net interest income for the first quarter reached $407 million, an increase of $11.5 million from the 2020 fourth quarter. Net interest margin declined 1",607,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by reviewing net interest income and margin. Net interest income for the first quarter reached $407 million, an increase of $11.5 million from the 2020 fourth quarter. 
Net interest margin declined 13 basis points to 2.1% and compared with 2.23% for the 2020 fourth quarter. The entire decrease and then some was due to massive excess cash balances from significant deposit flows which impacted margin by 58 basis points. 
Now let's look at asset yields and funding costs for a moment. Interest-earning asset yields for the 2021 first quarter decreased 21 basis points from the linked quarter to 2.4%. The decrease in overall asset yields was again driven by the massive excess average cash balances, which grew from $12.5 billion to $17.1 billion during the quarter. 
Additionally, asset yields continue to be affected by lower reinvestment rates in all of our asset classes. Yields on the securities portfolio decreased 25 basis points linked quarter to 1.88% due to lower reinvestment rates as well as the bank investing in floating rate securities and our portfolio duration increased to 3.25 years, which was due to a steeper yield curve. 
Given the better rate environment, we aggressively grew the securities portfolio by a record $2.1 billion, and we anticipate similar growth in future quarters. 
Turning to our loan portfolio. Yields on average commercial loans and commercial mortgages decreased 6 basis points to 3.54% compared with the 2020 fourth quarter. This was mostly due to lower origination yields. Excluding prepayment penalties from both quarters, yields decreased by 9 basis points. 
And now looking at liabilities. Our overall deposit cost this quarter decreased 8 basis points to 34 basis points due to the low interest rate environment as we gradually lower our relationship-based deposit rates. We anticipate this downward trend to continue in the coming quarters. 
During the quarter, average borrowing balances decreased by $7 million and the cost of borrowings increased by 1 basis point to 2.41%. The overall cost of funds for the quarter decreased 10 basis points to 47 basis points, driven by the reduction in deposit costs. 
And now on to noninterest income and expense. We continue to emphasize fee income and noninterest income for the 2021 first quarter was $32.7 million, an increase of $18.5 million or 131% when compared with the 2020 first quarter. The increase is mostly due to a rise in fees and service charges, net gains on sales of loans and trading income. 
Noninterest expense for the 2021 first quarter was $166.4 million versus $144 million for the same period a year ago to $22.4 million or 15.6% increase was principally due to the addition of new private client banking teams and operational support to meet the bank's growing needs. 
Despite our significant team hirings and margin compression from substantial cash balances, the bank continues to gain operating leverage. And as a result, our efficiency ratio improved to 37.9% for the 2021 first quarter versus 39.7% for the comparable period last year. 
And turning to capital. During the quarter, the bank successfully issued $708 million of common stock. All capital ratios remain well in excess of regulatory requirements and augment the relatively low-risk profile of the balance sheet, as evidenced by a common equity Tier 1 risk-based ratio of 10.92% and total risk-based ratio of 14.41% as of the 2021 first quarter. 
Given our robust total risk-based ratio, we redeemed $260 million of subordinated debt at a rate of 5.3% on April 19, which will further reduce our interest expense in coming quarters. 
And now I'll turn the call back to Joe. Thank you."

And our performance once again this quarter reflects their extraordinary efforts as we continue to execute on many fronts. 
We look forward to a healthier 2021 as recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic continues. The collective strength of our franchise led to an unbelievable quarter of record deposit growth, record pretax pre-provision earnings and record net income. Bottom line, we delivered another strong quarter and we are well positioned for the future. 
Now we are happy to answer any questions you might have. Erica will turn it over to you."

And then maybe provide some details on the new upcoming 2 asset-generating verticals that we've discussed, but haven't quite gotten a lot of detail on yet."
913010,711402625,2254479,"Signature Bank, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2021",2021-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Signature Bank","Executives","Well, sure.

We expect that we'll see loan growth per quarter in the $1 billion to $2 billion range. So we should see anywhere from $4 billion to $8 billion in loan growth coupled with roughly $1 billion to $2 billion in securities purchases, hopefully closer to the $2 billion in both cases, right? 
So we should have asset growth anywhere. We're giving pretty broad ranges because it can be choppy in both deposit -- in both loans and securities, but anywhere from $8 billion to $16 billion for the year. So we certainly have ample places to put the deposit growth and the cash to use. 
On the new business line front, there are -- the 2 new businesses that we've been talking to about for a little while. The gentleman leading those efforts are both here. The first is the mortgage warehouse lending team, which is being led by Ken Logan. 
Ken has been a 35-year industry veteran. He founded and led the mortgage banking finance group at Wells Fargo. He actually started at Wachovia from scratch. And when they were acquired by Wells, he continued the efforts there. So a substantial track record in the space, has built that business at a few different institutions from scratch, extremely well known, and we're very excited to be answering it. 
Clearly, it's a very logical fit with the mortgage -- specialized mortgage banking team that we brought on board that really is the deposit-generating side. So now we've got the lending side. And I'd say that our clients are very pleased with on both fronts and then not win this business. 
And that, from a growth perspective, can be a little choppy again, but we're looking at $200 million to $1 billion in growth per quarter. So we should see at least $1 billion in growth for the year, if not closer to $4 billion in growth from that space. So very excited to have him on board. 
We don't really anticipate anything meaningful on the growth front until the third quarter and fourth quarters, we could see some participations in the second quarter. 
The second business line that we've onboarded is the SBA origination business. As many of you know, we're 1 of the largest buyers of SBA loans in the market. We have a very large business out of our Houston office where we buy the loans, pool them, securitize them and sell them to accredited investors. 
Now we're getting into the origination business. We've done so once again with a 30-plus-year industry veteran George Glyn, what comes out of Bank of the West, and we'll really be focused on the California marketplace. So this business was very strategically important to us and to our growth initiatives on the West Coast. 
The cost of real estate often makes it prohibitive for businesses to buy their real estate so they really need that government helping there. And we're very happy to be involved in that space. On the growth side, it's a little lower growth. We're talking anywhere from $200 million to $500 million per quarter. And we don't really anticipate seeing that growth until the third -- I'm sorry, $200 million to $500 million per year, not per quarter per year, and we don't see that growth coming until the latter half of this year. 
So in both cases, once again is a continuation of the Signature Bank model, where we've hired very well seasoned knowledgeable banking veterans had the efforts in both of these spaces. So we're very excited to have both the teams on board."

Now within digital, we're in all different areas of digital. We do stable coin reserves, we're dealing with the OTC desks. The clients' digital asset exchanges, blockchain technology, digital miners and that we have those that use Signet and then we have some of the traditional. 
So within digital, we have a mix shift. And outside of digital, we have a mix shift because of all the businesses. So we feel that a fairly sticky deposits.

And that team has been around for over 8 years, and they have a knowledge base and they're key into getting the actual operating accounts. So we feel the stickiness is there. We've been asked what about the competition, like the big banks, the cases and the Cities, if they get into digital in a big way. Well, we've been competing with them for 20 years. 
So we're not worried about the big players nor are we worried about the stickiness of the deposit. Having said that, we do keep a decent amount of liquidity.

I will provide some overview into the quarterly and annual results, and then Eric Howell, our Senior Executive Vice President of Corporate and Business Development, will review the bank's financial performance in greater detail. Eric and",1042,"Thank you, Susan. I will provide some overview into the quarterly and annual results, and then Eric Howell, our Senior Executive Vice President of Corporate and Business Development, will review the bank's financial performance in greater detail. Eric and I will address your questions at the end of our remarks.
We started 2021 in an astonishing manner with another quarter of record deposit growth of $10.7 billion, emanating from our core client relationships coming off the heels of 2020 where we grew record deposits by nearly $23 billion. It's clear that the bank is firing on all cylinders, including our newer business lines, where, again, many contributed to this quarter's phenomenal growth.
When looking at earnings, we had another quarter of record net interest income driven by record deposit growth, strong loan growth and record securities purchases. Additionally, we had record fee income and contained expense growth, which culminated in record net income. Bottom line, we are delivering strong results for our shareholders even with significant excess liquidity. This liquidity bodes well for future earnings as the unlocking of excess cash, especially for higher-yielding loan growth, has a far greater impact than any Fed or political action.
In retrospect, it's really not that astonishing to see we delivered another quarter of record earnings and growth as we have done for the past 20 years. In fact, our 20-year anniversary is less than 2 weeks away on May 1. We've remained true to our founding principles of a team-based, single point-of-contact model that caters to privately-owned businesses and their owners and managers. This focused model has allowed us to distinguish ourselves from the pack and delivered outstanding performance consistently throughout Signature Bank's existence. It's hard to believe that the bank started with nearly $50 million in assets and grew organically without ever making an acquisition to an $85 billion bank.
Separately, I would be remiss not to mention how proud we are of the recently issued 2020 annual report, highlighting essential frontline health care workers that are closely associated with our colleagues. We wanted to showcase the unrelenting dedication and sacrifices of these frontline heroes, including our own and thank them for their service.
Now let's take a look at earnings. Pretax pre-provision earnings for the 2021 first quarter were a record $272.8 million, an increase of $54 million or 25% compared with $218.5 million for the 2020 first quarter. Net income for the 2021 first quarter was a record $191 million or $3.24 diluted earnings per share compared with $99.6 million or $1.88 diluted earnings per share reported in the same period last year. The increase in income was predominantly driven by substantial asset growth of $32.3 billion over the last 12 months as well as the decrease in the provision for credit losses, which was substantially impacted by COVID-19 in the first quarter of 2020.
Looking at deposits. Deposits increased a record $10.7 billion or 17% to $74 billion this quarter, while average deposits grew $6.8 billion. This quarter's growth, which was across the board, was driven by the digital asset banking team, which grew deposits by $4.4 billion.
The specialized mortgage banking solutions team, which grew to $2.3 billion. The fund banking team, which was up nearly $700 million. Our Venture Banking Group, which increased over $300 million and 9 private client banking teams across the spectrum in Metro New York, which grew over $100 million each, including 5 of the teams that exceeded $200 million.
Since the end of the 2020 first quarter, deposits increased a remarkable $31.7 billion or 75% and average deposits increased nearly $28 billion. Noninterest-bearing deposits increased $3.8 billion to $22.5 billion, which represent a high of 30.5% of total deposits. Our deposit growth plus capital raises as well as earnings retention led to an increase of $32.3 billion or 61% in total assets since the first quarter of last year.
Now let's take a look at our lending businesses. Core loans or loans excluding PPP during the 2021 first quarter increased $1.3 billion or 2.8% to $48 billion. For the prior 12 months, core loans grew $7.3 billion or 17.8%. The increase in loans this quarter was again driven primarily by new fund banking capital call facilities. This is the tenth quarter or tenth consecutive quarter where C&I outpaced CRE growth, furthering the rapid transformation of the balance sheet to include more floating rate assets as we continue to diversify our portfolio. We're well positioned in all our lending businesses to capitalize on opportunities based on our pipeline and a recovering economy.
Turning to credit quality. Our portfolio continues to perform well. Nonaccrual loans were $134 million or 26 basis points of total loans compared with $120 million or 25 basis points for the 2020 fourth quarter. Our past due loans returned to the pre-COVID-19 levels with 30 to 89 past due loans decreasing to $39 million, and our 90-day-plus past due loans remained very low at $4.9 million.
Net charge-offs for the 2021 first quarter was $17.9 million or 15 basis points of average loans compared with $11.4 million for the 2020 fourth quarter. Provision for credit losses for the 2021 first quarter was $30.9 million compared with $35.6 million for the 2020 fourth quarter. This brought the bank's allowance for credit losses to 1.02%, and the coverage ratio stands at a healthy 390%. I would like to point out that excluding well -- very well-secured fund banking loans and government-guaranteed PPP loans, the allowance of credit loss ratio would be much higher at 1.43%.
Turning to modifications. As of April 15, the bank's COVID-19 related nonpayment modifications reduced by $329 million to $983 million or 1.9% of loans when compared with the balance at the end of 2020 fourth quarter.
Now on the expanding -- onto the expanding team front where we continue to have success. In the 2021 first quarter, the bank onboarded 3 private client banking teams, including 2 in the West Coast. Additionally, the bank added 4 private client banking group directors to existing California teams in Signet financial and 7 executive sales offices throughout its national footprint.
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Eric, and he will review the quarter's financial results in greater detail."
913010,711402625,2254599,"Signature Bank, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 21, 2021",2021-04-21,"Earnings Calls","Signature Bank","Executives","Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by reviewing net interest income and margin. Net interest income for the first quarter reached $407 million, an increase of $11.5 million from the 2020 fourth quarter.Net interest margin declined 13",607,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by reviewing net interest income and margin. Net interest income for the first quarter reached $407 million, an increase of $11.5 million from the 2020 fourth quarter.
Net interest margin declined 13 basis points to 2.1% compared with 2.23% for the 2020 fourth quarter. The entire decrease and then some was due to massive excess cash balances from significant deposit flows, which impacted margin by 58 basis points.
Now let's look at asset yields and funding costs for a moment. Interest-earning asset yields for the 2021 first quarter decreased 21 basis points from the linked quarter to 2.54%. The decrease in overall asset yields was again driven by the massive excess average cash balances, which grew from $12.5 billion to $17.1 billion during the quarter. Additionally, asset yields continue to be affected by lower reinvestment rates in all of our asset classes.
Yields on the securities portfolio decreased 25 basis points linked quarter to 1.88% due to lower reinvestment rates as well as the bank investing in floating rate securities, and our portfolio duration increased to 3.25 years, which was due to a steeper yield curve. Given the better rate environment, we aggressively grew the securities portfolio by a record $2.1 billion, and we anticipate similar growth in future quarters.
Turning to our loan portfolio. Yields on average commercial loans and commercial mortgages decreased 6 basis points to 3.54% compared with the 2020 fourth quarter. This was mostly due to lower origination yields. Excluding prepayment penalties from both quarters, yields decreased by 9 basis points.
And now looking at liabilities. Our overall deposit cost this quarter decreased 8 basis points to 34 basis points due to the low interest rate environment as we gradually lower our relationship-based deposit rates. We anticipate this downward trend to continue in the coming quarters.
During the quarter, our average borrowing balances decreased by $7 million and the cost of borrowings increased by 1 basis point to 2.41%. The overall cost of funds for the quarter decreased 10 basis points to 47 basis points driven by the reduction in deposit costs.
And now on to noninterest income and expense. We continue to emphasize fee income and noninterest income for the 2021 first quarter was $32.7 million, an increase of $18.5 million or 131% when compared with the 2020 first quarter. The increase is mostly due to a rise in fees and service charges, net gains on sales of loans and trading income.
Noninterest expense for the 2021 first quarter was $166.4 million versus $144 million for the same period a year ago to $22.4 million or 15.6% increase was principally due to the addition of new private client banking teams and operational support to meet the bank's growing needs.
Despite our significant team hirings and margin compression from substantial cash balances, the bank continues to gain operating leverage. And as a result, our efficiency ratio improved to 37.9% for the 2021 first quarter versus 39.7% for the comparable period last year.
And turning to capital. During the quarter, the bank successfully issued $708 million of common stock. All capital ratios remained well in excess of regulatory requirements and augment the relatively low-risk profile of the balance sheet, as evidenced by a common equity Tier 1 risk-based ratio of 10.92% and total risk-based ratio of 14.41% as of the 2021 first quarter. Given our robust total risk-based ratio, we redeemed $260 million of subordinated debt at a rate of 5.3% on April 19, which will further reduce our interest expense in coming quarters.
And now I'll turn the call back to Joe. Thank you."

We look forward to a healthier 2021 as recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic continues. The collective strength of our franchise led to an unbelievable quarter of record deposit growth, record pretax pre-provision earnings and record net income. Bottom line, we delivered another strong quarter and we are well positioned for the future.

We expect that we'll see loan growth per quarter in the $1 billion to $2 billion range. So we should see anywhere from $4 billion to $8 billion in loan growth coupled with roughly $1 billion to $2 billion in securities purchases, hopeful",605,"Well, sure, Matt. We expect that we'll see loan growth per quarter in the $1 billion to $2 billion range. So we should see anywhere from $4 billion to $8 billion in loan growth coupled with roughly $1 billion to $2 billion in securities purchases, hopefully closer to the $2 billion in both cases, right?
So we should have asset growth anywhere. We're giving pretty broad ranges because it can be choppy in both deposit -- in both loans and securities, but anywhere from $8 billion to $16 billion for the year. So we certainly have ample places to put the deposit growth and the cash to use.
On the new business line front, there are -- the 2 new businesses that we've been talking to about for a little while, the gentleman leading those efforts are both here. The first is the mortgage warehouse lending team, which is being led by Ken Logan. Ken has been a 35-year industry veteran. He founded and led the mortgage banking finance group at Wells Fargo. He actually started at Wachovia from scratch. And when they were acquired by Wells, he continued the efforts there. So a substantial track record in the space, has built that business at a few different institutions from scratch, extremely well known and we're very excited to be answering it.
Clearly, it's a very logical fit with the mortgage -- specialized mortgage banking team that we brought on board that really is the deposit-generating side. So now we've got the lending side. And I'd say that our clients are very pleased with -- on both fronts and they're not [ leaving ] this business.
And that, from a growth perspective, can be a little choppy again, but we're looking at $200 million to $1 billion in growth per quarter. So we should see at least $1 billion in growth for the year, if not closer to $4 billion in growth from that space. So very excited to have him on board.
We don't really anticipate anything meaningful on the growth front until the third quarter and fourth quarters. We could see some participations in the second quarter.
The second business line that we've onboarded is the SBA origination business. As many of you know, we're one of the largest buyers of SBA loans in the market. We have a very large business out of our Houston office where we buy the loans, pool them, securitize them and sell them to accredited investors.
Now we're getting into the origination business. We've done so once again with a 30-plus-year industry veteran George Glines, who comes out of Bank of the West, and we'll really be focused on the California marketplace. So this business was very strategically important to us and to our growth initiatives on the West Coast.
The cost of real estate often makes it prohibitive for businesses to buy their real estate so they really need that government helping there. And we're very happy to be involved in that space.
On the growth side, it's a little lower growth. We're talking anywhere from $200 million to $500 million per quarter. And we don't really anticipate seeing that growth until the third -- I'm sorry, $200 million to $500 million per year, not per quarter per year, and we don't see that growth coming until the latter half of this year.
So in both cases, once again is a continuation of the Signature Bank model, where we've hired very well seasoned knowledgeable banking veterans to spearhead the efforts in both of these spaces. So we're very excited to have both the teams on board."

So within digital, we have a mix shift. And outside of digital, we have a mix shift because of all the businesses. So we feel that a fairly sticky deposits.

So we feel the stickiness is there. We've been asked what about the competition, like the big banks, the cases and the cities, if they get into digital in a big way. Well, we've been competing with them for 20 years.
So we're not worried about the big players nor are we worried about the stickiness of the deposit. Having said that, we do keep a decent amount of liquidity.

We're not the only ones in this position and people are fighting for the securities. So really that's the other side of the equation. We have a lot of cash flow coming back at us on that portfolio and just trying to reinvest and find a good paper to put it into is harder and harder these days.

We've grown cash, we've grown securities and we've grown well-secured fund banking loans. So we've really put on little to no risk. So we're not focused on the TCE for sure, but it's more the CET1, the Tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios. That's our focus.
And we're well above our peers now in those levels as well as the level that we need to be well capitalized. So right now, we feel comfortable where -- with where our capital ratios are today.

The success of Signature Bank's single point-of-contact service model has resulted in yet another quarter of significant growth. During the past several years, the bank has grown dramatically and transformed organically. We set and achieved specific goals of becoming asset sensitive, increasing both credit and geographic diversification, while continuing to grow core deposits. As a result, we shifted to asset sensitivity -- sensitive from liability sensitive, with 38% of our loan portfolio now variable rate. 
We reduced our CRE concentration from nearly 600% to 345% of capital. Our loan-to-deposit ratio, which peaked at 104%, has moved to a low 64%. Additionally, we entered new markets through the hiring of veteran bankers from -- for our West Coast private client banking offices while continuing to increase deposits across our New York operations. The speed at which we achieve these objectives organically is extraordinary within the banking industry. It clearly demonstrates the power of our founding, single point-of-contact entrepreneurial model. 
Throughout the second quarter of 2021, we saw the same strong growth trends we witnessed during the past several quarters. Our record deposit growth of $11.6 billion emanates from all our business units and teams within the institution, demonstrating the broad-based strength of our franchise. 
Record core loan growth of $3.6 billion was driven by a well-established fund banking division, and we put more cash to use than ever before to a record growth of $2.7 billion in our securities portfolio. Our strong growth profile, coupled with the expansion of fee income and contained expenses, led to a third consecutive quarter of record net income and strong return on common equity of more than 13%. We continue to focus on the pure organic growth that has made this institution successful. 
Now let's take a look at earnings. Pretax pre-provision earnings for the 2021 second quarter were a record $308.6 million, an increase of $60.6 million or 24.5% compared with $247.9 million for the 2020 second quarter. Net income for the 2021 second quarter was a record $214.5 million or $3.57 diluted earnings per share compared with $11. -- with $117.2 million or $2.21 diluted earnings per share reported in the same period last year. 
The increase in income was predominantly driven by substantial asset growth of $36.5 billion over the last 12 months as well as the decrease in the provision for credit losses, which was substantially impacted by COVID-19 in the second quarter of 2020. 
Looking at deposits. Deposits increased a record $11.6 billion or 15.7% and $85.6 billion this quarter. Our average deposits grew a record $11.9 billion. This quarter's growth was driven by the digital asset banking team, which grew deposits $6.3 billion. The specialized mortgage banking solutions team, which grew by $1.2 billion. Our Venture Banking Group, which increased nearly $400 million. The West Coast banking teams grew nearly $200 million. And our New York banking team, which grew over $3.6 billion, including 10 teams that each exceeded $100 million for the quarter. 
Since the end of the 2020 second quarter, deposits increased a remarkable $35.3 billion or 70.3% and average deposits increased $33.4 billion. During the quarter, noninterest deposits increased $6.1 billion to $28.7 billion, which represents a high 33.5% of total deposits. Our deposit growth, plus capital raises as well as earnings retention, led to an increase of $36.5 billion or 60.5% in total assets since the second quarter of last year. That's the equivalent of acquiring the top 50 U.S. Bank, but we did it completely organically. We believe this is by far the most efficient use of capital. 
Now let's take a look at our lending businesses. Core loans, or loans excluding PPP during the 2021 second quarter, increased a record $3.9 billion by 8% to $52 billion. For the prior 12 months, core loans grew $9 billion or 20.7%. The increase in loans this quarter was again driven primarily by new -- and it's a key word, new fund banking capital call facilities. We are well positioned in all our lending businesses to capitalize on opportunities based upon our pipeline and a recovering economy. 
Turning to credit quality. Our portfolio continues to perform well. Let me first point out the bank's COVID-19-related nonpayment modifications continue to trend positively. As of the year-end 2020, they were $1.3 billion. At April 15, they were $983 million. And at July 15, they are now at $309 million or 0.6% of total loans. So that went from year-end at $1.3 billion to slightly above $0.3 billion, and we knocked off $1 billion in nonpayment modifications. 
Nonaccrual loans were $136.1 million or 25 basis points of total loans compared with $133.7 million or 26 basis points in 2021 first quarter. Our loans remained within the normal range to 30 to 89 pass-through loans at $94.8 million and our 90-day plus past due loans remained at a very, very low $2.3 million. Net charge-offs in 2021 second quarter decreased to $15.3 million or 12 basis points of average loans compared with $17.9 million 2021 first quarter. 
The provision for credit losses for the 2021 second quarter declined to $8.3 million compared with $30.9 million for the 2021 first quarter. This supports the bank's allowance for credit loss to 0.94%, and the coverage ratio stands at a healthy 378%. I would like to point out that excluding very well-secured fund banking loans and government-guaranteed PPP loans, the allowance for credit losses ratio would be much higher at 1.41%. 
Now on to the expanding team front where we continue to realize success. In the 2021 second quarter, the bank onboarded 2 private client banking teams on the West Coast as well as the SBA lending team, which is 1 of our 2 new lending initiatives we announced earlier in the quarter. 
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Eric, and he will review the quarter's financial results in greater detail."
913010,1673899915,2348076,"Signature Bank, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2021",2021-07-20,"Earnings Calls","Signature Bank","Executives","Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by reviewing net interest income and margin. With our emphasis on growing net interest income for the second quarter reached $457.2 million, an increase of $50.7 million or 12.5% from the 2021 first",599,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by reviewing net interest income and margin. 
With our emphasis on growing net interest income for the second quarter reached $457.2 million, an increase of $50.7 million or 12.5% from the 2021 first quarter. That is an annualized growth rate of 50%.
Net interest margin declined 8 basis points to 2.02% compared with 2.1% for the 2021 first quarter. The entire decrease was due to massive excess cash balances from significant deposit flows, which impacted margin by 55 basis points. Again, we are focused on net interest income growth and not the margin. 
Let's look at asset yields and funding costs for a moment. Interest-earning asset yields for the 2021 second quarter decreased 17 basis points from the linked quarter to 2.37%. The decrease in overall asset yields was again driven by the massive excess average cash balances, which grew $6.6 billion to $23.7 billion during the quarter. 
Yields on the securities portfolio decreased 16 basis points linked quarter of 1.72% due to lower reinvestment rates as well as the bank investing in floating rate securities. And our portfolio duration decreased to 2.2 years, which was due to a decline in rates at the end of the quarter. We were opportunistic throughout the quarter as we saw windows in which to invest, and therefore, we were able to increase the securities portfolio by $2.7 billion. 
And turning to our loan portfolio. Yields on average commercial loans and commercial mix increased 4 basis points to 3.58% compared with the 2021 first quarter. Excluding prepayment penalties from both quarters, yields increased by 5 basis points. 
Now looking at liabilities. Our overall deposit cost this quarter decreased 7 basis points to 27 basis points due to the low interest rate environment as we gradually lower our relationship-based deposit rates. We anticipate this downward trend to continue in the coming quarters, albeit at a slower pace. 
During the quarter, average borrowing balances decreased by $276.4 million, and the cost of borrowings decreased by 12 basis points to 2.8%. The overall cost of funds for the quarter decreased 9 basis points to 38 basis points, driven by the reduction in deposit costs. 
And on to noninterest income and expense. With our focus on growing noninterest income, we achieved growth of $10.7 million or 84.5% to $23.4 million when compared with the 2020 second quarter. The increase was mostly due to a rise in fees and service charges and net gains on sales of loans. 
Noninterest expense for the 2021 second quarter was $172 million versus $151.9 million for the same period a year ago. The $20.1 million or 13.3% increase was principally due to the addition of new private client banking teams and operational support to meet the bank's growing needs. And despite our significant team hiring and margin compression from substantial cash balances, the bank continues to gain operating leverage. And as a result, the efficiency ratio improved to 35.8% for the 2021 second quarter versus 38% for the comparable period last year. 
And now turning to capital. All capital ratios remain well in excess of regulatory requirements and augment the relatively low-risk profile of the balance sheet as evidenced by a common equity Tier 1 risk-based ratio of 10.03% and total risk-based ratio of 12.72% as of the 2021 second quarter. Given our robust total risk-based ratio, we redeemed $260 million of subordinated debt at a rate of 5.3% on April 19, which will further reduce our interest expense in coming quarters. 
And now I'll turn the call back to Joe. Thank you."

We've seen that the third quarter is usually our slowest quarter of loan growth. And given that people were not able to really take vacations last year due to the pandemic, we expect that there's a lot of people that will be out in the months of July and August, and we'll see that affect our loan growth a bit. So we're holding to the $1 billion to $2 billion for the third quarter. 
For the fourth quarter, we're hoping to get the high end of that range. We do anticipate that the mortgage warehouse business will kick in a little bit. There's hope for the third quarter that we can do $200 million to $250 million in that mortgage warehouse space, and I think that's certainly possible. And then we can do an equal to potentially even greater amount in the fourth quarter. So that will be beneficial to the growth for sure. 
On the SBA side, we anticipate that bill start up mostly in the fourth quarter. We're still putting our systems and processes in place. It's very important in that space to really have your systems, your paperwork and everything in line with the government to ensure that you have that government guarantee on your loans.

The success of Signature Bank's single point-of-contact service model has resulted in yet another quarter of significant growth. During the past several years, the bank has grown dramatically and transformed organically. We set and achieved specific goals of becoming asset sensitive, increasing both credit and geographic diversification, while continuing to grow core deposits. As a result, we shifted to asset sensitivity -- sensitive from liability sensitive, with 38% of our loan portfolio now variable rate.  
We reduced our CRE concentration from nearly 600% to 345% of capital. Our loan-to-deposit ratio, which peaked at 104%, has moved to a low 64%. Additionally, we entered new markets through the hiring of veteran bankers from -- for our West Coast private client banking offices while continuing to increase deposits across our New York operations. The speed at which we achieve these objectives organically is extraordinary within the banking industry. It clearly demonstrates the power of our founding single point-of-contact entrepreneurial model.  
Throughout the second quarter of 2021, we saw the same strong growth trends we witnessed during the past several quarters. Our record deposit growth of $11.6 billion emanates from all our business units and teams within the institution, demonstrating the broad-based strength of our franchise.  
Record core loan growth of $3.6 billion was driven by a well-established Fund Banking Division, and we put more cash to use than ever before to a record growth of $2.7 billion in our securities portfolio. Our strong growth profile, coupled with the expansion of fee income and contained expenses, led to a third consecutive quarter of record net income and strong return on common equity of more than 13%. We continue to focus on the pure organic growth that has made this institution successful.  
Now let's take a look at earnings. Pretax pre-provision earnings for the 2021 second quarter were a record $308.6 million, an increase of $60.6 million or 24.5% compared with $247.9 million for the 2020 second quarter. Net income for the 2021 second quarter was a record $214.5 million or $3.57 diluted earnings per share compared with $11. -- with $117.2 million or $2.21 diluted earnings per share reported in the same period last year.  
The increase in income was predominantly driven by substantial asset growth of $36.5 billion over the last 12 months as well as the decrease in the provision for credit losses, which was substantially impacted by COVID-19 in the second quarter of 2020. Looking at deposits. 
Deposits increased a record $11.6 billion or 15.7% and $85.6 billion this quarter. Our average deposits grew a record $11.9 billion. This quarter's growth was driven by the digital asset banking team, which grew deposits $6.3 billion. The specialized mortgage banking solutions team, which grew by $1.2 billion. Our Venture Banking Group, which increased nearly $400 million. The West Coast banking teams grew nearly $200 million. And our New York banking team, which grew over $3.6 billion, including 10 teams that each exceeded $100 million for the quarter.  
Since the end of the 2020 second quarter, deposits increased a remarkable $35.3 billion or 70.3% and average deposits increased $33.4 billion. During the quarter, noninterest deposits increased $6.1 billion to $28.7 billion, which represents a high 33.5% of total deposits. Our deposit growth, plus capital raises as well as earnings retention, led to an increase of $36.5 billion or 60.5% in total assets since the second quarter of last year. That's the equivalent of acquiring the top 50 U.S. Bank, but we did it completely organically. We believe this is by far the most efficient use of capital.  
Now let's take a look at our lending businesses. Core loans, or loans excluding PPP during the 2021 second quarter, increased a record $3.9 billion by 8% to $52 billion. For the prior 12 months, core loans grew $9 billion or 20.7%. The increase in loans this quarter was again driven primarily by new and it's a key word, new fund banking capital call facilities. We are well positioned in all our lending businesses to capitalize on opportunities based upon our pipeline and a recovering economy.  
Turning to credit quality. Our portfolio continues to perform well. Let me first point out the bank's COVID-19-related nonpayment modifications continue to trend positively. As of the year-end 2020, they were $1.3 billion. At April 15, they were $983 million. And as of July 15, they are now at $309 million or 0.6% of total loans. So that went from year-end at $1.3 billion to slightly above $0.3 billion, and we knocked off $1 billion in nonpayment modifications.  
Nonaccrual loans were $136.1 million or 25 basis points of total loans compared with $133.7 million or 26 basis points in 2021 first quarter. Our past due loans remained within the normal range to 30 to 89 pass due loans at $94.8 million and our 90-day plus past due loans remained at a very, very low $2.3 million. Net charge-offs in 2021 second quarter decreased to $15.3 million or 12 basis points of average loans compared with $17.9 million 2021 first quarter.  
The provision for credit losses for the 2021 second quarter declined to $8.3 million compared with $30.9 million for the 2021 first quarter. This supports the bank's allowance for credit loss to 0.94%, and the coverage ratio stands at a healthy 378%. I would like to point out that excluding very well-secured fund banking loans and government-guaranteed PPP loans, the allowance for credit losses ratio would be much higher at 1.41%.  
Now on to the expanding team front where we continue to realize success. In the 2021 second quarter, the bank onboarded 2 private client banking teams on the West Coast as well as the SBA lending team, which is 1 of our 2 new lending initiatives we announced earlier in the quarter.  
At this point, I'll turn the call over to Eric, and he will review the quarter's financial results in greater detail."
913010,1673899915,2348124,"Signature Bank, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 20, 2021",2021-07-20,"Earnings Calls","Signature Bank","Executives","Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by reviewing net interest income and margin.  With our emphasis on growing net interest income for the second quarter reached $457.2 million, an increase of $50.7 million or 12.5% from the 2021 firs",599,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by reviewing net interest income and margin.  
With our emphasis on growing net interest income for the second quarter reached $457.2 million, an increase of $50.7 million or 12.5% from the 2021 first quarter. That is an annualized growth rate of 50%. 
Net interest margin declined 8 basis points to 2.02% compared with 2.1% for the 2021 first quarter. The entire decrease was due to massive excess cash balances from significant deposit flows, which impacted margin by 55 basis points. Again, we are focused on net interest income growth and not the margin.  
Let's look at asset yields and funding costs for a moment. Interest-earning asset yields for the 2021 second quarter decreased 17 basis points from the linked quarter to 2.37%. The decrease in overall asset yields was again driven by the massive excess average cash balances, which grew $6.6 billion to $23.7 billion during the quarter.  
Yields on the securities portfolio decreased 16 basis points linked quarter of 1.72% due to lower reinvestment rates as well as the bank investing in floating rate securities. And our portfolio duration decreased to 2.92 years, which was due to a decline in rates at the end of the quarter. We were opportunistic throughout the quarter as we saw windows in which to invest, and therefore, we were able to increase the securities portfolio by $2.7 billion.  
And turning to our loan portfolio. Yields on average commercial loans and commercial mortgages increased 4 basis points to 3.58% compared with the 2021 first quarter. Excluding prepayment penalties from both quarters, yields increased by 5 basis points.  
Now looking at liabilities. Our overall deposit cost this quarter decreased 7 basis points to 27 basis points due to the low interest rate environment as we gradually lower our relationship-based deposit rates. We anticipate this downward trend to continue in the coming quarters, albeit at a slower pace.  
During the quarter, average borrowing balances decreased by $276.4 million, and the cost of borrowings decreased by 12 basis points to 2.8%. The overall cost of funds for the quarter decreased 9 basis points to 38 basis points, driven by the reduction in deposit costs.  
And on to noninterest income and expense. With our focus on growing noninterest income, we achieved growth of $10.7 million or 84.5% to $23.4 million when compared with the 2020 second quarter. The increase was mostly due to a rise in fees and service charges and net gains on sales of loans.  
Noninterest expense for the 2021 second quarter was $172 million versus $151.9 million for the same period a year ago. The $20.1 million or 13.3% increase was principally due to the addition of new private client banking teams and operational support to meet the bank's growing needs. And despite our significant team hiring and margin compression from substantial cash balances, the bank continues to gain operating leverage. And as a result, the efficiency ratio improved to 35.8% for the 2021 second quarter versus 38% for the comparable period last year.  
And now turning to capital. All capital ratios remain well in excess of regulatory requirements and augment the relatively low-risk profile of the balance sheet as evidenced by a common equity Tier 1 risk-based ratio of 10.03% and total risk-based ratio of 12.72% as of the 2021 second quarter. Given our robust total risk-based ratio, we redeemed $260 million of subordinated debt at a rate of 5.3% on April 19, which will further reduce our interest expense in coming quarters.  
And now I'll turn the call back to Joe. Thank you."

The collective strength of our franchise led to an unbelievable quarter of record deposit growth, record core loan growth, record pretax pre-provision earnings and record net income. Bottom line, we delivered another strong quarter, and we are well positioned for the future. We've been bullish on New York City since the onset of the pandemic. Clearly, it is going to take some time to return to pre-pandemic activity levels. But it is encouraging to see the vibrancy return to this great city and country.  
It's great to see Broadway show selling tickets again, restaurants at full capacity, busy streets and most importantly, my colleagues in the office. We look forward to a continued recovery and a bright future for Signature Bank. Now we are happy to answer any questions you might have. But before I turn the call over to Nicole, I just want to encourage everyone listening to ease get vaccinated. Now I'll turn the call over to Nicole."

We've seen that the third quarter is usually our slowest quarter of loan growth. And given that people were not able to really take vacations last year due to the pandemic, we expect that there's a lot of people that will be out in the months of July and August, and we'll see that affect our loan growth a bit. So we're holding to the $1 billion to $2 billion for the third quarter. 
For the fourth quarter, we're hoping to be at the high end of that range. We do anticipate that the mortgage warehouse business will kick in a little bit. There's hope for the third quarter that we can do $200 million to $250 million in that mortgage warehouse space, and I think that's certainly possible. And then we can do an equal to potentially even greater amount in the fourth quarter. So that will be beneficial to the growth for sure. 
On the SBA side, we anticipate that they will start up mostly in the fourth quarter. We're still putting our systems and processes in place. It's very important in that space to really have your systems, your paperwork and everything in line with the government to ensure that you have that government guarantee on your loans. So it will take us a little bit longer to get that up and running, but it should be beneficial to growth in the fourth quarter, albeit to a much lesser extent in the mortgage warehouse business."

I will provide some overview into the quarterly results; and then my colleague, Eric Howell, our Chief Operating Officer, will review the bank's financial performance in greater detail. Eric and I will address your questions at the end of our remarks. Signature Bank's dramatic growth, which surpassed a milestone of $100 billion in assets was driven by the collective success of our legacy banking teams in New York are blockchain-driven -- they are block chain-based payments platform, Signet, and the many old risk franchises, which now comprise our organization. The deposit growth of $10 billion in the third quarter continued to be widespread with notable contributions from our digital asset banking team, including growth on the Signet platform, the specialized mortgage banking solutions team and the New York legacy banking teams. 
Our core growth -- our core loan growth was driven by our Fund Banking Division, which grew a record $5 billion in outstanding. Although some of these businesses have only recently come to fruition, our approach remains consistent since the day we opened our doors. We've always adhered to our client-centric single point-of-contact model, which invariably attracts top bankers from across the industry as well as their clients. Now let's take a look at earnings. Pretax pre-provision earnings for the 2021 third quarter were a record $331 million, an increase of $78.6 million or 31% compared with $252.4 million for the 2020 third quarter. 
Net income for the 2021 third quarter increased $102.9 million or 74.8% to a record $241.4 million or $3.88 diluted earnings per share compared with $138.6 million or $2.62 diluted earnings per share for last year. The increase in income was predominantly driven by substantial asset growth of $44.1 billion over the last 12 months as well as the decrease in the provision for credit losses, which was substantially impacted by COVID-19 in the third quarter of 2020. Looking at deposits. Deposits increased $10 billion or 11.7% to $95.6 billion this quarter, while average deposits also grew $10 million. This quarter's growth was driven by the digital asset banking team, which grew deposits $5.1 billion, including $2.7 billion of growth on the Signet platform. 
Additionally, the specialized mortgage banking solutions team grew $2.3 billion. Our Venture Banking Group increased $200 million. West Coast banking teams grew $235 million our New York banking teams grew $1.9 billion. This includes 8 New York teams that exceeded $100 million in growth. Since the end of the 2020 third quarter, deposits increased a remarkable $41.2 billion or 76% and average deposits increased $33.4 billion, furthering the reduction in our loan-to-deposit ratio, which now stands at 61%, down from 85% just 1 year ago. During the quarter, noninterest-bearing deposits increased $5.7 billion. That's worth saying twice. Noninterest-bearing deposits increased $5.7 billion to $34.4 billion, which represents a high 36% of total deposits. 
This tremendous growth in DDA can largely be attributable to the adoption of our Signet platform, which, as I stated earlier, grew by $2.7 billion this quarter. Our substantial organic deposit growth led to an increase of $44.1 billion or 69.2% in total assets since the third quarter of last year. That's the equivalent of acquiring a top 50 U.S. bank, but we did it completely organically. We believe this is by far the most efficient use of capital. Now let's take a look at our lending businesses. Core loans or loans excluding PPP during the 2021 third quarter increased a record $5 billion or 9.6% to $57.2 billion. For the prior 12 months, core loans grew $13 million or 29.4%. The increase in loans this quarter was again driven primarily by the fund banking capital call facilities. Our existing teams are well positioned to capitalize on opportunities. We also welcome our corporate mortgage finance business, warehouse mortgaging and our SBA originations platform, which will help to further our growth and diversification. 
Now turning to credit quality. Our portfolio continues to perform well. Let me first point out the bank's COVID-19 related nonpayment modifications continue to trend positively. As of year-end 2020, they were $1.3 billion; at April 15, they were $983 million; at July 15, there were $309 million; and as of October 10, they are now at $254 million. So from the end of 2020, when it was $1.3 billion, we're now down to $254 million or 43 basis points of total loans. That's a nonpayment modifications. Nonaccrual loans were $165.4 million or 28 basis points of total loans compared with $136.1 million or 25 basis points for the 2021 second quarter, well within our expectations. Our 30 to 89-day past due loans are well within our normal range of $98.1 million. Our 90-day plus past due loans were $81.2 million. However, there were 2 loans that renewals that were delayed and have subsequently closed. Adjusted for this, our 90-day plus past dues would have been within the normal range of $7.9 million. 
Net charge-offs for the quarter -- net charge-offs for the 2021 third quarter were $17.3 million or 12 basis points of average loans compared with $15.3 million for the 2021 second quarter, again well within our expectations. The provision for credit losses for the 2021 third quarter decreased to $4 million compared with $8.3 million for the 2021 second quarter. This brought the bank's allowance for credit losses to 85 basis points and the coverage ratio continues to stand at a healthy 303%. I would like to point out that excluding very well secured fund banking capital call facilities and government-guaranteed PPP loans, the allowance for credit losses will be much higher at 136% or 136 basis points. 
Now on to the expanding team where we continue to realize success. In the 2021 third quarter, the bank onboarded 1 large private client banking team in New York. This brings key total hires to 8 for the year, 2 in New York, 4 on the West Coast as well as the corporate mortgage finance team and the SBA originations team. At this point in the call, I'll turn it over to Eric, and he will review the quarter's financial results in greater detail."
913010,1685054520,2407367,"Signature Bank, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2021",2021-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Signature Bank","Executives","Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by reviewing net interest income and margin. With our emphasis on growing net interest income, for the third quarter, it reached $480.9 million, an increase of $23.7 million or 5.2% from the 2021 seco",759,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by reviewing net interest income and margin. With our emphasis on growing net interest income, for the third quarter, it reached $480.9 million, an increase of $23.7 million or 5.2% from the 2021 second quarter, an increase of $220.5 million or 20% from the 2020 third quarter. Net interest margin declined 14 basis points to 1.88% compared with 2.02% for the 2021 second quarter. The decrease was due to massive excess cash balances from significant deposit flows, which impacted margin by 59 basis points. Again, our focus is on net interest income growth. Let's look at asset yields and funding costs for a moment. 
Interest-earning asset yields for the 2021 third quarter decreased 19 basis points from the linked quarter to 2.18%. The decrease in overall asset yields was again driven by the massive excess average cash balances, which grew $5.4 billion to $29.2 billion during the quarter. Yields on the securities portfolio decreased 23 basis points linked quarter to 1.49% due to lower reinvestment rates as well as the bank investment in floating rate securities. Additionally, our portfolio duration increased to 3.01 years, which was due to an increase in the rates at the end of the quarter. We anticipated that it was going to be a better environment for investing in securities, and fortunately, interest rates were lower for most of the quarter. However, we were opportunistic throughout the quarter as we saw limited windows in which to invest. And therefore, we did increase the securities portfolio by $2.2 billion, which includes $1 billion in purchases that settled literally on the last day of the quarter. 
And turning to our loan portfolio. Yields on average commercial loans and commercial mortgages decreased 13 basis points to 3.45% compared with the 2021 second quarter. Excluding prepayment penalties from both quarters, yields decreased by 10 basis points. Now looking at liabilities. Our overall deposit cost this quarter decreased 5 basis points to 22 basis points due to the low interest rate environment as we gradually lower our relationship-based deposit rates. We anticipate this downward trend to continue in the coming quarters, albeit at a slower pace. During the quarter, average borrowing balances decreased by $146 million, and the cost of borrowings decreased 3 basis points to 2.8%. The overall cost of funds for the quarter decreased 6 basis points to 32 basis points, driven by the reduction in deposit costs. And I'd like to point out the dramatic shift in our interest rate risk profile, where our balance sheet has moved to significantly asset-sensitive from mildly liability-sensitive over the last several years. 
The bank's focus on growing floating rate loans, which now comprise 45%, up from 10% of our loan portfolio, coupled with our core deposit funding base makes us extremely well positioned to take advantage of a rising rate environment. And now on to noninterest income and expense. With our plan to grow noninterest income, we achieved growth of $7.2 million or 30% to $31.4 million when compared with the 2020 third quarter. The increase is mostly due to a rise in fees and service charges which was driven by an increase in both unused commitment fees and treasury management fees. Noninterest expense for the 2021 third quarter was $181.2 million versus $160.6 million for the same period a year ago. The $20.7 million or 12.9% increase was principally due to the addition of new private client banking teams and operational support to meet the bank's growing needs. And despite our significant team hiring and margin compression from substantial cash balances, the bank continues to gain operating leverage; and as a result, our efficiency ratio improved to 35.4% for the 2021 third quarter versus 38.9% for the comparable period last year. 
Now quickly turning to taxes. This quarter, we benefited from multiple onetime tax items, which totaled $7.4 million and included $4.3 million in solar tax credits. This lowered our tax rate to 26.2% for the quarter. Excluding these benefits, the effective tax rate for the quarter would have been 28.5%. And turning to capital. The bank raised $655 million of common equity through a public offering during the quarter. As a result, all capital ratios strengthened and remain well in excess of regulatory requirements and augment the relatively low-risk profile of the balance sheet as evidenced by a common equity Tier 1 risk-based ratio of 10.49% and total risk-based ratio of 12.96% as of the 2021 third quarter. And now I'll turn the call back to Joe. Thank you."

Record core loan growth, record pretax pre-provision earnings and record net income. Bottom line, we delivered another strong quarter. We are well positioned for the future given the robust deposit growth from across the board that has led to a significant level of excess cash on our balance sheet. We will continue to prudently put the cash to use in our securities portfolio as well as our loan portfolio through both our new and existing lending businesses. Our steadfast deployment will ultimately drive earnings higher for our shareholders. Our approach to organic growth coupled with our industry-leading efficiency continues to be the best method for capital deployment. Signature Bank's track record confirms that investing in people is paramount and the optimal path is to avoid all of the cultural and organizational disruptions that stem from M&A, which are often underestimated. 
Looking ahead, we will continue to invest in our colleagues, and dedication has brought us to this next chapter. It has always been and will continue to be their efforts that culminate into the driving institution that has become Signature Bank. We look forward to a bright future ahead.

Last one for me is just I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the -- there's obviously a ton of cash on the balance sheet, $29 billion. At what point do you think we start to see an inflection. We can actually see cash balances start to turn and go lower. And could you maybe just talk a little bit about what you think the normalized cash position of the bank is. A lot of the stablecoin issuers are mandating that certain -- the reserve deposits need to be in certain asset classes. Should we expect the Signature as a participant in that just needs to hold on to more cash than your average bank? That's all I had."

It's hard to determine what the deposit flows will be because we have all these businesses out there, both new and legacy that are continuing to draw their clients. Particularly if you think about the West Coast, they've been under a pandemic the whole time that they've been here. So as they start to bring more of the deposits in, it's hard to deploy that quickly. So it really depends on the deposit flows. But one of the good things that we had going on on the asset side is that we have 2 new verticals, we have the warehouse lending and we have the SBA lending, and we have another vertical that will be coming on board either this quarter or next first quarter of 2022. So that deployment will help us. We expect that commercial real estate will start coming on, not like they did in the early part of their tenure here, but certainly in a positive way. So whatever cash we get -- we have, we're pretty confident that we can deploy it to levels that were much higher than they've been in the past."

So we'll be able to deploy there as well. Normalized cash balance is tough to predict because, again, we're growing the overall balance sheet. But I'd say we're probably in a $10 billion to $15 billion cash hold now. So we've got a significant amount of cash that we need to deploy in the future, and we'll be able to do so. We've seen -- it's hard to say, as Joe said, it's very hard to predict deposit growth for us because of the engine that we have in place to drive that future deposit growth, we have been through a couple of rising rate environments now in our history. And although we've only had 1 quarter of negative deposit growth in all of our history, we did see that deposit growth moderate. So we do anticipate, as interest rates rise, we will see the growth moderates near impossible to think that we're going to grow $10 billion a quarter in perpetuity. And when that happens, then that should signal a stronger economy and steeper yield curve, which will give us plenty of asset classes to deploy into. And that's where we really monetize these cash balances."

Thank you, Susan. I will provide some overview into the quarterly results; and then my colleague, Eric Howell, our Chief Operating Officer, will review the bank's financial performance in greater detail. Eric and I will address your questions at the end of our remarks. Signature Bank's dramatic growth, which surpassed a milestone of $100 billion in assets was driven by the collective success of our legacy banking teams in New York, our blockchain-driven -- blockchain-based payments platform, Signet, and the many low-risk franchises which now comprise our organization. The deposit growth of $10 billion in the third quarter continued to be widespread with notable contributions from our Digital Asset Banking team, including growth on the Signet platform. The Specialized Mortgage Banking Solutions team and the New York legacy banking teams. 
Our core growth -- our core loan growth was driven by our Fund Banking Division, which grew a record $5 billion in outstandings. Although some of these businesses have only recently come to fruition, our approach remains consistent since the day we opened our doors. We've always adhered to our client-centric, single point-of-contact model, which invariably attracts top bankers from across the industry as well as their clients. 
Now let's take a look at earnings. Pre-tax, pre-provision earnings for the 2021 third quarter were a record $331 million, an increase of $78.6 million or 31% compared with $252.4 million for the 2020 third quarter. Net income for the 2021 third quarter increased $102.9 million or 74.2% to a record $241.4 million or $3.88 diluted earnings per share compared with $138.6 million or $2.62 diluted earnings per share for last year. The increase in income was predominantly driven by substantial asset growth of $44.1 billion over the last 12 months as well as the decrease in the provision for credit losses, which was substantially impacted by COVID-19 in the third quarter of 2020. 
Looking at deposits. Deposits increased $10 billion or 11.7% to $95.6 billion this quarter, while average deposits also grew $10 billion. This quarter's growth was driven by the Digital Assets Banking team, which grew deposits $5.1 billion, including $2.7 billion of growth on the Signet platform. Additionally, the Specialized Mortgage Banking Solutions team grew $2.3 billion. Our Venture Banking Group increased $200 million. West Coast Banking teams grew $235 million and our New York Banking teams grew $1.9 billion. This includes 8 New York teams that exceeded $100 million in growth. 
Since the end of the 2020 third quarter, deposits increased to remarkable $41.2 billion or 76% and average deposits increased $33.4 billion, furthering the reduction in our loan-to-deposit ratio, which now stands at 61%, down from 85% just 1 year ago. During the quarter, noninterest-bearing deposits increased $5.7 billion. That's worth saying twice. Noninterest-bearing deposits increased $5.7 billion to $34.4 billion, which represents a high 36% of total deposits. This tremendous growth in DDA can largely be attributable to the adoption of our Signet platform, which, as I stated earlier, grew by $2.7 billion this quarter. 
Our substantial organic deposit growth led to an increase of $44.1 billion or 69.2% in total assets since the third quarter of last year. That's the equivalent of acquiring a top 50 U.S. bank, but we did it completely organically. We believe this is by far the most efficient use of capital. Now let's take a look at our lending businesses. Core loans or loans excluding PPP during the 2021 third quarter increased a record $5 billion or 9.6% to $57.2 billion. For the prior 12 months, core loans grew $13 billion or 29.4%. The increase in loans this quarter was again driven primarily by the Fund Banking Capital Call facilities. Our existing teams are well positioned to capitalize on opportunities. We also welcome our Corporate Mortgage Finance business, warehouse mortgaging and our SBA originations of platform, which will help to further our growth and diversification.  
Now turning to credit quality. Our portfolio continues to perform well. Let me first point out the bank's COVID-19 related nonpayment modifications continue to trend positively. As of year-end 2020, they were $1.3 billion; at April 15, they were $983 million; at July 15, they were $309 million; and as of October 10, they are now at $254 million. So from the end of 2020, when it was $1.3 billion, we're now down to $254 million or 43 basis points of total loans. That's a nonpayment modification. Nonaccrual loans were $165.4 million or 28 basis points of total loans compared with $136.1 million or 25 basis points for the 2021 second quarter, well within our expectations. Our 30 to 89-day past due loans are well within our normal range of $98.1 million. Our 90-day plus past due loans were $81.2 million. However, there were 2 loans that renewals that were delayed and have subsequently closed. Adjusted for this, our 90-day plus past dues would have been within the normal range of $7.9 million.  
Net charge-offs for the quarter -- net charge-offs for the 2021 third quarter were $17.3 million or 12 basis points of average loans compared with $15.3 million for the 2021 second quarter, again well within our expectations. The provision for credit losses for the 2021 third quarter decreased to $4 million compared with $8.3 million for the 2021 second quarter. This brought the bank's allowance for credit losses to 85 basis points and the coverage ratio continues to stand at a healthy 303%. I would like to point out that excluding very well secured Fund Banking capital call facility and government-guaranteed PPP loans, the allowance for credit losses will be much higher at 136% or 136 basis points. 
Now on to the expanding team front where we continue to realize success. In the 2021 third quarter, the bank onboarded 1 large private client banking team in New York. This brings the team total hires to 8 for the year, 2 in New York, 4 on the West Coast as well as the corporate mortgage finance team and the SBA originations team. At this point in the call, I'll turn it over to Eric, and he will review the quarter's financial results in greater detail."

Net interest margin declined 14 basis points to 1.88% compared with 2.02% for the 2021 second quarter. The decrease was due to massive excess cash balances from significant deposit flows, which impacted margin by 59 basis points. Again, our focus is on net interest income growth. 
Let's look at asset yields and funding costs for a moment. Interest-earning asset yields for the 2021 third quarter decreased 19 basis points from the linked quarter to 2.18%. The decrease in overall asset yields was again driven by the massive excess average cash balances, which grew $5.4 billion to $29.2 billion during the quarter. Yields on the securities portfolio decreased 23 basis points linked quarter to 1.49% due to lower reinvestment rates as well as the bank investing in floating rate securities. Additionally, our portfolio duration increased to 3.01 years, which was due to an increase in the rates at the end of the quarter. We anticipated that it was going to be a better environment for investing in securities, and fortunately, interest rates were lower for most of the quarter. However, we were opportunistic throughout the quarter as we saw limited windows in which to invest. And therefore, we did increase the securities portfolio by $2.2 billion, which includes $1 billion in purchases that settled literally on the last day of the quarter. 
And turning to our loan portfolio. Yields on average commercial loans and commercial mortgages decreased 13 basis points to 3.45% compared with the 2021 second quarter. Excluding prepayment penalties from both quarters, yields decreased by 10 basis points. Now looking at liabilities. Our overall deposit cost this quarter decreased 5 basis points to 22 basis points due to the low interest rate environment as we gradually lower our relationship-based deposit rates. We anticipate this downward trend to continue in the coming quarters, albeit at a slower pace. During the quarter, average borrowing balances decreased by $146 million, and the cost of borrowings decreased 3 basis points to 2.8%. The overall cost of funds for the quarter decreased 6 basis points to 32 basis points, driven by the reduction in deposit costs. And I'd like to point out the dramatic shift in our interest rate risk profile, where our balance sheet has moved to significantly asset-sensitive from mildly liability-sensitive over the last several years. 
The bank's focus on growing floating rate loans, which now comprise 45%, up from 10% of our loan portfolio coupled with our core deposit funding base makes us extremely well positioned to take advantage of a rising rate environment. And now on to noninterest income and expense. With our plan to grow noninterest income, we achieved growth of $7.2 million or 30% to $31.4 million when compared with the 2020 third quarter. The increase is mostly due to a rise in fees and service charges which was driven by an increase in both unused commitment fees and treasury management fees.
Noninterest expense for the 2021 third quarter was $181.2 million versus $160.6 million for the same period a year ago. The $20.7 million or 12.9% increase was principally due to the addition of new private client banking teams and operational support to meet the bank's growing needs. And despite our significant team hiring and margin compression from substantial cash balances, the bank continues to gain operating leverage; and as a result, our efficiency ratio improved to 35.4% for the 2021 third quarter versus 38.9% for the comparable period last year. 
Now quickly turning to taxes. This quarter, we benefited from multiple onetime tax items, which totaled $7.4 million and included $4.3 million in solar tax credits. This lowered our tax rate to 26.2% for the quarter. Excluding these benefits, the effective tax rate for the quarter would have been 28.5%. And turning to capital. The bank raised $655 million of common equity through a public offering during the quarter. As a result, all capital ratios strengthened and remained well in excess of regulatory requirements and augment the relatively low-risk profile of the balance sheet as evidenced by a common equity Tier 1 risk-based ratio of 10.49% and total risk-based ratio of 12.96% as of the 2021 third quarter. And now I'll turn the call back to Joe. Thank you."

Record core loan growth, record pre-tax, pre-provision earnings and record net income. Bottom line, we delivered another strong quarter. We are well positioned for the future given the robust deposit growth from across the Board that has led to a significant level of excess cash on our balance sheet. We will continue to prudently put the cash to use in our securities portfolio as well as our loan portfolio through both our new and existing lending businesses. Our steadfast deployment will ultimately drive earnings higher for our shareholders. Our approach to organic growth coupled with our industry-leading efficiency continues to be the best method for capital deployment. Signature Bank's track record confirms that investing in people is paramount and the optimal path is to avoid all of the cultural and organizational disruptions that stem from M&A, which are often underestimated. 
Looking ahead, we will continue to invest in our colleagues, and dedication has brought us to this next chapter. It has always been and will continue to be their efforts that culminate into the thriving institution that has become Signature Bank. We look forward to a bright future ahead. Now we are happy to answer any questions you might have. But before I turn the call over to the operator, I just want to encourage everyone please get vaccinated. Now I'll turn it over to Emma.

It's hard to determine what the deposit flows will be because we have all these businesses out there, both new and legacy that are continuing to draw their clients. Particularly if you think about the West Coast, they've been under a pandemic the whole time that they've been here. So as they start to bring more of the deposits in, it's hard to deploy that quickly. So it really depends on the deposit flows. But one of the good things that we had going on, on the asset side is that we have 2 new verticals, we have the warehouse lending and we have the SBA lending, and we have another vertical that will be coming on Board either this quarter or next first quarter of 2022. So that deployment will help us. We expect that commercial real estate will start coming on, not like they did in the early part of their tenure here, but certainly in a positive way.

So we'll be able to deploy there as well. Normalized cash balance is tough to predict because, again, we're growing the overall balance sheet. But I'd say we're probably in a $10 billion to $15 billion cash hold now. 
So we've got a significant amount of cash that we need to deploy in the future, and we'll be able to do so. We've seen -- it's hard to say, as Joe said, it's very hard to predict deposit growth for us because of the engine that we have in place to drive that future deposit growth. We have been through a couple of rising rate environments now in our history. And although we've only had 1 quarter of negative deposit growth in all of our history, we did see that deposit growth moderate, right? 
So we do anticipate, as interest rates rise, we will see the growth moderates near impossible to think that we're going to grow $10 billion a quarter in perpetuity. And when that happens, then that should signal a stronger economy and steeper yield curve, which will give us plenty of asset classes to deploy into.

I will provide some overview into the quarterly results; and then my colleague, Eric Howell, our Chief Operating Officer, will review the bank's financial performance in greater detail. Eric and I will address your questions at the end of our remarks. Signature Bank's dramatic growth, which surpassed a milestone of $100 billion in assets was driven by the collective success of our legacy banking teams in New York, our blockchain-driven -- blockchain-based payments platform, Signet, and the many low-risk franchises which now comprise our organization. The deposit growth of $10 billion in the third quarter continued to be widespread with notable contributions from our Digital Asset Banking team, including growth on the Signet platform. The Specialized Mortgage Banking Solutions team and the New York legacy banking teams. 
Our core growth -- our core loan growth was driven by our Fund Banking Division, which grew a record $5 billion in outstandings. Although some of these businesses have only recently come to fruition, our approach remains consistent since the day we opened our doors. We've always adhered to our client-centric, single point-of-contact model, which invariably attracts top bankers from across the industry as well as their clients. 
Now let's take a look at earnings. Pre-tax, pre-provision earnings for the 2021 third quarter were a record $331 million, an increase of $78.6 million or 31% compared with $252.4 million for the 2020 third quarter. Net income for the 2021 third quarter increased $102.9 million or 74.2% to a record $241.4 million or $3.88 diluted earnings per share compared with $138.6 million or $2.62 diluted earnings per share for last year. The increase in income was predominantly driven by substantial asset growth of $44.1 billion over the last 12 months as well as the decrease in the provision for credit losses, which was substantially impacted by COVID-19 in the third quarter of 2020. 
Looking at deposits. Deposits increased $10 billion or 11.7% to $95.6 billion this quarter, while average deposits also grew $10 billion. This quarter's growth was driven by the Digital Assets Banking team, which grew deposits $5.1 billion, including $2.7 billion of growth on the Signet platform. Additionally, the Specialized Mortgage Banking Solutions team grew $2.3 billion. Our Venture Banking Group increased $200 million. West Coast Banking teams grew $235 million and our New York Banking teams grew $1.9 billion. This includes 8 New York teams that exceeded $100 million in growth. 
Since the end of the 2020 third quarter, deposits increased to remarkable $41.2 billion or 76% and average deposits increased $33.4 billion, furthering the reduction in our loan-to-deposit ratio, which now stands at 61%, down from 85% just 1 year ago. During the quarter, noninterest-bearing deposits increased $5.7 billion. That's worth saying twice. Noninterest-bearing deposits increased $5.7 billion to $34.4 billion, which represents a high 36% of total deposits. This tremendous growth in DDA can largely be attributable to the adoption of our Signet platform, which, as I stated earlier, grew by $2.7 billion this quarter. 
Our substantial organic deposit growth led to an increase of $44.1 billion or 69.2% in total assets since the third quarter of last year. That's the equivalent of acquiring a top 50 U.S. bank, but we did it completely organically. We believe this is by far the most efficient use of capital. Now let's take a look at our lending businesses. Core loans or loans excluding PPP during the 2021 third quarter increased a record $5 billion or 9.6% to $57.2 billion. For the prior 12 months, core loans grew $13 billion or 29.4%. The increase in loans this quarter was again driven primarily by the Fund Banking Capital Call facilities. Our existing teams are well positioned to capitalize on opportunities. We also welcome our Corporate Mortgage Finance business, warehouse mortgaging and our SBA originations of platform, which will help to further our growth and diversification.  
Now turning to credit quality. Our portfolio continues to perform well. Let me first point out the bank's COVID-19 related nonpayment modifications continue to trend positively. As of year-end 2020, they were $1.3 billion; at April 15, they were $983 million; at July 15, they were $309 million; and as of October 10, they are now at $254 million. So from the end of 2020, when it was $1.3 billion, we're now down to $254 million or 43 basis points of total loans. That's a nonpayment modification. Nonaccrual loans were $165.4 million or 28 basis points of total loans compared with $136.1 million or 25 basis points for the 2021 second quarter, well within our expectations. Our 30 to 89-day past due loans are well within our normal range of $98.1 million. Our 90-day plus past due loans were $81.2 million. However, there were 2 loans that renewals that were delayed and have subsequently closed. Adjusted for this, our 90-day plus past dues would have been within the normal range of $7.9 million.  
Net charge-offs for the quarter -- net charge-offs for the 2021 third quarter were $17.3 million or 12 basis points of average loans compared with $15.3 million for the 2021 second quarter, again well within our expectations. The provision for credit losses for the 2021 third quarter decreased to $4 million compared with $8.3 million for the 2021 second quarter. This brought the bank's allowance for credit losses to 85 basis points and the coverage ratio continues to stand at a healthy 303%. I would like to point out that excluding very well secured Fund Banking capital call facility and government-guaranteed PPP loans, the allowance for credit losses will be much higher at 136% or 136 basis points. 
Now on to the expanding team front where we continue to realize success. In the 2021 third quarter, the bank onboarded 1 large private client banking team in New York. This brings the team total hires to 8 for the year, 2 in New York, 4 on the West Coast as well as the corporate mortgage finance team and the SBA originations team. At this point in the call, I'll turn it over to Eric, and he will review the quarter's financial results in greater detail."
913010,1685054520,2474885,"Signature Bank, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 19, 2021",2021-10-19,"Earnings Calls","Signature Bank","Executives","Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by reviewing net interest income and margin. With our emphasis on growing net interest income, for the third quarter, it reached $480.9 million, an increase of $23.7 million or 5.2% from the 2021 seco",759,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by reviewing net interest income and margin. With our emphasis on growing net interest income, for the third quarter, it reached $480.9 million, an increase of $23.7 million or 5.2% from the 2021 second quarter, an increase of $220.5 million or 20% from the 2020 third quarter. Net interest margin declined 14 basis points to 1.88% compared with 2.02% for the 2021 second quarter. The decrease was due to massive excess cash balances from significant deposit flows, which impacted margin by 59 basis points. Again, our focus is on net interest income growth. 
Let's look at asset yields and funding costs for a moment. Interest-earning asset yields for the 2021 third quarter decreased 19 basis points from the linked quarter to 2.18%. The decrease in overall asset yields was again driven by the massive excess average cash balances, which grew $5.4 billion to $29.2 billion during the quarter. Yields on the securities portfolio decreased 23 basis points linked quarter to 1.49% due to lower reinvestment rates as well as the bank investing in floating rate securities. Additionally, our portfolio duration increased to 3.01 years, which was due to an increase in the rates at the end of the quarter. We anticipated that it was going to be a better environment for investing in securities, and fortunately, interest rates were lower for most of the quarter. However, we were opportunistic throughout the quarter as we saw limited windows in which to invest. And therefore, we did increase the securities portfolio by $2.2 billion, which includes $1 billion in purchases that settled literally on the last day of the quarter. 
And turning to our loan portfolio. Yields on average commercial loans and commercial mortgages decreased 13 basis points to 3.45% compared with the 2021 second quarter. Excluding prepayment penalties from both quarters, yields decreased by 10 basis points. Now looking at liabilities. Our overall deposit cost this quarter decreased 5 basis points to 22 basis points due to the low interest rate environment as we gradually lower our relationship-based deposit rates. We anticipate this downward trend to continue in the coming quarters, albeit at a slower pace. During the quarter, average borrowing balances decreased by $146 million, and the cost of borrowings decreased 3 basis points to 2.8%. The overall cost of funds for the quarter decreased 6 basis points to 32 basis points, driven by the reduction in deposit costs. And I'd like to point out the dramatic shift in our interest rate risk profile, where our balance sheet has moved to significantly asset-sensitive from mildly liability-sensitive over the last several years. 
The bank's focus on growing floating rate loans, which now comprise 45%, up from 10% of our loan portfolio coupled with our core deposit funding base makes us extremely well positioned to take advantage of a rising rate environment. And now on to noninterest income and expense. With our plan to grow noninterest income, we achieved growth of $7.2 million or 30% to $31.4 million when compared with the 2020 third quarter. The increase is mostly due to a rise in fees and service charges which was driven by an increase in both unused commitment fees and treasury management fees.
Noninterest expense for the 2021 third quarter was $181.2 million versus $160.6 million for the same period a year ago. The $20.7 million or 12.9% increase was principally due to the addition of new private client banking teams and operational support to meet the bank's growing needs. And despite our significant team hiring and margin compression from substantial cash balances, the bank continues to gain operating leverage; and as a result, our efficiency ratio improved to 35.4% for the 2021 third quarter versus 38.9% for the comparable period last year. 
Now quickly turning to taxes. This quarter, we benefited from multiple onetime tax items, which totaled $7.4 million and included $4.3 million in solar tax credits. This lowered our tax rate to 26.2% for the quarter. Excluding these benefits, the effective tax rate for the quarter would have been 28.5%. And turning to capital. The bank raised $655 million of common equity through a public offering during the quarter. As a result, all capital ratios strengthened and remained well in excess of regulatory requirements and augment the relatively low-risk profile of the balance sheet as evidenced by a common equity Tier 1 risk-based ratio of 10.49% and total risk-based ratio of 12.96% as of the 2021 third quarter. And now I'll turn the call back to Joe. Thank you."

Record core loan growth, record pre-tax, pre-provision earnings and record net income. Bottom line, we delivered another strong quarter. We are well positioned for the future given the robust deposit growth from across the Board that has led to a significant level of excess cash on our balance sheet. We will continue to prudently put the cash to use in our securities portfolio as well as our loan portfolio through both our new and existing lending businesses. Our steadfast deployment will ultimately drive earnings higher for our shareholders. Our approach to organic growth coupled with our industry-leading efficiency continues to be the best method for capital deployment. Signature Bank's track record confirms that investing in people is paramount and the optimal path is to avoid all of the cultural and organizational disruptions that stem from M&A, which are often underestimated. 
Looking ahead, we will continue to invest in our colleagues, and dedication has brought us to this next chapter. It has always been and will continue to be their efforts that culminate into the thriving institution that has become Signature Bank. We look forward to a bright future ahead.

It's hard to determine what the deposit flows will be because we have all these businesses out there, both new and legacy that are continuing to draw their clients. Particularly if you think about the West Coast, they've been under a pandemic the whole time that they've been here. So as they start to bring more of the deposits in, it's hard to deploy that quickly. So it really depends on the deposit flows. But one of the good things that we had going on, on the asset side is that we have 2 new verticals, we have the warehouse lending and we have the SBA lending, and we have another vertical that will be coming on Board either this quarter or next first quarter of 2022. So that deployment will help us. We expect that commercial real estate will start coming on, not like they did in the early part of their tenure here, but certainly in a positive way. So whatever cash we get -- we have, we're pretty confident that we can deploy it to levels that were much higher than they've been in the past."

So we'll be able to deploy there as well. Normalized cash balance is tough to predict because, again, we're growing the overall balance sheet. But I'd say we're probably in a $10 billion to $15 billion cash hold now. 
So we've got a significant amount of cash that we need to deploy in the future, and we'll be able to do so. We've seen -- it's hard to say, as Joe said, it's very hard to predict deposit growth for us because of the engine that we have in place to drive that future deposit growth. We have been through a couple of rising rate environments now in our history. And although we've only had 1 quarter of negative deposit growth in all of our history, we did see that deposit growth moderate, right? 
So we do anticipate, as interest rates rise, we will see the growth moderates near impossible to think that we're going to grow $10 billion a quarter in perpetuity. And when that happens, then that should signal a stronger economy and steeper yield curve, which will give us plenty of asset classes to deploy into. And that's where we really monetize these cash balances."

And that bodes well for us and it's hard for others to do it because they don't have bankers that have experience in this space. With Signet and with other products, we're continuously making enhancements and we'll probably announce in the upcoming quarters into the fourth or first quarter, announcements of some of the new things that we'll be doing.

In the Mortgage Warehouse Finance business, they've got almost $2 billion, I want to say, now in the pipeline. We expect, let's say, anywhere from $200 million to maybe even as much as $800 million, but that would really be on the high end of lines to close and draws will be roughly 50% of that.

We've brought on some massive business lines and undertaking a number of initiatives. And we need to invest in our people, in our operations and in our technology.
