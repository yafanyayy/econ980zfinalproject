270586,700922562,2181567,"NextEra Energy Partners, LP, NextEra Energy, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2021",2021-01-26,"Earnings Calls","NextEra Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. 2020 was a terrific year for both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. NextEra Energy performance was strong both financially and operationally. We had outstanding execution on our initiatives to continu",2321,"Thanks, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. 2020 was a terrific year for both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. NextEra Energy performance was strong both financially and operationally. We had outstanding execution on our initiatives to continue to drive future growth across the company.
Across all of our businesses, we successfully executed on the largest capital program in our history, deploying more than $14 billion in 2020 as we lead America's clean energy transformation. By successfully executing on our plans, NextEra Energy extended its long track record of delivering value for shareholders with adjusted earnings per share of $2.31, up 10.5% from 2019.
A key element of our value proposition in NextEra Energy is a culture focused on delivering outstanding results for our shareholders. Over the past 10 years, we've delivered compound annual growth and adjusted EPS of 8%, which is the highest among all top 10 power companies who have achieved, on average, compound annual growth of less than 3% over the same period. Amid this significant growth, the company has maintained one of the strongest balance sheets and credit positions in the industry.
In 2020, we delivered a total shareholder return of approximately 30%, significantly outperforming both the S&P 500 and the S&P 500 Utilities Index, and continuing to outperform both indices in terms of total shareholder return on a 1-year, 3-year, 5-year, 7-year and 10-year basis. Over the past 15 years, we've outperformed all of the other companies in the S&P 500 Utilities Index and 86% of the companies in the S&P 500 while more than tripling the average total shareholder return of both indices. While we are proud of our long-term track record of creating shareholder value, we remain laser-focused on the future and on delivering our commitments.
NextEra Energy remains well positioned to capitalize on the disruptive forces reshaping our industry, which have expanded and accelerated over the past 2 years, even beyond what we had anticipated. The combination of low-cost renewables with low-cost storage in the form of batteries today and hydrogen in the longer term has substantially increased the total addressable market for NextEra Energy. We now believe that a substantial and economic decarbonization of the electricity, transportation and industrial sectors is possible, which represents a potential investment opportunity of trillions of dollars in the coming decades.
In the electricity sector, we expect that older and more inefficient generation will continue to be retired and replaced with cleaner and more affordable alternatives. In the transportation sector, we believe it will be increasingly economic to replace fossil fuel vehicles with vehicles powered by fuel cells and batteries charged with renewable energy. And in the industrial sector, gray hydrogen and other high-carbon feedstocks can be replaced with green hydrogen. We believe these trends have already been put into motion driven by economics. In addition, we believe it is possible that the Biden administration, supported by a significant shift in public support towards taking action to address climate change, may act to further accelerate these shifts through the extension of existing incentives as well as initiating other forms of policy support.
Importantly, we believe that no company is better equipped to take advantage of these substantial and long-term trends than NextEra Energy. In fact, NextEra Energy is already proof that you can be clean, low-cost and financially successful all at the same time. We are at the vanguard of building a sustainable energy era that is both clean and affordable, and we are driving hard to continue to be at the forefront of the disruption that is occurring within the energy sector and broader parts of the U.S. economy.
We expect that the execution of our strategy will drive meaningful CO2 emissions reductions across the country and will help advance NextEra Energy towards its goal of reducing its CO2 emissions rate by 67% by 2025 from a 2005 baseline, while simultaneously lowering generation cost for customers and maintaining best-in-class reliability. We expect the disruptive nature of renewables to be terrific for customers, terrific for the environment and terrific for shareholders by helping to drive tremendous growth for this company over the next decade and beyond.
FPL is already capitalizing on the disruption in our sector with continued focus on its grid and fleet modernization efforts. During 2020, FPL successfully executed on its strategic initiatives, including placing more than 1,100 megawatts of cost-effective solar in service on time and on budget in support of its ongoing capital plan. This solar expansion is part of FPL's SolarTogether community solar program and its groundbreaking 30-by-30 plan, which is one of the world's largest solar expansions and would result in roughly 10,000 megawatts of total solar capacity on FPL's system by 2030.
Additionally, the 409-megawatt Manatee Energy Storage Center, which will be the world's largest integrated solar-powered battery system, is on track and on budget to be placed in service later this year as part of the approximately $1 billion that NextEra Energy is investing in battery storage projects in 2021. Smart capital investments such as these help FPL improve its already best-in-class customer value proposition while also maintaining an emissions profile that is among the cleanest in the nation. 
FPL also had continued success with its cost-saving initiatives, making even further reductions to its already best-in-class dollar per retail megawatt-hour nonfuel O&M costs from 2019 to 2020. Through our unrelenting focus on cost savings and on making disciplined long-term investments for the benefit of our customers, FPL has been able to maintain typical customer bills that are the lowest in the nation when compared to the 20 largest investor-owned utilities in the country.
In addition to low bills, FPL has continued to provide reliability that is by far the best in the state of Florida, achieving its best-ever reliability rate in 2020. FPL's investments to build a stronger, smarter energy grid have resulted in best-in-state reliability for the last 14 years in a row as well as earning numerous national awards. In 2020, FPL was recognized for the fifth time in 6 years as being the most reliable electric utility in the nation.
Let me now turn to Gulf Power. In the 2 years that it has been part of the NextEra Energy family, Gulf Power has realized an approximately 30% reduction in O&M costs, a 50% improvement in service reliability, a 93% improvement in safety and a nearly 20% reduction in CO2 emissions. Gulf Power has grown regulatory capital employed at a 17% compound annual growth rate since 2018, and we are well on our way to achieving the objectives we laid out at our investor conference in 2019.
In addition to the excellent operational execution that we delivered in 2020, we continued to progress our smart capital investment program that is expected to generate further customer benefits over the coming years. In the fourth quarter, we completed the Plant Crist coal-to-natural gas conversion. As a result, consistent with our commitment to remain a clean energy leader, we were able to complete the accelerated shutdown of the coal units at Plant Crist, which has now been renamed the Gulf Clean Energy Center.
With the retirement of FPL's Indiantown Cogeneration facility also occurring late last year, 2021 is the first time in nearly 70 years that there are no coal-fired power plants in Florida for either FPL or Gulf Power. Earlier this month, FPL filed a test year letter with the Florida Public Service Commission to initiate a rate proceeding for new rates beginning in January 2022. The 4-year plan that we intend to propose is designed to provide continued longer-term cost certainty for customers while allowing FPL to continue investing in clean energy, storm-hardened infrastructure and other innovative technologies that are the foundation of our communities.
The stability of multiyear rate plans allows FPL to focus on efficiency in the business, which is critical to keeping customer bills low while, at the same time, enabling FPL to maintain strong credit ratings and balance sheet, which allows for consistent access to the capital markets. We look forward to the opportunity to showcase our long-term track record of providing low bills, high reliability and clean energy for Floridans and plans -- and our plans to build an even more resilient and sustainable energy future for Florida in the coming years.
Turning to Energy Resources. In 2020, we continued to advance our position as the leading developer and operator of wind, solar and battery storage projects, commissioning approximately 5,750 megawatts of new projects, more than doubling the amount of total renewables commissioned versus the previous year. This was also a record year for renewables origination in Energy Resources with the team adding a net nearly 7,000 megawatts to our backlog during the year.
As a result of the team's origination success and alongside the backdrop of the terrific market outlook I just outlined at the beginning of my remarks, we now expect to construct approximately 23 to 30 gigawatts of new renewables in the 2021 to 2024 time frame, which, if we are successful at the midpoint, would mean adding a portfolio of generation projects that is approximately 1.5x the size of Energy Resources' entire operating renewables portfolio as of year-end 2019.
Energy Resources' execution success is reflective of our ability to leverage our significant competitive advantages, including our best-in-class development skills, large pipeline of sites and interconnection queue positions, strong customer relationships, purchasing power, best-in-class construction expertise, resource assessment capabilities, cost of capital advantages and world-class operations capability to capitalize on the ongoing energy transition that is occurring in the nation's generation fleet. We believe that we are in a terrific position to be able to capture a significant share of the market opportunities going forward and what we continue to believe is the best renewables development environment we have ever seen.
Along with the broader public shift towards calls for action to fight climate change, over the past few years, there's been an increased focus on environmental, social and governance, or ESG, on the part of many of our stakeholders. While we expect this trend to amplify demand among our traditional customers and in our core renewables business, we also believe it is opening up significant new markets and business opportunities for Energy Resources. We anticipate our development program to be further enhanced by an ability to attract new nontraditional customers, particularly in the commercial and industrial sector, as improving renewable economics are increasingly aligned with corporate objectives to procure energy from clean generation sources.
In summary, I continue to remain as enthusiastic as ever about NextEra Energy's long-term growth prospects. In 2020, we extended our long track record of executing for the benefit of customers and shareholders and further developed our best-in-class organic growth prospects. Based on the strength and resiliency of our underlying businesses, I will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectation ranges in 2021, 2022 and 2023, while at the same time, maintaining our strong credit ratings. We remain intensely focused on execution and continuing to drive shareholder value over the coming years.
Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which delivered a total unit return -- unitholder return of approximately 32% in 2020, further advancing its history of value creation since the IPO. NextEra Energy Partners is uniquely positioned to take advantage of the disruptive factors reshaping the energy industry and benefit from the enormous market opportunity in the coming decades for renewables. 
NextEra Energy Partners also had a terrific year of execution in 2020 and continue to deliver on its commitments. That history of execution is supported by NextEra Energy Partners' outstanding portfolio of clean energy assets, which was further diversified in 2020. During the year, NextEra Energy Partners acquired interests in approximately 1,100 megawatts of high-quality renewable energy assets, including the partnership's first battery storage project from Energy Resources.
Additionally, during the year, NextEra Energy Partners successfully completed its first 3 organic growth prospects, including the repowering of 275 megawatts of wind projects. For 2020, NextEra Energy Partners grew its LP distributions by 15% year-over-year and delivered 40% year-over-year cash available for distribution growth, highlighting the strength of its operating portfolio. With this strong year-over-year growth in cash available for distribution, NextEra Energy Partners achieved its distribution growth objectives while maintaining a trailing 12-month payout ratio in the high 60% range as of year-end 2020.
In the fourth quarter, we published our first NextEra Energy Partners ESG report, highlighting its high-quality clean energy portfolio, visible opportunities for renewables growth and ability to leverage the operational expertise of NextEra Energy Resources. The continued origination success at Energy Resources is expected to benefit NextEra Energy Partners in meeting its future growth objectives. I continue to believe that the combination of NextEra Energy Partners' clean energy portfolio, growth visibility and flexibility to finance that growth offers LP unitholders a uniquely attractive investor value proposition. As with NextEra Energy, we remain intensely focused on continuing to execute and deliver that unitholder value over the coming years. 
Finally, I would like to take a moment to thank all of NextEra Energy's employees for their continued dedication, hard work and focus during the extraordinary circumstances of the past year. Despite the significant disruption caused by the pandemic and in the midst of the most active hurricane season in the Atlantic Basin on record, our employees' unwavering focus on our customers is what enabled yet another year of flawless execution in the business while also delivering our best-ever safety results across the company. It is because of their commitment to excellence that we were able to deliver above and beyond our commitments in 2020 and why I remain as confident as ever in our ability to deliver on all our expectations moving forward.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Rebecca, who will review the 2020 results in more detail."
270586,700922562,2181567,"NextEra Energy Partners, LP, NextEra Energy, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2021",2021-01-26,"Earnings Calls","NextEra Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone.Let's now turn to the detailed results beginning with FPL. For the fourth quarter of 2020, FPL reported net income of $502 million or $0.25 per share, up $0.05 per share year-over-year. For the full year 2020,",4294,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone.
Let's now turn to the detailed results beginning with FPL. For the fourth quarter of 2020, FPL reported net income of $502 million or $0.25 per share, up $0.05 per share year-over-year. For the full year 2020, FPL reported net income of $2.65 billion or $1.35 per share, an increase of $0.15 per share versus 2019.
Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 11% for 2020 and was the principal driver of FPL's net income growth of more than 13% for the year. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing its full year capital investments to a total of roughly $6.7 billion. FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes was 11.6% for the 12 months ended December 31, 2020, which is at the upper end of the allowed band of 9.6% to 11.6% under our current rate agreement.
During the fourth quarter, we utilized approximately $100 million of reserve amortization, leaving FPL with a year-end 2020 balance of $894 million. Approximately $206 million of reserve amortization was used to offset the restoration costs associated with Hurricanes Isaias and Tropical Storm Eta, which FPL elected not to recover from customers through a surcharge. FPL's reserve amortization mechanism under its current settlement agreement, combined with our aggressive cost-cutting measures and the benefits of tax reform, has provided significant customer benefits, including avoided surcharges for approximately $1.7 billion in storm restoration costs since 2017.
Our overall capital program at FPL is progressing well. We continue to advance one of the nation's largest-ever solar expansions. During the year, the Florida Public Service Commission approved FPL's SolarTogether program, which is the nation's largest community solar program that is expected to generate $249 million in total net cost savings for participating and nonparticipating customers over the program's life. After commissioning over 1,100 megawatts or more than 3.5x the amount of solar capacity in 2020 versus the prior year, FPL expects to commission roughly 670 megawatts of additional SolarTogether capacity in 2021. And the customer demand for this innovative program across all customer classes remains strong.
Beyond solar, construction of the highly efficient, roughly 1,200-megawatt Dania Beach Clean Energy Center remains on schedule and on budget as it continues to advance towards its projected commercial operations date in 2022. It should be noted that all of these significant accomplishments, including the deployment of nearly $7 billion in capital, were in the midst of not only a global pandemic, but also during the most active hurricane season in the Atlantic Basin on record. We've delivered our best-ever reliability results when our customers needed us the most. And we remain committed to supporting customers experiencing economic hardship as a result of the challenges caused by the pandemic. To date, FPL has provided customers with approximately $75 million in relief through various programs and initiatives. As Florida recovers, we will continue to help our customers navigate this difficult time while maintaining our best-in-class customer value proposition.
Let me now turn to Gulf Power, which, as a reminder, was legally merged into FPL on January 1, 2021, but will continue to be reported as a separate regulated segment during 2021. Gulf Power reported fourth quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $53 million or $0.03 per share, up $0.02 per share year-over-year. For the full year, Gulf Power reported net income of $238 million or $0.12 per share, an increase of $0.02 per share year-over-year on an adjusted basis. Base O&M reductions were the primary driver of Gulf Power's 19% year-over-year growth in adjusted earnings.
Gulf Power's reported ROE for regulatory purposes is expected to be approximately 11.1% for the 12 months ending December 2020, which is near the upper end of the allowed band of 9.25% to 11.25% under its current rate agreement. For the full year 2021, we expect the regulatory ROE to be in the upper half of this allowed band, assuming normal weather and operating conditions.
All of our major capital initiatives at Gulf Power are progressing well. Gulf Power's first solar development project, the roughly 75-megawatt Blue Indigo Solar Energy Center, went into service in 2020 and is expected to generate significant customer savings over its lifetime. Gulf Power anticipates bringing another 150 megawatts of cost-effective, zero-emission solar capacity online later this year.
The North Florida Resiliency Connection, which, among other things, will allow customers to benefit from greater diversity in solar output across 2 different time zones, is expected to be in service in mid-2022. Continued smart capital investments such as these renewables and core infrastructure are expected to drive customer benefits for many years to come.
The Florida economy continues to recover from the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. A number of current economic indicators, including retail taxable sales, new building permits and consumer confidence, have meaningfully improved since the start of the pandemic in early 2020. Additionally, Florida's most recent seasonally adjusted unemployment rate of 6.4% is below the national average. While it is unclear at this point how the economy will be impacted by the current wave of COVID-19 cases, we continue to believe that Florida offers a unique proposition in terms of housing affordability, great weather, low taxes and a pro-business economy, all of which should support ongoing FPL customer growth and economic rebound once the worst of the pandemic is behind us.
We remain deeply engaged in helping Florida return from this stronger than ever, and we will continue to do our part to support that outcome, including pursuing our smart capital investment program and economic development efforts, which help create jobs, provide investment in local communities and further enhance our best-in-class customer value proposition.
During the quarter, FPL's average customer growth was strong, increasing by nearly 76,000 from the comparable prior year quarter. FPL's fourth quarter retail sales were up 0.9% versus the prior year period, largely driven by a 2.3% year-over-year growth in underlying usage per customer. For 2020, FPL's retail sales increased 1.5% versus the prior year, driven primarily by ongoing strong growth in customers and a favorable weather comparison. On a weather-normalized basis, FPL's retail sales increased by 0.7% for the full year 2020. The overall impacts of the pandemic on last year's retail sales were relatively muted, and FPL's underlying usage per customer was flat year-over-year.
For Gulf Power, the average number of customers increased approximately 0.9% versus the comparable prior year quarter. For 2020, Gulf Power's retail sales declined 3.3%, primarily as a result of a more favorable weather in the prior year as well as lower usage per customer, which we attribute in part to the ongoing impacts of the pandemic on our commercial and industrial customers.
As Jim mentioned, FPL is preparing to file a base rate adjustment proposal that would cover the next 4 years, 2022 through 2025, and provide customers longer-term visibility to the future cost of electricity. While the details are still being finalized, we expect the proposal to include base rate adjustments of approximately $1.1 billion starting in January of 2022 and $615 million starting in January of 2023. We also expect the proposal to request support for continued deployment of cost-effective solar with the continuation of our solar base rate adjustment or SoBRA mechanism to recover the revenue requirements associated with up to 900 megawatts of cost-effective solar projects in each of 2024 and 2025, which we currently estimate to be approximately $140 million each year.
For the period 2019 through the end of 2022, FPL is planning to have invested approximately $29 billion, with additional significant investments expected in 2023 and beyond to meet the growing needs of Florida's economy and to continue delivering outstanding value for Florida customers by keeping reliability high and fuel and other costs low. While the benefits of building a stronger, smarter and cleaner grid, more efficient generation fleet are passed along regularly to customers through higher service reliability and lower bills. We must periodically seek recovery for these long-term investments supported by base rates.
As we've previously indicated, we plan to request the Commission to authorize unified rates and capital structure for both FPL and Gulf Power customers. We believe the combination of the 2 businesses will result in approximately $2.8 billion of savings for customers through both operational savings and overall system benefits.
FPL expects to request an 11.5% ROE, inclusive of a 50 basis point incentive for superior performance. Compared with peer utilities in the Southeastern U.S., FPL has the most efficient -- most cost-efficient operations, the highest reliability, the lowest customer bills, all while remaining one of the cleanest utilities in the country, and is widely regarded as the top overall performer in the industry, bringing exceptional value to customers. We believe that the performance adder would reflect FPL's current superior value proposition and encourage strong -- continued strong performance.
In addition, we continue to believe that a strong balance sheet, including strong credit ratings, remains critical to ensure FPL maintains uninterrupted access to the capital markets, even in times of significant market disruption in the aftermath of hurricanes as well as to attract capital to support the investments FPL is making to further improve the value we offer customers. The total of these base rate increase requests over the 4-year period from 2022 to 2025 would result in an estimated average increase in total revenues of about 3.7% per year.
Today, FPL's typical residential bill is about 30% lower than the national average. If the full amount of the requests were granted under our proposal and assuming other utilities experience bill increases only at their historical rate of increase, FPL's typical customer bills would remain significantly lower than the national average through 2025. To put this proposal in context, the proposal would result in a typical customer bill in January 2022 that is nearly 22% less than it was in real terms 15 years ago, even with our proposed base rate increases. Even in nominal terms, FPL bills would be only about 3.5% higher in 2022 than in 2006, a fraction of the nominal increases of 25% to 75% in the cost of groceries, medical care, health insurance and housing over the past 15 years.
Moreover, through the consolidation of FPL and Gulf Power, the typical 1,000 kilowatt hour residential customer bill in Northwest Florida is projected to be lower in 2025 than it was in 2019. We look forward to the opportunity to present the details of our case and expect to make our formal filing with testimony and required detailed data in March. The timing for the proceeding will ultimately be determined by the Commission, but we currently expect that we will have hearings in the third quarter and a final commission decision in the fourth quarter, in time for new rates to go into effect in January of 2022.
As always, we are open to the possibility of resolving our rate request through a fair settlement agreement. During the course of the past 22 years, FPL has entered into 6 multiyear settlement agreements that have provided customers with a high degree of rate stability and certainty and helped FPL execute to deliver its best-in-class customer value proposition. Our core focus will be to pursue a fair and objective review of our case that supports continued execution of our successful strategy for customers, and we will continue to provide updates throughout the process. 
Energy Resources reported fourth quarter 2020 GAAP loss of $644 million or $0.33 per share. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were $342 million or $0.17 per share. Energy Resources' contribution to adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter is flat versus the prior year comparable period as favorable results from the continued growth and performance in our renewables portfolio were roughly offset by a number of items, none of which are particularly noteworthy. For the full year, Energy Resources reported GAAP earnings of $531 million or $0.27 per share and adjusted earnings of $1.95 billion or $0.99 per share. 
Energy Resources full year adjusted earnings per share contribution increased $0.12 or approximately 14% versus 2019. For the full year, growth was driven by continued new additions to our renewables portfolio as contributions from new investments increased by $0.07 per share. Contributions from existing generation assets increased $0.03 versus 2019 due primarily to increased production tax credit volume from our repowered wind projects and an improvement in wind resource, which were partially offset by the planned nuclear outages and retirement of our Duane Arnold nuclear facility. Also contributing favorably was NextEra Energy Transmission, which increased results by $0.02 year-over-year, primarily as a result of full year contributions from Trans Bay Cable acquisition that closed in the middle of 2019. Contributions from all other impacts were flat year-over-year.
Amid the disruption of the pandemic, Energy Resources had one of its best years ever, including successfully executing on the largest construction program in our history as well as delivering our best year ever for origination, adding a net nearly 7,000 megawatts of new renewables projects to our backlog. In 2020, we commissioned approximately 5,750 megawatts of wind, solar and storage projects on schedule and on budget.
In addition, since the last call, we have added approximately 2,000 megawatts of renewables projects to our backlog, including approximately 1,030 megawatts of new wind and wind repowerings, 670 megawatts of solar and 300 megawatts of battery storage, including 75 additional megawatts of capacity on Desert Peak Storage, which is now expected to total 400 megawatts and remains the world's largest stand-alone storage project.
Following the terrific origination year in 2020, our renewables backlog now stands at approximately 13,500 megawatts. Despite a record year of megawatts placed in service, Energy Resources grew its year-end backlog by approximately 1,500 megawatts year-over-year, providing terrific visibility to the strong growth that lies ahead. Since 2017, our backlog additions have grown at a roughly 25% compound annual growth rate.
As a result of our tremendous progress in 2020 and our strong continued origination success, we are raising our 2021 to 2022 renewables development expectations to a range of 10,525 megawatts to 12,700 megawatts, which at the midpoint is approximately 3,500 megawatts above our previous expectations. Our expectations for 2021 and 2022 are now up more than 50% at the midpoint relative to the expectations that we laid out at the 2019 investor conference, reflecting the significant acceleration of renewables activity over the past 1.5 years. We are also introducing our 2023 to 2024 renewables development expectations of 12,150 megawatts to 17,300 megawatts. This is by far the largest expected 2-year development program in our history and reflects our high level of confidence in Energy Resources' ongoing leadership position in renewable energy development. The accompanying slide provides some additional details.
As we've previously discussed, we are optimistic about the expanded investment opportunities that the broad decarbonization of the U.S. economy presents for Energy Resources, and we are pursuing a number of pilot projects to rapidly develop our capabilities across this potential investment opportunity set. Today, we are announcing a new innovative green hydrogen project in Energy Resources that includes a 12-megawatt solar array, on-site hydrogen production and storage and a hydrogen fuel cell. This emissions-free project will utilize solar energy to create green hydrogen to power the fuel cell, which will be able to provide electricity to the local grid during periods of peak demand. Subject to final terms and regulatory approvals, this approximately $20 million innovative green hydrogen project is expected to begin construction in 2022 with commercial operations in mid-2023.
Energy Resources is also in advanced discussions with a number of potential customers across the industrial landscape, including food processing, specialty chemicals and refineries, to continue to develop clean energy solutions for more efficient green production processes. One potential project includes a solar tracker combined with an electrolyzer at a large industrial plant. The project would deliver green hydrogen as an industrial feedstock for the facility. And when not producing hydrogen, the solar power would offset a portion of the plant's energy consumption, further decarbonizing the facility's operations.
In addition, today, Energy Resources announced a planned partnership to pursue large school bus fleet conversions to electric and hydrogen with the nation's largest school bus owner and operator and transportation services provider. With its partner, Energy Resources anticipates investing in bus electrification upgrades and charging stations as well as providing energy management services. This transaction is consistent with our toe-in-the-water approach as we explore potential opportunities in the electrification of the transportation sector.
We are excited about all of these opportunities as well as the previously announced Hydrogen Pilot Project we plan to propose at FPL's Okeechobee Clean Energy Center, which highlight the significant opportunities that the broad decarbonization of the U.S. economy presents. Consistent with our long-term track record, NextEra Energy will remain disciplined as we take steps to be at the forefront of these developing markets while taking a leadership role in the clean energy transition.
Beyond renewables and storage, since the last earnings call, Mountain Valley Pipeline made progress with its outstanding permitting issues, including receiving the Bureau of Land Management right-of-way grant, which authorizes MVP to cross the Jefferson National Forest once the stream and wetland permitting is complete. While the Fourth Circuit denied a stay request on MVP's new biological opinion, the Court did grant a stay on the Nationwide 12 permit, and the project is now pursuing an alternate path forward to permit and complete stream and wetland crossings.
Due to these continued legal and regulatory issues as well as the substantial delays in commercial operation and increased costs associated with those delays, the carrying value for our investment in MVP now exceeds its fair market value. And as a result, we have reflected a $1.2 billion after-tax impairment in our GAAP financial statements, which we have excluded from adjusted earnings. While we are disappointed with the extended development and construction time line due to the legal challenges that the project has faced, we intend to continue pursuing completing the project with our partners.
Finally, during 2020, NextEra Energy Transmission furthered its efforts to grow America's leading competitive transmission company and had its best year ever. During the year, the business delivered a record earnings contribution and realized constructive rate case outcomes at Trans Bay Cable and Lone Star Transmission as well as entered into an agreement to acquire GridLiance, which owns 3 FERC-regulated transmission utilities spanning 6 states. We continue to expect to obtain all necessary regulatory approvals and close on the GridLiance acquisition in the first half of this year.
Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the fourth quarter of 2020, GAAP net losses attributable to NextEra Energy were $5 million or $0.00 per share. NextEra Energy's 2020 fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $785 million or $0.40 per share, respectively. For the full year 2020, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $2.92 billion or $1.48 per share. Adjusted earnings were $4.55 billion or $2.31 per share. As a reminder, all of our financial results have been adjusted to account for the 4-for-1 stock split, which became effective in the fourth quarter.
For the Corporate and Other segment, adjusted earnings for the full year decreased $0.07 per share compared to the 2019 prior comparable period, primarily as a result of higher interest and refinancing costs associated with certain liability management initiatives completed during the fourth quarter to take advantage of the low interest rate environment.
In total for NextEra Energy, our refinancing activities reduced nominal adjusted net income by roughly $103 million during the fourth quarter, inclusive of approximately $39 million associated with Energy Resources' share of refinancing cost at NextEra Energy Partners. We expect these initiatives to translate into favorable net income contributions in future years and an overall improvement in net present value for our shareholders.
Long-term financial expectations, which we increased and extended late last year through 2023, remain unchanged. For 2021, NextEra Energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.40 to $2.54. For 2022 and 2023, NextEra Energy expects to grow 6% to 8% off the expected 2021 adjusted earnings per share. And we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of these ranges. From 2018 to 2023, we continue to expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at a roughly 10% per year rate through at least 2022 off of a 2020 base. As always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions.
Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which also had a strong year of operational and financial performance in 2020. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $308 million and cash available for distribution was $106 million, an increase of 10% and 8% from the prior year period, respectively. EBITDA growth was driven primarily by favorable resource across the portfolio and the full contributions from new projects acquired in late 2019, and it was slightly offset by a planned outage at our Genesis project late in the fourth quarter.
For the full year 2020, adjusted EBITDA was $1.263 billion, up 14% year-over-year. Cash available for distribution was $570 million, an increase of 40% from the prior year. Similar to the quarterly results, full year growth in adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by full year contributions from acquisitions in the prior year and favorable wind resource. For the full year, wind resource was 100% of the long-term average versus 97% in 2019. The benefit to cash available for distribution from lower project-level debt service was partially offset by higher corporate level interest expense. As a reminder, these results include the impact of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide.
Yesterday, the NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.615 per common unit or $2.46 per unit on an annualized basis, up 15% from the comparable quarterly distribution a year earlier and at the top end of the range we discussed going into 2020.
During 2020, NextEra Energy Partners executed several financing to support its ongoing growth investments and optimize its capital structure for the benefit of LP unitholders. As Jim mentioned, during the quarter, we closed on an acquisition from Energy Resources of interest in an approximately 1,100 megawatt portfolio of long-term contracted renewables projects. As part of this transaction, NextEra Energy Partners raised a 10-year, approximately $1.1 billion convertible equity portfolio financing that includes the acquired assets plus 4 existing NextEra Energy Partners wind and solar projects.
Combining this acquisition with the recapitalization of 4 existing NextEra Energy Partners assets through the longest-dated and lowest-cost convertible equity portfolio financing in the partnership's history is expected to provide significant benefits for unitholders. By leveraging the strong demand for high-quality clean energy assets, NextEra Energy Partners was able to secure financing for both the current transaction and future growth while enhancing returns for LP unitholders and limiting downside risk.
NextEra Energy Partners expects to further strengthen its balance sheet and have access to approximately $2.4 billion in available financing capacity, including capacity under its corporate revolving credit facility and commitments from investors to potential future convertible equity portfolio financings, which further supports the partnership's long-term growth.
During the second half of the year, NextEra Energy Partners completed the successful conversion of approximately $300 million of convertible debt and the remaining balance of the convertible preferred securities that were issued in 2017 into approximately 5.7 million and 4.7 million units -- common units, respectively. These conversions helped NextEra Energy Partners achieve its goal of using low-cost financing products to efficiently issue equity over time.
Finally, NextEra Energy Partners raised approximately $600 million in new 0% coupon convertible notes during the quarter and used the net proceeds from this offering to redeem a portion of its outstanding 4.25% senior notes due in 2024. Coincident with the issuance of the convertible notes, NextEra Energy Partners entered into a capped call structure that will result in NextEra Energy Partners retaining up to 90% of the upside in its unit price associated with the convertible note over the next 5 years. 
NextEra Energy Partners run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA and CAFD at December 31, 2021, remain unchanged. Year-end 2021 run rate adjusted EBITDA expectations are $1.44 to $1.62 billion and CAFD in the range of $600 million to $680 million. As a reminder, all of our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated IDR fees as we treat these as an operating expense.
From an updated base of our fourth quarter 2020 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.46, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2021 distribution that is payable in February of 2022 to be in a range of $2.76 to $2.83 per common unit.
In summary, we continue to believe that both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners have excellent prospects for growth both in the near and longer term. FPL, Energy Resources and NextEra Energy Partners each have outstanding set of opportunities across the board. The progress we made in 2020 reinforces our longer-term growth prospects. And while we have a lot to execute on in 2021, we believe that we have the building blocks in place for another excellent year.
That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open up the line for your questions."

First, obviously, the project has taken longer and cost more than what we anticipated. And so the impairment is really related to reflecting not only that value that we have on our books, but really in relation to what we believe is the current fair valuation for the investment, given what we do still have to accomplish. And obviously, a lot changed in the fourth quarter, including the Nationwide 12 permit stay that I mentioned in the prepared remarks as well as the various things that have happened in January and against the backdrop of obvious changes, including the change in the administration, including the change in control of the Senate, which happened here in January.
So the impairment does reflect our view of what we still need to accomplish and the associated fair values related to the chances of being able to successfully execute on that. But this was an accounting exercise. It was a lot of due diligence that we needed to evaluate, and we think we've made the appropriate changes. But it does not change our commitment to work with our partners to put this project into service. So as I noted in the comments, we do have now a path that we're going to pursue in terms of the outstanding permitting. We'll work closely with our partners to pursue that path. But we thought it was appropriate and obviously took the actions that we did with respect to the impairment."

And that's just accelerated, in particular, over the last 24 months. I think what that means is it's changed a bit of our analytic framework of how we think about utility M&A. On the one hand, I continue to believe there's enormous value creation that we can bring to the table, and you only need to look at what we've been able to do with Gulf in the last 24.5 months to see how much value creation, bringing our playbook and our operating platform the Bay Area can create, right? So that is -- that, I think, remains clear. And if anything, it's clearer to me.
On the other, I think it's also clear that probably a sweet spot for us in terms of M&A is things in the less than $20 billion range that we can pay cash and finance through the normal course. And at that point, if you do that, you're not shifting the mix one way or another all that tremendously. And in our set of analytics, we're looking really more at how much value creation are we bringing to the table when we do this. And so for example, I think Santee Cooper is a great example of that. That's -- it's roughly $8 billion or $9 billion transaction and something that we can finance in the normal course in a place where we think we can create enormous value very quickly.
And so that's the kind of things that we're focused on. And -- but most importantly, we're focused on running the business and executing, staying financially disciplined as we always have been and executing against the terrific growth prospects we have in Energy Resources and then executing at FPL as we always have for the benefit of our customers and continuing and for the benefit of the state. So that, I think, is just a little bit of an overview of how our current status of our thinking on."

Secondly, the new expectations explicitly do not include any future build-own-transfer. How do you see that as incremental? And any heuristics you might offer as to how to think about value creation there?
And the third one on that, if I can just throw in there, is the attach rates on storage. It seems like the bulk of the storage that you're talking about in the future is probably tied to your solar assets. How do you think about stand-alone as being incremental to what you've talked about already? I'll leave it there."

Julien, thanks for the questions, and you may need to prompt me if I forgot one or more aspects of the multipart question. Let me start with C&I. As I highlighted in the prepared remarks, John and his team across Energy Resources have really cultivated a nice suite of opportunities with C&I customers. And if we look at our core base of other major investor-owned utilities, our munis and co-ops and our C&I business, other investor-owned utilities, munis and co-ops are still larger overall, but the opportunity set with C&I customers is definitely growing, not just in your standard PPA, but more in the suite of types of opportunities that I mentioned as one of the pilot projects that John and his team are pursuing, kind of a more holistic energy solution provider to these C&I customers.
And I think what's really changed over the last year plus, maybe it's even 2 years, is the inbound request to C&I has really expanded as they really start to look at their own carbon footprint, their own ESG messaging. How do they source energy to do their business and how do they source that from a cleaner energy solutions has become a higher topic of interest and higher priority for them and, therefore, a terrific opportunity set for us. So I think that's a growing opportunity for us that we continue to be really excited about.
In terms of build-own-transfers, we will continue to present our expectations, both our expectations and our signed contracts consistent in the way that we've shown it in the past, that there will be some build-own-transfer that Energy Resources pursues. If it is a strict, just sell the project to somebody else. We think there's a lot of value creation there, but we won't necessarily incorporate in our backlog for purposes of reporting, unless there is a long-term operation and maintenance or other stream of revenue to us that we benefit from. So we'll consistently report that. I think the opportunity set is there for both traditional build-own-transfers as well as build-own-transfers where we provide some incremental long-term value to our customers.
And then finally, storage, the opportunity set is terrific. Obviously, we've had tremendous success in attaching storage to new solar facilities, existing solar facilities and even some stand-alone storage projects. If there is a stand-alone storage incentive that Congress pursues, obviously, that would support near-term growth of stand-alone storage opportunities even beyond what we've seen, but the growth is terrific. And as we outlined back in 2019, we were surprised how fast the market evolved, and I think we continue to be really supportive of that overall market.
And one last thing I'll highlight, Julien, is really the innovative nature of the FPL team in working with the SolarTogether program to work with our commercial and industrial customers in Florida to support their needs to build the most cost-effective solar. And that's what the SolarTogether program offered them is the ability to really source clean energy solutions in the most profitable way for them and in a way that we structured the benefits both for those participating customers and nonparticipating customers to meet their needs.

So it's -- the offer is there, and we're ready to negotiate whenever the state is ready to get going. And so we stand ready and are hopeful that the legislature will move forward on that process. And we'll know more, obviously, over the next 90 days or so.
On NextEra Energy Transmission, I think Rebecca, in her prepared remarks, had just a terrific year last year, their best year ever as a company. Remember, we started that business from scratch a little over 10 years ago. And it's a business that made over $100 million in net income last year and we think has the ability to grow mid-teens, double-digit over the next several years just organically with what they have in front of them without doing any other acquisitions. And we are pursuing other acquisitions there because we think we add an enormous amount of value through our operating model, number one.
And then number two, probably the biggest inhibitor to renewables in this country is not consumer demand or it is not interest on the part of the federal government or state governments to get renewables built. It's not that customers don't want it. It is fundamentally broken processes with the ISOs in terms of how they manage their queues and transmission and just broadly transmission planning in this country. And I think with the Biden administration and a new FERC, there is a new opportunity to fix that. And our transmission business, I think, is a great example of what FERC Order 1000 can do when you get competition going in the transmission world. And it is also, I think, every bit of transmission we build in that business is incremental and helpful to the renewable business that we have and that it makes the delivery of lower-cost renewables even more fast to come on to the grid than they otherwise would. So I'm very excited about the transmission business. We're going to continue to push it, and I think it's got a lot of runway to grow."

There is not a regulated coal plant in this country that is economic today, full period, end of stop when it's dispatched on any basis, not a single one, okay? A",527,"So Michael, I think you're being kind, honestly, to the regulated coal fleet in this country. There is not a regulated coal plant in this country that is economic today, full period, end of stop when it's dispatched on any basis, not a single one, okay? And so why haven't it -- I think you've hit on the crux of some of the issues. Obviously, there have been, in certain states, a reluctance to let our utility customers retire the coal plant and then be able to recover their investment, right? And so, of course, if you run a utility, you don't want to retire an asset that you're going to then either have to write-off or not be able to earn on, right?
I think one of the things that has been really constructive and very smart about the Florida regulatory environment or the Commission's view on modernizing the generation fleet is that they have -- we've spread that capital recovery over a period of 5 or 10 years. And that has both, I think, moderated the impact to customer bills, on the one hand, and also on the other, given us the right incentive to do the right thing by our customers and bring on lower-cost generation.
So I think it's about -- the other piece, I think, that's going to change is there is no question, this administration through the EPA and other means is going to make the continued operation of coal plants very difficult in this country. And so there's going to be, I think, more pressure, more federal pressure to accelerate that transition away from coal than there has been, obviously, over the last 4 years, where there's been, in fact, the opposite of federal pressure, but the complete lack of federal pressure to do anything about with your coal fleet.
So I think the combination of that plus states becoming -- it becoming clearer and clearer the economics as we go along, that the operating cost of coal plants are higher than the new build cost of renewables with storage as that becomes even clearer as costs come down for renewables and costs continue to go up, operating costs continue to go up for coal. That's -- I mean the bottom line in Florida, we've shut our coal down, and we've saved customers literally billions of dollars of present value over the expected life of the new generation we put in place.
So there's an enormous opportunity. There are several states in the country that are not taking advantage of that opportunity because of some of the regulatory approaches. And honestly, I think with the new administration and some of the policies there, that's going to accelerate the replacement of coal in this country. And it should be because there's no -- it's costing customers money. Leave aside the environmental benefits, just on pure economics that's costing customers' money every day, and that's bad for the country and let alone that it's terrible for the climate, it is -- and for the environment, it is bad for customers because economics are -- the coal economics are so out of whack."

NextEra Energy performance was strong both financially and operationally. We had outstanding execution on our initiatives to continue to drive future growth across the company.
Across all of our businesses, we successfully executed on the largest capital program in our history, deploying more than $14 billion in 2020 as we lead America's clean energy transformation. By successfully executing on our plans, NextEra Energy extended its long track record of delivering value for shareholders with adjusted earnings per share of $2.31, up 10.5% from 2019.
A key element of our value proposition in NextEra Energy is a culture focused on delivering outstanding results for our shareholders. Over the past 10 years, we've delivered compound annual growth and adjusted EPS of 8%, which is the highest among all top 10 power companies who have achieved, on average, compound annual growth of less than 3% over the same period. Amid this significant growth, the company has maintained one of the strongest balance sheets and credit positions in the industry.
In 2020, we delivered a total shareholder return of approximately 30%, significantly outperforming both the S&P 500 and the S&P 500 Utilities Index, and continuing to outperform both indices in terms of total shareholder return on a 1-year, 3-year, 5-year, 7-year and 10-year basis. Over the past 15 years, we've outperformed all of the other companies in the S&P 500 Utilities Index and 86% of the companies in the S&P 500 while more than tripling the average total shareholder return of both indices. While we are proud of our long-term track record of creating shareholder value, we remain laser-focused on the future and on delivering our commitments.
NextEra Energy remains well positioned to capitalize on the disruptive forces reshaping our industry, which have expanded and accelerated over the past 2 years, even beyond what we had anticipated. The combination of low-cost renewables with low-cost storage in the form of batteries today and hydrogen in the longer term has substantially increased the total addressable market for NextEra Energy. We now believe that a substantial and economic decarbonization of the electricity, transportation and industrial sectors is possible, which represents a potential investment opportunity of trillions of dollars in the coming decades.
In the electricity sector, we expect that older and more inefficient generation will continue to be retired and replaced with cleaner and more affordable alternatives. In the transportation sector, we believe it will be increasingly economic to replace fossil fuel vehicles with vehicles powered by fuel cells and batteries charged with renewable energy. And in the industrial sector, gray hydrogen and other high-carbon feedstocks can be replaced with green hydrogen. We believe these trends have already been put into motion driven by economics. In addition, we believe it is possible that the Biden administration, supported by a significant shift in public support towards taking action to address climate change, may act to further accelerate these shifts through the extension of existing incentives as well as initiating other forms of policy support.
Importantly, we believe that no company is better equipped to take advantage of these substantial and long-term trends than NextEra Energy. In fact, NextEra Energy is already proof that you can be clean, low-cost and financially successful all at the same time. We are at the vanguard of building a sustainable energy era that is both clean and affordable, and we are driving hard to continue to be at the forefront of the disruption that is occurring within the energy sector and broader parts of the U.S. economy.
We expect that the execution of our strategy will drive meaningful CO2 emissions reductions across the country and will help advance NextEra Energy towards its goal of reducing its CO2 emissions rate by 67% by 2025 from a 2005 baseline, while simultaneously lowering generation cost for customers and maintaining best-in-class reliability. We expect the disruptive nature of renewables to be terrific for customers, terrific for the environment and terrific for shareholders by helping to drive tremendous growth for this company over the next decade and beyond.
FPL is already capitalizing on the disruption in our sector with continued focus on its grid and fleet modernization efforts. During 2020, FPL successfully executed on its strategic initiatives, including placing more than 1,100 megawatts of cost-effective solar in service on time and on budget in support of its ongoing capital plan. This solar expansion is part of FPL's SolarTogether community solar program and its groundbreaking 30-by-30 plan, which is one of the world's largest solar expansions and would result in roughly 10,000 megawatts of total solar capacity on FPL's system by 2030.
Additionally, the 409-megawatt Manatee Energy Storage Center, which will be the world's largest integrated solar-powered battery system, is on track and on budget to be placed in service later this year as part of the approximately $1 billion that NextEra Energy is investing in battery storage projects in 2021. Smart capital investments such as these help FPL improve its already best-in-class customer value proposition while also maintaining an emissions profile that is among the cleanest in the nation. 
FPL also had continued success with its cost-saving initiatives, making even further reductions to its already best-in-class dollar per retail megawatt-hour nonfuel O&M costs from 2019 to 2020. Through our unrelenting focus on cost savings and on making disciplined long-term investments for the benefit of our customers, FPL has been able to maintain typical customer bills that are the lowest in the nation when compared to the 20 largest investor-owned utilities in the country.
In addition to low bills, FPL has continued to provide reliability that is by far the best in the state of Florida, achieving its best-ever reliability rate in 2020. FPL's investments to build a stronger, smarter energy grid have resulted in best-in-state reliability for the last 14 years in a row as well as earning numerous national awards. In 2020, FPL was recognized for the fifth time in 6 years as being the most reliable electric utility in the nation.
Let me now turn to Gulf Power. In the 2 years that it has been part of the NextEra Energy family, Gulf Power has realized an approximately 30% reduction in O&M costs, a 50% improvement in service reliability, a 93% improvement in safety and a nearly 20% reduction in CO2 emissions. Gulf Power has grown regulatory capital employed at a 17% compound annual growth rate since 2018, and we are well on our way to achieving the objectives we laid out at our investor conference in 2019.
In addition to the excellent operational execution that we delivered in 2020, we continued to progress our smart capital investment program that is expected to generate further customer benefits over the coming years. In the fourth quarter, we completed the Plant Crist coal-to-natural gas conversion. As a result, consistent with our commitment to remain a clean energy leader, we were able to complete the accelerated shutdown of the coal units at Plant Crist, which has now been renamed the Gulf Clean Energy Center.
With the retirement of FPL's Indiantown Cogeneration facility also occurring late last year, 2021 is the first time in nearly 70 years that there are no coal-fired power plants in Florida for either FPL or Gulf Power. Earlier this month, FPL filed a test year letter with the Florida Public Service Commission to initiate a rate proceeding for new rates beginning in January 2022. The 4-year plan that we intend to propose is designed to provide continued longer-term cost certainty for customers while allowing FPL to continue investing in clean energy, storm-hardened infrastructure and other innovative technologies that are the foundation of our communities.
The stability of multiyear rate plans allows FPL to focus on efficiency in the business, which is critical to keeping customer bills low while, at the same time, enabling FPL to maintain strong credit ratings and balance sheet, which allows for consistent access to the capital markets. We look forward to the opportunity to showcase our long-term track record of providing low bills, high reliability and clean energy for Floridans and plans -- and our plans to build an even more resilient and sustainable energy future for Florida in the coming years.
Turning to Energy Resources. In 2020, we continued to advance our position as the leading developer and operator of wind, solar and battery storage projects, commissioning approximately 5,750 megawatts of new projects, more than doubling the amount of total renewables commissioned versus the previous year. This was also a record year for renewables origination in Energy Resources with the team adding a net nearly 7,000 megawatts to our backlog during the year.
As a result of the team's origination success and alongside the backdrop of the terrific market outlook I just outlined at the beginning of my remarks, we now expect to construct approximately 23 to 30 gigawatts of new renewables in the 2021 to 2024 time frame, which, if we are successful at the midpoint, would mean adding a portfolio of generation projects that is approximately 1.5x the size of Energy Resources' entire operating renewables portfolio as of year-end 2019.
Energy Resources' execution success is reflective of our ability to leverage our significant competitive advantages, including our best-in-class development skills, large pipeline of sites and interconnection queue positions, strong customer relationships, purchasing power, best-in-class construction expertise, resource assessment capabilities, cost of capital advantages and world-class operations capability to capitalize on the ongoing energy transition that is occurring in the nation's generation fleet. We believe that we are in a terrific position to be able to capture a significant share of the market opportunities going forward and what we continue to believe is the best renewables development environment we have ever seen.
Along with the broader public shift towards calls for action to fight climate change, over the past few years, there's been an increased focus on environmental, social and governance, or ESG, on the part of many of our stakeholders. While we expect this trend to amplify demand among our traditional customers and in our core renewables business, we also believe it is opening up significant new markets and business opportunities for Energy Resources. We anticipate our development program to be further enhanced by an ability to attract new nontraditional customers, particularly in the commercial and industrial sector, as improving renewable economics are increasingly aligned with corporate objectives to procure energy from clean generation sources.
In summary, I continue to remain as enthusiastic as ever about NextEra Energy's long-term growth prospects. In 2020, we extended our long track record of executing for the benefit of customers and shareholders and further developed our best-in-class organic growth prospects. Based on the strength and resiliency of our underlying businesses, I will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectation ranges in 2021, 2022 and 2023, while at the same time, maintaining our strong credit ratings. We remain intensely focused on execution and continuing to drive shareholder value over the coming years.
Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which delivered a total unit return -- unitholder return of approximately 32% in 2020, further advancing its history of value creation since the IPO. NextEra Energy Partners is uniquely positioned to take advantage of the disruptive factors reshaping the energy industry and benefit from the enormous market opportunity in the coming decades for renewables. 
NextEra Energy Partners also had a terrific year of execution in 2020 and continue to deliver on its commitments. That history of execution is supported by NextEra Energy Partners' outstanding portfolio of clean energy assets, which was further diversified in 2020. During the year, NextEra Energy Partners acquired interests in approximately 1,100 megawatts of high-quality renewable energy assets, including the partnership's first battery storage project from Energy Resources.
Additionally, during the year, NextEra Energy Partners successfully completed its first 3 organic growth prospects, including the repowering of 275 megawatts of wind projects. For 2020, NextEra Energy Partners grew its LP distributions by 15% year-over-year and delivered 40% year-over-year cash available for distribution growth, highlighting the strength of its operating portfolio. With this strong year-over-year growth in cash available for distribution, NextEra Energy Partners achieved its distribution growth objectives while maintaining a trailing 12-month payout ratio in the high 60% range as of year-end 2020.
In the fourth quarter, we published our first NextEra Energy Partners ESG report, highlighting its high-quality clean energy portfolio, visible opportunities for renewables growth and ability to leverage the operational expertise of NextEra Energy Resources. The continued origination success at Energy Resources is expected to benefit NextEra Energy Partners in meeting its future growth objectives. I continue to believe that the combination of NextEra Energy Partners' clean energy portfolio, growth visibility and flexibility to finance that growth offers LP unitholders a uniquely attractive investor value proposition. As with NextEra Energy, we remain intensely focused on continuing to execute and deliver that unitholder value over the coming years. 
Finally, I would like to take a moment to thank all of NextEra Energy's employees for their continued dedication, hard work and focus during the extraordinary circumstances of the past year. Despite the significant disruption caused by the pandemic and in the midst of the most active hurricane season in the Atlantic Basin on record, our employees' unwavering focus on our customers is what enabled yet another year of flawless execution in the business while also delivering our best-ever safety results across the company. It is because of their commitment to excellence that we were able to deliver above and beyond our commitments in 2020 and why I remain as confident as ever in our ability to deliver on all our expectations moving forward.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Rebecca, who will review the 2020 results in more detail."

Let's now turn to the detailed results beginning with FPL. For the fourth quarter of 2020, FPL reported net income of $502 million or $0.25 per share, up $0.05 per share year-over-year. For the full year 2020, FPL reported net income of $2.65 billion or $1.35 per share, an increase of $0.15 per share versus 2019.
Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 11% for 2020 and was the principal driver of FPL's net income growth of more than 13% for the year. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing its full year capital investments to a total of roughly $6.7 billion. FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes was 11.6% for the 12 months ended December 31, 2020, which is at the upper end of the allowed band of 9.6% to 11.6% under our current rate agreement.
During the fourth quarter, we utilized approximately $100 million of reserve amortization, leaving FPL with a year-end 2020 balance of $894 million. Approximately $206 million of reserve amortization was used to offset the restoration costs associated with Hurricanes Isaias and Tropical Storm Eta, which FPL elected not to recover from customers through a surcharge. FPL's reserve amortization mechanism under its current settlement agreement, combined with our aggressive cost-cutting measures and the benefits of tax reform, has provided significant customer benefits, including avoided surcharges for approximately $1.7 billion in storm restoration costs since 2017.
Our overall capital program at FPL is progressing well. We continue to advance one of the nation's largest-ever solar expansions. During the year, the Florida Public Service Commission approved FPL's SolarTogether program, which is the nation's largest community solar program that is expected to generate $249 million in total net cost savings for participating and nonparticipating customers over the program's life. After commissioning over 1,100 megawatts or more than 3.5x the amount of solar capacity in 2020 versus the prior year, FPL expects to commission roughly 670 megawatts of additional SolarTogether capacity in 2021. And the customer demand for this innovative program across all customer classes remains strong.
Beyond solar, construction of the highly efficient, roughly 1,200-megawatt Dania Beach Clean Energy Center remains on schedule and on budget as it continues to advance towards its projected commercial operations date in 2022. It should be noted that all of these significant accomplishments, including the deployment of nearly $7 billion in capital, were in the midst of not only a global pandemic, but also during the most active hurricane season in the Atlantic Basin on record. We've delivered our best-ever reliability results when our customers needed us the most. And we remain committed to supporting customers experiencing economic hardship as a result of the challenges caused by the pandemic. To date, FPL has provided customers with approximately $75 million in relief through various programs and initiatives. As Florida recovers, we will continue to help our customers navigate this difficult time while maintaining our best-in-class customer value proposition.
Let me now turn to Gulf Power, which, as a reminder, was legally merged into FPL on January 1, 2021, but will continue to be reported as a separate regulated segment during 2021. Gulf Power reported fourth quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $53 million or $0.03 per share, up $0.02 per share year-over-year. For the full year, Gulf Power reported net income of $238 million or $0.12 per share, an increase of $0.02 per share year-over-year on an adjusted basis. Base O&M reductions were the primary driver of Gulf Power's 19% year-over-year growth in adjusted earnings.
Gulf Power's reported ROE for regulatory purposes is expected to be approximately 11.1% for the 12 months ending December 2020, which is near the upper end of the allowed band of 9.25% to 11.25% under its current rate agreement. For the full year 2021, we expect the regulatory ROE to be in the upper half of this allowed band, assuming normal weather and operating conditions.
All of our major capital initiatives at Gulf Power are progressing well. Gulf Power's first solar development project, the roughly 75-megawatt Blue Indigo Solar Energy Center, went into service in 2020 and is expected to generate significant customer savings over its lifetime. Gulf Power anticipates bringing another 150 megawatts of cost-effective, zero-emission solar capacity online later this year.
The North Florida Resiliency Connection, which, among other things, will allow customers to benefit from greater diversity in solar output across 2 different time zones, is expected to be in service in mid-2022. Continued smart capital investments such as these renewables and core infrastructure are expected to drive customer benefits for many years to come.
The Florida economy continues to recover from the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. A number of current economic indicators, including retail taxable sales, new building permits and consumer confidence, have meaningfully improved since the start of the pandemic in early 2020. Additionally, Florida's most recent seasonally adjusted unemployment rate of 6.4% is below the national average. While it is unclear at this point how the economy will be impacted by the current wave of COVID-19 cases, we continue to believe that Florida offers a unique proposition in terms of housing affordability, great weather, low taxes and a pro-business economy, all of which should support ongoing FPL customer growth and economic rebound once the worst of the pandemic is behind us.
We remain deeply engaged in helping Florida return from this stronger than ever, and we will continue to do our part to support that outcome, including pursuing our smart capital investment program and economic development efforts, which help create jobs, provide investment in local communities and further enhance our best-in-class customer value proposition.
During the quarter, FPL's average customer growth was strong, increasing by nearly 76,000 from the comparable prior year quarter. FPL's fourth quarter retail sales were up 0.9% versus the prior year period, largely driven by a 2.3% year-over-year growth in underlying usage per customer. For 2020, FPL's retail sales increased 1.5% versus the prior year, driven primarily by ongoing strong growth in customers and a favorable weather comparison. On a weather-normalized basis, FPL's retail sales increased by 0.7% for the full year 2020. The overall impacts of the pandemic on last year's retail sales were relatively muted, and FPL's underlying usage per customer was flat year-over-year.
For Gulf Power, the average number of customers increased approximately 0.9% versus the comparable prior year quarter. For 2020, Gulf Power's retail sales declined 3.3%, primarily as a result of a more favorable weather in the prior year as well as lower usage per customer, which we attribute in part to the ongoing impacts of the pandemic on our commercial and industrial customers.
As Jim mentioned, FPL is preparing to file a base rate adjustment proposal that would cover the next 4 years, 2022 through 2025, and provide customers longer-term visibility to the future cost of electricity. While the details are still being finalized, we expect the proposal to include base rate adjustments of approximately $1.1 billion starting in January of 2022 and $615 million starting in January of 2023. We also expect the proposal to request support for continued deployment of cost-effective solar with the continuation of our solar base rate adjustment or SoBRA mechanism to recover the revenue requirements associated with up to 900 megawatts of cost-effective solar projects in each of 2024 and 2025, which we currently estimate to be approximately $140 million each year.
For the period 2019 through the end of 2022, FPL is planning to have invested approximately $29 billion, with additional significant investments expected in 2023 and beyond to meet the growing needs of Florida's economy and to continue delivering outstanding value for Florida customers by keeping reliability high and fuel and other costs low. While the benefits of building a stronger, smarter and cleaner grid, more efficient generation fleet are passed along regularly to customers through higher service reliability and lower bills. We must periodically seek recovery for these long-term investments supported by base rates.
As we've previously indicated, we plan to request the Commission to authorize unified rates and capital structure for both FPL and Gulf Power customers. We believe the combination of the 2 businesses will result in approximately $2.8 billion of savings for customers through both operational savings and overall system benefits.
FPL expects to request an 11.5% ROE, inclusive of a 50 basis point incentive for superior performance. Compared with peer utilities in the Southeastern U.S., FPL has the most efficient -- most cost-efficient operations, the highest reliability, the lowest customer bills, all while remaining one of the cleanest utilities in the country, and is widely regarded as the top overall performer in the industry, bringing exceptional value to customers. We believe that the performance adder would reflect FPL's current superior value proposition and encourage strong -- continued strong performance.
In addition, we continue to believe that a strong balance sheet, including strong credit ratings, remains critical to ensure FPL maintains uninterrupted access to the capital markets, even in times of significant market disruption in the aftermath of hurricanes as well as to attract capital to support the investments FPL is making to further improve the value we offer customers. The total of these base rate increase requests over the 4-year period from 2022 to 2025 would result in an estimated average increase in total revenues of about 3.7% per year.
Today, FPL's typical residential bill is about 30% lower than the national average. If the full amount of the requests were granted under our proposal and assuming other utilities experience bill increases only at their historical rate of increase, FPL's typical customer bills would remain significantly lower than the national average through 2025. To put this proposal in context, the proposal would result in a typical customer bill in January 2022 that is nearly 22% less than it was in real terms 15 years ago, even with our proposed base rate increases. Even in nominal terms, FPL bills would be only about 3.5% higher in 2022 than in 2006, a fraction of the nominal increases of 25% to 75% in the cost of groceries, medical care, health insurance and housing over the past 15 years.
Moreover, through the consolidation of FPL and Gulf Power, the typical 1,000 kilowatt hour residential customer bill in Northwest Florida is projected to be lower in 2025 than it was in 2019. We look forward to the opportunity to present the details of our case and expect to make our formal filing with testimony and required detailed data in March. The timing for the proceeding will ultimately be determined by the Commission, but we currently expect that we will have hearings in the third quarter and a final commission decision in the fourth quarter, in time for new rates to go into effect in January of 2022.
As always, we are open to the possibility of resolving our rate request through a fair settlement agreement. During the course of the past 22 years, FPL has entered into 6 multiyear settlement agreements that have provided customers with a high degree of rate stability and certainty and helped FPL execute to deliver its best-in-class customer value proposition. Our core focus will be to pursue a fair and objective review of our case that supports continued execution of our successful strategy for customers, and we will continue to provide updates throughout the process. 
Energy Resources reported fourth quarter 2020 GAAP loss of $644 million or $0.33 per share. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were $342 million or $0.17 per share. Energy Resources' contribution to adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter is flat versus the prior year comparable period as favorable results from the continued growth and performance in our renewables portfolio were roughly offset by a number of items, none of which are particularly noteworthy. For the full year, Energy Resources reported GAAP earnings of $531 million or $0.27 per share and adjusted earnings of $1.95 billion or $0.99 per share. 
Energy Resources full year adjusted earnings per share contribution increased $0.12 or approximately 14% versus 2019. For the full year, growth was driven by continued new additions to our renewables portfolio as contributions from new investments increased by $0.07 per share. Contributions from existing generation assets increased $0.03 versus 2019 due primarily to increased production tax credit volume from our repowered wind projects and an improvement in wind resource, which were partially offset by the planned nuclear outages and retirement of our Duane Arnold nuclear facility. Also contributing favorably was NextEra Energy Transmission, which increased results by $0.02 year-over-year, primarily as a result of full year contributions from Trans Bay Cable acquisition that closed in the middle of 2019. Contributions from all other impacts were flat year-over-year.
Amid the disruption of the pandemic, Energy Resources had one of its best years ever, including successfully executing on the largest construction program in our history as well as delivering our best year ever for origination, adding a net nearly 7,000 megawatts of new renewables projects to our backlog. In 2020, we commissioned approximately 5,750 megawatts of wind, solar and storage projects on schedule and on budget.
In addition, since the last call, we have added approximately 2,000 megawatts of renewables projects to our backlog, including approximately 1,030 megawatts of new wind and wind repowerings, 670 megawatts of solar and 300 megawatts of battery storage, including 75 additional megawatts of capacity on Desert Peak Storage, which is now expected to total 400 megawatts and remains the world's largest stand-alone storage project.
Following the terrific origination year in 2020, our renewables backlog now stands at approximately 13,500 megawatts. Despite a record year of megawatts placed in service, Energy Resources grew its year-end backlog by approximately 1,500 megawatts year-over-year, providing terrific visibility to the strong growth that lies ahead. Since 2017, our backlog additions have grown at a roughly 25% compound annual growth rate.
As a result of our tremendous progress in 2020 and our strong continued origination success, we are raising our 2021 to 2022 renewables development expectations to a range of 10,525 megawatts to 12,700 megawatts, which at the midpoint is approximately 3,500 megawatts above our previous expectations. Our expectations for 2021 and 2022 are now up more than 50% at the midpoint relative to the expectations that we laid out at the 2019 investor conference, reflecting the significant acceleration of renewables activity over the past 1.5 years. We are also introducing our 2023 to 2024 renewables development expectations of 12,150 megawatts to 17,300 megawatts. This is by far the largest expected 2-year development program in our history and reflects our high level of confidence in Energy Resources' ongoing leadership position in renewable energy development. The accompanying slide provides some additional details.
As we've previously discussed, we are optimistic about the expanded investment opportunities that the broad decarbonization of the U.S. economy presents for Energy Resources, and we are pursuing a number of pilot projects to rapidly develop our capabilities across this potential investment opportunity set. Today, we are announcing a new innovative green hydrogen project in Energy Resources that includes a 12-megawatt solar array, on-site hydrogen production and storage and a hydrogen fuel cell. This emissions-free project will utilize solar energy to create green hydrogen to power the fuel cell, which will be able to provide electricity to the local grid during periods of peak demand. Subject to final terms and regulatory approvals, this approximately $20 million innovative green hydrogen project is expected to begin construction in 2022 with commercial operations in mid-2023.
Energy Resources is also in advanced discussions with a number of potential customers across the industrial landscape, including food processing, specialty chemicals and refineries, to continue to develop clean energy solutions for more efficient green production processes. One potential project includes a solar tracker combined with an electrolyzer at a large industrial plant. The project would deliver green hydrogen as an industrial feedstock for the facility. And when not producing hydrogen, the solar power would offset a portion of the plant's energy consumption, further decarbonizing the facility's operations.
In addition, today, Energy Resources announced a planned partnership to pursue large school bus fleet conversions to electric and hydrogen with the nation's largest school bus owner and operator and transportation services provider. With its partner, Energy Resources anticipates investing in bus electrification upgrades and charging stations as well as providing energy management services. This transaction is consistent with our toe-in-the-water approach as we explore potential opportunities in the electrification of the transportation sector.
We are excited about all of these opportunities as well as the previously announced Hydrogen Pilot Project we plan to propose at FPL's Okeechobee Clean Energy Center, which highlight the significant opportunities that the broad decarbonization of the U.S. economy presents. Consistent with our long-term track record, NextEra Energy will remain disciplined as we take steps to be at the forefront of these developing markets while taking a leadership role in the clean energy transition.
Beyond renewables and storage, since the last earnings call, Mountain Valley Pipeline made progress with its outstanding permitting issues, including receiving the Bureau of Land Management right-of-way grant, which authorizes MVP to cross the Jefferson National Forest once the stream and wetland permitting is complete. While the Fourth Circuit denied a stay request on MVP's new biological opinion, the Court did grant a stay on the Nationwide 12 permit, and the project is now pursuing an alternate path forward to permit and complete stream and wetland crossings.
Due to these continued legal and regulatory issues as well as the substantial delays in commercial operation and increased costs associated with those delays, the carrying value for our investment in MVP now exceeds its fair market value. And as a result, we have reflected a $1.2 billion after-tax impairment in our GAAP financial statements, which we have excluded from adjusted earnings. While we are disappointed with the extended development and construction time line due to the legal challenges that the project has faced, we intend to continue pursuing completing the project with our partners.
Finally, during 2020, NextEra Energy Transmission furthered its efforts to grow America's leading competitive transmission company and had its best year ever. During the year, the business delivered a record earnings contribution and realized constructive rate case outcomes at Trans Bay Cable and Lone Star Transmission as well as entered into an agreement to acquire GridLiance, which owns 3 FERC-regulated transmission utilities spanning 6 states. We continue to expect to obtain all necessary regulatory approvals and close on the GridLiance acquisition in the first half of this year.
Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the fourth quarter of 2020, GAAP net losses attributable to NextEra Energy were $5 million or $0.00 per share. NextEra Energy's 2020 fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $785 million or $0.40 per share, respectively. For the full year 2020, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $2.92 billion or $1.48 per share. Adjusted earnings were $4.55 billion or $2.31 per share. As a reminder, all of our financial results have been adjusted to account for the 4-for-1 stock split, which became effective in the fourth quarter.
For the Corporate and Other segment, adjusted earnings for the full year decreased $0.07 per share compared to the 2019 prior comparable period, primarily as a result of higher interest and refinancing costs associated with certain liability management initiatives completed during the fourth quarter to take advantage of the low interest rate environment.
In total for NextEra Energy, our refinancing activities reduced nominal adjusted net income by roughly $103 million during the fourth quarter, inclusive of approximately $39 million associated with Energy Resources' share of refinancing cost at NextEra Energy Partners. We expect these initiatives to translate into favorable net income contributions in future years and an overall improvement in net present value for our shareholders.
Long-term financial expectations, which we increased and extended late last year through 2023, remain unchanged. For 2021, NextEra Energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.40 to $2.54. For 2022 and 2023, NextEra Energy expects to grow 6% to 8% off the expected 2021 adjusted earnings per share. And we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of these ranges. From 2018 to 2023, we continue to expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at a roughly 10% per year rate through at least 2022 off of a 2020 base. As always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions.
Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which also had a strong year of operational and financial performance in 2020. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $308 million and cash available for distribution was $106 million, an increase of 10% and 8% from the prior year period, respectively. EBITDA growth was driven primarily by favorable resource across the portfolio and the full contributions from new projects acquired in late 2019, and it was slightly offset by a planned outage at our Genesis project late in the fourth quarter.
For the full year 2020, adjusted EBITDA was $1.263 billion, up 14% year-over-year. Cash available for distribution was $570 million, an increase of 40% from the prior year. Similar to the quarterly results, full year growth in adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by full year contributions from acquisitions in the prior year and favorable wind resource. For the full year, wind resource was 100% of the long-term average versus 97% in 2019. The benefit to cash available for distribution from lower project-level debt service was partially offset by higher corporate level interest expense. As a reminder, these results include the impact of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide.
Yesterday, the NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.615 per common unit or $2.46 per unit on an annualized basis, up 15% from the comparable quarterly distribution a year earlier and at the top end of the range we discussed going into 2020.
During 2020, NextEra Energy Partners executed several financing to support its ongoing growth investments and optimize its capital structure for the benefit of LP unitholders. As Jim mentioned, during the quarter, we closed on an acquisition from Energy Resources of interest in an approximately 1,100 megawatt portfolio of long-term contracted renewables projects. As part of this transaction, NextEra Energy Partners raised a 10-year, approximately $1.1 billion convertible equity portfolio financing that includes the acquired assets plus 4 existing NextEra Energy Partners wind and solar projects.
Combining this acquisition with the recapitalization of 4 existing NextEra Energy Partners assets through the longest-dated and lowest-cost convertible equity portfolio financing in the partnership's history is expected to provide significant benefits for unitholders. By leveraging the strong demand for high-quality clean energy assets, NextEra Energy Partners was able to secure financing for both the current transaction and future growth while enhancing returns for LP unitholders and limiting downside risk.
NextEra Energy Partners expects to further strengthen its balance sheet and have access to approximately $2.4 billion in available financing capacity, including capacity under its corporate revolving credit facility and commitments from investors to potential future convertible equity portfolio financings, which further supports the partnership's long-term growth.
During the second half of the year, NextEra Energy Partners completed the successful conversion of approximately $300 million of convertible debt and the remaining balance of the convertible preferred securities that were issued in 2017 into approximately 5.7 million and 4.7 million units -- common units, respectively. These conversions helped NextEra Energy Partners achieve its goal of using low-cost financing products to efficiently issue equity over time.
Finally, NextEra Energy Partners raised approximately $600 million in new 0% coupon convertible notes during the quarter and used the net proceeds from this offering to redeem a portion of its outstanding 4.25% senior notes due in 2024. Coincident with the issuance of the convertible notes, NextEra Energy Partners entered into a capped call structure that will result in NextEra Energy Partners retaining up to 90% of the upside in its unit price associated with the convertible note over the next 5 years. 
NextEra Energy Partners run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA and CAFD at December 31, 2021, remain unchanged. Year-end 2021 run rate adjusted EBITDA expectations are $1.44 to $1.62 billion and CAFD in the range of $600 million to $680 million. As a reminder, all of our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated IDR fees as we treat these as an operating expense.
From an updated base of our fourth quarter 2020 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.46, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2021 distribution that is payable in February of 2022 to be in a range of $2.76 to $2.83 per common unit.
In summary, we continue to believe that both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners have excellent prospects for growth both in the near and longer term. FPL, Energy Resources and NextEra Energy Partners each have outstanding set of opportunities across the board. The progress we made in 2020 reinforces our longer-term growth prospects. And while we have a lot to execute on in 2021, we believe that we have the building blocks in place for another excellent year.
That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open up the line for your questions."

First, obviously, the project has taken longer and cost more than what we anticipated. And so the impairment is really related to reflecting not only that value that we have on our books, but really in relation to what we believe is the current fair valuation for the investment, given what we do still have to accomplish. And obviously, a lot changed in the fourth quarter, including the Nationwide 12 permit stay that I mentioned in the prepared remarks as well as the various things that have happened in January and against the backdrop of obvious changes, including the change in the administration, including the change in control of the Senate, which happened here in January.
So the impairment does reflect our view of what we still need to accomplish and the associated fair values related to the chances of being able to successfully execute on that. But this was an accounting exercise. It was a lot of due diligence that we needed to evaluate, and we think we've made the appropriate changes. But it does not change our commitment to work with our partners to put this project into service. So as I noted in the comments, we do have now a path that we're going to pursue in terms of the outstanding permitting. We'll work closely with our partners to pursue that path. But we thought it was appropriate and obviously took the actions that we did with respect to the impairment."

On the other, I think it's also clear that probably a sweet spot for us in terms of M&A is things in the less than $20 billion range that we can pay cash and finance through the normal course. And at that point, if you do that, you're not shifting the mix one way or another all that tremendously. And in our set of analytics, we're looking really more at how much value creation are we bringing to the table when we do this. And so for example, I think Santee Cooper is a great example of that. That's -- it's roughly $8 billion or $9 billion transaction and something that we can finance in the normal course in a place where we think we can create enormous value very quickly.
And so that's the kind of things that we're focused on. And -- but most importantly, we're focused on running the business and executing, staying financially disciplined as we always have been and executing against the terrific growth prospects we have in Energy Resources and then executing at FPL as we always have for the benefit of our customers and continuing and for the benefit of the state. So that, I think, is just a little bit of an overview of how our current status of our thinking on."

And the third one on that, if I can just throw in there, is the attach rates on storage.

Julien, thanks for the questions, and you may need to prompt me if I forgot one or more aspects of the multipart question. Let me start with C&I. As I highlighted in the prepared remarks, John and his team across Energy Resources have really cultivated a nice suite of opportunities with C&I customers. And if we look at our core base of other major investor-owned utilities, our munis and co-ops and our C&I business, other investor-owned utilities, munis and co-ops are still larger overall, but the opportunity set with C&I customers is definitely growing, not just in your standard PPA, but more in the suite of types of opportunities that I mentioned as one of the pilot projects that John and his team are pursuing, kind of a more holistic energy solution provider to these C&I customers.
And I think what's really changed over the last year plus, maybe it's even 2 years, is the inbound request to C&I has really expanded as they really start to look at their own carbon footprint, their own ESG messaging. How do they source energy to do their business and how do they source that from a cleaner energy solutions has become a higher topic of interest and higher priority for them and, therefore, a terrific opportunity set for us. So I think that's a growing opportunity for us that we continue to be really excited about.
In terms of build-own-transfers, we will continue to present our expectations, both our expectations and our signed contracts consistent in the way that we've shown it in the past, that there will be some build-own-transfer that Energy Resources pursues. If it is a strict, just sell the project to somebody else. We think there's a lot of value creation there, but we won't necessarily incorporate in our backlog for purposes of reporting, unless there is a long-term operation and maintenance or other stream of revenue to us that we benefit from. So we'll consistently report that. I think the opportunity set is there for both traditional build-own-transfers as well as build-own-transfers where we provide some incremental long-term value to our customers.
And then finally, storage, the opportunity set is terrific. Obviously, we've had tremendous success in attaching storage to new solar facilities, existing solar facilities and even some stand-alone storage projects. If there is a stand-alone storage incentive that Congress pursues, obviously, that would support near-term growth of stand-alone storage opportunities even beyond what we've seen, but the growth is terrific. And as we outlined back in 2019, we were surprised how fast the market evolved, and I think we continue to be really supportive of that overall market.
And one last thing I'll highlight, Julien, is really the innovative nature of the FPL team in working with the SolarTogether program to work with our commercial and industrial customers in Florida to support their needs to build the most cost-effective solar. And that's what the SolarTogether program offered them is the ability to really source clean energy solutions in the most profitable way for them and in a way that we structured the benefits both for those participating customers and nonparticipating customers to meet their needs.
So let me stop there, Julien. Did I miss any aspect of it?"

So a tremendous amount of leverage off the existing operating fleet. And with new origination, I think of attach rates being roughly 60% on all the new stuff that we do.
And then one more comment on C&I. We are positioning the business to be the preferred strategic partner with C&I customers. And we are looking at the business in a holistic way where we can provide clean energy solutions across the board. It's wind, it's solar, it's storage, it's hydrogen, it's mobility.

From an NextEra Energy perspective, as you would expect, and when we provide expectations, we do a variety of scenario planning analyses to feel comfortable with the expectations that we've laid out. So there's not one answer to what you have in your assumptions that you've laid out for expectations. There's a range, and we feel comfortable today, as we've obviously reiterated those expectations, for the 2021, '22 and '23 timeframes.
So we look forward to presenting our case to the Commission and stakeholders. We feel very confident in the decisions that we've made in terms of where we've been investing, where we plan to invest. And obviously, the results, to some measure, obviously speak for themselves in terms of low bills, high reliability, terrific customer service and a clean energy profile that is substantial.

And we'll know more, obviously, over the next 90 days or so.
On NextEra Energy Transmission, I think Rebecca, in her prepared remarks, had just a terrific year last year, their best year ever as a company. Remember, we started that business from scratch a little over 10 years ago. And it's a business that made over $100 million in net income last year and we think has the ability to grow mid-teens, double-digit over the next several years just organically with what they have in front of them without doing any other acquisitions. And we are pursuing other acquisitions there because we think we add an enormous amount of value through our operating model, number one.
And then number two, probably the biggest inhibitor to renewables in this country is not consumer demand or it is not interest on the part of the federal government or state governments to get renewables built. It's not that customers don't want it. It is fundamentally broken processes with the ISOs in terms of how they manage their queues and transmission and just broadly transmission planning in this country. And I think with the Biden administration and a new FERC, there is a new opportunity to fix that. And our transmission business, I think, is a great example of what FERC Order 1000 can do when you get competition going in the transmission world. And it is also, I think, every bit of transmission we build in that business is incremental and helpful to the renewable business that we have and that it makes the delivery of lower-cost renewables even more fast to come on to the grid than they otherwise would. So I'm very excited about the transmission business. We're going to continue to push it, and I think it's got a lot of runway to grow."

A",527,"So Michael, I think you're being kind, honestly, to the regulated coal fleet in this country. There is not a regulated coal plant in this country that is economic today, full period, end of stop when it's dispatched on any basis, not a single one, okay? And so why haven't it -- I think you've hit on the crux of some of the issues. Obviously, there have been, in certain states, a reluctance to let our utility customers retire the coal plant and then be able to recover their investment, right? And so, of course, if you run a utility, you don't want to retire an asset that you're going to then either have to write-off or not be able to earn on, right?
I think one of the things that has been really constructive and very smart about the Florida regulatory environment or the Commission's view on modernizing the generation fleet is that they have -- we've spread that capital recovery over a period of 5 or 10 years. And that has both, I think, moderated the impact to customer bills, on the one hand, and also on the other, given us the right incentive to do the right thing by our customers and bring on lower-cost generation.
So I think it's about -- the other piece, I think, that's going to change is there is no question, this administration through the EPA and other means is going to make the continued operation of coal plants very difficult in this country. And so there's going to be, I think, more pressure, more federal pressure to accelerate that transition away from coal than there has been, obviously, over the last 4 years, where there's been, in fact, the opposite of federal pressure, but the complete lack of federal pressure to do anything about with your coal fleet.
So I think the combination of that plus states becoming -- it becoming clearer and clearer the economics as we go along, that the operating cost of coal plants are higher than the new build cost of renewables with storage as that becomes even clearer as costs come down for renewables and costs continue to go up, operating costs continue to go up for coal. That's -- I mean the bottom line in Florida, we've shut our coal down, and we've saved customers literally billions of dollars of present value over the expected life of the new generation we put in place.
So there's an enormous opportunity. There are several states in the country that are not taking advantage of that opportunity because of some of the regulatory approaches. And honestly, I think with the new administration and some of the policies there, that's going to accelerate the replacement of coal in this country. And it should be because there's no -- it's costing customers money. Leave aside the environmental benefits, just on pure economics that's costing customers' money every day, and that's bad for the country and let alone that it's terrible for the climate, it is -- and for the environment, it is bad for customers because economics are -- the coal economics are so out of whack."

270586,700922562,2251196,"NextEra Energy Partners, LP, NextEra Energy, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2021",2021-01-26,"Earnings Calls","NextEra Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. 2020 was a terrific year for both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. NextEra Energy performance was strong both financially and operationally. We had outstanding execution on our initiatives to continu",2321,"Thanks, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. 2020 was a terrific year for both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. NextEra Energy performance was strong both financially and operationally. We had outstanding execution on our initiatives to continue to drive future growth across the company.
Across all of our businesses, we successfully executed on the largest capital program in our history, deploying more than $14 billion in 2020 as we lead America's clean energy transformation. By successfully executing on our plans, NextEra Energy extended its long track record of delivering value for shareholders with adjusted earnings per share of $2.31, up 10.5% from 2019.
A key element of our value proposition in NextEra Energy is a culture focused on delivering outstanding results for our shareholders. Over the past 10 years, we've delivered compound annual growth and adjusted EPS of 8%, which is the highest among all top 10 power companies who have achieved, on average, compound annual growth of less than 3% over the same period. Amid this significant growth, the company has maintained one of the strongest balance sheets and credit positions in the industry.
In 2020, we delivered a total shareholder return of approximately 30%, significantly outperforming both the S&P 500 and the S&P 500 Utilities Index, and continuing to outperform both indices in terms of total shareholder return on a 1-year, 3-year, 5-year, 7-year and 10-year basis. Over the past 15 years, we've outperformed all of the other companies in the S&P 500 Utilities Index and 86% of the companies in the S&P 500 while more than tripling the average total shareholder return of both indices. While we are proud of our long-term track record of creating shareholder value, we remain laser-focused on the future and on delivering our commitments.
NextEra Energy remains well positioned to capitalize on the disruptive forces reshaping our industry, which have expanded and accelerated over the past 2 years, even beyond what we had anticipated. The combination of low-cost renewables with low-cost storage in the form of batteries today and hydrogen in the longer term has substantially increased the total addressable market for NextEra Energy. We now believe that a substantial and economic decarbonization of the electricity, transportation and industrial sectors is possible, which represents a potential investment opportunity of trillions of dollars in the coming decades.
In the electricity sector, we expect that older and more inefficient generation will continue to be retired and replaced with cleaner and more affordable alternatives. In the transportation sector, we believe it will be increasingly economic to replace fossil fuel vehicles with vehicles powered by fuel cells and batteries charged with renewable energy. And in the industrial sector, gray hydrogen and other high-carbon feedstocks can be replaced with green hydrogen. We believe these trends have already been put into motion driven by economics. In addition, we believe it is possible that the Biden administration, supported by a significant shift in public support towards taking action to address climate change, may act to further accelerate these shifts through the extension of existing incentives as well as initiating other forms of policy support.
Importantly, we believe that no company is better equipped to take advantage of these substantial and long-term trends than NextEra Energy. In fact, NextEra Energy is already proof that you can be clean, low-cost and financially successful all at the same time. We are at the vanguard of building a sustainable energy era that is both clean and affordable, and we are driving hard to continue to be at the forefront of the disruption that is occurring within the energy sector and broader parts of the U.S. economy.
We expect that the execution of our strategy will drive meaningful CO2 emissions reductions across the country and will help advance NextEra Energy towards its goal of reducing its CO2 emissions rate by 67% by 2025 from a 2005 baseline, while simultaneously lowering generation cost for customers and maintaining best-in-class reliability. We expect the disruptive nature of renewables to be terrific for customers, terrific for the environment and terrific for shareholders by helping to drive tremendous growth for this company over the next decade and beyond.
FPL is already capitalizing on the disruption in our sector with continued focus on its grid and fleet modernization efforts. During 2020, FPL successfully executed on its strategic initiatives, including placing more than 1,100 megawatts of cost-effective solar in service on time and on budget in support of its ongoing capital plan. This solar expansion is part of FPL's SolarTogether community solar program and its groundbreaking 30-by-30 plan, which is one of the world's largest solar expansions and would result in roughly 10,000 megawatts of total solar capacity on FPL's system by 2030.
Additionally, the 409-megawatt Manatee Energy Storage Center, which will be the world's largest integrated solar-powered battery system, is on track and on budget to be placed in service later this year as part of the approximately $1 billion that NextEra Energy is investing in battery storage projects in 2021. Smart capital investments such as these help FPL improve its already best-in-class customer value proposition while also maintaining an emissions profile that is among the cleanest in the nation. 
FPL also had continued success with its cost-saving initiatives, making even further reductions to its already best-in-class dollar per retail megawatt-hour nonfuel O&M costs from 2019 to 2020. Through our unrelenting focus on cost savings and on making disciplined long-term investments for the benefit of our customers, FPL has been able to maintain typical customer bills that are the lowest in the nation when compared to the 20 largest investor-owned utilities in the country.
In addition to low bills, FPL has continued to provide reliability that is by far the best in the state of Florida, achieving its best-ever reliability rate in 2020. FPL's investments to build a stronger, smarter energy grid have resulted in best-in-state reliability for the last 14 years in a row as well as earning numerous national awards. In 2020, FPL was recognized for the fifth time in 6 years as being the most reliable electric utility in the nation.
Let me now turn to Gulf Power. In the 2 years that it has been part of the NextEra Energy family, Gulf Power has realized an approximately 30% reduction in O&M costs, a 50% improvement in service reliability, a 93% improvement in safety and a nearly 20% reduction in CO2 emissions. Gulf Power has grown regulatory capital employed at a 17% compound annual growth rate since 2018, and we are well on our way to achieving the objectives we laid out at our investor conference in 2019.
In addition to the excellent operational execution that we delivered in 2020, we continued to progress our smart capital investment program that is expected to generate further customer benefits over the coming years. In the fourth quarter, we completed the Plant Crist coal-to-natural gas conversion. As a result, consistent with our commitment to remain a clean energy leader, we were able to complete the accelerated shutdown of the coal units at Plant Crist, which has now been renamed the Gulf Clean Energy Center.
With the retirement of FPL's Indiantown Cogeneration facility also occurring late last year, 2021 is the first time in nearly 70 years that there are no coal-fired power plants in Florida for either FPL or Gulf Power. Earlier this month, FPL filed a test year letter with the Florida Public Service Commission to initiate a rate proceeding for new rates beginning in January 2022. The 4-year plan that we intend to propose is designed to provide continued longer-term cost certainty for customers while allowing FPL to continue investing in clean energy, storm-hardened infrastructure and other innovative technologies that are the foundation of our communities.
The stability of multiyear rate plans allows FPL to focus on efficiency in the business, which is critical to keeping customer bills low while, at the same time, enabling FPL to maintain strong credit ratings and balance sheet, which allows for consistent access to the capital markets. We look forward to the opportunity to showcase our long-term track record of providing low bills, high reliability and clean energy for Floridans and plans -- and our plans to build an even more resilient and sustainable energy future for Florida in the coming years.
Turning to Energy Resources. In 2020, we continued to advance our position as the leading developer and operator of wind, solar and battery storage projects, commissioning approximately 5,750 megawatts of new projects, more than doubling the amount of total renewables commissioned versus the previous year. This was also a record year for renewables origination in Energy Resources with the team adding a net nearly 7,000 megawatts to our backlog during the year.
As a result of the team's origination success and alongside the backdrop of the terrific market outlook I just outlined at the beginning of my remarks, we now expect to construct approximately 23 to 30 gigawatts of new renewables in the 2021 to 2024 time frame, which, if we are successful at the midpoint, would mean adding a portfolio of generation projects that is approximately 1.5x the size of Energy Resources' entire operating renewables portfolio as of year-end 2019.
Energy Resources' execution success is reflective of our ability to leverage our significant competitive advantages, including our best-in-class development skills, large pipeline of sites and interconnection queue positions, strong customer relationships, purchasing power, best-in-class construction expertise, resource assessment capabilities, cost of capital advantages and world-class operations capability to capitalize on the ongoing energy transition that is occurring in the nation's generation fleet. We believe that we are in a terrific position to be able to capture a significant share of the market opportunities going forward and what we continue to believe is the best renewables development environment we have ever seen.
Along with the broader public shift towards calls for action to fight climate change, over the past few years, there's been an increased focus on environmental, social and governance, or ESG, on the part of many of our stakeholders. While we expect this trend to amplify demand among our traditional customers and in our core renewables business, we also believe it is opening up significant new markets and business opportunities for Energy Resources. We anticipate our development program to be further enhanced by an ability to attract new nontraditional customers, particularly in the commercial and industrial sector, as improving renewable economics are increasingly aligned with corporate objectives to procure energy from clean generation sources.
In summary, I continue to remain as enthusiastic as ever about NextEra Energy's long-term growth prospects. In 2020, we extended our long track record of executing for the benefit of customers and shareholders and further developed our best-in-class organic growth prospects. Based on the strength and resiliency of our underlying businesses, I will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectation ranges in 2021, 2022 and 2023, while at the same time, maintaining our strong credit ratings. We remain intensely focused on execution and continuing to drive shareholder value over the coming years.
Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which delivered a total unit return -- unitholder return of approximately 32% in 2020, further advancing its history of value creation since the IPO. NextEra Energy Partners is uniquely positioned to take advantage of the disruptive factors reshaping the energy industry and benefit from the enormous market opportunity in the coming decades for renewables. 
NextEra Energy Partners also had a terrific year of execution in 2020 and continue to deliver on its commitments. That history of execution is supported by NextEra Energy Partners' outstanding portfolio of clean energy assets, which was further diversified in 2020. During the year, NextEra Energy Partners acquired interests in approximately 1,100 megawatts of high-quality renewable energy assets, including the partnership's first battery storage project from Energy Resources.
Additionally, during the year, NextEra Energy Partners successfully completed its first 3 organic growth prospects, including the repowering of 275 megawatts of wind projects. For 2020, NextEra Energy Partners grew its LP distributions by 15% year-over-year and delivered 40% year-over-year cash available for distribution growth, highlighting the strength of its operating portfolio. With this strong year-over-year growth in cash available for distribution, NextEra Energy Partners achieved its distribution growth objectives while maintaining a trailing 12-month payout ratio in the high 60% range as of year-end 2020.
In the fourth quarter, we published our first NextEra Energy Partners ESG report, highlighting its high-quality clean energy portfolio, visible opportunities for renewables growth and ability to leverage the operational expertise of NextEra Energy Resources. The continued origination success at Energy Resources is expected to benefit NextEra Energy Partners in meeting its future growth objectives. I continue to believe that the combination of NextEra Energy Partners' clean energy portfolio, growth visibility and flexibility to finance that growth offers LP unitholders a uniquely attractive investor value proposition. As with NextEra Energy, we remain intensely focused on continuing to execute and deliver that unitholder value over the coming years. 
Finally, I would like to take a moment to thank all of NextEra Energy's employees for their continued dedication, hard work and focus during the extraordinary circumstances of the past year. Despite the significant disruption caused by the pandemic and in the midst of the most active hurricane season in the Atlantic Basin on record, our employees' unwavering focus on our customers is what enabled yet another year of flawless execution in the business while also delivering our best-ever safety results across the company. It is because of their commitment to excellence that we were able to deliver above and beyond our commitments in 2020 and why I remain as confident as ever in our ability to deliver on all our expectations moving forward.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Rebecca, who will review the 2020 results in more detail."
270586,700922562,2251196,"NextEra Energy Partners, LP, NextEra Energy, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 26, 2021",2021-01-26,"Earnings Calls","NextEra Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone.Let's now turn to the detailed results beginning with FPL. For the fourth quarter of 2020, FPL reported net income of $502 million or $0.25 per share, up $0.05 per share year-over-year. For the full year 2020,",4292,"Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone.
Let's now turn to the detailed results beginning with FPL. For the fourth quarter of 2020, FPL reported net income of $502 million or $0.25 per share, up $0.05 per share year-over-year. For the full year 2020, FPL reported net income of $2.65 billion or $1.35 per share, an increase of $0.15 per share versus 2019.
Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 11% for 2020 and was the principal driver of FPL's net income growth of more than 13% for the year. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing its full year capital investments to a total of roughly $6.7 billion. FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes was 11.6% for the 12 months ended December 31, 2020, which is at the upper end of the allowed band of 9.6% to 11.6% under our current rate agreement.
During the fourth quarter, we utilized approximately $100 million of reserve amortization, leaving FPL with a year-end 2020 balance of $894 million. Approximately $206 million of reserve amortization was used to offset the restoration costs associated with Hurricanes Isaias and Tropical Storm Eta, which FPL elected not to recover from customers through a surcharge. FPL's reserve amortization mechanism under its current settlement agreement, combined with our aggressive cost-cutting measures and the benefits of tax reform, has provided significant customer benefits, including avoided surcharges for approximately $1.7 billion in storm restoration costs since 2017.
Our overall capital program at FPL is progressing well. We continue to advance one of the nation's largest-ever solar expansions. During the year, the Florida Public Service Commission approved FPL's SolarTogether program, which is the nation's largest community solar program that is expected to generate $249 million in total net cost savings for participating and nonparticipating customers over the program's life. After commissioning over 1,100 megawatts or more than 3.5x the amount of solar capacity in 2020 versus the prior year, FPL expects to commission roughly 670 megawatts of additional SolarTogether capacity in 2021. And the customer demand for this innovative program across all customer classes remains strong.
Beyond solar, construction of the highly efficient, roughly 1,200-megawatt Dania Beach Clean Energy Center remains on schedule and on budget as it continues to advance towards its projected commercial operations date in 2022. It should be noted that all of these significant accomplishments, including the deployment of nearly $7 billion in capital, were in the midst of not only a global pandemic, but also during the most active hurricane season in the Atlantic Basin on record. We've delivered our best-ever reliability results when our customers needed us the most. And we remain committed to supporting customers experiencing economic hardship as a result of the challenges caused by the pandemic. To date, FPL has provided customers with approximately $75 million in relief through various programs and initiatives. As Florida recovers, we will continue to help our customers navigate this difficult time while maintaining our best-in-class customer value proposition.
Let me now turn to Gulf Power, which, as a reminder, was legally merged into FPL on January 1, 2021, but will continue to be reported as a separate regulated segment during 2021. Gulf Power reported fourth quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $53 million or $0.03 per share, up $0.02 per share year-over-year. For the full year, Gulf Power reported net income of $238 million or $0.12 per share, an increase of $0.02 per share year-over-year on an adjusted basis. Base O&M reductions were the primary driver of Gulf Power's 19% year-over-year growth in adjusted earnings.
Gulf Power's reported ROE for regulatory purposes is expected to be approximately 11.1% for the 12 months ending December 2020, which is near the upper end of the allowed band of 9.25% to 11.25% under its current rate agreement. For the full year 2021, we expect the regulatory ROE to be in the upper half of this allowed band, assuming normal weather and operating conditions.
All of our major capital initiatives at Gulf Power are progressing well. Gulf Power's first solar development project, the roughly 75-megawatt Blue Indigo Solar Energy Center, went into service in 2020 and is expected to generate significant customer savings over its lifetime. Gulf Power anticipates bringing another 150 megawatts of cost-effective, zero-emission solar capacity online later this year.
The North Florida Resiliency Connection, which, among other things, will allow customers to benefit from greater diversity in solar output across 2 different time zones, is expected to be in service in mid-2022. Continued smart capital investments such as these renewables and core infrastructure are expected to drive customer benefits for many years to come.
The Florida economy continues to recover from the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. A number of current economic indicators, including retail taxable sales, new building permits and consumer confidence, have meaningfully improved since the start of the pandemic in early 2020. Additionally, Florida's most recent seasonally adjusted unemployment rate of 6.4% is below the national average. While it is unclear at this point how the economy will be impacted by the current wave of COVID-19 cases, we continue to believe that Florida offers a unique proposition in terms of housing affordability, great weather, low taxes and a pro-business economy, all of which should support ongoing FPL customer growth and economic rebound once the worst of the pandemic is behind us.
We remain deeply engaged in helping Florida return from this stronger than ever, and we will continue to do our part to support that outcome, including pursuing our smart capital investment program and economic development efforts, which help create jobs, provide investment in local communities and further enhance our best-in-class customer value proposition.
During the quarter, FPL's average customer growth was strong, increasing by nearly 76,000 from the comparable prior year quarter. FPL's fourth quarter retail sales were up 0.9% versus the prior year period, largely driven by a 2.3% year-over-year growth in underlying usage per customer. For 2020, FPL's retail sales increased 1.5% versus the prior year, driven primarily by ongoing strong growth in customers and a favorable weather comparison. On a weather-normalized basis, FPL's retail sales increased by 0.7% for the full year 2020. The overall impacts of the pandemic on last year's retail sales were relatively muted, and FPL's underlying usage per customer was flat year-over-year.
For Gulf Power, the average number of customers increased approximately 0.9% versus the comparable prior year quarter. For 2020, Gulf Power's retail sales declined 3.3%, primarily as a result of a more favorable weather in the prior year as well as lower usage per customer, which we attribute in part to the ongoing impacts of the pandemic on our commercial and industrial customers.
As Jim mentioned, FPL is preparing to file a base rate adjustment proposal that would cover the next 4 years, 2022 through 2025, and provide customers longer-term visibility to the future cost of electricity. While the details are still being finalized, we expect the proposal to include base rate adjustments of approximately $1.1 billion starting in January of 2022 and $615 million starting in January of 2023. We also expect the proposal to request support for continued deployment of cost-effective solar with the continuation of our solar base rate adjustment or SoBRA mechanism to recover the revenue requirements associated with up to 900 megawatts of cost-effective solar projects in each of 2024 and 2025, which we currently estimate to be approximately $140 million each year.
For the period 2019 through the end of 2022, FPL is planning to have invested approximately $29 billion, with additional significant investments expected in 2023 and beyond to meet the growing needs of Florida's economy and to continue delivering outstanding value for Florida customers by keeping reliability high and fuel and other costs low. While the benefits of building a stronger, smarter and cleaner grid, more efficient generation fleet are passed along regularly to customers through higher service reliability and lower bills. We must periodically seek recovery for these long-term investments supported by base rates.
As we've previously indicated, we plan to request the Commission to authorize unified rates and capital structure for both FPL and Gulf Power customers. We believe the combination of the 2 businesses will result in approximately $2.8 billion of savings for customers through both operational savings and overall system benefits.
FPL expects to request an 11.5% ROE, inclusive of a 50 basis point incentive for superior performance. Compared with peer utilities in the Southeastern U.S., FPL has the most efficient -- most cost-efficient operations, the highest reliability, the lowest customer bills, all while remaining one of the cleanest utilities in the country, and is widely regarded as the top overall performer in the industry, bringing exceptional value to customers. We believe that the performance adder would reflect FPL's current superior value proposition and encourage strong -- continued strong performance.
In addition, we continue to believe that a strong balance sheet, including strong credit ratings, remains critical to ensure FPL maintains uninterrupted access to the capital markets, even in times of significant market disruption in the aftermath of hurricanes as well as to attract capital to support the investments FPL is making to further improve the value we offer customers. The total of these base rate increase requests over the 4-year period from 2022 to 2025 would result in an estimated average increase in total revenues of about 3.7% per year.
Today, FPL's typical residential bill is about 30% lower than the national average. If the full amount of the requests were granted under our proposal and assuming other utilities experience bill increases only at their historical rate of increase, FPL's typical customer bills would remain significantly lower than the national average through 2025. To put this proposal in context, the proposal would result in a typical customer bill in January 2022 that is nearly 22% less than it was in real terms 15 years ago, even with our proposed base rate increases. Even in nominal terms, FPL bills would be only about 3.5% higher in 2022 than in 2006, a fraction of the nominal increases of 25% to 75% in the cost of groceries, medical care, health insurance and housing over the past 15 years.
Moreover, through the consolidation of FPL and Gulf Power, the typical 1,000 kilowatt-hour residential customer bill in Northwest Florida is projected to be lower in 2025 than it was in 2019. We look forward to the opportunity to present the details of our case and expect to make our formal filing with testimony and required detailed data in March. The timing for the proceeding will ultimately be determined by the Commission, but we currently expect that we will have hearings in the third quarter and a final commission decision in the fourth quarter, in time for new rates to go into effect in January of 2022.
As always, we are open to the possibility of resolving our rate request through a fair settlement agreement. During the course of the past 22 years, FPL has entered into 6 multiyear settlement agreements that have provided customers with a high degree of rate stability and certainty and helped FPL execute to deliver its best-in-class customer value proposition. Our core focus will be to pursue a fair and objective review of our case that supports continued execution of our successful strategy for customers, and we will continue to provide updates throughout the process. 
Energy Resources reported fourth quarter 2020 GAAP loss of $644 million or $0.33 per share. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were $342 million or $0.17 per share. Energy Resources' contribution to adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter is flat versus the prior year comparable period as favorable results from the continued growth and performance in our renewables portfolio were roughly offset by a number of items, none of which are particularly noteworthy. For the full year, Energy Resources reported GAAP earnings of $531 million or $0.27 per share and adjusted earnings of $1.95 billion or $0.99 per share. 
Energy Resources full year adjusted earnings per share contribution increased $0.12 or approximately 14% versus 2019. For the full year, growth was driven by continued new additions to our renewables portfolio as contributions from new investments increased by $0.07 per share. Contributions from existing generation assets increased $0.03 versus 2019 due primarily to increased production tax credit volume from our repowered wind projects and an improvement in wind resource, which were partially offset by the planned nuclear outages and retirement of our Duane Arnold nuclear facility. Also contributing favorably was NextEra Energy Transmission, which increased results by $0.02 year-over-year, primarily as a result of full year contributions from Trans Bay Cable acquisition that closed in the middle of 2019. Contributions from all other impacts were flat year-over-year.
Amid the disruption of the pandemic, Energy Resources had one of its best years ever, including successfully executing on the largest construction program in our history as well as delivering our best year ever for origination, adding a net nearly 7,000 megawatts of new renewables projects to our backlog. In 2020, we commissioned approximately 5,750 megawatts of wind, solar and storage projects on schedule and on budget.
In addition, since the last call, we have added approximately 2,000 megawatts of renewables projects to our backlog, including approximately 1,030 megawatts of new wind and wind repowerings, 670 megawatts of solar and 300 megawatts of battery storage, including 75 additional megawatts of capacity on Desert Peak Storage, which is now expected to total 400 megawatts and remains the world's largest stand-alone storage project.
Following the terrific origination year in 2020, our renewables backlog now stands at approximately 13,500 megawatts. Despite a record year of megawatts placed in service, Energy Resources grew its year-end backlog by approximately 1,500 megawatts year-over-year, providing terrific visibility to the strong growth that lies ahead. Since 2017, our backlog additions have grown at a roughly 25% compound annual growth rate.
As a result of our tremendous progress in 2020 and our strong continued origination success, we are raising our 2021 to 2022 renewables development expectations to a range of 10,525 megawatts to 12,700 megawatts, which at the midpoint is approximately 3,500 megawatts above our previous expectations. Our expectations for 2021 and 2022 are now up more than 50% at the midpoint relative to the expectations that we laid out at the 2019 investor conference, reflecting the significant acceleration of renewables activity over the past 1.5 years. We are also introducing our 2023 to 2024 renewables development expectations of 12,150 megawatts to 17,300 megawatts. This is by far the largest expected 2-year development program in our history and reflects our high level of confidence in Energy Resources' ongoing leadership position in renewable energy development. The accompanying slide provides some additional details.
As we've previously discussed, we are optimistic about the expanded investment opportunities that the broad decarbonization of the U.S. economy presents for Energy Resources, and we are pursuing a number of pilot projects to rapidly develop our capabilities across this potential investment opportunity set. Today, we are announcing a new innovative green hydrogen project in Energy Resources that includes a 12-megawatt solar array, on-site hydrogen production and storage and a hydrogen fuel cell. This emissions-free project will utilize solar energy to create green hydrogen to power the fuel cell, which will be able to provide electricity to the local grid during periods of peak demand. Subject to final terms and regulatory approvals, this approximately $20 million innovative green hydrogen project is expected to begin construction in 2022 with commercial operations in mid-2023.
Energy Resources is also in advanced discussions with a number of potential customers across the industrial landscape, including food processing, specialty chemicals and refineries, to continue to develop clean energy solutions for more efficient green production processes. One potential project includes a solar tracker combined with an electrolyzer at a large industrial plant. The project would deliver green hydrogen as an industrial feedstock for the facility. And when not producing hydrogen, the solar power would offset a portion of the plant's energy consumption, further decarbonizing the facility's operations.
In addition, today, Energy Resources announced a planned partnership to pursue large school bus fleet conversions to electric and hydrogen with the nation's largest school bus owner and operator and transportation services provider. With its partner, Energy Resources anticipates investing in bus electrification upgrades and charging stations as well as providing energy management services. This transaction is consistent with our toe-in-the-water approach as we explore potential opportunities in the electrification of the transportation sector.
We are excited about all of these opportunities as well as the previously announced Hydrogen Pilot Project we plan to propose at FPL's Okeechobee Clean Energy Center, which highlight the significant opportunities that the broad decarbonization of the U.S. economy presents. Consistent with our long-term track record, NextEra Energy will remain disciplined as we take steps to be at the forefront of these developing markets while taking a leadership role in the clean energy transition.
Beyond renewables and storage, since the last earnings call, Mountain Valley Pipeline made progress with its outstanding permitting issues, including receiving the Bureau of Land Management right-of-way grant, which authorizes MVP to cross the Jefferson National Forest once the stream and wetland permitting is complete. While the Fourth Circuit denied a stay request on MVP's new biological opinion, the Court did grant a stay on the Nationwide 12 permit, and the project is now pursuing an alternate path forward to permit and complete stream and wetland crossings.
Due to these continued legal and regulatory issues as well as the substantial delays in commercial operation and increased costs associated with those delays, the carrying value for our investment in MVP now exceeds its fair market value. And as a result, we have reflected a $1.2 billion after-tax impairment in our GAAP financial statements, which we have excluded from adjusted earnings. While we are disappointed with the extended development and construction time line due to the legal challenges that the project has faced, we intend to continue pursuing completing the project with our partners.
Finally, during 2020, NextEra Energy Transmission furthered its efforts to grow America's leading competitive transmission company and had its best year ever. During the year, the business delivered a record earnings contribution and realized constructive rate case outcomes at Trans Bay Cable and Lone Star Transmission as well as entered into an agreement to acquire GridLiance, which owns 3 FERC-regulated transmission utilities spanning 6 states. We continue to expect to obtain all necessary regulatory approvals and close on the GridLiance acquisition in the first half of this year.
Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the fourth quarter of 2020, GAAP net losses attributable to NextEra Energy were $5 million or $0.00 per share. NextEra Energy's 2020 fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $785 million or $0.40 per share, respectively. For the full year 2020, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $2.92 billion or $1.48 per share. Adjusted earnings were $4.55 billion or $2.31 per share. As a reminder, all of our financial results have been adjusted to account for the 4-for-1 stock split, which became effective in the fourth quarter.
For the Corporate and Other segment, adjusted earnings for the full year decreased $0.07 per share compared to the 2019 prior comparable period, primarily as a result of higher interest and refinancing costs associated with certain liability management initiatives completed during the fourth quarter to take advantage of the low interest rate environment.
In total for NextEra Energy, our refinancing activities reduced nominal adjusted net income by roughly $103 million during the fourth quarter, inclusive of approximately $39 million associated with Energy Resources' share of refinancing cost at NextEra Energy Partners. We expect these initiatives to translate into favorable net income contributions in future years and an overall improvement in net present value for our shareholders.
Long-term financial expectations, which we increased and extended late last year through 2023, remain unchanged. For 2021, NextEra Energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.40 to $2.54. For 2022 and 2023, NextEra Energy expects to grow 6% to 8% off the expected 2021 adjusted earnings per share. And we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of these ranges. From 2018 to 2023, we continue to expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at a roughly 10% per year rate through at least 2022 off of a 2020 base. As always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions.
Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which also had a strong year of operational and financial performance in 2020. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $308 million and cash available for distribution was $106 million, an increase of 10% and 8% from the prior year period, respectively. EBITDA growth was driven primarily by favorable resource across the portfolio and the full contributions from new projects acquired in late 2019, and it was slightly offset by a planned outage at our Genesis project late in the fourth quarter.
For the full year 2020, adjusted EBITDA was $1.263 billion, up 14% year-over-year. Cash available for distribution was $570 million, an increase of 40% from the prior year. Similar to the quarterly results, full year growth in adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by full year contributions from acquisitions in the prior year and favorable wind resource. For the full year, wind resource was 100% of the long-term average versus 97% in 2019. The benefit to cash available for distribution from lower project-level debt service was partially offset by higher corporate level interest expense. As a reminder, these results include the impact of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide.
Yesterday, the NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.615 per common unit or $2.46 per unit on an annualized basis, up 15% from the comparable quarterly distribution a year earlier and at the top end of the range we discussed going into 2020.
During 2020, NextEra Energy Partners executed several financing to support its ongoing growth investments and optimize its capital structure for the benefit of LP unitholders. As Jim mentioned, during the quarter, we closed on an acquisition from Energy Resources of interest in an approximately 1,100-megawatt portfolio of long-term contracted renewables projects. As part of this transaction, NextEra Energy Partners raised a 10-year, approximately $1.1 billion convertible equity portfolio financing that includes the acquired assets plus 4 existing NextEra Energy Partners wind and solar projects.
Combining this acquisition with the recapitalization of 4 existing NextEra Energy Partners assets through the longest-dated and lowest-cost convertible equity portfolio financing in the partnership's history is expected to provide significant benefits for unitholders. By leveraging the strong demand for high-quality clean energy assets, NextEra Energy Partners was able to secure financing for both the current transaction and future growth while enhancing returns for LP unitholders and limiting downside risk.
NextEra Energy Partners expects to further strengthen its balance sheet and have access to approximately $2.4 billion in available financing capacity, including capacity under its corporate revolving credit facility and commitments from investors to potential future convertible equity portfolio financings, which further supports the partnership's long-term growth.
During the second half of the year, NextEra Energy Partners completed the successful conversion of approximately $300 million of convertible debt and the remaining balance of the convertible preferred securities that were issued in 2017 into approximately 5.7 million and 4.7 million units -- common units, respectively. These conversions helped NextEra Energy Partners achieve its goal of using low-cost financing products to efficiently issue equity over time.
Finally, NextEra Energy Partners raised approximately $600 million in new 0% coupon convertible notes during the quarter and used the net proceeds from this offering to redeem a portion of its outstanding 4.25% senior notes due in 2024. Coincident with the issuance of the convertible notes, NextEra Energy Partners entered into a capped call structure that will result in NextEra Energy Partners retaining up to 90% of the upside in its unit price associated with the convertible note over the next 5 years. 
NextEra Energy Partners run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA and CAFD at December 31, 2021, remain unchanged. Year-end 2021 run rate adjusted EBITDA expectations are $1.44 to $1.62 billion and CAFD in the range of $600 million to $680 million. As a reminder, all of our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated IDR fees as we treat these as an operating expense.
From an updated base of our fourth quarter 2020 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.46, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2021 distribution that is payable in February of 2022 to be in a range of $2.76 to $2.83 per common unit.
In summary, we continue to believe that both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners have excellent prospects for growth both in the near and longer term. FPL, Energy Resources and NextEra Energy Partners each have outstanding set of opportunities across the board. The progress we made in 2020 reinforces our longer-term growth prospects. And while we have a lot to execute on in 2021, we believe that we have the building blocks in place for another excellent year.
That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open up the line for your questions."

First, obviously, the project has taken longer and cost more than what we anticipated. And so the impairment is really related to reflecting not only that value that we have on our books but really in relation to what we believe is the current fair valuation for the investment, given what we do still have to accomplish. And obviously, a lot changed in the fourth quarter, including the Nationwide 12 permit stay that I mentioned in the prepared remarks as well as the various things that have happened in January and against the backdrop of obvious changes, including the change in the administration, including the change in control of the Senate, which happened here in January.
So the impairment does reflect our view of what we still need to accomplish and the associated fair values related to the chances of being able to successfully execute on that. But this was an accounting exercise. It was a lot of due diligence that we needed to evaluate, and we think we've made the appropriate changes. But it does not change our commitment to work with our partners to put this project into service. So as I noted in the comments, we do have now a path that we're going to pursue in terms of the outstanding permitting. We'll work closely with our partners to pursue that path. But we thought it was appropriate and obviously took the actions that we did with respect to the impairment."

And that's just accelerated, in particular, over the last 24 months. I think what that means is it's changed a bit of our analytic framework of how we think about utility M&A. On the one hand, I continue to believe there's enormous value creation that we can bring to the table, and you only need to look at what we've been able to do with Gulf in the last 24.5 months to see how much value creation, bringing our playbook and our operating platform the Bay Area can create, right? So that is -- that, I think, remains clear. And if anything, it's clearer to me.
On the other, I think it's also clear that probably a sweet spot for us in terms of M&A is things in the less than $20 billion range that we can pay cash and finance through the normal course. And at that point, if you do that, you're not shifting the mix one way or another all that tremendously. And in our set of analytics, we're looking really more at how much value creation are we bringing to the table when we do this. And so for example, I think Santee Cooper is a great example of that. That's -- it's roughly $8 billion or $9 billion transaction and something that we can finance in the normal course in a place where we think we can create enormous value very quickly.
And so that's the kind of things that we're focused on. And -- but most importantly, we're focused on running the business and executing, staying financially disciplined as we always have been and executing against the terrific growth prospects we have in Energy Resources and then executing at FPL as we always have for the benefit of our customers and continuing and for the benefit of the state. So that, I think, is just a little bit of an overview of how our current status of our thinking on."

Secondly, the new expectations explicitly do not include any future build-own-transfer. How do you see that as incremental? And any heuristics you might offer as to how to think about value creation there?
And the third one on that, if I can just throw in there, is the attach rates on storage. It seems like the bulk of the storage that you're talking about in the future is probably tied to your solar assets. How do you think about stand-alone as being incremental to what you've talked about already? I'll leave it there."

Julien, thanks for the questions, and you may need to prompt me if I forgot one or more aspects of the multipart question. Let me start with C&I. As I highlighted in the prepared remarks, John and his team across Energy Resources have really cultivated a nice suite of opportunities with C&I customers. And if we look at our core base of other major investor-owned utilities, our munis and co-ops and our C&I business, other investor-owned utilities, munis and co-ops are still larger overall, but the opportunity set with C&I customers is definitely growing, not just in your standard PPA, but more in the suite of types of opportunities that I mentioned as one of the pilot projects that John and his team are pursuing, kind of a more holistic energy solution provider to these C&I customers.
And I think what's really changed over the last year plus, maybe it's even 2 years, is the inbound request to C&I has really expanded as they really start to look at their own carbon footprint, their own ESG messaging. How do they source energy to do their business and how do they source that from a cleaner energy solutions has become a higher topic of interest and higher priority for them and, therefore, a terrific opportunity set for us. So I think that's a growing opportunity for us that we continue to be really excited about.
In terms of build-own-transfers, we will continue to present our expectations, both our expectations and our signed contracts consistent in the way that we've shown it in the past, that there will be some build-own-transfer that Energy Resources pursues. If it is a strict, just sell the project to somebody else. We think there's a lot of value creation there, but we won't necessarily incorporate in our backlog for purposes of reporting, unless there is a long-term operation and maintenance or other stream of revenue to us that we benefit from. So we'll consistently report that. I think the opportunity set is there for both traditional build-own-transfers as well as build-own-transfers where we provide some incremental long-term value to our customers.
And then finally, storage, the opportunity set is terrific. Obviously, we've had tremendous success in attaching storage to new solar facilities, existing solar facilities and even some stand-alone storage projects. If there is a stand-alone storage incentive that Congress pursues, obviously, that would support near-term growth of stand-alone storage opportunities even beyond what we've seen, but the growth is terrific. And as we outlined back in 2019, we were surprised how fast the market evolved, and I think we continue to be really supportive of that overall market.
And one last thing I'll highlight, Julien, is really the innovative nature of the FPL team in working with the SolarTogether program to work with our commercial and industrial customers in Florida to support their needs to build the most cost-effective solar. And that's what the SolarTogether program offered them is the ability to really source clean energy solutions in the most profitable way for them and in a way that we structured the benefits both for those participating customers and nonparticipating customers to meet their needs.
So let me stop there, Julien. Did I miss any aspect of it?"

How large do you want NextEra Transmission to be as part of the business mix? Do you see any -- is there more to come there?"

So it's -- the offer is there, and we're ready to negotiate whenever the state is ready to get going. And so we stand ready and are hopeful that the legislature will move forward on that process. And we'll know more, obviously, over the next 90 days or so.
On NextEra Energy Transmission, I think Rebecca, in her prepared remarks, had just a terrific year last year, their best year ever as a company. Remember, we started that business from scratch a little over 10 years ago. And it's a business that made over $100 million in net income last year and we think has the ability to grow mid-teens, double-digit over the next several years just organically with what they have in front of them without doing any other acquisitions. And we are pursuing other acquisitions there because we think we add an enormous amount of value through our operating model, number one.
And then number two, probably the biggest inhibitor to renewables in this country is not consumer demand or it is not interest on the part of the federal government or state governments to get renewables built. It's not that customers don't want it. It is fundamentally broken processes with the ISOs in terms of how they manage their queues and transmission and just broadly transmission planning in this country. And I think with the Biden administration and a new FERC, there is a new opportunity to fix that. And our transmission business, I think, is a great example of what FERC Order 1000 can do when you get competition going in the transmission world. And it is also, I think, every bit of transmission we build in that business is incremental and helpful to the renewable business that we have and that it makes the delivery of lower-cost renewables even more fast to come on to the grid than they otherwise would. So I'm very excited about the transmission business. We're going to continue to push it, and I think it's got a lot of runway to grow."

There is not a regulated coal plant in this country that is economic today, full period, end of stop when it's dispatched on any basis, not a single one, okay? A",527,"So Michael, I think you're being kind, honestly, to the regulated coal fleet in this country. There is not a regulated coal plant in this country that is economic today, full period, end of stop when it's dispatched on any basis, not a single one, okay? And so why haven't it -- I think you've hit on the crux of some of the issues. Obviously, there have been, in certain states, a reluctance to let our utility customers retire the coal plant and then be able to recover their investment, right? And so, of course, if you run a utility, you don't want to retire an asset that you're going to then either have to write-off or not be able to earn on, right?
I think one of the things that has been really constructive and very smart about the Florida regulatory environment or the Commission's view on modernizing the generation fleet is that they have -- we've spread that capital recovery over a period of 5 or 10 years. And that has both, I think, moderated the impact to customer bills, on the one hand, and also on the other, given us the right incentive to do the right thing by our customers and bring on lower-cost generation.
So I think it's about -- the other piece, I think, that's going to change is there is no question, this administration through the EPA and other means is going to make the continued operation of coal plants very difficult in this country. And so there's going to be, I think, more pressure, more federal pressure to accelerate that transition away from coal than there has been, obviously, over the last 4 years, where there's been, in fact, the opposite of federal pressure, but the complete lack of federal pressure to do anything about with your coal fleet.
So I think the combination of that plus states becoming -- it becoming clearer and clearer the economics as we go along, that the operating cost of coal plants are higher than the new build cost of renewables with storage as that becomes even clearer as costs come down for renewables and costs continue to go up, operating costs continue to go up for coal. That's -- I mean the bottom line in Florida, we've shut our coal down, and we've saved customers literally billions of dollars of present value over the expected life of the new generation we put in place.
So there's an enormous opportunity. There are several states in the country that are not taking advantage of that opportunity because of some of the regulatory approaches. And honestly, I think with the new administration and some of the policies there, that's going to accelerate the replacement of coal in this country. And it should be because there's no -- it's costing customers money. Leave aside the environmental benefits, just on pure economics that's costing customers' money every day, and that's bad for the country and let alone that it's terrible for the climate, it is -- and for the environment, it is bad for customers because economics are -- the coal economics are so out of whack."

NextEra Energy performance was strong both financially and operationally. We had outstanding execution on our initiatives to continue to drive future growth across the company.
Across all of our businesses, we successfully executed on the largest capital program in our history, deploying more than $14 billion in 2020 as we lead America's clean energy transformation. By successfully executing on our plans, NextEra Energy extended its long track record of delivering value for shareholders with adjusted earnings per share of $2.31, up 10.5% from 2019.
A key element of our value proposition in NextEra Energy is a culture focused on delivering outstanding results for our shareholders. Over the past 10 years, we've delivered compound annual growth and adjusted EPS of 8%, which is the highest among all top 10 power companies who have achieved, on average, compound annual growth of less than 3% over the same period. Amid this significant growth, the company has maintained one of the strongest balance sheets and credit positions in the industry.
In 2020, we delivered a total shareholder return of approximately 30%, significantly outperforming both the S&P 500 and the S&P 500 Utilities Index, and continuing to outperform both indices in terms of total shareholder return on a 1-year, 3-year, 5-year, 7-year and 10-year basis. Over the past 15 years, we've outperformed all of the other companies in the S&P 500 Utilities Index and 86% of the companies in the S&P 500 while more than tripling the average total shareholder return of both indices. While we are proud of our long-term track record of creating shareholder value, we remain laser-focused on the future and on delivering our commitments.
NextEra Energy remains well positioned to capitalize on the disruptive forces reshaping our industry, which have expanded and accelerated over the past 2 years, even beyond what we had anticipated. The combination of low-cost renewables with low-cost storage in the form of batteries today and hydrogen in the longer term has substantially increased the total addressable market for NextEra Energy. We now believe that a substantial and economic decarbonization of the electricity, transportation and industrial sectors is possible, which represents a potential investment opportunity of trillions of dollars in the coming decades.
In the electricity sector, we expect that older and more inefficient generation will continue to be retired and replaced with cleaner and more affordable alternatives. In the transportation sector, we believe it will be increasingly economic to replace fossil fuel vehicles with vehicles powered by fuel cells and batteries charged with renewable energy. And in the industrial sector, gray hydrogen and other high-carbon feedstocks can be replaced with green hydrogen. We believe these trends have already been put into motion driven by economics. In addition, we believe it is possible that the Biden administration, supported by a significant shift in public support towards taking action to address climate change, may act to further accelerate these shifts through the extension of existing incentives as well as initiating other forms of policy support.
Importantly, we believe that no company is better equipped to take advantage of these substantial and long-term trends than NextEra Energy. In fact, NextEra Energy is already proof that you can be clean, low-cost and financially successful all at the same time. We are at the vanguard of building a sustainable energy era that is both clean and affordable, and we are driving hard to continue to be at the forefront of the disruption that is occurring within the energy sector and broader parts of the U.S. economy.
We expect that the execution of our strategy will drive meaningful CO2 emissions reductions across the country and will help advance NextEra Energy towards its goal of reducing its CO2 emissions rate by 67% by 2025 from a 2005 baseline, while simultaneously lowering generation cost for customers and maintaining best-in-class reliability. We expect the disruptive nature of renewables to be terrific for customers, terrific for the environment and terrific for shareholders by helping to drive tremendous growth for this company over the next decade and beyond.
FPL is already capitalizing on the disruption in our sector with continued focus on its grid and fleet modernization efforts. During 2020, FPL successfully executed on its strategic initiatives, including placing more than 1,100 megawatts of cost-effective solar in service on time and on budget in support of its ongoing capital plan. This solar expansion is part of FPL's SolarTogether community solar program and its groundbreaking 30-by-30 plan, which is one of the world's largest solar expansions and would result in roughly 10,000 megawatts of total solar capacity on FPL's system by 2030.
Additionally, the 409-megawatt Manatee Energy Storage Center, which will be the world's largest integrated solar-powered battery system, is on track and on budget to be placed in service later this year as part of the approximately $1 billion that NextEra Energy is investing in battery storage projects in 2021. Smart capital investments such as these help FPL improve its already best-in-class customer value proposition while also maintaining an emissions profile that is among the cleanest in the nation. 
FPL also had continued success with its cost-saving initiatives, making even further reductions to its already best-in-class dollar per retail megawatt-hour nonfuel O&M costs from 2019 to 2020. Through our unrelenting focus on cost savings and on making disciplined long-term investments for the benefit of our customers, FPL has been able to maintain typical customer bills that are the lowest in the nation when compared to the 20 largest investor-owned utilities in the country.
In addition to low bills, FPL has continued to provide reliability that is by far the best in the state of Florida, achieving its best-ever reliability rate in 2020. FPL's investments to build a stronger, smarter energy grid have resulted in best-in-state reliability for the last 14 years in a row as well as earning numerous national awards. In 2020, FPL was recognized for the fifth time in 6 years as being the most reliable electric utility in the nation.
Let me now turn to Gulf Power. In the 2 years that it has been part of the NextEra Energy family, Gulf Power has realized an approximately 30% reduction in O&M costs, a 50% improvement in service reliability, a 93% improvement in safety and a nearly 20% reduction in CO2 emissions. Gulf Power has grown regulatory capital employed at a 17% compound annual growth rate since 2018, and we are well on our way to achieving the objectives we laid out at our investor conference in 2019.
In addition to the excellent operational execution that we delivered in 2020, we continued to progress our smart capital investment program that is expected to generate further customer benefits over the coming years. In the fourth quarter, we completed the Plant Crist coal-to-natural gas conversion. As a result, consistent with our commitment to remain a clean energy leader, we were able to complete the accelerated shutdown of the coal units at Plant Crist, which has now been renamed the Gulf Clean Energy Center.
With the retirement of FPL's Indiantown Cogeneration facility also occurring late last year, 2021 is the first time in nearly 70 years that there are no coal-fired power plants in Florida for either FPL or Gulf Power. Earlier this month, FPL filed a test year letter with the Florida Public Service Commission to initiate a rate proceeding for new rates beginning in January 2022. The 4-year plan that we intend to propose is designed to provide continued longer-term cost certainty for customers while allowing FPL to continue investing in clean energy, storm-hardened infrastructure and other innovative technologies that are the foundation of our communities.
The stability of multiyear rate plans allows FPL to focus on efficiency in the business, which is critical to keeping customer bills low while, at the same time, enabling FPL to maintain strong credit ratings and balance sheet, which allows for consistent access to the capital markets. We look forward to the opportunity to showcase our long-term track record of providing low bills, high reliability and clean energy for Floridans and plans -- and our plans to build an even more resilient and sustainable energy future for Florida in the coming years.
Turning to Energy Resources. In 2020, we continued to advance our position as the leading developer and operator of wind, solar and battery storage projects, commissioning approximately 5,750 megawatts of new projects, more than doubling the amount of total renewables commissioned versus the previous year. This was also a record year for renewables origination in Energy Resources with the team adding a net nearly 7,000 megawatts to our backlog during the year.
As a result of the team's origination success and alongside the backdrop of the terrific market outlook I just outlined at the beginning of my remarks, we now expect to construct approximately 23 to 30 gigawatts of new renewables in the 2021 to 2024 time frame, which, if we are successful at the midpoint, would mean adding a portfolio of generation projects that is approximately 1.5x the size of Energy Resources' entire operating renewables portfolio as of year-end 2019.
Energy Resources' execution success is reflective of our ability to leverage our significant competitive advantages, including our best-in-class development skills, large pipeline of sites and interconnection queue positions, strong customer relationships, purchasing power, best-in-class construction expertise, resource assessment capabilities, cost of capital advantages and world-class operations capability to capitalize on the ongoing energy transition that is occurring in the nation's generation fleet. We believe that we are in a terrific position to be able to capture a significant share of the market opportunities going forward and what we continue to believe is the best renewables development environment we have ever seen.
Along with the broader public shift towards calls for action to fight climate change, over the past few years, there's been an increased focus on environmental, social and governance, or ESG, on the part of many of our stakeholders. While we expect this trend to amplify demand among our traditional customers and in our core renewables business, we also believe it is opening up significant new markets and business opportunities for Energy Resources. We anticipate our development program to be further enhanced by an ability to attract new nontraditional customers, particularly in the commercial and industrial sector, as improving renewable economics are increasingly aligned with corporate objectives to procure energy from clean generation sources.
In summary, I continue to remain as enthusiastic as ever about NextEra Energy's long-term growth prospects. In 2020, we extended our long track record of executing for the benefit of customers and shareholders and further developed our best-in-class organic growth prospects. Based on the strength and resiliency of our underlying businesses, I will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectation ranges in 2021, 2022 and 2023, while at the same time, maintaining our strong credit ratings. We remain intensely focused on execution and continuing to drive shareholder value over the coming years.
Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which delivered a total unit return -- unitholder return of approximately 32% in 2020, further advancing its history of value creation since the IPO. NextEra Energy Partners is uniquely positioned to take advantage of the disruptive factors reshaping the energy industry and benefit from the enormous market opportunity in the coming decades for renewables. 
NextEra Energy Partners also had a terrific year of execution in 2020 and continue to deliver on its commitments. That history of execution is supported by NextEra Energy Partners' outstanding portfolio of clean energy assets, which was further diversified in 2020. During the year, NextEra Energy Partners acquired interests in approximately 1,100 megawatts of high-quality renewable energy assets, including the partnership's first battery storage project from Energy Resources.
Additionally, during the year, NextEra Energy Partners successfully completed its first 3 organic growth prospects, including the repowering of 275 megawatts of wind projects. For 2020, NextEra Energy Partners grew its LP distributions by 15% year-over-year and delivered 40% year-over-year cash available for distribution growth, highlighting the strength of its operating portfolio. With this strong year-over-year growth in cash available for distribution, NextEra Energy Partners achieved its distribution growth objectives while maintaining a trailing 12-month payout ratio in the high 60% range as of year-end 2020.
In the fourth quarter, we published our first NextEra Energy Partners ESG report, highlighting its high-quality clean energy portfolio, visible opportunities for renewables growth and ability to leverage the operational expertise of NextEra Energy Resources. The continued origination success at Energy Resources is expected to benefit NextEra Energy Partners in meeting its future growth objectives. I continue to believe that the combination of NextEra Energy Partners' clean energy portfolio, growth visibility and flexibility to finance that growth offers LP unitholders a uniquely attractive investor value proposition. As with NextEra Energy, we remain intensely focused on continuing to execute and deliver that unitholder value over the coming years. 
Finally, I would like to take a moment to thank all of NextEra Energy's employees for their continued dedication, hard work and focus during the extraordinary circumstances of the past year. Despite the significant disruption caused by the pandemic and in the midst of the most active hurricane season in the Atlantic Basin on record, our employees' unwavering focus on our customers is what enabled yet another year of flawless execution in the business while also delivering our best-ever safety results across the company. It is because of their commitment to excellence that we were able to deliver above and beyond our commitments in 2020 and why I remain as confident as ever in our ability to deliver on all our expectations moving forward.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Rebecca, who will review the 2020 results in more detail."

Let's now turn to the detailed results beginning with FPL. For the fourth quarter of 2020, FPL reported net income of $502 million or $0.25 per share, up $0.05 per share year-over-year. For the full year 2020, FPL reported net income of $2.65 billion or $1.35 per share, an increase of $0.15 per share versus 2019.
Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 11% for 2020 and was the principal driver of FPL's net income growth of more than 13% for the year. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing its full year capital investments to a total of roughly $6.7 billion. FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes was 11.6% for the 12 months ended December 31, 2020, which is at the upper end of the allowed band of 9.6% to 11.6% under our current rate agreement.
During the fourth quarter, we utilized approximately $100 million of reserve amortization, leaving FPL with a year-end 2020 balance of $894 million. Approximately $206 million of reserve amortization was used to offset the restoration costs associated with Hurricanes Isaias and Tropical Storm Eta, which FPL elected not to recover from customers through a surcharge. FPL's reserve amortization mechanism under its current settlement agreement, combined with our aggressive cost-cutting measures and the benefits of tax reform, has provided significant customer benefits, including avoided surcharges for approximately $1.7 billion in storm restoration costs since 2017.
Our overall capital program at FPL is progressing well. We continue to advance one of the nation's largest-ever solar expansions. During the year, the Florida Public Service Commission approved FPL's SolarTogether program, which is the nation's largest community solar program that is expected to generate $249 million in total net cost savings for participating and nonparticipating customers over the program's life. After commissioning over 1,100 megawatts or more than 3.5x the amount of solar capacity in 2020 versus the prior year, FPL expects to commission roughly 670 megawatts of additional SolarTogether capacity in 2021. And the customer demand for this innovative program across all customer classes remains strong.
Beyond solar, construction of the highly efficient, roughly 1,200-megawatt Dania Beach Clean Energy Center remains on schedule and on budget as it continues to advance towards its projected commercial operations date in 2022. It should be noted that all of these significant accomplishments, including the deployment of nearly $7 billion in capital, were in the midst of not only a global pandemic, but also during the most active hurricane season in the Atlantic Basin on record. We've delivered our best-ever reliability results when our customers needed us the most. And we remain committed to supporting customers experiencing economic hardship as a result of the challenges caused by the pandemic. To date, FPL has provided customers with approximately $75 million in relief through various programs and initiatives. As Florida recovers, we will continue to help our customers navigate this difficult time while maintaining our best-in-class customer value proposition.
Let me now turn to Gulf Power, which, as a reminder, was legally merged into FPL on January 1, 2021, but will continue to be reported as a separate regulated segment during 2021. Gulf Power reported fourth quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $53 million or $0.03 per share, up $0.02 per share year-over-year. For the full year, Gulf Power reported net income of $238 million or $0.12 per share, an increase of $0.02 per share year-over-year on an adjusted basis. Base O&M reductions were the primary driver of Gulf Power's 19% year-over-year growth in adjusted earnings.
Gulf Power's reported ROE for regulatory purposes is expected to be approximately 11.1% for the 12 months ending December 2020, which is near the upper end of the allowed band of 9.25% to 11.25% under its current rate agreement. For the full year 2021, we expect the regulatory ROE to be in the upper half of this allowed band, assuming normal weather and operating conditions.
All of our major capital initiatives at Gulf Power are progressing well. Gulf Power's first solar development project, the roughly 75-megawatt Blue Indigo Solar Energy Center, went into service in 2020 and is expected to generate significant customer savings over its lifetime. Gulf Power anticipates bringing another 150 megawatts of cost-effective, zero-emission solar capacity online later this year.
The North Florida Resiliency Connection, which, among other things, will allow customers to benefit from greater diversity in solar output across 2 different time zones, is expected to be in service in mid-2022. Continued smart capital investments such as these renewables and core infrastructure are expected to drive customer benefits for many years to come.
The Florida economy continues to recover from the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. A number of current economic indicators, including retail taxable sales, new building permits and consumer confidence, have meaningfully improved since the start of the pandemic in early 2020. Additionally, Florida's most recent seasonally adjusted unemployment rate of 6.4% is below the national average. While it is unclear at this point how the economy will be impacted by the current wave of COVID-19 cases, we continue to believe that Florida offers a unique proposition in terms of housing affordability, great weather, low taxes and a pro-business economy, all of which should support ongoing FPL customer growth and economic rebound once the worst of the pandemic is behind us.
We remain deeply engaged in helping Florida return from this stronger than ever, and we will continue to do our part to support that outcome, including pursuing our smart capital investment program and economic development efforts, which help create jobs, provide investment in local communities and further enhance our best-in-class customer value proposition.
During the quarter, FPL's average customer growth was strong, increasing by nearly 76,000 from the comparable prior year quarter. FPL's fourth quarter retail sales were up 0.9% versus the prior year period, largely driven by a 2.3% year-over-year growth in underlying usage per customer. For 2020, FPL's retail sales increased 1.5% versus the prior year, driven primarily by ongoing strong growth in customers and a favorable weather comparison. On a weather-normalized basis, FPL's retail sales increased by 0.7% for the full year 2020. The overall impacts of the pandemic on last year's retail sales were relatively muted, and FPL's underlying usage per customer was flat year-over-year.
For Gulf Power, the average number of customers increased approximately 0.9% versus the comparable prior year quarter. For 2020, Gulf Power's retail sales declined 3.3%, primarily as a result of a more favorable weather in the prior year as well as lower usage per customer, which we attribute in part to the ongoing impacts of the pandemic on our commercial and industrial customers.
As Jim mentioned, FPL is preparing to file a base rate adjustment proposal that would cover the next 4 years, 2022 through 2025, and provide customers longer-term visibility to the future cost of electricity. While the details are still being finalized, we expect the proposal to include base rate adjustments of approximately $1.1 billion starting in January of 2022 and $615 million starting in January of 2023. We also expect the proposal to request support for continued deployment of cost-effective solar with the continuation of our solar base rate adjustment or SoBRA mechanism to recover the revenue requirements associated with up to 900 megawatts of cost-effective solar projects in each of 2024 and 2025, which we currently estimate to be approximately $140 million each year.
For the period 2019 through the end of 2022, FPL is planning to have invested approximately $29 billion, with additional significant investments expected in 2023 and beyond to meet the growing needs of Florida's economy and to continue delivering outstanding value for Florida customers by keeping reliability high and fuel and other costs low. While the benefits of building a stronger, smarter and cleaner grid, more efficient generation fleet are passed along regularly to customers through higher service reliability and lower bills. We must periodically seek recovery for these long-term investments supported by base rates.
As we've previously indicated, we plan to request the Commission to authorize unified rates and capital structure for both FPL and Gulf Power customers. We believe the combination of the 2 businesses will result in approximately $2.8 billion of savings for customers through both operational savings and overall system benefits.
FPL expects to request an 11.5% ROE, inclusive of a 50 basis point incentive for superior performance. Compared with peer utilities in the Southeastern U.S., FPL has the most efficient -- most cost-efficient operations, the highest reliability, the lowest customer bills, all while remaining one of the cleanest utilities in the country, and is widely regarded as the top overall performer in the industry, bringing exceptional value to customers. We believe that the performance adder would reflect FPL's current superior value proposition and encourage strong -- continued strong performance.
In addition, we continue to believe that a strong balance sheet, including strong credit ratings, remains critical to ensure FPL maintains uninterrupted access to the capital markets, even in times of significant market disruption in the aftermath of hurricanes as well as to attract capital to support the investments FPL is making to further improve the value we offer customers. The total of these base rate increase requests over the 4-year period from 2022 to 2025 would result in an estimated average increase in total revenues of about 3.7% per year.
Today, FPL's typical residential bill is about 30% lower than the national average. If the full amount of the requests were granted under our proposal and assuming other utilities experience bill increases only at their historical rate of increase, FPL's typical customer bills would remain significantly lower than the national average through 2025. To put this proposal in context, the proposal would result in a typical customer bill in January 2022 that is nearly 22% less than it was in real terms 15 years ago, even with our proposed base rate increases. Even in nominal terms, FPL bills would be only about 3.5% higher in 2022 than in 2006, a fraction of the nominal increases of 25% to 75% in the cost of groceries, medical care, health insurance and housing over the past 15 years.
Moreover, through the consolidation of FPL and Gulf Power, the typical 1,000 kilowatt-hour residential customer bill in Northwest Florida is projected to be lower in 2025 than it was in 2019. We look forward to the opportunity to present the details of our case and expect to make our formal filing with testimony and required detailed data in March. The timing for the proceeding will ultimately be determined by the Commission, but we currently expect that we will have hearings in the third quarter and a final commission decision in the fourth quarter, in time for new rates to go into effect in January of 2022.
As always, we are open to the possibility of resolving our rate request through a fair settlement agreement. During the course of the past 22 years, FPL has entered into 6 multiyear settlement agreements that have provided customers with a high degree of rate stability and certainty and helped FPL execute to deliver its best-in-class customer value proposition. Our core focus will be to pursue a fair and objective review of our case that supports continued execution of our successful strategy for customers, and we will continue to provide updates throughout the process. 
Energy Resources reported fourth quarter 2020 GAAP loss of $644 million or $0.33 per share. Adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter were $342 million or $0.17 per share. Energy Resources' contribution to adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter is flat versus the prior year comparable period as favorable results from the continued growth and performance in our renewables portfolio were roughly offset by a number of items, none of which are particularly noteworthy. For the full year, Energy Resources reported GAAP earnings of $531 million or $0.27 per share and adjusted earnings of $1.95 billion or $0.99 per share. 
Energy Resources full year adjusted earnings per share contribution increased $0.12 or approximately 14% versus 2019. For the full year, growth was driven by continued new additions to our renewables portfolio as contributions from new investments increased by $0.07 per share. Contributions from existing generation assets increased $0.03 versus 2019 due primarily to increased production tax credit volume from our repowered wind projects and an improvement in wind resource, which were partially offset by the planned nuclear outages and retirement of our Duane Arnold nuclear facility. Also contributing favorably was NextEra Energy Transmission, which increased results by $0.02 year-over-year, primarily as a result of full year contributions from Trans Bay Cable acquisition that closed in the middle of 2019. Contributions from all other impacts were flat year-over-year.
Amid the disruption of the pandemic, Energy Resources had one of its best years ever, including successfully executing on the largest construction program in our history as well as delivering our best year ever for origination, adding a net nearly 7,000 megawatts of new renewables projects to our backlog. In 2020, we commissioned approximately 5,750 megawatts of wind, solar and storage projects on schedule and on budget.
In addition, since the last call, we have added approximately 2,000 megawatts of renewables projects to our backlog, including approximately 1,030 megawatts of new wind and wind repowerings, 670 megawatts of solar and 300 megawatts of battery storage, including 75 additional megawatts of capacity on Desert Peak Storage, which is now expected to total 400 megawatts and remains the world's largest stand-alone storage project.
Following the terrific origination year in 2020, our renewables backlog now stands at approximately 13,500 megawatts. Despite a record year of megawatts placed in service, Energy Resources grew its year-end backlog by approximately 1,500 megawatts year-over-year, providing terrific visibility to the strong growth that lies ahead. Since 2017, our backlog additions have grown at a roughly 25% compound annual growth rate.
As a result of our tremendous progress in 2020 and our strong continued origination success, we are raising our 2021 to 2022 renewables development expectations to a range of 10,525 megawatts to 12,700 megawatts, which at the midpoint is approximately 3,500 megawatts above our previous expectations. Our expectations for 2021 and 2022 are now up more than 50% at the midpoint relative to the expectations that we laid out at the 2019 investor conference, reflecting the significant acceleration of renewables activity over the past 1.5 years. We are also introducing our 2023 to 2024 renewables development expectations of 12,150 megawatts to 17,300 megawatts. This is by far the largest expected 2-year development program in our history and reflects our high level of confidence in Energy Resources' ongoing leadership position in renewable energy development. The accompanying slide provides some additional details.
As we've previously discussed, we are optimistic about the expanded investment opportunities that the broad decarbonization of the U.S. economy presents for Energy Resources, and we are pursuing a number of pilot projects to rapidly develop our capabilities across this potential investment opportunity set. Today, we are announcing a new innovative green hydrogen project in Energy Resources that includes a 12-megawatt solar array, on-site hydrogen production and storage and a hydrogen fuel cell. This emissions-free project will utilize solar energy to create green hydrogen to power the fuel cell, which will be able to provide electricity to the local grid during periods of peak demand. Subject to final terms and regulatory approvals, this approximately $20 million innovative green hydrogen project is expected to begin construction in 2022 with commercial operations in mid-2023.
Energy Resources is also in advanced discussions with a number of potential customers across the industrial landscape, including food processing, specialty chemicals and refineries, to continue to develop clean energy solutions for more efficient green production processes. One potential project includes a solar tracker combined with an electrolyzer at a large industrial plant. The project would deliver green hydrogen as an industrial feedstock for the facility. And when not producing hydrogen, the solar power would offset a portion of the plant's energy consumption, further decarbonizing the facility's operations.
In addition, today, Energy Resources announced a planned partnership to pursue large school bus fleet conversions to electric and hydrogen with the nation's largest school bus owner and operator and transportation services provider. With its partner, Energy Resources anticipates investing in bus electrification upgrades and charging stations as well as providing energy management services. This transaction is consistent with our toe-in-the-water approach as we explore potential opportunities in the electrification of the transportation sector.
We are excited about all of these opportunities as well as the previously announced Hydrogen Pilot Project we plan to propose at FPL's Okeechobee Clean Energy Center, which highlight the significant opportunities that the broad decarbonization of the U.S. economy presents. Consistent with our long-term track record, NextEra Energy will remain disciplined as we take steps to be at the forefront of these developing markets while taking a leadership role in the clean energy transition.
Beyond renewables and storage, since the last earnings call, Mountain Valley Pipeline made progress with its outstanding permitting issues, including receiving the Bureau of Land Management right-of-way grant, which authorizes MVP to cross the Jefferson National Forest once the stream and wetland permitting is complete. While the Fourth Circuit denied a stay request on MVP's new biological opinion, the Court did grant a stay on the Nationwide 12 permit, and the project is now pursuing an alternate path forward to permit and complete stream and wetland crossings.
Due to these continued legal and regulatory issues as well as the substantial delays in commercial operation and increased costs associated with those delays, the carrying value for our investment in MVP now exceeds its fair market value. And as a result, we have reflected a $1.2 billion after-tax impairment in our GAAP financial statements, which we have excluded from adjusted earnings. While we are disappointed with the extended development and construction time line due to the legal challenges that the project has faced, we intend to continue pursuing completing the project with our partners.
Finally, during 2020, NextEra Energy Transmission furthered its efforts to grow America's leading competitive transmission company and had its best year ever. During the year, the business delivered a record earnings contribution and realized constructive rate case outcomes at Trans Bay Cable and Lone Star Transmission as well as entered into an agreement to acquire GridLiance, which owns 3 FERC-regulated transmission utilities spanning 6 states. We continue to expect to obtain all necessary regulatory approvals and close on the GridLiance acquisition in the first half of this year.
Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the fourth quarter of 2020, GAAP net losses attributable to NextEra Energy were $5 million or $0.00 per share. NextEra Energy's 2020 fourth quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $785 million or $0.40 per share, respectively. For the full year 2020, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $2.92 billion or $1.48 per share. Adjusted earnings were $4.55 billion or $2.31 per share. As a reminder, all of our financial results have been adjusted to account for the 4-for-1 stock split, which became effective in the fourth quarter.
For the Corporate and Other segment, adjusted earnings for the full year decreased $0.07 per share compared to the 2019 prior comparable period, primarily as a result of higher interest and refinancing costs associated with certain liability management initiatives completed during the fourth quarter to take advantage of the low interest rate environment.
In total for NextEra Energy, our refinancing activities reduced nominal adjusted net income by roughly $103 million during the fourth quarter, inclusive of approximately $39 million associated with Energy Resources' share of refinancing cost at NextEra Energy Partners. We expect these initiatives to translate into favorable net income contributions in future years and an overall improvement in net present value for our shareholders.
Long-term financial expectations, which we increased and extended late last year through 2023, remain unchanged. For 2021, NextEra Energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.40 to $2.54. For 2022 and 2023, NextEra Energy expects to grow 6% to 8% off the expected 2021 adjusted earnings per share. And we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of these ranges. From 2018 to 2023, we continue to expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at a roughly 10% per year rate through at least 2022 off of a 2020 base. As always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions.
Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which also had a strong year of operational and financial performance in 2020. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $308 million and cash available for distribution was $106 million, an increase of 10% and 8% from the prior year period, respectively. EBITDA growth was driven primarily by favorable resource across the portfolio and the full contributions from new projects acquired in late 2019, and it was slightly offset by a planned outage at our Genesis project late in the fourth quarter.
For the full year 2020, adjusted EBITDA was $1.263 billion, up 14% year-over-year. Cash available for distribution was $570 million, an increase of 40% from the prior year. Similar to the quarterly results, full year growth in adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by full year contributions from acquisitions in the prior year and favorable wind resource. For the full year, wind resource was 100% of the long-term average versus 97% in 2019. The benefit to cash available for distribution from lower project-level debt service was partially offset by higher corporate level interest expense. As a reminder, these results include the impact of IDR fees, which we treat as an operating expense. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide.
Yesterday, the NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.615 per common unit or $2.46 per unit on an annualized basis, up 15% from the comparable quarterly distribution a year earlier and at the top end of the range we discussed going into 2020.
During 2020, NextEra Energy Partners executed several financing to support its ongoing growth investments and optimize its capital structure for the benefit of LP unitholders. As Jim mentioned, during the quarter, we closed on an acquisition from Energy Resources of interest in an approximately 1,100-megawatt portfolio of long-term contracted renewables projects. As part of this transaction, NextEra Energy Partners raised a 10-year, approximately $1.1 billion convertible equity portfolio financing that includes the acquired assets plus 4 existing NextEra Energy Partners wind and solar projects.
Combining this acquisition with the recapitalization of 4 existing NextEra Energy Partners assets through the longest-dated and lowest-cost convertible equity portfolio financing in the partnership's history is expected to provide significant benefits for unitholders. By leveraging the strong demand for high-quality clean energy assets, NextEra Energy Partners was able to secure financing for both the current transaction and future growth while enhancing returns for LP unitholders and limiting downside risk.
NextEra Energy Partners expects to further strengthen its balance sheet and have access to approximately $2.4 billion in available financing capacity, including capacity under its corporate revolving credit facility and commitments from investors to potential future convertible equity portfolio financings, which further supports the partnership's long-term growth.
During the second half of the year, NextEra Energy Partners completed the successful conversion of approximately $300 million of convertible debt and the remaining balance of the convertible preferred securities that were issued in 2017 into approximately 5.7 million and 4.7 million units -- common units, respectively. These conversions helped NextEra Energy Partners achieve its goal of using low-cost financing products to efficiently issue equity over time.
Finally, NextEra Energy Partners raised approximately $600 million in new 0% coupon convertible notes during the quarter and used the net proceeds from this offering to redeem a portion of its outstanding 4.25% senior notes due in 2024. Coincident with the issuance of the convertible notes, NextEra Energy Partners entered into a capped call structure that will result in NextEra Energy Partners retaining up to 90% of the upside in its unit price associated with the convertible note over the next 5 years. 
NextEra Energy Partners run rate expectations for adjusted EBITDA and CAFD at December 31, 2021, remain unchanged. Year-end 2021 run rate adjusted EBITDA expectations are $1.44 to $1.62 billion and CAFD in the range of $600 million to $680 million. As a reminder, all of our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated IDR fees as we treat these as an operating expense.
From an updated base of our fourth quarter 2020 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.46, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2021 distribution that is payable in February of 2022 to be in a range of $2.76 to $2.83 per common unit.
In summary, we continue to believe that both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners have excellent prospects for growth both in the near and longer term. FPL, Energy Resources and NextEra Energy Partners each have outstanding set of opportunities across the board. The progress we made in 2020 reinforces our longer-term growth prospects. And while we have a lot to execute on in 2021, we believe that we have the building blocks in place for another excellent year.
That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open up the line for your questions."

First, obviously, the project has taken longer and cost more than what we anticipated. And so the impairment is really related to reflecting not only that value that we have on our books but really in relation to what we believe is the current fair valuation for the investment, given what we do still have to accomplish. And obviously, a lot changed in the fourth quarter, including the Nationwide 12 permit stay that I mentioned in the prepared remarks as well as the various things that have happened in January and against the backdrop of obvious changes, including the change in the administration, including the change in control of the Senate, which happened here in January.
So the impairment does reflect our view of what we still need to accomplish and the associated fair values related to the chances of being able to successfully execute on that. But this was an accounting exercise. It was a lot of due diligence that we needed to evaluate, and we think we've made the appropriate changes. But it does not change our commitment to work with our partners to put this project into service. So as I noted in the comments, we do have now a path that we're going to pursue in terms of the outstanding permitting. We'll work closely with our partners to pursue that path. But we thought it was appropriate and obviously took the actions that we did with respect to the impairment."

And that's just accelerated, in particular, over the last 24 months. I think what that means is it's changed a bit of our analytic framework of how we think about utility M&A. On the one hand, I continue to believe there's enormous value creation that we can bring to the table, and you only need to look at what we've been able to do with Gulf in the last 24.5 months to see how much value creation, bringing our playbook and our operating platform the Bay Area can create, right? So that is -- that, I think, remains clear. And if anything, it's clearer to me.
On the other, I think it's also clear that probably a sweet spot for us in terms of M&A is things in the less than $20 billion range that we can pay cash and finance through the normal course. And at that point, if you do that, you're not shifting the mix one way or another all that tremendously. And in our set of analytics, we're looking really more at how much value creation are we bringing to the table when we do this. And so for example, I think Santee Cooper is a great example of that. That's -- it's roughly $8 billion or $9 billion transaction and something that we can finance in the normal course in a place where we think we can create enormous value very quickly.
And so that's the kind of things that we're focused on. And -- but most importantly, we're focused on running the business and executing, staying financially disciplined as we always have been and executing against the terrific growth prospects we have in Energy Resources and then executing at FPL as we always have for the benefit of our customers and continuing and for the benefit of the state.

Secondly, the new expectations explicitly do not include any future build-own-transfer. How do you see that as incremental? And any heuristics you might offer as to how to think about value creation there?
And the third one on that, if I can just throw in there, is the attach rates on storage. It seems like the bulk of the storage that you're talking about in the future is probably tied to your solar assets. How do you think about stand-alone as being incremental to what you've talked about already? I'll leave it there."

Julien, thanks for the questions, and you may need to prompt me if I forgot one or more aspects of the multipart question. Let me start with C&I. As I highlighted in the prepared remarks, John and his team across Energy Resources have really cultivated a nice suite of opportunities with C&I customers. And if we look at our core base of other major investor-owned utilities, our munis and co-ops and our C&I business, other investor-owned utilities, munis and co-ops are still larger overall, but the opportunity set with C&I customers is definitely growing, not just in your standard PPA, but more in the suite of types of opportunities that I mentioned as one of the pilot projects that John and his team are pursuing, kind of a more holistic energy solution provider to these C&I customers.
And I think what's really changed over the last year plus, maybe it's even 2 years, is the inbound request to C&I has really expanded as they really start to look at their own carbon footprint, their own ESG messaging. How do they source energy to do their business and how do they source that from a cleaner energy solutions has become a higher topic of interest and higher priority for them and, therefore, a terrific opportunity set for us. So I think that's a growing opportunity for us that we continue to be really excited about.
In terms of build-own-transfers, we will continue to present our expectations, both our expectations and our signed contracts consistent in the way that we've shown it in the past, that there will be some build-own-transfer that Energy Resources pursues. If it is a strict, just sell the project to somebody else. We think there's a lot of value creation there, but we won't necessarily incorporate in our backlog for purposes of reporting, unless there is a long-term operation and maintenance or other stream of revenue to us that we benefit from. So we'll consistently report that. I think the opportunity set is there for both traditional build-own-transfers as well as build-own-transfers where we provide some incremental long-term value to our customers.
And then finally, storage, the opportunity set is terrific. Obviously, we've had tremendous success in attaching storage to new solar facilities, existing solar facilities and even some stand-alone storage projects. If there is a stand-alone storage incentive that Congress pursues, obviously, that would support near-term growth of stand-alone storage opportunities even beyond what we've seen, but the growth is terrific. And as we outlined back in 2019, we were surprised how fast the market evolved, and I think we continue to be really supportive of that overall market.
And one last thing I'll highlight, Julien, is really the innovative nature of the FPL team in working with the SolarTogether program to work with our commercial and industrial customers in Florida to support their needs to build the most cost-effective solar. And that's what the SolarTogether program offered them is the ability to really source clean energy solutions in the most profitable way for them and in a way that we structured the benefits both for those participating customers and nonparticipating customers to meet their needs.
So let me stop there, Julien. Did I miss any aspect of it?"

So a tremendous amount of leverage off the existing operating fleet. And with new origination, I think of attach rates being roughly 60% on all the new stuff that we do.
And then one more comment on C&I. We are positioning the business to be the preferred strategic partner with C&I customers. And we are looking at the business in a holistic way where we can provide clean energy solutions across the board. It's wind, it's solar, it's storage, it's hydrogen, it's mobility.

From an NextEra Energy perspective, as you would expect, and when we provide expectations, we do a variety of scenario planning analyses to feel comfortable with the expectations that we've laid out. So there's not one answer to what you have in your assumptions that you've laid out for expectations. There's a range, and we feel comfortable today, as we've obviously reiterated those expectations, for the 2021, '22 and '23 timeframes.
So we look forward to presenting our case to the Commission and stakeholders. We feel very confident in the decisions that we've made in terms of where we've been investing, where we plan to invest. And obviously, the results, to some measure, obviously speak for themselves in terms of low bills, high reliability, terrific customer service and a clean energy profile that is substantial. And we're obviously looking forward to not only telling that story, but also the Gulf changes over the last couple of years that Jim highlighted.

And we'll know more, obviously, over the next 90 days or so.
On NextEra Energy Transmission, I think Rebecca, in her prepared remarks, had just a terrific year last year, their best year ever as a company. Remember, we started that business from scratch a little over 10 years ago. And it's a business that made over $100 million in net income last year and we think has the ability to grow mid-teens, double-digit over the next several years just organically with what they have in front of them without doing any other acquisitions. And we are pursuing other acquisitions there because we think we add an enormous amount of value through our operating model, number one.
And then number two, probably the biggest inhibitor to renewables in this country is not consumer demand or it is not interest on the part of the federal government or state governments to get renewables built. It's not that customers don't want it. It is fundamentally broken processes with the ISOs in terms of how they manage their queues and transmission and just broadly transmission planning in this country. And I think with the Biden administration and a new FERC, there is a new opportunity to fix that. And our transmission business, I think, is a great example of what FERC Order 1000 can do when you get competition going in the transmission world. And it is also, I think, every bit of transmission we build in that business is incremental and helpful to the renewable business that we have and that it makes the delivery of lower-cost renewables even more fast to come on to the grid than they otherwise would. So I'm very excited about the transmission business. We're going to continue to push it, and I think it's got a lot of runway to grow."

A",527,"So Michael, I think you're being kind, honestly, to the regulated coal fleet in this country. There is not a regulated coal plant in this country that is economic today, full period, end of stop when it's dispatched on any basis, not a single one, okay? And so why haven't it -- I think you've hit on the crux of some of the issues. Obviously, there have been, in certain states, a reluctance to let our utility customers retire the coal plant and then be able to recover their investment, right? And so, of course, if you run a utility, you don't want to retire an asset that you're going to then either have to write-off or not be able to earn on, right?
I think one of the things that has been really constructive and very smart about the Florida regulatory environment or the Commission's view on modernizing the generation fleet is that they have -- we've spread that capital recovery over a period of 5 or 10 years. And that has both, I think, moderated the impact to customer bills, on the one hand, and also on the other, given us the right incentive to do the right thing by our customers and bring on lower-cost generation.
So I think it's about -- the other piece, I think, that's going to change is there is no question, this administration through the EPA and other means is going to make the continued operation of coal plants very difficult in this country. And so there's going to be, I think, more pressure, more federal pressure to accelerate that transition away from coal than there has been, obviously, over the last 4 years, where there's been, in fact, the opposite of federal pressure, but the complete lack of federal pressure to do anything about with your coal fleet.
So I think the combination of that plus states becoming -- it becoming clearer and clearer the economics as we go along, that the operating cost of coal plants are higher than the new build cost of renewables with storage as that becomes even clearer as costs come down for renewables and costs continue to go up, operating costs continue to go up for coal. That's -- I mean the bottom line in Florida, we've shut our coal down, and we've saved customers literally billions of dollars of present value over the expected life of the new generation we put in place.
So there's an enormous opportunity. There are several states in the country that are not taking advantage of that opportunity because of some of the regulatory approaches. And honestly, I think with the new administration and some of the policies there, that's going to accelerate the replacement of coal in this country. And it should be because there's no -- it's costing customers money. Leave aside the environmental benefits, just on pure economics that's costing customers' money every day, and that's bad for the country and let alone that it's terrible for the climate, it is -- and for the environment, it is bad for customers because economics are -- the coal economics are so out of whack."

Throughout today's presentation, when we refer to FPL, we are referring to Florida Power & Light, excluding Gulf Power, unless otherwise noted or when using the term combined. 
With that, I will turn the call over to Rebecca."

NextEra Energy is off to a terrific start in 2021 and has made excellent progress in the core focus areas that we discussed on the last call. Adjusted earnings per share increased nearly 14% year-over-year,",3860,"Thank you, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy is off to a terrific start in 2021 and has made excellent progress in the core focus areas that we discussed on the last call. Adjusted earnings per share increased nearly 14% year-over-year, reflecting successful performance across all of the businesses. FPL increased net income by approximately $78 million from the prior year comparable period which was driven by continued investment in the business for the benefit of our customers. 
During the quarter, FPL successfully placed in service approximately 300 megawatts of additional cost-effective solar projects built under its SolarTogether program, which remains the largest community solar program in the nation. FPL now owns and operates approximately 2,640 megawatts of solar on its combined system, which is more than any other utility in the country. FPL's other major capital investments, including the 409-megawatt Manatee Energy Storage Center and highly efficient 1,200-megawatt Dania Beach Clean Energy Center are also on schedule and on budget. By executing on smart capital investments such as these, FPL is able to maintain its best-in-class customer value proposition of clean energy, low bills, high reliability and outstanding customer service. FPL's typical residential bill remains well below the national average and the lowest in the nation among the 20 largest U.S. investor-owned utilities, while our service reliability has never been higher. 
Gulf Power also had a strong quarter of execution. The focus on the operational cost effectiveness at Gulf Power continues to progress well with a 43% increase in net income year-over-year, primarily driven by year-to-date O&M costs declining by approximately 21% versus the prior year comparable period and by more than 34% relative to 2018. Gulf Power also delivered further improvements in service reliability and employee safety, with no OSHA recordables year-to-date through the end of March. We remain committed to delivering on the objectives that we have previously outlined at Gulf Power and continue to expect to generate significant customer and shareholder value over the coming years. 
At Energy Resources, adjusted earnings increased 13% year-over-year, and it was another strong quarter of renewables origination with our backlog increasing by approximately 1,750 megawatts since the last call. We continue to see increased stakeholder focus on environmental, social and governance, or ESG factors, helping to drive accelerated demand for diversified clean energy solutions among new nontraditional customers, particularly in the commercial and industrial sector as an attractive source of incremental growth for Energy Resources in the coming years. 
We have been encouraged by the Biden administration's focus on clean energy and the emphasis they have placed on it in their budget and in the upcoming infrastructure package. We continue to work with the administration on their important efforts around extensions of existing renewable credits, new credits for transmission and storage, including hydrogen as well as a new clean energy standard for the electric sector. We support a clean energy standard that accelerates the decarbonization of the electric grid and enables the decarbonization of the transportation and industrial sectors as well. We believe that no energy company in the world has been more committed, consistent and proactive in promoting smart investments in clean energy technology as we have been for over 2 decades. As the push for action to address climate change and acceleration of progress towards decarbonization creates new and enhanced renewable incentives across our industry, we continue to believe that no company is better positioned than NextEra Energy to continue to drive change and capitalize on these trends. 
At this early point in the year, we are very pleased with our progress at FPL, Gulf Power and Energy Resources. 
Now let's turn to the detailed results, beginning first with FPL. For the first quarter of 2021, FPL reported net income of $720 million or $0.37 per share. Earnings per share increased $0.04 year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed growth of 10.8% was a significant driver of FPL's EPS growth versus the prior year comparable quarter. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $1.4 billion for the quarter, and we expect our full year capital investments to be between $6.6 billion and $6.8 billion. FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.6% for the 12 months ending March 2021. During the quarter, we utilized $316 million of reserve amortization to achieve our target regulatory ROE, leaving FPL with a balance of $578 million. As we've previously discussed, FPL historically utilizes more reserve amortization in the first half of the year given the pattern of its underlying revenues and expenses, and we expect to continue this trend this year. 
Let me now turn to Gulf Power, which reported first quarter 2021 net income of $57 million or $0.03 per share. Gulf Power's capital expenditures were $170 million for the quarter as it continues to execute on smart capital investments for the benefit of customers, and we expected full capital investments for the year to be between $800 million and $900 million. All of Gulf Power's major capital investments, including the North Florida Resiliency Connection that is expected to be in service in mid-2022, continued to progress well. As a result of these ongoing investments, regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 16% year-over-year. Gulf Power's reported ROE for regulatory purposes is expected to be approximately 10.4% for the 12 months ending March 2021. 
Turning to our development and planning efforts. We recently filed an updated 10-year site plan for FPL and Gulf Power which we expect will begin to operate as an integrated electric system in 2022. The 10-year site plan projects that zero-emission sources will provide nearly 40% on of all energy produced across the combined FPL system in 2030, largely as a result of FPL's continued rapid expansion of solar energy through the execution of its 30-by-30 plan and success in its coal phaseout strategy. FPL expects to add 3,800 megawatts of additional cost-effective solar over the next 4 years, and we now control all of the land needed to meet our projected solar deployment of 11.7 gigawatts by 2030 for the combined FPL system. 
The site plan also reflects an expected total deployment of more than 1,200 megawatts of storage capacity by 2030. This plan is consistent with our belief that renewable generation and particularly solar, paired with battery storage in Florida, is an increasingly cost-effective form of generation in most parts of the U.S. As we execute on these opportunities, we project that FPL's combined emissions rate will be 62% lower in 2030 than the industry average was in 2005 and 20% lower than the U.S. Department of Energy's projected industry average in 2030. 
Moreover, we continue to plan and invest in sustainable solutions to broaden how we serve customers and prepare for an even cleaner future. During the quarter, FPL placed in service nearly 70 new electric vehicle charging ports and is now operating nearly 400 electric vehicle charging ports in the state as part of our goal to install more than 1,000 charging ports in more than 100 locations across the combined FPL service area from 2019 through 2022. As we've previously discussed, we are also developing a hydrogen electrolysis pilot project at FPL's Okeechobee combined cycle unit as part of our efforts to introduce further fuel diversity and resiliency into FPL's generation system. The approximately 25-megawatt solar connected electrolyzer that will be used to generate clean hydrogen as part of the Okeechobee pilot will be the largest of its kind in the U.S. to date. While these projects are just a few examples of our advanced deployment efforts at FPL, we are excited about the immense opportunities that lie ahead as our industry moves towards cleaner, more sustainable future. 
The Florida economy continues to recover from the early effects of the pandemic and is among the strongest in the nation. The current unemployment rate of 4.7% is well below the national average. The real estate sector continues to grow with average building permits and the Case-Shiller Index for South Florida up approximately 6% and 10%, respectively, versus the prior year. Florida's retail sales index continued its quarter-over-quarter improvement, which is a further indication of the ongoing health in our economy and bolsters our confidence in our smart investment strategy required to serve anticipated demand growth. 
During the quarter, FPL's average number of customers increased by approximately 71,400 or 1.4% versus the comparable prior year quarter, driven by continued solid underlying population growth. FPL's first quarter retail sales decreased 1.7% from the prior year comparable period, which is primarily due to mild weather in the first quarter of this year versus 2020. We estimate that approximately 3% of the decline can be attributed to weather-related usage per customer. On a weather normalized basis, first quarter retail sales increased 1.3%, with continued strong underlying usage contributing favorably. 
For Gulf Power, the average number of customers grew 1.1% versus the comparable prior year quarter, driven by continued economic growth in Northwest Florida. Gulf Power's first quarter retail sales increased 2.9% year-over-year, primarily due to favorable weather. 
On March 12, we submitted testimony and detailed supporting information for Florida Power & Light's 2021 base rate proceeding. The overall proposal for our 2022 through 2025 base rate plan is substantially consistent with the test year letter filed in January. We are requesting a base rate adjustment of approximately $1.1 billion starting in January '22; $607 million starting in January of 2023; and solar-based rate adjustments, or SoBRA mechanisms, in 2024 and 2025 for up to 1,788 megawatts of cost-effective solar. 
We are proud to offer our customers service that ranks among the cleanest and the most reliable in the country, with typical residential bills of approximately 13% below state average and importantly, nearly 10% lower than in 2006. The 4-year base plan has been designed to support continued investments in the long-term infrastructure and advanced technology, which continues to improve our already best-in-class reliability and helps keep customer bills low. With the proposed base rate adjustments and current projections for fuel and other costs, we believe that FPL's typical residential bill will grow at an average annual rate of about 3.4% from January 2021 through the end of 2025, which is expected to result in FPL's typical residential bill being approximately 20% below the projected national average and more than 20% lower than our typical bills 15 years ago when adjusted for inflation. Typical Gulf Power residential bills are projected to decrease approximately 1% over the 4-year rate plan. 
The Florida Public Service Commission has established a schedule for this proceeding, beginning with the quality of service hearings in June and technical hearings in late August. The proceedings would conclude in the fourth quarter with a staff recommendation and commission rulings on revenue requirements and rates. We look forward to the opportunity to present our case to the commission this summer, and our focus will be to pursue a balanced outcome that supports continued execution of our successful strategy for customers. As always, we are open to the possibility of resolving our rate request through a fair settlement agreement. 
Energy Resources reported first quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $491 million or $0.25 per share. Adjusted earnings for the first quarter were $598 million or $0.30 per share, up 13% versus the prior year comparable period. New investments added $0.04 per share, primarily reflecting growth in the renewables and storage business, including more than 2,700 megawatts of new contracted wind projects that were commissioned during 2020. The extreme market conditions in Texas in February were the primary driver of the underperformance in our existing generation portfolio and customer supply and trading business as well as the favorable performance in the gas infrastructure business. As a reminder, when weather events like this occur, we operate our businesses in Texas as a portfolio. And while there were pluses and minuses during these events, we believe the end result is a testament to the strength of our large and well-diversified business. All other impacts increased results by $0.03 versus 2020. 
As I mentioned earlier, Energy Resources development team had another strong quarter of origination. We added 503 megawatts of new solar projects to our backlog, including 190 megawatts of solar that will be paired with approximately 100 megawatts of 4-hour battery storage capacity. In 2020, our market share of signed contracts and co-located solar-plus storage assets in the U.S. was more than 35%, and we are excited about the continued trend in demand for co-located storage solutions as we anticipate even further cost synergies by pairing low-cost renewables with storage solutions in the coming decades as being an important part of decarbonization in our sector. 
We also added 916 megawatts of new wind projects to our backlog for 2022. In addition, our backlog increased by Energy Resources share of Next Energy Partners' planned acquisition of 391 megawatts of operating wind projects announced earlier this week. With the approximately 1,750 megawatts added this quarter, our backlog of signed contracts at Energy Resources now totals approximately 15,250 megawatts, supporting our industry-leading long-term growth expectations. We remain enthusiastic about the expanded investment opportunities that the broad decarbonization of the U.S. economy presents for energy resources, and we continue to evaluate pilot projects for industrial, transportation and electric sector applications. In addition to the pilots and partnerships we've discussed on prior calls, we recently committed to make a minority investment in a clean energy technology company that has developed a proprietary process to essentially decarbonize the industrial production of hydrogen at economic prices. This investment and the hydrogen pilots we've announced to date show the promise of electrification across our economy and we are excited for the opportunity to participate in these new markets and build renewables to support future growth in demand for electricity. Consistent with our long-term track record, we will remain disciplined as we take steps to be at the forefront of this developing market while taking a leadership role in the clean energy transition. 
Beyond renewables and storage, NextEra Energy Transmission furthered its efforts to build America's leading competitive transmission company with the closing of its acquisition of GridLiance occurring at the end of last month. GridLiance, which owns 3 FERC-regulated transmission utilities spanning 6 states, is an excellent complement to our existing operations and further expand NextEra Energy's regulated business through the addition of attractive rate-regulated assets. Next Energy Transmission now owns regulated assets in 10 states and 6 regional transmission organizations. Growth in renewables means that there is also a growing imperative to build additional transmission across the U.S. to support this transmission to a low-cost, low-carbon economy, fueled by renewable energy. Our incorporation of GridLiance into our portfolio furthers our strategy to be North America's leading competitive transmission provider, both to deploy capital profitably as well as to enable further renewables deployment. 
Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the first quarter of 2021, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $1.67 billion or $0.84 per share. NextEra Energy's 2021 first quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $1.33 billion and $0.67 per share, respectively. Adjusted earnings from Corporate and Other segment were roughly flat year-over-year. 
Long-term financial expectations, which we increased and extended late last year through 2023, remain unchanged. For 2021, NextEra Energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.40 to $2.54. For 2022 and 2023, NextEra Energy expects to grow 6% to 8% off of the expected 2021 adjusted earnings per share, and we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of these ranges in 2021, 2022 and 2023, while at the same time maintaining our strong credit ratings. From 2018 to 2023, we continue to expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow dividends per share roughly 10% rate per year through at least 2022 off of a 2020 base. As always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions. 
Let me now turn to Next Energy Partners, which delivered very strong first quarter results with year-over-year growth in adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution of approximately 20% and 36%, respectively. Yesterday, the Next Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.6375 per common unit or $2.55 per common unit on an annualized basis, up approximately 15% from a year earlier. Inclusive of this increase, NextEra Energy Partners has grown its distribution per unit by 240% since the IPO. 
Further building on that strength, NextEra Energy Partners recently announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire an approximately 400-megawatt portfolio of long-term contracted wind assets. This transaction will be NextEra Energy Partners first third-party acquisition of renewable energy assets and represents another step towards growing LP unit distributions in a manner consistent with our previously stated expectations of 12% to 15% per year through at least 2024. I'll provide additional details on the transaction in just a few minutes. 
Turning to the detailed quarterly results. NextEra Energy Partners' first quarter adjusted EBITDA was $354 million, and cash available for distribution was $184 million. New projects, which primarily reflect the asset acquisitions that closed at the end of 2020, contributed $27 million of adjusted EBITDA and $13 million of cash available for distribution. Existing projects added $39 million of adjusted EBITDA and $23 million of cash available for distribution. This strong year-over-year increase in adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution includes favorable results from NextEra Energy Partners wind and natural gas pipeline investments in Texas during the February winter storm, partially offset by the impacts of an accelerated outage at our Genesis project during the quarter. Cash available for distribution also benefited from a reduction in corporate level interest payments, primarily as a result of certain refinancing activities completed in the fourth quarter of last year. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide. 
As I previously mentioned, we continue to execute on our plan to expand NextEra Energy Partners portfolio and recently entered into an agreement to acquire an approximately 400-megawatt portfolio of long-term contracted operating wind projects. The portfolio has a cash available distribution weighted average contract life of approximately 13 years with high credit quality customers and further enhances the diversity of NextEra Energy Partners' existing portfolio. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of this year, subject to customary closing conditions and the receipt of certain regulatory approvals and generate an attractive CAFD yield and be immediately accretive to LP distributions. This transaction demonstrates the NextEra Energy Partners' continued ability to execute on its long-term growth plan and it's enhanced by our ability to take advantage of Energy Resources' best-in-class operating platform to reduce operating expenses at the asset. Energy Resources continues to leverage our culture of continuous improvement to realize lower costs across the renewable assets that it operates. Since 2017, Energy Resources have reduced fleet-wide dollar per megawatt hour O&M cost in its wind fleet by more than 30%. And we believe both Energy Resources wind and solar operating expenses are significantly better than its industry peers. With Energy Resources operating the NextEra Energy Partners renewable assets, these cost advantages directly benefit LP unitholders. 
Over the coming years, we look forward to leveraging the benefits of Energy Resources' operating portfolio platform for both Next Energy Partners' existing portfolio as well as to add incremental value to future third-party acquisitions. In addition to providing attractive base returns, these projects are well situated in attractive markets that we anticipate will have significant long-term renewables demand, supporting asset recontracting or potential repowering opportunities after the initial contract terms. We continue to believe that the existing NextEra Energy Partners portfolio has meaningful organic growth opportunities over the coming years and expect the portfolio we are acquiring provides additional long-term investment opportunities as well. 
NextEra Energy Partners expect to acquire the portfolio for a base purchase price of approximately $733 million, subject to closing adjustments. The portfolio of assets is expected to contribute adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution of approximately $63 million to $70 million, each on a 5-year average annual run rate basis beginning in December of -- December 31, 2021. We believe this transaction is an attractive investment in which to deploy the $345 million of undrawn funds from the 2020 convertible equity portfolio financing, which we used to fund the acquisition along with existing NextEra Energy Partners debt capacity. 
Following the recently announced transaction, we now expect to be in the upper end of our previously disclosed year-end 2021 run rate adjusted EBITDA and CAFD expectation ranges of $1.44 billion to $1.62 billion, and $600 million to $680 million, respectively. As a reminder, all of our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated IDR fees as we treat these as an operating expense. 
From a base of our fourth quarter 2020 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.46, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2021 distribution that is payable in February of 2022 to be in the range of $2.76 to $2.83 per common unit. 
In summary, after a strong start to the year, we remain as enthusiastic as ever about the long-term growth prospects for both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. At FPL, we continue to focus on delivering our best-in-class customer value proposition through operational cost effectiveness, productivity and making smart long-term investments. Energy Resources maintains significant competitive advantages and continues to capitalize on the best renewables development period in our history. Combined with the strength of our balance sheet and credit ratings, NextEra Energy is uniquely positioned to drive long-term shareholder value, and we remain intensely focused on executing on these opportunities. NextEra Energy Partners is well positioned to deliver on its already best-in-class runway for LP distribution growth. 
Finally, last month, we were honored that NextEra Energy was ranked #1 in a sector for Fortune Magazine's most admired -- World's Most Admired Companies list for the 14th time in 15 years. Moreover, we are recognized for the 14th time as one of the world's most ethical companies by Ethisphere Institute, which is a testament to our team of nearly 15,000 employees who are committed to our core values while helping to build a sustainable energy era that is affordable and clean. In the coming weeks, we expect to publish NextEra Energy's 2021 ESG Report, which we believe establishes our full alignment with the task force for climate-related financial disclosures or TCFD recommendations. We are also excited to announce our commitment to participation in the Carbon Disclosure Project Survey Later this year. These enhanced disclosures highlight the alignment of our corporate strategy with the key tenets of ESG, which our company has been focused on for more than 25 years and remains key to execution of our strategy moving forward. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, I will open up the line for questions."

And I appreciate all -- I was going to say the question, but I think it's multiple questions in there. So I'll start and ask John can -- I guess John or Jim can jump in if they want to add something. We are very excited about opportunities in transmission. And it is founded on a couple of points that I highlighted in the script. First is we couldn't be more excited, as you well know, about the renewables opportunities across the U.S. in the coming decades. A key part of all of those opportunities -- or at least a lot of those opportunities in the latter part of this decade going into the 2030s and beyond, is some level of build-out of transmission in the U.S. beyond what's been accomplished. So both to enable long-term renewables development, but also to capitalize on those opportunities, leaves us very interested in transmission. The Energy Resources team has done a terrific job growing that business, both through organic opportunities, so long-term development efforts of identifying opportunities, participating in processes and ultimately securing opportunities to invest and build and bring successfully into line -- into operations, some of those lines as well as through acquisitions. Obviously, with GridLiance being the most recent and Trans Bay Cable not being too much far behind it. 
I expect that we'll grow the business through both going forward as well, continued efforts on the development side as well as participating in opportunities to acquire investments as they come to market. 
On the FERC transmission side, we do think there are lots of opportunities to improve how transmission is sited and built across the U.S. And we're optimistic that this administration and this FERC will start to focus on those. And I think it's both through FERC as well as potential focus on transmission in this infrastructure package. So a lot of opportunities to invest in the future."

So we look forward to the opportunity to articulating that through this process. 
As it relates to settlements, as you know, here in Florida, there is a great history of settlement agreements, not just with Florida Power & Light Company, but other utilities in the state. We do think that opportunities to have a negotiated outcome that meets the needs of all stakeholders and historically that has produced consistent rates for many years in the future that provides tremendous value for customers. There's a great history of that. We, of course, will be open to it. But it's very early in this process. And again, we look forward to being able to put forward our case."

Really think about it as we bring assets into the portfolio, it really gets leveraged on the platform that we already operate. And so the team is really excited about how we can add incremental value through the Energy Resources management of these assets at NextEra Energy Partners. We've been very excited about NextEra Energy Partners' growth outlook for quite some time. As we've always indicated, it's well founded -- our excitement is well founded, just simply looking at the backlog of both operating and signed contracts and then the potential for new contracts in Energy Resources. But I've always alluded to the fact that really our market opportunity is this broader market set. And we'll continue to engage and look for opportunities. 
I do think there are more opportunities out there for third-party acquisitions on the renewable side. It's an area of focus for us to continue to participate in. But we've got the 3 ways to grow. And to the extent that we can put opportunities to gather, great, and we'll take advantage of them over time, but we also continue to have terrific organic opportunities in NEP, particularly as the portfolio grows and then, of course, the continued success of Energy Resources in the broader market is very positive."

I think this is a process that's going to play out over months, not weeks. There's obviously a lot in the plan that's very positive from a renewable standpoint. And as Rebecca said in the prepared remarks, we are excited to work with the administration on the plan that I think is really going to accelerate the decarbonization of the U.S. economy over the next -- over the next several years. In a way that as we've always said for a long time, is going to be essentially free to customers, i.e., not more expensive for customers, right? I mean the thing about the green economy is that it's cleaner, it's greener, but it's also cheaper. And that's why it's so powerful. 
So a lot of details obviously still to be worked out. We're working them. As you can imagine, it's very early and probably too early for me to comment on any of the specific details that we feel like need some work versus the ones that we like a lot. On the tax front, I think, obviously, that's -- there are a lot of puts and takes with taxes, particularly in a company that has both utility assets as well as renewable assets, and we're working through it. Think about the tax rate being -- tax rate going up something in the $0.04 to $0.07 of headwind. I'm not particularly worried about that in the context of all the other things that would be positive for our company if the infrastructure bill gets passed. And so we continue to work, obviously, that as well. And lots of details still to be laid out on the minimum tax issue. And that also matters as to what the final corporate rate ends up being. 
And I guess the last thing I would say is none of this is going to be easy to get done. It's very narrow margins in both the Senate and the House. And folks tend to focus on the Senate and extraordinarily narrow margin given kind of vacancies in the House right now as well. And there's -- the history on midterm elections suggests that it's always an uphill battle for the current administration in midterm -- for whatever parties in power in the midterm elections of of presidency. So that, on the one hand, I think puts some urgency, I think, around the administration's push to get something done this year. But the flip side is it also there's a lot of risk for moderate democrats to take a vote on some of these issues. So it's going to be very -- any change will be very hard. And I think we were very much a part of the -- we've always been very active in terms of what happens around clean energy policy in Washington, and you can imagine that we're remaining very active on that front and working it very hard. But I will just say in closing that we're very much encouraged by the focus of the administration on decarbonizing the economy. We feel like it's absolutely the right thing to do, right thing for the planet and the right thing for customers and the right thing for the country, and we stand ready to support an infrastructure plan that accelerates that decarbonization. And I think any acceleration of what's already going on just because of the amazing economics that renewables have relative to the other alternatives plus what's going on with hydrogen, and you saw there was a PTC -- hydrogen PTC as part of the -- suggested as part of the infrastructure plan. So there's a lot of very positive things in there that we're going to be working on to build on over the next several months."

The first part, which is the latter term view, is when w",553,"Perfect. Thanks, Stephen. Let me start with the longer-term view first and then come back to the shorter-term view which would really tie into, I think, the latter part of your question and comment. The first part, which is the latter term view, is when we look at substantial deployment of renewables and battery storage and think about how do you further decarbonize the U.S. electricity sector. When we previously ran that analysis, just trying to add more renewables and add more battery storage, it became very burdensome for customers because you aren't getting a significant amount of value to the more and more renewables and storage you add absent other actions. So when we incorporated hydrogen into that thought, which is effectively a form of long-duration storage that is taking advantage of the cheap electricity production coming from renewables, in some cases, excess renewable production at certain times of the day, that substantially changed the value equation for customers to fully decarbonize in the electricity sector. So that gives us great excitement about the potential for substantial renewables and battery storage deployment, knowing that as you continue to deploy more and you find economic forms of long-duration storage, that continues to be very value accretive to customers, both in cost and the deployments of clean energy. So that's kind of the starting point. 
But then coming back to a little bit more nearer term, if you think about how do you decarbonize transportation and industrial sectors, the most exciting ways to do that, that we see today is through electrification, whether that's in the form of electric vehicles fueled by batteries or other type of fuel cells. Or through hydrogen, and hydrogen probably more applicable in the industrial sector, particularly for applications that already exist today. So -- and with -- as Jim highlighted, the potential for hydrogen production tax credit being considered by the administration and by Congress as part of the infrastructure package, in the near term, we could see a closing of the gap perhaps fairly quickly to creating this as an economic alternative to other fuel sources today that are fossil fuel-based. So yes, we couldn't be more excited about it for both the opportunities for renewables, for electricity sector, industrial and transportation, but also as you suggested potentially to participate in the hydrogen infrastructure itself, whether it's the electrolyzer or rather forms of creating and distributing the molecules. How much and where we participate in that is really one of the things that we're focused on in all of these different pilots. that both John and the Energy Resources team as well as Eric within Florida Power and LiDAR thinking through today. How do we do that economically, how do we leverage some of the scale benefits and opportunities that our business can bring to bear in these opportunities. You'll see us continue to place small bets to get experience, to build relationships, to gain knowledge. And over the -- in the short term, that won't add up to a heck of a lot of capital investment opportunity. But it will add up to a tremendous amount of learning and continuing to focus our strategies on where we can add significant amount of value to the infrastructure and the market and ultimately to our shareholders as well."

We have for quite some time, overall returns between wind and solar. From a risk-adjusted basis, we're happy with returns that we've seen in both sets of technologies. In the short term, in terms of backlog that John and the Energy Resources team, it certainly has influenced by what I think is the conventional wisdom for a long time that the step-downs for the production tax credit on wind and the step-down for the investment tax credit on solar were, in fact, likely to happen. I think our customers now are thinking about that a little bit differently as discussions in Washington has started to heat up. But as we look what are likely outcomes, as Jim was talking through, including the potential for extensions of those incentives, I think the key takeaway is they remain -- both technologies are very likely to remain economic for our customers to deploy on behalf of their customers and ultimately leading to significant cost savings for electricity buyers at the end of the day. So they remain attractive from our perspective, and we continue to focus our development efforts on wherever we can add value for our customers."

So we've done a lot of deep dives across our portfolio to think about where weatherizing makes sense. As I've talked about in the past and you well know, we have a lot of interest across Texas across Texas, not only wind investment, solar, battery storage, gas infrastructure investments and of course, the small retail business. So we've been carefully thinking through all of what are the opportunities to learn and perhaps invest going forward. 
Specifically to weatherizing, I don't know if you were talking exclusively around the renewables fleet or if you're talking about the gas infrastructure side. But on the renewables side, keep in mind that weatherization really focuses on ambient temperature effects. And ambient temperature, at least for our fleet, I can't speak for everybody's, was not the real issue for any sort of production shortfall versus a FP50 forecast. It was really related to the fact that in this extraordinary event that happened for multiple days, it was preceded by an icing event. So ice was accumulating on our blades. And when ice accumulate on the blades, it's difficult for them to spend. And because the temperatures remained low for several days in a row, there was an opportunity for that ice to shed. 
Typically, weatherization packages don't really address ice accumulation on the blades. This is something that the industry is focused on. There are some what, at this point, are very expensive solutions to try to address ice accumulation on the blades. And given that they don't happen every year and certainly don't happen frequently across specific sites every year and ends up being very cost-prohibitive for something that happens very sporadically. So I'm not optimistic that there's a substantial amount to do to at least today with respect to weatherization on the wind side to change the events. 
I do think there's opportunities across the gas supply side to improve the ability for gas to flow, which obviously was really at the crux of the issues, along with not only natural gas supply shortages but plant issues and issues in the coal fleet and issues in the nuclear fleet. So there's opportunities across the market to invest."

When you look at ERCOT's overall operating fleet, what they really do have to address at the end of the day is weatherization of gas because you think about 87, 88 gigawatts that were supposed to be available. I mean renewables on an NCF-adjusted basis were only about 3 gigawatts of that and very much a rounding error in the problem that occurred in Texas. And so Texas really needs to think through what are the right solutions for gas because when you have icing conditions, it doesn't matter if it's blades on a turbine, it's a combustion gas turbine, it's a nuclear power plant, it's a coal plant. When you have severe icing conditions, they're all going to fail. And that's what we saw in Texas. And so the question is what is going to be the right market construct going forward to provide the appropriate incentives for weatherization and for backup fuel on-site to make sure that these facilities are capable of running. And I think those are the kinds of issues that the Texas legislature is currently evaluating."

Rebecca will provide an overview of our results, and our executive team will then be available to answer your questions.
We will be making forward-looking statements during this call based on current expectations and assumptions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings news release in the comments made during this conference call in the Risk Factors section of the accompanying presentation or in our latest reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, each of which can be found on our website, nexteraenergy.com and nexteraenergypartners.com. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statements.
Today's presentation also includes references to non-GAAP financial measures. You should refer to the information contained in the slides accompanying today's presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non-GAAP measures to the closest GAAP financial measure. As a reminder, Gulf Power legally merged into Florida Power & Light Company effective on January 1, 2021. Gulf Power will continue as a separate reporting segment within Florida Power & Light and NextEra Energy through 2021, serving its existing customers under separate retail rates. Throughout today's presentation, when we refer to FPL, we are referring to Florida Power & Light, excluding Gulf Power, unless otherwise noted or when using the term combined.
With that, I will turn the call over to Rebecca."

NextEra Energy is off to a terrific start in 2021 and has made excellent progress in the core focus areas that we discussed on the last call. Adjusted earnings per share increased nearly 14% year-over-year,",3870,"Thank you, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy is off to a terrific start in 2021 and has made excellent progress in the core focus areas that we discussed on the last call. Adjusted earnings per share increased nearly 14% year-over-year, reflecting successful performance across all of the businesses. FPL increased net income by approximately $78 million from the prior year comparable period, which was driven by continued investment in the business for the benefit of our customers.
During the quarter, FPL successfully placed in service approximately 300 megawatts of additional cost-effective solar projects built under its SolarTogether program, which remains the largest community solar program in the nation. FPL now owns and operates approximately 2,640 megawatts of solar on its combined system, which is more than any other utility in the country. FPL's other major capital investments, including the 409-megawatt Manatee Energy Storage Center and highly efficient 1,200-megawatt Dania Beach Clean Energy Center, are also on schedule and on budget. By executing on smart capital investments such as these, FPL is able to maintain its best-in-class customer value proposition of clean energy, low bills, high reliability and outstanding customer service. FPL's typical residential bill remains well below the national average and the lowest in the nation among the 20 largest U.S. investor-owned utilities, while our service reliability has never been higher.
Gulf Power also had a strong quarter of execution. The focus on the operational cost effectiveness at Gulf Power continues to progress well, with a 43% increase in net income year-over-year, primarily driven by year-to-date O&M costs declining by approximately 21% versus the prior year comparable period and by more than 34% relative to 2018. Gulf Power also delivered further improvements in service reliability and employee safety, with no OSHA recordables year-to-date through the end of March. We remain committed to delivering on the objectives that we have previously outlined at Gulf Power and continue to expect to generate significant customer and shareholder value over the coming years.
At Energy Resources, adjusted earnings increased 13% year-over-year, and it was another strong quarter of renewables origination, with our backlog increasing by approximately 1,750 megawatts since the last call. We continue to see increased stakeholder focus on environmental, social and governance, or ESG, factors, helping to drive accelerated demand for diversified clean energy solutions among new nontraditional customers, particularly in the commercial and industrial sector as an attractive source of incremental growth for Energy Resources in the coming years.
We have been encouraged by the Biden administration's focus on clean energy and the emphasis they have placed on it in their budget and in the upcoming infrastructure package. We continue to work with the administration on their important efforts around extensions of existing renewable credits, new credits for transmission and storage, including hydrogen as well as a new clean energy standard for the electric sector. We support a clean energy standard that accelerates the decarbonization of the electric grid and enables the decarbonization of the transportation and industrial sectors as well.
We believe that no energy company in the world has been more committed, consistent and proactive in promoting smart investments in clean energy technology as we have been for over 2 decades. As the push for action to address climate change and acceleration of progress towards decarbonization creates new and enhanced renewable incentives across our industry, we continue to believe that no company is better positioned than NextEra Energy to continue to drive change and capitalize on these trends. At this early point in the year, we are very pleased with our progress at FPL, Gulf Power and Energy Resources.
Now let's turn to the detailed results, beginning first with FPL. For the first quarter of 2021, FPL reported net income of $720 million or $0.37 per share. Earnings per share increased $0.04 year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed growth of 10.8% was a significant driver of FPL's EPS growth versus the prior year comparable quarter. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $1.4 billion for the quarter, and we expect our full year capital investments to be between $6.6 billion and $6.8 billion. FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.6% for the 12 months ending March 2021. During the quarter, we utilized $316 million of reserve amortization to achieve our target regulatory ROE, leaving FPL with a balance of $578 million. As we've previously discussed, FPL historically utilizes more reserve amortization in the first half of the year given the pattern of its underlying revenues and expenses, and we expect to continue this trend this year.
Let me now turn to Gulf Power, which reported first quarter 2021 net income of $57 million or $0.03 per share. Gulf Power's capital expenditures were $170 million for the quarter as it continues to execute on smart capital investments for the benefit of customers, and we expected full capital investments for the year to be between $800 million and $900 million. All of Gulf Power's major capital investments, including the North Florida Resiliency Connection that is expected to be in service in mid-2022, continued to progress well. As a result of these ongoing investments, regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 16% year-over-year. Gulf Power's reported ROE for regulatory purposes is expected to be approximately 10.4% for the 12 months ending March 2021.
Turning to our development and planning efforts. We recently filed an updated 10-year site plan for FPL and Gulf Power which we expect will begin to operate as an integrated electric system in 2022. The 10-year site plan projects that zero-emission sources will provide nearly 40% of all energy produced across the combined FPL system in 2030, largely as a result of FPL's continued rapid expansion of solar energy through the execution of its 30-by-30 plan and the success in its coal phaseout strategy. FPL expects to add 3,800 megawatts of additional cost-effective solar over the next 4 years, and we now control all of the land needed to meet our projected solar deployment of 11.7 gigawatts by 2030 for the combined FPL system.
The site plan also reflects an expected total deployment of more than 1,200 megawatts of storage capacity by 2030. This plan is consistent with our belief that renewable generation and particularly solar, paired with battery storage in Florida, is an increasingly cost-effective form of generation in most parts of the U.S. As we execute on these opportunities, we project that FPL's combined emissions rate will be 62% lower in 2030 than the industry average was in 2005 and 20% lower than the U.S. Department of Energy's projected industry average in 2030.
Moreover, we continue to plan and invest in sustainable solutions to broaden how we serve customers and prepare for an even cleaner future. During the quarter, FPL placed in service nearly 70 new electric vehicle charging ports and is now operating nearly 400 electric vehicle charging ports in the state as part of our goal to install more than 1,000 charging ports in more than 100 locations across the combined FPL service area from 2019 through 2022. As we've previously discussed, we are also developing a hydrogen electrolysis pilot project at FPL's Okeechobee combined cycle unit as part of our efforts to introduce further fuel diversity and resiliency into FPL's generation system. The approximately 25-megawatt solar connected electrolyzer that will be used to generate clean hydrogen as part of the Okeechobee pilot will be the largest of its kind in the U.S. to date. While these projects are just a few examples of our advanced deployment efforts at FPL, we are excited about the immense opportunities that lie ahead as our industry moves towards cleaner, more sustainable future.
The Florida economy continues to recover from the early effects of the pandemic and is among the strongest in the nation. The current unemployment rate of 4.7% is well below the national average. The real estate sector continues to grow, with average building permits and the Case-Shiller Index for South Florida up approximately 6% and 10%, respectively, versus the prior year. Florida's retail sales index continued its quarter-over-quarter improvement, which is a further indication of the ongoing health in our economy and bolsters our confidence in our smart investment strategy required to serve anticipated demand growth.
During the quarter, FPL's average number of customers increased by approximately 71,400 or 1.4% versus the comparable prior year quarter, driven by continued solid underlying population growth. FPL's first quarter retail sales decreased 1.7% from the prior year comparable period, which is primarily due to mild weather in the first quarter of this year versus 2020. We estimate that approximately 3% of the decline can be attributed to weather-related usage per customer. On a weather-normalized basis, first quarter retail sales increased 1.3%, with continued strong underlying usage contributing favorably.
For Gulf Power, the average number of customers grew 1.1% versus the comparable prior year quarter, driven by continued economic growth in Northwest Florida. Gulf Power's first quarter retail sales increased 2.9% year-over-year primarily due to favorable weather.
On March 12, we submitted testimony and detailed supporting information for Florida Power & Light's 2021 base rate proceeding. The overall proposal for our 2022 through 2025 base rate plan is substantially consistent with the test year letter filed in January. We are requesting a base rate adjustment of approximately $1.1 billion starting in January '22; $607 million starting in January of 2023; and solar-based rate adjustments, or SoBRA, mechanisms, in 2024 and 2025 for up to 1,788 megawatts of cost-effective solar.
We are proud to offer our customers service that ranks among the cleanest and the most reliable in the country, with typical residential bills of approximately 13% below state average and importantly, nearly 10% lower than in 2006. The 4-year base plan has been designed to support continued investments in the long-term infrastructure and advanced technology, which continues to improve our already best-in-class reliability and helps keep customer bills low. With the proposed base rate adjustments and current projections for fuel and other costs, we believe that FPL's typical residential bill will grow at an average annual rate of about 3.4% from January 2021 through the end of 2025, which is expected to result in FPL's typical residential bill being approximately 20% below the projected national average and more than 20% lower than our typical bills 15 years ago when adjusted for inflation. Typical Gulf Power residential bills are projected to decrease approximately 1% over the 4-year rate plan.
The Florida Public Service Commission has established a schedule for this proceeding, beginning with the quality of service hearings in June and technical hearings in late August. The proceedings would conclude in the fourth quarter with the staff -- the recommendation and commission rulings on revenue requirements and rates. We look forward to the opportunity to present our case to the commission this summer, and our focus will be to pursue a balanced outcome that supports continued execution of our successful strategy for customers. As always, we are open to the possibility of resolving our rate request through a fair settlement agreement. 
Energy Resources reported first quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $491 million or $0.25 per share. Adjusted earnings for the first quarter were $598 million or $0.30 per share, up 13% versus the prior year comparable period. New investments added $0.04 per share, primarily reflecting growth in the renewables and storage business, including more than 2,700 megawatts of new contracted wind projects that were commissioned during 2020. The extreme market conditions in Texas in February were the primary driver of the underperformance in our existing generation portfolio and customer supply and trading business as well as the favorable performance in the gas infrastructure business. As a reminder, when weather events like this occur, we operate our businesses in Texas as a portfolio. And while there were pluses and minuses during these events, we believe the end result is a testament to the strength of our large and well-diversified business. All other impacts increased results by $0.03 versus 2020.
As I mentioned earlier, Energy Resources development team had another strong quarter of origination. We added 503 megawatts of new solar projects to our backlog, including 190 megawatts of solar that will be paired with approximately 100 megawatts of 4-hour battery storage capacity. In 2020, our market share of signed contracts and co-located solar-plus storage assets in the U.S. was more than 35%, and we are excited about the continued trend in demand for co-located storage solutions as we anticipate even further cost synergies by pairing low-cost renewables with storage solutions in the coming decades as being an important part of decarbonization in our sector.
We also added 916 megawatts of new wind projects to our backlog for 2022. In addition, our backlog increased by Energy Resources' share of NextEra Energy Partners' planned acquisition of 391 megawatts of operating wind projects announced earlier this week. With the approximately 1,750 megawatts added this quarter, our backlog of signed contracts at Energy Resources now totals approximately 15,250 megawatts, supporting our industry-leading long-term growth expectations. We remain enthusiastic about the expanded investment opportunities that the broad decarbonization of the U.S. economy presents for Energy Resources, and we continue to evaluate pilot projects for industrial, transportation and electric sector applications.
In addition to the pilots and partnerships we've discussed on prior calls, we recently committed to make a minority investment in a clean energy technology company that has developed a proprietary process to essentially decarbonize the industrial production of hydrogen at economic prices. This investment and the hydrogen pilots we've announced to date show the promise of electrification across our economy, and we are excited for the opportunity to participate in these new markets and build renewables to support future growth in demand for electricity. Consistent with our long-term track record, we will remain disciplined as we take steps to be at the forefront of this developing market while taking a leadership role in the clean energy transition.
Beyond renewables and storage, NextEra Energy Transmission furthered its efforts to build America's leading competitive transmission company with the closing of its acquisition of GridLiance occurring at the end of last month. GridLiance, which owns 3 FERC-regulated transmission utilities spanning 6 states, is an excellent complement to our existing operations and further expands NextEra Energy's regulated business through the addition of attractive rate-regulated assets. NextEra Energy Transmission now owns regulated assets in 10 states and 6 regional transmission organizations.
Growth in renewables means that there is also a growing imperative to build additional transmission across the U.S. to support this transmission to a low-cost, low-carbon economy, fueled by renewable energy. Our incorporation of GridLiance into our portfolio furthers our strategy to be North America's leading competitive transmission provider, both to deploy capital profitably as well as to enable further renewables deployment.
Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the first quarter of 2021, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $1.67 billion or $0.84 per share. NextEra Energy's 2021 first quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $1.33 billion and $0.67 per share, respectively. Adjusted earnings from Corporate and Other segment were roughly flat year-over-year.
Long-term financial expectations, which we increased and extended late last year through 2023, remain unchanged. For 2021, NextEra Energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.40 to $2.54. For 2022 and 2023, NextEra Energy expects to grow 6% to 8% off of the expected 2021 adjusted earnings per share, and we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of these ranges in 2021, 2022 and 2023, while at the same time maintaining our strong credit ratings. From 2018 to 2023, we continue to expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow dividends per share roughly 10% rate per year through at least 2022 off of a 2020 base. As always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions.
Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which delivered very strong first quarter results, with year-over-year growth in adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution of approximately 20% and 36%, respectively. Yesterday, the NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.6375 per common unit or $2.55 per common unit on an annualized basis, up approximately 15% from a year earlier. Inclusive of this increase, NextEra Energy Partners has grown its distribution per unit by 240% since the IPO.
Further building on that strength, NextEra Energy Partners recently announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire an approximately 400-megawatt portfolio of long-term contracted wind assets. This transaction will be NextEra Energy Partners' first third-party acquisition of renewable energy assets and represents another step towards growing LP unit distributions in a manner consistent with our previously stated expectations of 12% to 15% per year through at least 2024. I'll provide additional details on the transaction in just a few minutes.
Turning to the detailed quarterly results. NextEra Energy Partners' first quarter adjusted EBITDA was $354 million, and cash available for distribution was $184 million. New projects, which primarily reflect the asset acquisitions that closed at the end of 2020, contributed $27 million of adjusted EBITDA and $13 million of cash available for distribution. Existing projects added $39 million of adjusted EBITDA and $23 million of cash available for distribution. This strong year-over-year increase in adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution includes favorable results from NextEra Energy Partners' wind and natural gas pipeline investments in Texas during the February winter storm, partially offset by the impacts of an accelerated outage at our Genesis project during the quarter. Cash available for distribution also benefited from a reduction in corporate level interest payments primarily as a result of certain refinancing activities completed in the fourth quarter of last year. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide.
As I previously mentioned, we continue to execute on our plan to expand NextEra Energy Partners' portfolio and recently entered into an agreement to acquire an approximately 400-megawatt portfolio of long-term contracted operating wind projects. The portfolio has a cash available distribution weighted average contract life of approximately 13 years with high credit quality customers and further enhances the diversity of NextEra Energy Partners' existing portfolio. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of this year, subject to customary closing conditions and the receipt of certain regulatory approvals and generate an attractive CAFD yield and be immediately accretive to LP distributions.
This transaction demonstrates the NextEra Energy Partners' continued ability to execute on its long-term growth plan, and it's enhanced by our ability to take advantage of Energy Resources' best-in-class operating platform to reduce operating expenses at the asset. Energy Resources continues to leverage our culture of continuous improvement to realize lower costs across the renewable assets that it operates. Since 2017, Energy Resources has reduced fleet-wide dollar per megawatt hour O&M cost in its wind fleet by more than 30%. And we believe both Energy Resources' wind and solar operating expenses are significantly better than its industry peers. With Energy Resources operating the NextEra Energy Partners renewable assets, these cost advantages directly benefit LP unitholders. Over the coming years, we look forward to leveraging the benefits of Energy Resources' operating portfolio platform for both NextEra Energy Partners' existing portfolio as well as to add incremental value to future third-party acquisitions.
In addition to providing attractive base returns, these projects are well situated in attractive markets that we anticipate will have significant long-term renewables demand, supporting asset recontracting or potential repowering opportunities after the initial contract terms. We continue to believe that the existing NextEra Energy Partners portfolio has meaningful organic growth opportunities over the coming years and expect the portfolio we are acquiring provides additional long-term investment opportunities as well.
NextEra Energy Partners expects to acquire the portfolio for a base purchase price of approximately $733 million, subject to closing adjustments. The portfolio of assets is expected to contribute adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution of approximately $63 million to $70 million, each on a 5-year average annual run rate basis beginning in December of -- December 31, 2021. We believe this transaction is an attractive investment in which to deploy the $345 million of undrawn funds from the 2020 convertible equity portfolio financing, which we used to fund the acquisition, along with existing NextEra Energy Partners' debt capacity.
Following the recently announced transaction, we now expect to be in the upper end of our previously disclosed year-end 2021 run rate adjusted EBITDA and CAFD expectation ranges of $1.44 billion to $1.62 billion and $600 million to $680 million, respectively. As a reminder, all of our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated IDR fees as we treat these as an operating expense.
From a base of our fourth quarter 2020 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.46, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2021 distribution that is payable in February of 2022 to be in the range of $2.76 to $2.83 per common unit.
In summary, after a strong start to the year, we remain as enthusiastic as ever about the long-term growth prospects for both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. At FPL, we continue to focus on delivering our best-in-class customer value proposition through operational cost effectiveness, productivity and making smart long-term investments. Energy Resources maintains significant competitive advantages and continues to capitalize on the best renewables development period in our history. Combined with the strength of our balance sheet and credit ratings, NextEra Energy is uniquely positioned to drive long-term shareholder value, and we remain intensely focused on executing on these opportunities. NextEra Energy Partners is well positioned to deliver on its already best-in-class runway for LP distribution growth.
Finally, last month, we were honored that NextEra Energy was ranked #1 in a sector for Fortune Magazine's most admired -- World's Most Admired Companies list for the 14th time in 15 years. Moreover, we are recognized for the 14th time as one of the world's most ethical companies by Ethisphere Institute, which is a testament to our team of nearly 15,000 employees who are committed to our core values while helping to build a sustainable energy era that is affordable and clean.
In the coming weeks, we expect to publish NextEra Energy's 2021 ESG Report, which we believe establishes our full alignment with the Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (sic) [ Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures ], or TCFD, recommendations. We are also excited to announce our commitment to participation in the Carbon Disclosure Project Survey later this year. These enhanced disclosures highlight the alignment of our corporate strategy with the key tenets of ESG, which our company has been focused on for more than 25 years and remains key to execution of our strategy moving forward.
That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, I will open up the line for questions."

And I appreciate all -- I was going to say the question, but I think it's multiple questions in there. So I'll start and ask John can -- I guess, John or Jim can jump in if they want to add something. We are very excited about opportunities in transmission. And it is founded on a couple of points that I highlighted in the script. First is we couldn't be more excited, as you well know, about the renewables opportunities across the U.S. in the coming decades. A key part of all of those opportunities -- or at least a lot of those opportunities in the latter part of this decade going into the 2030s and beyond is some level of build-out of transmission in the U.S. beyond what's been accomplished. So both to enable long-term renewables development, but also to capitalize on those opportunities, leaves us very interested in transmission.
The Energy Resources team has done a terrific job growing that business, both through organic opportunities, so long-term development efforts of identifying opportunities, participating in processes and ultimately securing opportunities to invest and build and bring successfully into line -- into operation some of those lines as well as through acquisitions, obviously, with GridLiance being the most recent and Trans Bay Cable not being too much far behind it. I expect that we'll grow the business through both going forward as well, continued efforts on the development side as well as participating in opportunities to acquire investments as they come to market.
On the FERC transmission side, we do think there are lots of opportunities to improve how transmission is sited and built across the U.S. And we're optimistic that this administration and this FERC will start to focus on those. And I think it's both through FERC as well as potential focus on transmission in this infrastructure package. So a lot of opportunities to invest in the future."

So we're very early. And no doubt the -- all of the key stakeholders is trying to review that information, and then we'll see the process unfold really over quite a number of months, culminating with the hearings in August. We are very proud, as I highlighted in the comments, both here and in other venues. We're really proud of the case that the FPL team has put together, not just the case itself, but it's built on a foundation of execution, not just over the last 5 years during which we've operated under the settlement agreement, but of course, years and years before that. So we look forward to the opportunity to articulating that through this process.
As it relates to settlements, as you know, here in Florida, there is a great history of settlement agreements, not just with Florida Power & Light Company, but other utilities in the state. We do think that opportunities to have a negotiated outcome that meets the needs of all stakeholders and historically that has produced consistent rates for many years in the future that provides tremendous value for customers. There's a great history of that. We, of course, will be open to it. But it's very early in this process. And again, we look forward to being able to put forward our case."

And as we've highlighted, both in terms of the financial characteristics of it, one of the things that was particularly attractive about this portfolio when we looked at it is our team's ability to add value on the operation and maintenance cost side. Really think about it -- as we bring assets into the portfolio, it really gets leveraged on the platform that we already operate. And so the team is really excited about how we can add incremental value through the Energy Resources' management of these assets at NextEra Energy Partners.
We've been very excited about NextEra Energy Partners' growth outlook for quite some time. As we've always indicated, it's well founded -- our excitement is well founded, just simply looking at the backlog of both operating and signed contracts and then the potential for new contracts in Energy Resources. But I've always alluded to the fact that really our market opportunity is this broader market set. And we'll continue to engage and look for opportunities.
I do think there are more opportunities out there for third-party acquisitions on the renewable side. It's an area of focus for us to continue to participate in. But we've got the freeway to grow. And to the extent that we can put opportunities to [ gather ], great, and we'll take advantage of them over time, but we also continue to have terrific organic opportunities in NEP, particularly as the portfolio grows and then, of course, the continued success of Energy Resources in the broader market is very positive."

I think this is a process that's going to play out over months, not weeks. There's obviously a lot in the plan that's very positive from a renewable standpoint. And as Rebecca said in the prepared remarks, we are excited to work with the administration on the plan that, I think, is really going to accelerate the decarbonization of the U.S. economy over the next several years in a way that, as we've always said for a long time, is going to be essentially free to customers, i.e., not more expensive for customers, right? I mean the thing about the green economy is that it's cleaner, it's greener, but it's also cheaper. And that is why it's -- that's why it's so powerful.
So a lot of details obviously still to be worked out. We're working them. As you can imagine, it's very early and probably too early for me to comment on any of the specific details that we feel like need some work versus the ones that we like a lot.
On the tax front, I think, obviously, that's -- there are a lot of puts and takes with taxes, particularly in a company that has both utility assets as well as renewable assets, and we're working through it. Think about the tax rate being -- tax rate going up something in the $0.04 to $0.07 of headwind. I'm not particularly worried about that in the context of all the other things that would be positive for our company if the infrastructure bill gets passed. And so we continue to work, obviously, that as well. And lots of details still to be laid out on the minimum tax issue. And that also matters as to what the final corporate rate ends up being.
And I guess the last thing I would say is none of this is going to be easy to get done. It's very narrow margins in both the Senate and the House. And folks tend to focus on the Senate and extraordinarily narrow margin given kind of vacancies in the House right now as well. And there's -- the history on midterm elections suggests that it's always an uphill battle for the current administration in midterm -- for whatever party's in power in the midterm elections of a presidency. So that, on the one hand, I think, puts some urgency, I think, around the administration's push to get something done this year. But the flip side is it also -- there's a lot of risk for moderate democrats to take a vote on some of these issues.
So it's going to be very -- any change will be very hard. And I think we were very much a part of the -- we've always been very active in terms of what happens around clean energy policy in Washington, and you can imagine that we're remaining very active on that front and working at it very hard. But I will just say in closing that we're very much encouraged by the focus of the administration on decarbonizing the economy. We feel like it's absolutely the right thing to do, right thing for the planet and the right thing for customers and the right thing for the country, and we stand ready to support an infrastructure plan that accelerates that decarbonization. And I think any acceleration of what's already going on just because of the amazing economics that renewables have relative to the other alternatives plus what's going on with hydrogen, and you saw there was a PTC -- hydrogen PTC as part of the -- suggested as part of the infrastructure plan. So there's a lot of very positive things in there that we're going to be working on to build on over the next several months."

Thanks, Stephen. Let me start with the longer-term view first and then come back to the shorter-term view, which would really tie into, I think, the latter part of your question and comment.
The first part, which is the latter-term view, is when we look at substantial deployment of renewables and battery storage and think about how do you further decarbonize the U.S. electricity sector, when we previously ran that analysis, just trying to add more renewables and add more battery storage, it became very burdensome for customers because you aren't getting a significant amount of value to the more renewables and storage you add, absent other actions. So when we incorporated hydrogen into that thought, which is effectively a form of long-duration storage that is taking advantage of the cheap electricity production coming from renewables, in some cases, excess renewable production at certain times of the day, that substantially changed the value equation for customers to fully decarbonize in the electricity sector. So that gives us great excitement about the potential for substantial renewables and battery storage deployment, knowing that as you continue to deploy more and you find economic forms of long-duration storage, that continues to be very value accretive to customers, both in cost and in the performance of clean energy. So that's kind of the starting point.
But then coming back to a little bit more nearer term, if you think about how do you decarbonize transportation and industrial sectors, the most exciting ways to do that, that we see today is through electrification, whether that's in the form of electric vehicles fueled by batteries or other type of fuel cells or through hydrogen, and hydrogen probably more applicable in the industrial sector, particularly for applications that already exist today. So -- and with -- as Jim highlighted, the potential for hydrogen production tax credit being considered by the administration and by Congress as part of the infrastructure package, in the near term, we could see a closing of the gap perhaps fairly quickly to creating this as an economic alternative to other fuel sources today that are fossil fuel-based. So yes, we couldn't be more excited about it for both the opportunities for renewables, for electricity sector, industrial and transportation, but also, as you suggested, potentially to participate in the hydrogen infrastructure itself, whether it's the electrolyzer or rather forms of creating and distributing the molecules.
How much and where we participate in that is really one of the things that we're focused on in all of these different pilots that both John and the Energy Resources team as well as Eric within Florida Power & Light are thinking through today. How do we do that economically, how do we leverage some of the scale benefits and opportunities that our business can bring to bear in these opportunities. You'll see us continue to place small bets to get experience, to build relationships, to gain knowledge. And over the -- in the short term, that won't add up to a heck of a lot of capital investment opportunity. But it will add up to a tremendous amount of learning and continuing to focus our strategies on where we can add significant amount of value to the infrastructure and the market and ultimately to our shareholders as well."

We have, for quite some time, overall returns between wind and solar. From a risk-adjusted basis, we're happy with returns that we've seen in both sets of technologies. In the short term, in terms of backlog that John and the Energy Resources team, it certainly has been influenced by what I think is the conventional wisdom for a long time that the step-downs for the production tax credit on wind and the step-down for the investment tax credit on solar were, in fact, likely to happen. I think our customers now are thinking about that a little bit differently as discussions in Washington has -- had started to heat up.
But as we look what are likely outcomes, as Jim was talking through, including the potential for extensions of those incentives, I think the key takeaway is they remain -- both technologies are very likely to remain economic for our customers to deploy on behalf of their customers and ultimately leading to significant cost savings for electricity buyers at the end of the day. So they remain attractive from our perspective, and we continue to focus our development efforts on wherever we can add value for our customers."

So we've done a lot of deep dives across our portfolio to think about where weatherizing makes sense. As I've talked about in the past and you well know, we have a lot of interest across Texas, not only wind investment, solar, battery storage, gas infrastructure investments and, of course, the small retail business. So we've been carefully thinking through all of what are the opportunities to learn and perhaps invest going forward.
Specifically to weatherizing, I don't know if you were talking exclusively around the renewables fleet or if you're talking about the gas infrastructure side. But on the renewables side, keep in mind that weatherization really focuses on ambient temperature effects. And ambient temperature, at least for our fleet, I can't speak for everybody's, was not the real issue for any sort of production shortfall versus a FP50 forecast. It was really related to the fact that in this extraordinary event that happened for multiple days, it was preceded by an icing event. So ice was accumulating on our blades. And when ice accumulates on the blades, it's difficult for them to spin. And because the temperatures remained low for several days in a row, there was an opportunity for that ice to shed.
Typically, weatherization packages don't really address ice accumulation on the blades. This is something that the industry is focused on. There are some what, at this point, are very expensive solutions to try to address ice accumulation on the blades. And given that they don't happen every year and certainly don't happen frequently across specific sites every year, it ends up being very cost-prohibitive for something that happens very sporadically. So I'm not optimistic that there's a substantial amount to do to -- at least today with respect to weatherization on the wind side to change the event.
I do think there's opportunities across the gas supply side to improve the ability for gas to flow, which obviously was really at the crux of the issues, along with not only natural gas supply shortages but plant issues and issues in the coal fleet and issues in the nuclear fleet. So there's opportunities across the market to invest."

When you look at ERCOT's overall operating fleet, what they really do have to address at the end of the day is weatherization of gas because you think about 87, 88 gigawatts that were supposed to be available. I mean renewables, on an NCF-adjusted basis, were only about 3 gigawatts of that and very much a rounding error in the problem that occurred in Texas. And so Texas really needs to think through what are the right solutions for gas. Because when you have icing conditions, it doesn't matter if it's blades on a turbine, it's a combustion gas turbine, it's a nuclear power plant, it's a coal plant. When you have severe icing conditions, they're all going to fail. And that's what we saw in Texas. And so the question is what is going to be the right market construct going forward to provide the appropriate incentives for weatherization and for backup fuel on site to make sure that these facilities are capable of running. And I think those are the kinds of issues that the Texas legislature is currently evaluating."

NextEra Energy is off to a terrific start in 2021 and has made excellent progress in the core focus areas that we discussed on the last call. Adjusted earnings per share increased nearly 14% year-over-year,",3870,"Thank you, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy is off to a terrific start in 2021 and has made excellent progress in the core focus areas that we discussed on the last call. Adjusted earnings per share increased nearly 14% year-over-year, reflecting successful performance across all of the businesses. FPL increased net income by approximately $78 million from the prior year comparable period, which was driven by continued investment in the business for the benefit of our customers.
During the quarter, FPL successfully placed in service approximately 300 megawatts of additional cost-effective solar projects built under its SolarTogether program, which remains the largest community solar program in the nation. FPL now owns and operates approximately 2,640 megawatts of solar on its combined system, which is more than any other utility in the country. FPL's other major capital investments, including the 409-megawatt Manatee Energy Storage Center and highly efficient 1,200-megawatt Dania Beach Clean Energy Center, are also on schedule and on budget. By executing on smart capital investments such as these, FPL is able to maintain its best-in-class customer value proposition of clean energy, low bills, high reliability and outstanding customer service. FPL's typical residential bill remains well below the national average and the lowest in the nation among the 20 largest U.S. investor-owned utilities, while our service reliability has never been higher.
Gulf Power also had a strong quarter of execution. The focus on the operational cost effectiveness at Gulf Power continues to progress well, with a 43% increase in net income year-over-year, primarily driven by year-to-date O&M costs declining by approximately 21% versus the prior year comparable period and by more than 34% relative to 2018. Gulf Power also delivered further improvements in service reliability and employee safety, with no OSHA recordables year-to-date through the end of March. We remain committed to delivering on the objectives that we have previously outlined at Gulf Power and continue to expect to generate significant customer and shareholder value over the coming years.
At Energy Resources, adjusted earnings increased 13% year-over-year, and it was another strong quarter of renewables origination, with our backlog increasing by approximately 1,750 megawatts since the last call. We continue to see increased stakeholder focus on environmental, social and governance, or ESG, factors, helping to drive accelerated demand for diversified clean energy solutions among new nontraditional customers, particularly in the commercial and industrial sector as an attractive source of incremental growth for Energy Resources in the coming years.
We have been encouraged by the Biden administration's focus on clean energy and the emphasis they have placed on it in their budget and in the upcoming infrastructure package. We continue to work with the administration on their important efforts around extensions of existing renewable credits, new credits for transmission and storage, including hydrogen as well as a new clean energy standard for the electric sector. We support a clean energy standard that accelerates the decarbonization of the electric grid and enables the decarbonization of the transportation and industrial sectors as well.
We believe that no energy company in the world has been more committed, consistent and proactive in promoting smart investments in clean energy technology as we have been for over 2 decades. As the push for action to address climate change and acceleration of progress towards decarbonization creates new and enhanced renewable incentives across our industry, we continue to believe that no company is better positioned than NextEra Energy to continue to drive change and capitalize on these trends. At this early point in the year, we are very pleased with our progress at FPL, Gulf Power and Energy Resources.
Now let's turn to the detailed results, beginning first with FPL. For the first quarter of 2021, FPL reported net income of $720 million or $0.37 per share. Earnings per share increased $0.04 year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed growth of 10.8% was a significant driver of FPL's EPS growth versus the prior year comparable quarter. FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $1.4 billion for the quarter, and we expect our full year capital investments to be between $6.6 billion and $6.8 billion. FPL's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.6% for the 12 months ending March 2021. During the quarter, we utilized $316 million of reserve amortization to achieve our target regulatory ROE, leaving FPL with a balance of $578 million. As we've previously discussed, FPL historically utilizes more reserve amortization in the first half of the year given the pattern of its underlying revenues and expenses, and we expect to continue this trend this year.
Let me now turn to Gulf Power, which reported first quarter 2021 net income of $57 million or $0.03 per share. Gulf Power's capital expenditures were $170 million for the quarter as it continues to execute on smart capital investments for the benefit of customers, and we expected full capital investments for the year to be between $800 million and $900 million. All of Gulf Power's major capital investments, including the North Florida Resiliency Connection that is expected to be in service in mid-2022, continued to progress well. As a result of these ongoing investments, regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 16% year-over-year. Gulf Power's reported ROE for regulatory purposes is expected to be approximately 10.4% for the 12 months ending March 2021.
Turning to our development and planning efforts. We recently filed an updated 10-year site plan for FPL and Gulf Power which we expect will begin to operate as an integrated electric system in 2022. The 10-year site plan projects that zero-emission sources will provide nearly 40% of all energy produced across the combined FPL system in 2030, largely as a result of FPL's continued rapid expansion of solar energy through the execution of its 30-by-30 plan and the success in its coal phaseout strategy. FPL expects to add 3,800 megawatts of additional cost-effective solar over the next 4 years, and we now control all of the land needed to meet our projected solar deployment of 11.7 gigawatts by 2030 for the combined FPL system.
The site plan also reflects an expected total deployment of more than 1,200 megawatts of storage capacity by 2030. This plan is consistent with our belief that renewable generation and particularly solar, paired with battery storage in Florida, is an increasingly cost-effective form of generation in most parts of the U.S. As we execute on these opportunities, we project that FPL's combined emissions rate will be 62% lower in 2030 than the industry average was in 2005 and 20% lower than the U.S. Department of Energy's projected industry average in 2030.
Moreover, we continue to plan and invest in sustainable solutions to broaden how we serve customers and prepare for an even cleaner future. During the quarter, FPL placed in service nearly 70 new electric vehicle charging ports and is now operating nearly 400 electric vehicle charging ports in the state as part of our goal to install more than 1,000 charging ports in more than 100 locations across the combined FPL service area from 2019 through 2022. As we've previously discussed, we are also developing a hydrogen electrolysis pilot project at FPL's Okeechobee combined cycle unit as part of our efforts to introduce further fuel diversity and resiliency into FPL's generation system. The approximately 25-megawatt solar connected electrolyzer that will be used to generate clean hydrogen as part of the Okeechobee pilot will be the largest of its kind in the U.S. to date. While these projects are just a few examples of our advanced deployment efforts at FPL, we are excited about the immense opportunities that lie ahead as our industry moves towards cleaner, more sustainable future.
The Florida economy continues to recover from the early effects of the pandemic and is among the strongest in the nation. The current unemployment rate of 4.7% is well below the national average. The real estate sector continues to grow, with average building permits and the Case-Shiller Index for South Florida up approximately 6% and 10%, respectively, versus the prior year. Florida's retail sales index continued its quarter-over-quarter improvement, which is a further indication of the ongoing health in our economy and bolsters our confidence in our smart investment strategy required to serve anticipated demand growth.
During the quarter, FPL's average number of customers increased by approximately 71,400 or 1.4% versus the comparable prior year quarter, driven by continued solid underlying population growth. FPL's first quarter retail sales decreased 1.7% from the prior year comparable period, which is primarily due to mild weather in the first quarter of this year versus 2020. We estimate that approximately 3% of the decline can be attributed to weather-related usage per customer. On a weather-normalized basis, first quarter retail sales increased 1.3%, with continued strong underlying usage contributing favorably.
For Gulf Power, the average number of customers grew 1.1% versus the comparable prior year quarter, driven by continued economic growth in Northwest Florida. Gulf Power's first quarter retail sales increased 2.9% year-over-year primarily due to favorable weather.
On March 12, we submitted testimony and detailed supporting information for Florida Power & Light's 2021 base rate proceeding. The overall proposal for our 2022 through 2025 base rate plan is substantially consistent with the test year letter filed in January. We are requesting a base rate adjustment of approximately $1.1 billion starting in January '22; $607 million starting in January of 2023; and solar-based rate adjustments, or SoBRA, mechanisms, in 2024 and 2025 for up to 1,788 megawatts of cost-effective solar.
We are proud to offer our customers service that ranks among the cleanest and the most reliable in the country, with typical residential bills of approximately 13% below state average and importantly, nearly 10% lower than in 2006. The 4-year base plan has been designed to support continued investments in the long-term infrastructure and advanced technology, which continues to improve our already best-in-class reliability and helps keep customer bills low. With the proposed base rate adjustments and current projections for fuel and other costs, we believe that FPL's typical residential bill will grow at an average annual rate of about 3.4% from January 2021 through the end of 2025, which is expected to result in FPL's typical residential bill being approximately 20% below the projected national average and more than 20% lower than our typical bills 15 years ago when adjusted for inflation. Typical Gulf Power residential bills are projected to decrease approximately 1% over the 4-year rate plan.
The Florida Public Service Commission has established a schedule for this proceeding, beginning with the quality of service hearings in June and technical hearings in late August. The proceedings would conclude in the fourth quarter with the staff -- the recommendation and commission rulings on revenue requirements and rates. We look forward to the opportunity to present our case to the commission this summer, and our focus will be to pursue a balanced outcome that supports continued execution of our successful strategy for customers. As always, we are open to the possibility of resolving our rate request through a fair settlement agreement. 
Energy Resources reported first quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $491 million or $0.25 per share. Adjusted earnings for the first quarter were $598 million or $0.30 per share, up 13% versus the prior year comparable period. New investments added $0.04 per share, primarily reflecting growth in the renewables and storage business, including more than 2,700 megawatts of new contracted wind projects that were commissioned during 2020. The extreme market conditions in Texas in February were the primary driver of the underperformance in our existing generation portfolio and customer supply and trading business as well as the favorable performance in the gas infrastructure business. As a reminder, when weather events like this occur, we operate our businesses in Texas as a portfolio. And while there were pluses and minuses during these events, we believe the end result is a testament to the strength of our large and well-diversified business. All other impacts increased results by $0.03 versus 2020.
As I mentioned earlier, Energy Resources development team had another strong quarter of origination. We added 503 megawatts of new solar projects to our backlog, including 190 megawatts of solar that will be paired with approximately 100 megawatts of 4-hour battery storage capacity. In 2020, our market share of signed contracts and co-located solar-plus storage assets in the U.S. was more than 35%, and we are excited about the continued trend in demand for co-located storage solutions as we anticipate even further cost synergies by pairing low-cost renewables with storage solutions in the coming decades as being an important part of decarbonization in our sector.
We also added 916 megawatts of new wind projects to our backlog for 2022. In addition, our backlog increased by Energy Resources' share of NextEra Energy Partners' planned acquisition of 391 megawatts of operating wind projects announced earlier this week. With the approximately 1,750 megawatts added this quarter, our backlog of signed contracts at Energy Resources now totals approximately 15,250 megawatts, supporting our industry-leading long-term growth expectations. We remain enthusiastic about the expanded investment opportunities that the broad decarbonization of the U.S. economy presents for Energy Resources, and we continue to evaluate pilot projects for industrial, transportation and electric sector applications.
In addition to the pilots and partnerships we've discussed on prior calls, we recently committed to make a minority investment in a clean energy technology company that has developed a proprietary process to essentially decarbonize the industrial production of hydrogen at economic prices. This investment and the hydrogen pilots we've announced to date show the promise of electrification across our economy, and we are excited for the opportunity to participate in these new markets and build renewables to support future growth in demand for electricity. Consistent with our long-term track record, we will remain disciplined as we take steps to be at the forefront of this developing market while taking a leadership role in the clean energy transition.
Beyond renewables and storage, NextEra Energy Transmission furthered its efforts to build America's leading competitive transmission company with the closing of its acquisition of GridLiance occurring at the end of last month. GridLiance, which owns 3 FERC-regulated transmission utilities spanning 6 states, is an excellent complement to our existing operations and further expands NextEra Energy's regulated business through the addition of attractive rate-regulated assets. NextEra Energy Transmission now owns regulated assets in 10 states and 6 regional transmission organizations.
Growth in renewables means that there is also a growing imperative to build additional transmission across the U.S. to support this transmission to a low-cost, low-carbon economy, fueled by renewable energy. Our incorporation of GridLiance into our portfolio furthers our strategy to be North America's leading competitive transmission provider, both to deploy capital profitably as well as to enable further renewables deployment.
Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the first quarter of 2021, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $1.67 billion or $0.84 per share. NextEra Energy's 2021 first quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $1.33 billion and $0.67 per share, respectively. Adjusted earnings from Corporate and Other segment were roughly flat year-over-year.
Long-term financial expectations, which we increased and extended late last year through 2023, remain unchanged. For 2021, NextEra Energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.40 to $2.54. For 2022 and 2023, NextEra Energy expects to grow 6% to 8% off of the expected 2021 adjusted earnings per share, and we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of these ranges in 2021, 2022 and 2023, while at the same time maintaining our strong credit ratings. From 2018 to 2023, we continue to expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow dividends per share roughly 10% rate per year through at least 2022 off of a 2020 base. As always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions.
Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which delivered very strong first quarter results, with year-over-year growth in adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution of approximately 20% and 36%, respectively. Yesterday, the NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.6375 per common unit or $2.55 per common unit on an annualized basis, up approximately 15% from a year earlier. Inclusive of this increase, NextEra Energy Partners has grown its distribution per unit by 240% since the IPO.
Further building on that strength, NextEra Energy Partners recently announced that it had entered into an agreement to acquire an approximately 400-megawatt portfolio of long-term contracted wind assets. This transaction will be NextEra Energy Partners' first third-party acquisition of renewable energy assets and represents another step towards growing LP unit distributions in a manner consistent with our previously stated expectations of 12% to 15% per year through at least 2024. I'll provide additional details on the transaction in just a few minutes.
Turning to the detailed quarterly results. NextEra Energy Partners' first quarter adjusted EBITDA was $354 million, and cash available for distribution was $184 million. New projects, which primarily reflect the asset acquisitions that closed at the end of 2020, contributed $27 million of adjusted EBITDA and $13 million of cash available for distribution. Existing projects added $39 million of adjusted EBITDA and $23 million of cash available for distribution. This strong year-over-year increase in adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution includes favorable results from NextEra Energy Partners' wind and natural gas pipeline investments in Texas during the February winter storm, partially offset by the impacts of an accelerated outage at our Genesis project during the quarter. Cash available for distribution also benefited from a reduction in corporate level interest payments primarily as a result of certain refinancing activities completed in the fourth quarter of last year. Additional details are shown on the accompanying slide.
As I previously mentioned, we continue to execute on our plan to expand NextEra Energy Partners' portfolio and recently entered into an agreement to acquire an approximately 400-megawatt portfolio of long-term contracted operating wind projects. The portfolio has a cash available distribution weighted average contract life of approximately 13 years with high credit quality customers and further enhances the diversity of NextEra Energy Partners' existing portfolio. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of this year, subject to customary closing conditions and the receipt of certain regulatory approvals and generate an attractive CAFD yield and be immediately accretive to LP distributions.
This transaction demonstrates the NextEra Energy Partners' continued ability to execute on its long-term growth plan, and it's enhanced by our ability to take advantage of Energy Resources' best-in-class operating platform to reduce operating expenses at the asset. Energy Resources continues to leverage our culture of continuous improvement to realize lower costs across the renewable assets that it operates. Since 2017, Energy Resources has reduced fleet-wide dollar per megawatt hour O&M cost in its wind fleet by more than 30%. And we believe both Energy Resources' wind and solar operating expenses are significantly better than its industry peers. With Energy Resources operating the NextEra Energy Partners renewable assets, these cost advantages directly benefit LP unitholders. Over the coming years, we look forward to leveraging the benefits of Energy Resources' operating portfolio platform for both NextEra Energy Partners' existing portfolio as well as to add incremental value to future third-party acquisitions.
In addition to providing attractive base returns, these projects are well situated in attractive markets that we anticipate will have significant long-term renewables demand, supporting asset recontracting or potential repowering opportunities after the initial contract terms. We continue to believe that the existing NextEra Energy Partners portfolio has meaningful organic growth opportunities over the coming years and expect the portfolio we are acquiring provides additional long-term investment opportunities as well.
NextEra Energy Partners expects to acquire the portfolio for a base purchase price of approximately $733 million, subject to closing adjustments. The portfolio of assets is expected to contribute adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution of approximately $63 million to $70 million, each on a 5-year average annual run rate basis beginning in December of -- December 31, 2021. We believe this transaction is an attractive investment in which to deploy the $345 million of undrawn funds from the 2020 convertible equity portfolio financing, which we used to fund the acquisition, along with existing NextEra Energy Partners' debt capacity.
Following the recently announced transaction, we now expect to be in the upper end of our previously disclosed year-end 2021 run rate adjusted EBITDA and CAFD expectation ranges of $1.44 billion to $1.62 billion and $600 million to $680 million, respectively. As a reminder, all of our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated IDR fees as we treat these as an operating expense.
From a base of our fourth quarter 2020 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.46, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2021 distribution that is payable in February of 2022 to be in the range of $2.76 to $2.83 per common unit.
In summary, after a strong start to the year, we remain as enthusiastic as ever about the long-term growth prospects for both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. At FPL, we continue to focus on delivering our best-in-class customer value proposition through operational cost effectiveness, productivity and making smart long-term investments. Energy Resources maintains significant competitive advantages and continues to capitalize on the best renewables development period in our history. Combined with the strength of our balance sheet and credit ratings, NextEra Energy is uniquely positioned to drive long-term shareholder value, and we remain intensely focused on executing on these opportunities. NextEra Energy Partners is well positioned to deliver on its already best-in-class runway for LP distribution growth.
Finally, last month, we were honored that NextEra Energy was ranked #1 in a sector for Fortune Magazine's most admired -- World's Most Admired Companies list for the 14th time in 15 years. Moreover, we are recognized for the 14th time as one of the world's most ethical companies by Ethisphere Institute, which is a testament to our team of nearly 15,000 employees who are committed to our core values while helping to build a sustainable energy era that is affordable and clean.
In the coming weeks, we expect to publish NextEra Energy's 2021 ESG Report, which we believe establishes our full alignment with the Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosures (sic) [ Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures ], or TCFD, recommendations. We are also excited to announce our commitment to participation in the Carbon Disclosure Project Survey later this year. These enhanced disclosures highlight the alignment of our corporate strategy with the key tenets of ESG, which our company has been focused on for more than 25 years and remains key to execution of our strategy moving forward.
That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, I will open up the line for questions."

And I appreciate all -- I was going to say the question, but I think it's multiple questions in there. So I'll start and ask John can -- I guess, John or Jim can jump in if they want to add something. We are very excited about opportunities in transmission. And it is founded on a couple of points that I highlighted in the script. First is we couldn't be more excited, as you well know, about the renewables opportunities across the U.S. in the coming decades. A key part of all of those opportunities -- or at least a lot of those opportunities in the latter part of this decade going into the 2030s and beyond is some level of build-out of transmission in the U.S. beyond what's been accomplished. So both to enable long-term renewables development, but also to capitalize on those opportunities, leaves us very interested in transmission.
The Energy Resources team has done a terrific job growing that business, both through organic opportunities, so long-term development efforts of identifying opportunities, participating in processes and ultimately securing opportunities to invest and build and bring successfully into line -- into operation some of those lines as well as through acquisitions, obviously, with GridLiance being the most recent and Trans Bay Cable not being too much far behind it. I expect that we'll grow the business through both going forward as well, continued efforts on the development side as well as participating in opportunities to acquire investments as they come to market.
On the FERC transmission side, we do think there are lots of opportunities to improve how transmission is sited and built across the U.S. And we're optimistic that this administration and this FERC will start to focus on those. And I think it's both through FERC as well as potential focus on transmission in this infrastructure package. So a lot of opportunities to invest in the future."

I think it's really early to comment on the rate case. We've just filed -- I think you've heard us comment a couple of times that these are U-Haul trucks worth of filing requirements that we produce and supply to staff and the interveners and the commission itself to start the process. So we're very early. And no doubt the -- all of the key stakeholders is trying to review that information, and then we'll see the process unfold really over quite a number of months, culminating with the hearings in August. We are very proud, as I highlighted in the comments, both here and in other venues. We're really proud of the case that the FPL team has put together, not just the case itself, but it's built on a foundation of execution, not just over the last 5 years during which we've operated under the settlement agreement, but of course, years and years before that. So we look forward to the opportunity to articulating that through this process.
As it relates to settlements, as you know, here in Florida, there is a great history of settlement agreements, not just with Florida Power & Light Company, but other utilities in the state. We do think that opportunities to have a negotiated outcome that meets the needs of all stakeholders and historically that has produced consistent rates for many years in the future that provides tremendous value for customers. There's a great history of that. We, of course, will be open to it. But it's very early in this process. And again, we look forward to being able to put forward our case."

Really think about it -- as we bring assets into the portfolio, it really gets leveraged on the platform that we already operate. And so the team is really excited about how we can add incremental value through the Energy Resources' management of these assets at NextEra Energy Partners.
We've been very excited about NextEra Energy Partners' growth outlook for quite some time. As we've always indicated, it's well founded -- our excitement is well founded, just simply looking at the backlog of both operating and signed contracts and then the potential for new contracts in Energy Resources. But I've always alluded to the fact that really our market opportunity is this broader market set. And we'll continue to engage and look for opportunities.

I think this is a process that's going to play out over months, not weeks. There's obviously a lot in the plan that's very positive from a renewable standpoint. And as Rebecca said in the prepared remarks, we are excited to work with the administration on the plan that, I think, is really going to accelerate the decarbonization of the U.S. economy over the next several years in a way that, as we've always said for a long time, is going to be essentially free to customers, i.e., not more expensive for customers, right? I mean the thing about the green economy is that it's cleaner, it's greener, but it's also cheaper. And that is why it's -- that's why it's so powerful.
So a lot of details obviously still to be worked out. We're working them. As you can imagine, it's very early and probably too early for me to comment on any of the specific details that we feel like need some work versus the ones that we like a lot.
On the tax front, I think, obviously, that's -- there are a lot of puts and takes with taxes, particularly in a company that has both utility assets as well as renewable assets, and we're working through it. Think about the tax rate being -- tax rate going up something in the $0.04 to $0.07 of headwind. I'm not particularly worried about that in the context of all the other things that would be positive for our company if the infrastructure bill gets passed. And so we continue to work, obviously, that as well. And lots of details still to be laid out on the minimum tax issue. And that also matters as to what the final corporate rate ends up being.
And I guess the last thing I would say is none of this is going to be easy to get done. It's very narrow margins in both the Senate and the House. And folks tend to focus on the Senate and extraordinarily narrow margin given kind of vacancies in the House right now as well. And there's -- the history on midterm elections suggests that it's always an uphill battle for the current administration in midterm -- for whatever party's in power in the midterm elections of a presidency. So that, on the one hand, I think, puts some urgency, I think, around the administration's push to get something done this year. But the flip side is it also -- there's a lot of risk for moderate democrats to take a vote on some of these issues.
So it's going to be very -- any change will be very hard. And I think we were very much a part of the -- we've always been very active in terms of what happens around clean energy policy in Washington, and you can imagine that we're remaining very active on that front and working at it very hard. But I will just say in closing that we're very much encouraged by the focus of the administration on decarbonizing the economy. We feel like it's absolutely the right thing to do, right thing for the planet and the right thing for customers and the right thing for the country, and we stand ready to support an infrastructure plan that accelerates that decarbonization. And I think any acceleration of what's already going on just because of the amazing economics that renewables have relative to the other alternatives plus what's going on with hydrogen, and you saw there was a PTC -- hydrogen PTC as part of the -- suggested as part of the infrastructure plan. So there's a lot of very positive things in there that we're going to be working on to build on over the next several months."

Thanks, Stephen. Let me start with the longer-term view first and then come back to the shorter-term view, which would really tie into, I think, the latter part of your question and comment.
The first part, which is the latter-term view, is when we look at substantial deployment of renewables and battery storage and think about how do you further decarbonize the U.S. electricity sector, when we previously ran that analysis, just trying to add more renewables and add more battery storage, it became very burdensome for customers because you aren't getting a significant amount of value to the more renewables and storage you add, absent other actions. So when we incorporated hydrogen into that thought, which is effectively a form of long-duration storage that is taking advantage of the cheap electricity production coming from renewables, in some cases, excess renewable production at certain times of the day, that substantially changed the value equation for customers to fully decarbonize in the electricity sector. So that gives us great excitement about the potential for substantial renewables and battery storage deployment, knowing that as you continue to deploy more and you find economic forms of long-duration storage, that continues to be very value accretive to customers, both in cost and in the performance of clean energy. So that's kind of the starting point.
But then coming back to a little bit more nearer term, if you think about how do you decarbonize transportation and industrial sectors, the most exciting ways to do that, that we see today is through electrification, whether that's in the form of electric vehicles fueled by batteries or other type of fuel cells or through hydrogen, and hydrogen probably more applicable in the industrial sector, particularly for applications that already exist today. So -- and with -- as Jim highlighted, the potential for hydrogen production tax credit being considered by the administration and by Congress as part of the infrastructure package, in the near term, we could see a closing of the gap perhaps fairly quickly to creating this as an economic alternative to other fuel sources today that are fossil fuel-based. So yes, we couldn't be more excited about it for both the opportunities for renewables, for electricity sector, industrial and transportation, but also, as you suggested, potentially to participate in the hydrogen infrastructure itself, whether it's the electrolyzer or rather forms of creating and distributing the molecules.
How much and where we participate in that is really one of the things that we're focused on in all of these different pilots that both John and the Energy Resources team as well as Eric within Florida Power & Light are thinking through today. How do we do that economically, how do we leverage some of the scale benefits and opportunities that our business can bring to bear in these opportunities. You'll see us continue to place small bets to get experience, to build relationships, to gain knowledge. And over the -- in the short term, that won't add up to a heck of a lot of capital investment opportunity. But it will add up to a tremendous amount of learning and continuing to focus our strategies on where we can add significant amount of value to the infrastructure and the market and ultimately to our shareholders as well."

We have, for quite some time, overall returns between wind and solar. From a risk-adjusted basis, we're happy with returns that we've seen in both sets of technologies. In the short term, in terms of backlog that John and the Energy Resources team, it certainly has been influenced by what I think is the conventional wisdom for a long time that the step-downs for the production tax credit on wind and the step-down for the investment tax credit on solar were, in fact, likely to happen. I think our customers now are thinking about that a little bit differently as discussions in Washington has -- had started to heat up.
But as we look what are likely outcomes, as Jim was talking through, including the potential for extensions of those incentives, I think the key takeaway is they remain -- both technologies are very likely to remain economic for our customers to deploy on behalf of their customers and ultimately leading to significant cost savings for electricity buyers at the end of the day. So they remain attractive from our perspective, and we continue to focus our development efforts on wherever we can add value for our customers."

So we've done a lot of deep dives across our portfolio to think about where weatherizing makes sense. As I've talked about in the past and you well know, we have a lot of interest across Texas, not only wind investment, solar, battery storage, gas infrastructure investments and, of course, the small retail business. So we've been carefully thinking through all of what are the opportunities to learn and perhaps invest going forward.
Specifically to weatherizing, I don't know if you were talking exclusively around the renewables fleet or if you're talking about the gas infrastructure side. But on the renewables side, keep in mind that weatherization really focuses on ambient temperature effects. And ambient temperature, at least for our fleet, I can't speak for everybody's, was not the real issue for any sort of production shortfall versus a FP50 forecast. It was really related to the fact that in this extraordinary event that happened for multiple days, it was preceded by an icing event. So ice was accumulating on our blades. And when ice accumulates on the blades, it's difficult for them to spin. And because the temperatures remained low for several days in a row, there was an opportunity for that ice to shed.
Typically, weatherization packages don't really address ice accumulation on the blades. This is something that the industry is focused on. There are some what, at this point, are very expensive solutions to try to address ice accumulation on the blades. And given that they don't happen every year and certainly don't happen frequently across specific sites every year, it ends up being very cost-prohibitive for something that happens very sporadically. So I'm not optimistic that there's a substantial amount to do to -- at least today with respect to weatherization on the wind side to change the event.
I do think there's opportunities across the gas supply side to improve the ability for gas to flow, which obviously was really at the crux of the issues, along with not only natural gas supply shortages but plant issues and issues in the coal fleet and issues in the nuclear fleet. So there's opportunities across the market to invest."

When you look at ERCOT's overall operating fleet, what they really do have to address at the end of the day is weatherization of gas because you think about 87, 88 gigawatts that were supposed to be available. I mean renewables, on an NCF-adjusted basis, were only about 3 gigawatts of that and very much a rounding error in the problem that occurred in Texas. And so Texas really needs to think through what are the right solutions for gas. Because when you have icing conditions, it doesn't matter if it's blades on a turbine, it's a combustion gas turbine, it's a nuclear power plant, it's a coal plant. When you have severe icing conditions, they're all going to fail. And that's what we saw in Texas. And so the question is what is going to be the right market construct going forward to provide the appropriate incentives for weatherization and for backup fuel on site to make sure that these facilities are capable of running. And I think those are the kinds of issues that the Texas legislature is currently evaluating."

NextEra Energy delivered strong second quarter results and is well positioned to meet its overall objectives for the year. Adjusted earnings per share increased more than 9% year-over-year, reflecting continued strong financial and operational performance across all of the businesses. 
FPL increased earnings per share by $0.04 year-over-year, driven by continued investments in the business. FPL's major capital initiatives remain on track and FPL's focus continues to be on identifying smart capital investments to lower costs, improve reliability and provide clean energy solutions for the benefit of our customers. 
In June, FPL demolished its last coal-fired plant in Florida, with plans to replace it with more clean emissions-free solar energy facilities. During the quarter, FPL also successfully commissioned approximately 373 megawatts of new solar, including the FPL Discovery Solar Energy Center at Kennedy Space Center. With these new additions, FPL surpassed 40% completion of its groundbreaking 30-by-30 plan to install 30 million solar panels by 2030. 
FPL expects to have installed more than 15 million panels by early 2022, which would put the company more than 50% on the way towards completing a 30x30 plan and just over 3 years since the initial announcement. To support its solar build-out, FPO recently began installing the first components of the world's largest integrated solar-powered battery system, the 409-megawatt FPL Manatee Energy Storage Center which is expected to begin serving customers later this year. 
Gulf Power also continued to execute on its growth initiatives during the quarter with its strong financial performance driven primarily by continued investment in the business and further improvements in operational cost effectiveness. Excluding the COVID-19-related expenses, which were subsequently reversed and booked into a regulatory asset in the third quarter of 2020, Gulf Power's year-to-date O&M costs declined by approximately 9% versus the prior year comparable period and have now declined by approximately 31% relative to 2018. 
Gulf Power's operational performance metrics also continued to improve, with the reliability of the generation fleet that we operate and service reliability, improving by 71% and 63%, respectively, year-to-date versus the first half of 2018. We continue to expect that the cost reduction initiatives and smart capital investments that we've previously outlined will generate significant customer and shareholder value in the coming years. 
At Energy Resources, adjusted earnings per share increased by more than 7% year-over-year. The Energy Resources team continues to capitalize on the terrific market opportunity for low-cost renewables and storage, adding approximately 1,840 megawatts to its backlog since the last earnings call. 
This continued origination success is a testament to Energy Resources' significant competitive advantages, including our large pipeline of sites and interconnection queue positions, strong customer relationships, purchasing power and supply chain execution, best-in-class construction expertise, resource assessment capabilities, cost of capital advantages and world-class operations capability. 
Moreover, Energy Resources, advanced data analytics and machine learning capabilities allow us to utilize the nearly 40 billion operating data points, our fleet provides every single day for predictive modeling, further extending our best-in-class O&M and development capabilities. We continue to believe that no company is better positioned than Energy Resources to capitalize on the best renewables development period in our history. 
We are pleased with the progress we've made at NextEra Energy so far in 2021 and headed into the second half of the year, we are well positioned to achieve the full year financial expectations that we've previously discussed, subject to our usual caveats. 
Now let's look at the detailed results beginning with FPL. For the second quarter of 2021, FPL reported net income of $819 million or $0.42 per share, which is an increase of $70 million and $0.04 per share, respectively, year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 10.7% over the same quarter last year and was the principal driver of FPL's net income growth of more than 9%.
FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $1.6 billion in the second quarter, and we expect our full year capital investments to total between $6.6 billion and $6.8 billion. Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.6% for the 12 months ended June 2021. 
During the quarter, we utilized $100 million of reserve amortization to achieve our target regulatory ROE, leaving FPL with a balance of $473 million. As a reminder, rather than seek recovery from customers of the approximately $240 million in Hurricane Dorian storm restoration costs. In 2019, FPL utilized its available reserve amortization to offset nearly all of the expense associated with the write-off of the regulatory asset related to Dorian cost recovery. 
Earlier in the year, FPL and Office of Public Counsel entered into a settlement regarding the prudence of FPL's Hurricane Dorian storm restoration costs and activities, which was approved by the Florida Public Service Commission in May. We are pleased by the commission's determination that all of FPL's Hurricane Dorian restoration costs were prudently incurred and we believe the settlement agreement fairly and reasonably balances the interest of FPL and its customers. 
Earlier this month, FPL responded to Tropical Storm Elsa with a restoration workforce of approximately 7,000 FPL employees and contractors. FPL safely and quickly restored power to nearly 100,000 customers who were impacted by Elsa as the hardening and automation investments that FPL has made since 2006 to build a stronger, smarter and more storm-resilient energy grid continued to benefit customers. 
Elsa was the earliest that a fifth name storm has formed in the Atlantic Basin, and we remain prepared in advance of what is forecasted to be another active hurricane season in 2021. Let me now turn to Gulf Power, which reported second quarter 2021 net income of $63 million or $0.03 per share. 
During the quarter, Gulf Power's capital expenditures were approximately $150 million and we expect its full year capital investments to be between $800 million and $900 million. All of the major capital -- the Gulf Power capital projects, including the North Florida Resiliency Connection that is expected to be in service in mid-2022, continue to progress well. And Gulf Power's regulatory capital employed grew by approximately 17% year-over-year as a result of these smart capital investments for the benefit of customers. 
Gulf Power's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 10.3% for the 12 months ended June 2021. For the full year 2021, we continue to target a regulatory ROE in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.25% to 11.25%. Earlier this month, Florida Public Service Commission also approved a settlement agreement between Gulf Power and the Office of Public Counsel for cost recovery of the approximately $13 million in COVID-19-related expenses, primarily reflected in incremental bad debt and safety expenses as a result of the pandemic. 
We are pleased with this outcome and believe it demonstrates the continued constructive regulatory environment in the state of Florida as we work to improve Gulf Power's value proposition of low cost, high reliability, excellent customer service and clean energy for our customers. 
As we anticipated, Florida's economic activity has rebounded since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic last year as reflected by a wide range of positive economic indicators. Florida's current unemployment rate is 5%, which remains well below the national average. Rolling 3-month average of new building permits are up approximately 46% year-over-year, which is the highest growth rate in nearly 8 years and are the second highest new building permits in the nation. 
As another indicator of health and Florida's economy, Florida's retail sales index was up over 40% versus the prior year. The Case-Shiller seasonally adjusted index for South Florida home prices is up over 14% on an annual basis. 
Recent population growth estimates indicate that Florida remains one of the top destinations for relocating Americans, with Florida adding nearly 330,000 new residents between April of 2020 and April of 2021. We expect this trend to continue with Florida's population projected to grow at an average annual rate of 1% through 2023; and FPL, including Gulf Power, forecasts adding almost 500,000 new customer accounts from 2018 through 2025. 
During the quarter, FPL's average number of customers increased by approximately 70,400 from the comparable prior year quarter driven by continued solid underlying population growth. FPL's second quarter retail sales increased 0.1% from the prior year comparable period. Partially offsetting customer growth was a decline in weather-related usage per customer of approximately 2.8%. 
On a weather-normalized basis, second quarter sales increased 2.9%, with continued strong underlying usage contributing favorably. For Gulf Power, the average number of customers grew roughly 1.5% versus the comparable prior year quarter. And Gulf Power's second quarter retail sales decreased 1% year-over-year as strong customer growth was more than offset by an unfavorable weather comparison relative to 2020. 
As we previously stated, on March 12, we initiated Florida Power & Light's 2021 base rate proceeding. The 4-year base rate plan we have proposed has been designed to support continued investments in clean energy generation, long-term infrastructure and advanced technology, which improves reliability and keep to keep customer bills low. 
Today, FPL's typical residential bills remain well below the national average and the lowest among the top 20 investor-owned utilities in the nation. With the proposed base rate adjustments and current projections for fuel and other costs, FPL's typical residential bill is expected to be approximately 20% below the projected national average and typical Gulf Power residential bills are projected to decrease approximately 1% over the 4-year rate plan. 
As always, we are open to the possibility of resolving our rate request through our care settlement agreement and our core focus remains on pursuing a fair and objective review of our case that supports continued execution of our successful strategy for customers. 
Energy Resources reported second quarter 2021 GAAP losses of $315 million or $0.16 per share. Adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $574 million or $0.29 per share. Energy Resources adjusted earnings per share in the second quarter increased more than 7% versus the prior year comparable period. 
The effect of mark-to-market on nonqualifying hedges, which is excluded from adjusted earnings, was the primary driver of the difference between Energy Resources second quarter GAAP and adjusted earnings results. Contributions from new investments added $0.04 per share versus the prior year and primarily reflects growth in our contracted renewables and battery storage program. 
Adjusted earnings per share contributions from existing generation and storage assets increased $0.01 year-over-year, which includes the impact of unfavorable wind resource during the second quarter. And NextEra Energy transmissions adjusted earnings per share contribution also increased $0.01 year-over-year. 
Our customer supply and trading business contribution was $0.03 lower year-over-year, primarily due to unfavorable market conditions. All other impacts decreased results by $0.01 per share versus 2020. The Energy Resources development team continues to capitalize on what we believe is the best renewables development environment in our history during the second quarter, with the team adding approximately 1,840 megawatts of renewables and storage projects to our backlog. 
Since our last earnings call, we've added approximately 285 megawatts of new wind and wind repowering, 1,450 megawatts of solar and 105 megawatts of battery storage to our backlog of signed contracts. With nearly 3.5 years remaining before the end of 2024, we have already signed more than 75% of the megawatts needed to realize the low end of our 2021 to 2024 development expectations range. 
Since the last call, we have also executed a 310-megawatt build-owned transfer agreement, which is not included in our backlog additions. Our customer intends to use the solar plus storage project to replace existing coal generation and we are excited to be able to continue supporting the industry's transition away from old and efficient forms of generation and into clean, reliable and low-cost renewables and storage. 
Our engineering and construction team continues to perform exceptionally well, commissioning approximately 330 megawatts during the quarter and keeping the backlog of wind, solar and storage projects that we expect to build in 2021 and 2022 on track. We are well positioned to complete our more than $20 billion capital investment program at Energy Resources for 2021 and 2022. 
Last month, the IRS extended safe harbor eligibility on production tax credits and investment tax credits, providing projects that began construction between 2016 and 2019 with 6 years to complete construction and projects that started construction in 2020 with 5 years to achieve their in-service dates and qualify for federal tax credits. 
We believe the extension reflects the strong support of the buy administration for new renewables and may enable an incremental 1 to 1.5 gigawatts of new wind and wind repowering opportunities. We now have more than $2.2 billion of safe harbor wind and solar equipment, which could support as much as $45 billion of wind, solar and battery storage investments across all of our businesses from 2021 to 2024. 
Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the second quarter of 2021, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $256 million or $0.13 per share. NextEra Energy's 2021 second quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $1.4 billion and $0.71 per share, respectively. 
Adjusted earnings from Corporate and Other segment were roughly flat year-over-year. 
Over the past few months, NextEra Energy issued nearly $3.3 billion in new financings under its innovative new NextEra Green bond structure. Funds raised with NextEra Energy -- NextEra Green bonds are designated for specific renewable energy and store projects under development across our businesses. And if funds are not used to bring the renewable projects online within 2 years, there is a step-up in the interest rate on the debt. 
Our inaugural NextEra Green issuance was 4.5x oversubscribed, priced at a premium to the market and was well received by investors. We believe that NextEra Green will set a new standard for green issuances moving forward. NextEra Energy has raised more than $9 billion in new capital year-to-date on very favorable terms as we continue to execute on our financing plan for the year. 
Finally, in June, S&P affirmed all of its ratings for NextEra Energy and lowered its downgrade threshold for its funds from operation or FFO to debt metric from the previous level of 21% to the new level of 20%. We believe this favorable adjustment reflects the strength of our business as well as  recognition of NextEra Energy's leading position in the utility and renewable energy sectors on environmental, social and governance, or ESG factors. 
I believe that this is the first time that S&P has formally recognized the benefits to business risk profile related to ESG factors by allowing more constructive financial metrics. Since it began its practice of identifying the specific ESG metrics that drive a company's overall credit position. Notably, S&P also revised NextEra Energy's management and governance assessment from satisfactory to strong to reflect its views on our comprehensive enterprise-wide risk management standards and successful track record of consistently implementing our strategic planning efforts. 
Our long-term financial expectations through 2023 remain unchanged. For 2021, NextEra Energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.40 to $2.54. For 2022 and 2023, NextEra Energy expects to grow 6% to 8% off of the expected 2021 adjusted earnings per share. And we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of these ranges in 2021, 2022 and 2023, while at the same time, maintaining our strong credit ratings. 
From 2018 to 2023, we continue to expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% rate per year through at least 2022 off of a 2020 base. As always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions. 
Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners. NextEnergy Partners portfolio performed well and delivered financial results generally in line with our expectations after accounting for the below-average renewable resource. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution have increased by roughly 9% and 11%, respectively, versus 2020. 
This strong operational and financial performance highlights the NextEra Energy partners remains well positioned to continue to deliver on its outstanding growth objectives. Yesterday, the NextEnergy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.665 per common unit or $2.65 per common unit on an annualized basis, up approximately 15% from a year earlier. Inclusive of this increase, NextEnergy Partners has now grown its distribution per unit by more than 250% and since the IPO. 
Further building on that strength, today, we are announcing that NextEnergy Partners has entered into an agreement to acquire approximately 590 net megawatts of geographically diverse wind and solar projects from NextEra Energy Resources. I will provide additional details on the transaction in a few minutes. 
NextEra Energy Partners also completed multiple financings during the second quarter to secure funding for its recently announced 2021 acquisitions and further enhance its financing flexibility. In June, NextEnergy Partners raised approximately $500 million in new 0% coupon convertible notes and concurrently entered into a capped call structure. It is expected to result in NextEnergy Partners retaining the upside from up to 50% appreciation in its unit price over the 3 years associated with the convertible notes. 
NextEra Energy Partners also drew the remaining funds from its 2020 convertible equity portfolio financing, which was upsized by approximately $150 million during the quarter, evidencing continued investor demand for exposure to the high-quality, long-term contracted renewables projects and the underlying portfolio of assets that was established last year. 
Finally, NextEnergy Partners has successfully completed the sale of approximately 700,000 NEP common units year-to-date through its recently expired at the market or ATM program, raising roughly $50 million in proceeds. 
Going forward, we will continue to seek opportunities to use the ATM program depending on market conditions and other considerations. And in the near term, NextEnergy Partners intends to renew the program for up to $300 million in issuances and over the next 3 years to permit additional financing flexibility. 
As a result of these financings and the strong cash flow generation of its existing portfolio, extent Partners ended the quarter with more than $2.2 billion in liquidity, which includes funds raised in the second quarter financing activities and existing partnership debt capacity to support its ongoing growth initiatives, including the acquisition of the approximately 590 net megawatts of renewables from Energy Resources as well as his previously announced acquisition of approximately 400 megawatts of operating wind projects. both of which are expected to close later this year. 
Let me now review the detailed results for NextEra Energy Partners. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $350 million was roughly flat versus the prior year comparable quarter, driven by favorable contributions from the approximately 500 megawatts of new wind and solar projects acquired in 2020. 
Weaker wind and solar resource in the second quarter, which reduced this quarter's adjusted EBITDA contribution from existing projects. It By roughly $22 million. was partially offset by positive contributions to adjusted EBITDA from last year's repowerings and the Texas pipelines. Wind resource for the quarter was 93% of the long-term average versus 100% in the second quarter of 2020.
Cash available for distribution of $151 million for the second quarter was also reduced for existing projects due to the distributions for the convertible equity portfolio financing entered into late last year. As a reminder, this convertible equity portfolio financing recapitalize NextEnergy Partners existing Genesis Solar project and other assets and the proceeds were used to fund last year's acquisition from Energy Resources. 
Additional details of our second quarter results are shown on the accompanying slide. We remain on track for the strong full year growth consistent with our long-term growth objectives of 12% to 15% distribution per unit growth through at least 2024. 
As I previously mentioned, we continue to execute on our plan to expand NextEnergy Partners portfolio with an agreement to acquire assets in a diverse portfolio of long-term contracted wind and solar projects from Energy Resources. The portfolio consists of approximately 830 megawatts of renewables, of which NextEnergy Partners will be acquiring an approximately 590-megawatt net interest. 
NextEnergy Partners interest in the portfolio will consist of approximately 510 megawatts of the universal scale wind and solar projects and approximately 80 megawatts of distributed solar projects, which is Next Energy Partners first acquisition of distributed generation assets. The portfolio to be acquired by next energy partners has a cash available for distribution, weighted average contract life of approximately 17 years and a counterparty credit rating of Baa1 at Moody's and BBB+ at S&P. Additional details on the portfolio of assets to be acquired by NexGen Partners can be found in the appendix of today's presentation. 
Energy Resources currently owns the country's largest portfolio of distributed generation assets with commercial and industrial customers and expects to triple its capital investment in distributed generation from 2020 through 2024. NextEnergy Partners expects to benefit from this expansion over the coming years through future acquisitions from Energy Resources. 
NextEnergy Partners expects to acquire the portfolio for a total consideration of $563 million, subject to working capital and other adjustments. NextEnergy Partners share of the portfolio's debt and tax equity financing is estimated to be approximately $270 million at the time of closing. The acquisition is expected to contribute adjusted EBITDA of approximately $90 million to $100 million and cash available for distribution of approximately $41 million to $49 million, each on a 5-year average annual run rate basis beginning on December 31, 2021. 
The purchase price for the transaction is expected to be funded with existing liquidity and the transaction is expected to close prior to year-end and be immediately accretive to LP distributions. Extranet Partners continues to expect to be in the upper end of our previously disclosed year-end 2021 run rate adjusted EBITDA and CAFD expectation ranges of $1.44 billion to $1.62 billion, and $600 million to $680 million, respectively. 
As a reminder, all of our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated IDR fees as we treat these as an operating expense. From the base of our fourth quarter 2020 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.46, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2021 distribution that is payable in February of 2022 and to be in the range of $2.76 to $2.83 per common unit. 
In summary, we remain as enthusiastic as ever about the long-term growth prospects both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. At NextEra Energy, we were honored to be named on Time Magazine's first-ever list of top 100 most influential companies, which highlights businesses making an extraordinary impact around the world. We are proud to be leading the clean energy transformation in our sector and remain focused on executing upon the opportunities presented by the significant growth in wind, solar and various forms of energy storage in the U.S. over the coming decades. 
At FPL, including Gulf Power, that means continuing to deliver on our best-in-class customer value proposition of low bills, high reliability and clean energy solutions. At Energy Resources, our competitive advantages position us well to capture a meaningful share of the significant and expanding market for renewables. And at NextEnergy Partners with its continued access to low-cost capital and accretive acquisition opportunities is well positioned as ever to take advantage of the clean energy transformation reshaping the energy industry. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open up the line for questions."

Thanks, Shar. Appreciate the question. From our perspective, and we're looking out decades and looking at the enormous renewables build opportunity across the U.S., it is clear that over time, new transmission needs to be built to support some of that build-out. And it's not necessarily imperative today for that transmission to be built, but it certainly is important to start today to build the type of infrastructure that's needed over time. So we're really excited about the opportunities that the next energy transmission team has. And I would expect over time that we will grow both organically and continue to look for acquisition opportunities like we have over the last couple of years to supplement and build out that portfolio. We're thrilled with the Transnet cable acquisition that we closed a couple of years ago. Very excited to bring the Grid Lions team on board, and we'll continue to focus on opportunities, both organically and through acquisition over time. From a broader policy standpoint, we thought it important for FERC and the regional ISOs to continue to focus on how do you support that transmission build-out. And we certainly are happy to see that to start to be a focus at FERC this year, in particular, and contemplating how do they support it going forward. And I think there's a receptive audience in the bid administration, making sure that they support laying a foundation that's supportive of renewables, not just in the next couple of years, but in the next couple of decades. So transmission moves slowly. You know that. So stay tuned, but we're optimistic about our direct prospects in the near term as well as longer term."

And just as a follow-up, is energy storage still kind of a large component of the backlog and contracted additions or has there been some pricing pressure there?"

And we're really pleased not only with what we've seen looking back and what the team has been able to execute on, but also looking forward. And that's what gave us the confidence just early this year. to not only increase but expand the horizon for our development expectations such that our 4-year period starting '21 through '24 is 23 to 30 gigawatts which is just an exceptional number and 1 that we're really excited and proud of the team for taking on, and we're thrilled to be at 75% already at the low end today. 
In terms of our customer demand remains very strong. across the board, and we're certainly excited about bringing that into more signed contracts going forward. In terms of costs, as you know, we'll continue to incorporate our latest expectations in the industry's latest expectations for costs, and we feel very comfortable with the returns that we see and excited about the opportunities going forward."

And I'll start with some kind of near-term thoughts and then think about the broader term second. Near term, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, we feel very comfortable with where we are with our backlog and what we plan to build in the 2021 and 2022 time frame. And our comments reflected that in the prepared remarks. And it's a real credit to the way that we approach this business and our engineering construction and integrated supply chain teams really working through a variety of different circumstances over the last 1.5 years. And we've secured the equipment that we need to build out those projects and of course, have some contractual agreements in place that help us feel comfortable about that position. From a longer-term standpoint, I think it still remains to be seen in some respects. You can see that in a broad set of discussion across the financial and the broader U.S. economy. -- dialogue of whether or not this is temporary related to near-term snap back and demand and hurdles in the supply chain that may not persist over time or if it is systemic and persisting. So I think that remains a little bit to be seen. One thing that's very fortunate for renewables, as you all well know, is that renewable energy projects are very much the least cost form of generation in many parts, if not most, of parts of the U.S. So even if there is a change in pricing, if these cost increases are persistent and systemic over a long period of time. The value proposition is still very clear for renewables relative to alternatives. And then beyond that, we also need to think about what implications, if any, there will be from policy changes. So I think the net takeaway is somewhat promised in your question is that we feel comfortable with where we are. We're prepared for a variety of set of circumstances, and we're thrilled with the position of renewables and the growth opportunities and honestly, the decades ahead."

And so the safe harbor extension creates 1 to 1.5 gigawatts of opportunity for us on the wind side. And if I could come back just for 1 second on Stephen Bird's question on the EBITDA multiples. The EBITDA multiples on this drop-down were consistent with what we've done in the past. You got to remember, it always gets a little bit tricky with tax credits. You also have to remember that even after the sale of the NEP, we own a good portion of NEP. We get cash distributions. We get IDRs. When you take all that into account on an EBITDA multiple basis, we end up with what we believe is a very competitive marker against where renewable assets trade today."

The middle of it is this market is absolutely growing significantly, and we expect it to continue to grow significantly for years to come. So from our perspective, the pie absolutely is getting bigger. Over a long period of time, our market share has remained very strong in the 20-ish percent range for wind and probably in the mid-teens occasionally a little bit higher and case probably in the mid-teens on solar and storage has actually been higher than both of those as this market has grown significantly over the last couple of years. When we look out, we focus on both maintaining market share and also maintaining attractive returns. And we think our competitive advantages have enabled us to do that over time. And we think both is important and be among them is very important. Sudan and his team are focused on getting the best of the projects that we see out in the marketplace and ultimately being very happy with the projects that we put into the portfolio. We get asked the question about new entrants a lot. You know this industry well. If you look back and you stack power purchase agreement awards over many years, you'll see that very big bar to the left when we put the chart together and a couple of bars that are smaller, of course, but still decent size and then a whole bunch of small players to get 100 -- a couple of hundred megawatts a given year and that dynamic continues to be consistent. That's for greenfield and kind of in the more development-oriented projects. There has been more capital coming in, but that's mostly post-COD. And when we think about capturing the value of developing renewables it really is on that twinkle in the eye of a developer, the COD is the enormous opportunity to create value, and we continue to be very good at it and enhance those competitive advantages to maintain that position over time. So we're really excited about what we've been able to accomplish, really excited about our position and really excited about the energy transformation overall and the opportunities that presents."

NextEra Energy delivered strong second quarter results and is well positioned to meet its overall objectives for the year. Adjusted earnings per share increased more than 9% year-over-year, reflecting continued strong financial and operational performance across all of the businesses.  
FPL increased earnings per share by $0.04 year-over-year, driven by continued investments in the business. FPL's major capital initiatives remain on track and FPL's focus continues to be on identifying smart capital investments to lower costs, improve reliability and provide clean energy solutions for the benefit of our customers.  
In June, FPL demolished its last coal-fired plant in Florida, with plans to replace it with more clean emissions-free solar energy facilities. During the quarter, FPL also successfully commissioned approximately 373 megawatts of new solar, including the FPL Discovery Solar Energy Center at Kennedy Space Center. With these new additions, FPL surpassed 40% completion of its groundbreaking 30-by-30 plan to install 30 million solar panels by 2030.  
FPL expects to have installed more than 15 million panels by early 2022, which would put the company more than 50% on the way towards completing a 30-by-30 plan in just over 3 years since the initial announcement. To support its solar build-out, FPL recently began installing the first components of the world's largest integrated solar-powered battery system, the 409-megawatt FPL Manatee Energy Storage Center which is expected to begin serving customers later this year.  
Gulf Power also continued to execute on its growth initiatives during the quarter with its strong financial performance driven primarily by continued investment in the business and further improvements in operational cost effectiveness. Excluding the COVID-19-related expenses, which were subsequently reversed and booked into a regulatory asset in the third quarter of 2020, Gulf Power's year-to-date O&M costs declined by approximately 9% versus the prior year comparable period and have now declined by approximately 31% relative to 2018.  
Gulf Power's operational performance metrics also continued to improve, with reliability of the generation fleet that we operate and service reliability improving by 71% and 63%, respectively, year-to-date versus the first half of 2018. We continue to expect that the cost reduction initiatives and smart capital investments that we've previously outlined will generate significant customer and shareholder value in the coming years.  
At Energy Resources, adjusted earnings per share increased by more than 7% year-over-year. The Energy Resources team continues to capitalize on the terrific market opportunity for low-cost renewables and storage, adding approximately 1,840 megawatts to its backlog since the last earnings call.  
This continued origination success is a testament to Energy Resources' significant competitive advantages, including our large pipeline of sites and interconnection queue positions, strong customer relationships, purchasing power and supply chain execution, best-in-class construction expertise, resource assessment capabilities, cost of capital advantages and world-class operations capability.  
Moreover, Energy Resources' advanced data analytics and machine learning capabilities allow us to utilize the nearly 40 billion operating data points our fleet provides every single day for predictive modeling, further extending our best-in-class O&M and development capabilities. We continue to believe that no company is better positioned than Energy Resources to capitalize on the best renewables development period in our history.  
We are pleased with the progress we've made at NextEra Energy so far in 2021 and headed into the second half of the year, we are well positioned to achieve the full year financial expectations that we've previously discussed, subject to our usual caveats.  
Now let's look at the detailed results beginning with FPL. For the second quarter of 2021, FPL reported net income of $819 million or $0.42 per share, which is an increase of $70 million and $0.04 per share, respectively, year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 10.7% over the same quarter last year and was the principal driver of FPL's net income growth of more than 9%. 
FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $1.6 billion in the second quarter, and we expect our full year capital investments to total between $6.6 billion and $6.8 billion. Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.6% for the 12 months ended June 2021.  
During the quarter, we utilized $100 million of reserve amortization to achieve our target regulatory ROE, leaving FPL with a balance of $473 million. As a reminder, rather than seek recovery from customers of the approximately $240 million in Hurricane Dorian storm restoration costs, in 2019, FPL utilized its available reserve amortization to offset nearly all of the expense associated with the write-off of the regulatory asset related to Dorian cost recovery.  
Earlier in the year, FPL and Office of Public Counsel entered into a settlement regarding the prudence of FPL's Hurricane Dorian storm restoration costs and activities, which was approved by the Florida Public Service Commission in May. We are pleased by the commission's determination that all of FPL's Hurricane Dorian restoration costs were prudently incurred and we believe the settlement agreement fairly and reasonably balances the interest of FPL and its customers.  
Earlier this month, FPL responded to Tropical Storm Elsa with a restoration workforce of approximately 7,000 FPL employees and contractors. FPL safely and quickly restored power to nearly 100,000 customers who were impacted by Elsa as the hardening and automation investments that FPL has made since 2006 to build a stronger, smarter and more storm-resilient energy grid continue to benefit customers.  
Elsa was the earliest that a fifth named storm has formed in the Atlantic basin, and we remain prepared in advance of what is forecasted to be another active hurricane season in 2021. Let me now turn to Gulf Power, which reported second quarter 2021 net income of $63 million or $0.03 per share.  
During the quarter, Gulf Power's capital expenditures were approximately $150 million and we expect its full year capital investments to be between $800 million and $900 million. All of the major capital at the Gulf Power capital projects, including the North Florida Resiliency Connection that is expected to be in service in mid-2022, continue to progress well. And Gulf Power's regulatory capital employed grew by approximately 17% year-over-year as a result of these smart capital investments for the benefit of customers.  
Gulf Power's reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 10.3% for the 12 months ended June 2021. For the full year 2021, we continue to target a regulatory ROE in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.25% to 11.25%. Earlier this month, Florida Public Service Commission also approved a settlement agreement between Gulf Power and the Office of Public Counsel for cost recovery of the approximately $13 million in COVID-19-related expenses, primarily reflected in incremental bad debt and safety expenses as a result of the pandemic.  
We are pleased with this outcome and believe it demonstrates the continued constructive regulatory environment in the state of Florida as we work to improve Gulf Power's customer value proposition of low cost, high reliability, excellent customer service and clean energy for our customers.  
As we anticipated, Florida's economic activity has rebounded since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic last year as reflected by a wide range of positive economic indicators. Florida's current unemployment rate is 5%, which remains well below the national average. Rolling 3-month average of new building permits are up approximately 46% year-over-year, which is the highest growth rate in nearly 8 years and are the second highest new building permits in the nation.  
As another indicator of health and Florida's economy, Florida's retail sales index was up over 40% versus the prior year. The Case-Shiller seasonally adjusted index for South Florida home prices is up over 14% on an annual basis.  
Recent population growth estimates indicate that Florida remains one of the top destinations for relocating Americans, with Florida adding nearly 330,000 new residents between April of 2020 and April of 2021. We expect this trend to continue with Florida's population projected to grow at an average annual rate of 1% through 2023; and FPL, including Gulf Power, forecast adding almost 500,000 new customer accounts from 2018 through 2025.  
During the quarter, FPL's average number of customers increased by approximately 70,400 from the comparable prior year quarter driven by continued solid underlying population growth. FPL's second quarter retail sales increased 0.1% from the prior year comparable period. Partially offsetting customer growth was a decline in weather-related usage per customer of approximately 2.8%. On a weather-normalized basis, second quarter sales increased 2.9%, with continued strong underlying usage contributing favorably. 
For Gulf Power, the average number of customers grew roughly 1.5% versus the comparable prior year quarter. And Gulf Power's second quarter retail sales decreased 1% year-over-year as strong customer growth was more than offset by an unfavorable weather comparison relative to 2020.  
As we previously stated, on March 12, we initiated Florida Power & Light's 2021 base rate proceeding. The 4-year base rate plan we have proposed has been designed to support continued investments in clean energy generation, long-term infrastructure and advanced technology, which improves reliability and keep -- helps to keep customer bills low.  
Today, FPL's typical residential bills remain well below the national average and the lowest among the top 20 investor-owned utilities in the nation. With the proposed base rate adjustments and current projections for fuel and other costs, FPL's typical residential bill is expected to be approximately 20% below the projected national average and typical Gulf Power residential bills are projected to decrease approximately 1% over the 4-year rate plan.  
As always, we are open to the possibility of resolving our rate request through a fair settlement agreement and our core focus remains on pursuing a fair and objective review of our case that supports continued execution of our successful strategy for customers.  
Energy Resources reported second quarter 2021 GAAP losses of $315 million or $0.16 per share. Adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $574 million or $0.29 per share. Energy Resources adjusted earnings per share in the second quarter increased more than 7% versus the prior year comparable period.  
The effect of mark-to-market on nonqualifying hedges, which is excluded from adjusted earnings, was the primary driver of the difference between Energy Resources second quarter GAAP and adjusted earnings results. Contributions from new investments added $0.04 per share versus the prior year and primarily reflects growth in our contracted renewables and battery storage program.  
Adjusted earnings per share contributions from existing generation and storage assets increased $0.01 year-over-year, which includes the impact of unfavorable wind resource during the second quarter. And NextEra Energy Transmission's adjusted earnings per share contribution also increased $0.01 year-over-year.  
Our customer supply and trading business contribution was $0.03 lower year-over-year, primarily due to unfavorable market conditions. All other impacts decreased results by $0.01 per share versus 2020. The Energy Resources development team continues to capitalize on what we believe is the best renewables development environment in our history during the second quarter, with the team adding approximately 1,840 megawatts of renewables and storage projects to our backlog.  
Since our last earnings call, we've added approximately 285 megawatts of new wind and wind repowering, 1,450 megawatts of solar and 105 megawatts of battery storage to our backlog of signed contracts. With nearly 3.5 years remaining before the end of 2024, we have already signed more than 75% of the megawatts needed to realize the low end of our 2021 to 2024 development expectations range.  
Since the last call, we have also executed a 310-megawatt build-own-transfer agreement, which is not included in our backlog additions. Our customer intends to use the solar-plus-storage project to replace existing coal generation and we are excited to be able to continue supporting the industry's transition away from old inefficient forms of generation into clean, reliable and low-cost renewables and storage.  
Our engineering and construction team continues to perform exceptionally well, commissioning approximately 330 megawatts during the quarter and keeping the backlog of wind, solar and storage projects that we expect to build in 2021 and 2022 on track. We are well positioned to complete our more than $20 billion capital investment program at Energy Resources for 2021 and 2022.  
Last month, the IRS extended safe harbor eligibility on production tax credits and investment tax credits, providing projects that began construction between 2016 and 2019 with 6 years to complete construction and projects that started construction in 2020 with 5 years to achieve their in-service dates and qualify for federal tax credits.  
We believe the extension reflects the strong support of the Biden administration for new renewables and may enable an incremental 1 to 1.5 gigawatts of new wind and wind repowering opportunities. We now have more than $2.2 billion of safe harbor wind and solar equipment, which could support as much as $45 billion of wind, solar and battery storage investments across all of our businesses from 2021 to 2024.  
Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the second quarter of 2021, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $256 million or $0.13 per share. NextEra Energy's 2021 second quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $1.4 billion and $0.71 per share, respectively. Adjusted earnings from Corporate and Other segment were roughly flat year-over-year.  
Over the past few months, NextEra Energy issued nearly $3.3 billion in new financings under its innovative new NextEra green bonds structure. Funds raised with NextEra Energy -- NextEra green bonds are designated for specific renewable energy and storage projects under development across our businesses. And if funds are not used to bring the renewable projects online within 2 years, there is a step-up in the interest rate on the debt.  
Our inaugural NextEra green issuance was 4.5x oversubscribed, priced at a premium to the market and was well received by investors. We believe that NextEra green will set a new standard for green issuances moving forward. NextEra Energy has raised more than $9 billion in new capital year-to-date on very favorable terms as we continue to execute on our financing plan for the year.  
Finally, in June, S&P affirmed all of its ratings for NextEra Energy and lowered its downgrade threshold for its funds from operation or FFO to debt metric from the previous level of 21% to the new level of 20%. We believe this favorable adjustment reflects the strength of our business as well as recognition of NextEra Energy's leading position in the utility and renewable energy sectors on environmental, social and governance, or ESG, factors.  
I believe that this is the first time that S&P has formally recognized the benefits-to-business-risk profile related to ESG factors by allowing more constructive financial metrics since it began its practice of identifying the specific ESG metrics that drive a company's overall credit position. Notably, S&P also revised NextEra Energy's management and governance assessment from satisfactory to strong to reflect its views on our comprehensive enterprise-wide risk management standards and successful track record of consistently implementing our strategic planning efforts.  
Our long-term financial expectations through 2023 remain unchanged. For 2021, NextEra Energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.40 to $2.54. For 2022 and 2023, NextEra Energy expects to grow 6% to 8% off of the expected 2021 adjusted earnings per share. And we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of these ranges in 2021, 2022 and 2023 while, at the same time, maintaining our strong credit ratings.  
From 2018 to 2023, we continue to expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% rate per year through at least 2022 off of a 2020 base. As always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions.  
Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners. NextEra Energy Partners' portfolio performed well and delivered financial results generally in line with our expectations after accounting for the below-average renewable resource. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution have increased by roughly 9% and 11%, respectively, versus 2020.  
This strong operational and financial performance highlights that NextEra Energy Partners remains well positioned to continue to deliver on its outstanding growth objectives. Yesterday, the NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.6625 per common unit or $2.65 per common unit on an annualized basis, up approximately 15% from a year earlier. Inclusive of this increase, NextEra Energy Partners has now grown its distribution per unit by more than 250% since the IPO.  
Further building on that strength, today we are announcing that NextEra Energy Partners has entered into an agreement to acquire approximately 590 net megawatts of geographically diverse wind and solar projects from NextEra Energy Resources. I will provide additional details on the transaction in a few minutes. 
NextEra Energy Partners also completed multiple financings during the second quarter to secure funding for its recently announced 2021 acquisitions and further enhance its financing flexibility. In June, NextEra Energy Partners raised approximately $500 million in new 0% coupon convertible notes and concurrently entered into a capped call structure. It is expected to result in NextEra Energy Partners retaining the upside from up to 50% appreciation in its unit price over the 3 years associated with the convertible notes. 
NextEra Energy Partners also drew the remaining funds from its 2020 convertible equity portfolio financing, which was upsized by approximately $150 million during the quarter, evidencing continued investor demand for exposure to the high-quality, long-term contracted renewables projects and the underlying portfolio of assets that was established last year. 
Finally, NextEra Energy Partners has successfully completed the sale of approximately 700,000 NEP common units year-to-date through its recently expired at-the-market or ATM program, raising roughly $50 million in proceeds. 
Going forward, we will continue to seek opportunities to use the ATM program depending on market conditions and other considerations. And in the near term, NextEra Energy Partners intends to renew the program for up to $300 million in issuances over the next 3 years to permit additional financing flexibility. 
As a result of these financings and the strong cash flow generation of its existing portfolio, NextEra Energy Partners ended the quarter with more than $2.2 billion in liquidity, which includes funds raised in the second quarter financing activities and existing partnership debt capacity to support its ongoing growth initiatives, including the acquisition of the approximately 590 net megawatts of renewables from Energy Resources as well as its previously announced acquisition of approximately 400 megawatts of operating wind projects, both of which are expected to close later this year. 
Let me now review the detailed results for NextEra Energy Partners. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $350 million was roughly flat versus the prior year comparable quarter, driven by favorable contributions from the approximately 500 megawatts of new wind and solar projects acquired in 2020. 
Weaker wind and solar resource in the second quarter, which reduced this quarter's adjusted EBITDA contribution from existing projects by roughly $22 million, was partially offset by positive contributions to adjusted EBITDA from last year's repowerings in the Texas pipelines. Wind resource for the quarter was 93% of the long-term average versus 100% in the second quarter of 2020.
Cash available for distribution of $151 million for the second quarter was also reduced for existing projects due to the distributions for the convertible equity portfolio financing entered into late last year. As a reminder, this convertible equity portfolio financing recapitalized NextEra Energy Partners existing Genesis solar project and other assets and the proceeds were used to fund last year's acquisition from Energy Resources. 
Additional details of our second quarter results are shown on the accompanying slide. We remain on track for the strong full year growth consistent with our long-term growth objectives of 12% to 15% distributions per unit growth through at least 2024. 
As I previously mentioned, we continue to execute on our plan to expand NextEra Energy Partners' portfolio with an agreement to acquire assets in a diverse portfolio of long-term contracted wind and solar projects from Energy Resources. The portfolio consists of approximately 830 megawatts of renewables, of which NextEra Energy Partners will be acquiring an approximately 590-megawatt net interest. 
NextEra Energy Partners' interest in the portfolio will consist of approximately 510 megawatts of the universal scale wind and solar projects and approximately 80 megawatts of distributed solar projects, which is Next Energy Partners' first acquisition of distributed generation assets. The portfolio to be acquired by NextEra Energy Partners has a cash available for distribution weighted average contract life of approximately 17 years and a counterparty credit rating of Baa1 at Moody's and BBB+ at S&P. Additional details on the portfolio of assets to be acquired by NextEra Energy Partners can be found in the appendix of today's presentation. 
Energy Resources currently owns the country's largest portfolio of distributed generation assets with commercial and industrial customers and expects to triple its capital investment in distributed generation from 2020 through 2024. NextEra Energy Partners expects to benefit from this expansion over the coming years through future acquisitions from Energy Resources. 
NextEra Energy Partners expects to acquire the portfolio for a total consideration of $563 million, subject to working capital and other adjustments. NextEra Energy Partners' share of the portfolio's debt and tax equity financing is estimated to be approximately $270 million at the time of closing. The acquisition is expected to contribute adjusted EBITDA of approximately $90 million to $100 million and cash available for distribution of approximately $41 million to $49 million, each on a 5-year average annual run rate basis beginning on December 31, 2021. 
The purchase price for the transaction is expected to be funded with existing liquidity and the transaction is expected to close prior to year-end and be immediately accretive to LP distributions. NextEra Energy Partners continues to expect to be in the upper end of our previously disclosed year-end 2021 run rate, adjusted EBITDA and CAFD expectation ranges of $1.44 billion to $1.62 billion and $600 million to $680 million, respectively. 
As a reminder, all of our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated IDR fees as we treat these as an operating expense. From the base of our fourth quarter 2020 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.46, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024. We expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter 2021 distribution that is payable in February of 2022 to be in the range of $2.76 to $2.83 per common unit. 
In summary, we remain as enthusiastic as ever about the long-term growth prospects for both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners. At NextEra Energy, we were honored to be named on Time Magazine's first-ever list of top 100 Most Influential Companies, which highlights businesses making an extraordinary impact around the world. We are proud to be leading the clean energy transformation in our sector and remain focused on executing upon the opportunities presented by the significant growth in wind, solar and various forms of energy storage in the U.S. over the coming decades. 
At FPL, including Gulf Power, that means continuing to deliver on our best-in-class customer value proposition of low bills, high reliability and clean energy solutions. At Energy Resources, our competitive advantages transition us well to capture a meaningful share of this significant and expanding market for renewables. And at NextEra Energy Partners with its continued access to low-cost capital and accretive acquisition opportunities is well positioned as ever to take advantage of the clean energy transformation reshaping the energy industry. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open up the line for questions."

Thanks, Shar. Appreciate the question. From our perspective, and we're looking out decades and looking at the enormous renewables build opportunity across the U.S., it is clear that over time, new transmission needs to be built to support some of that build-out. And it's not necessarily imperative today for that transmission to be built, but it certainly is important to start today to build the type of infrastructure that's needed over time. So we're really excited about the opportunities that the NextEra Energy Transmission team has. And I would expect over time that we will grow both organically and continue to look for acquisition opportunities like we have over the last couple of years to supplement and build out that portfolio. We're thrilled with the Trans Bay Cable acquisition that we closed a couple of years ago. Very excited to bring the GridLiance team on board, and we'll continue to focus on opportunities, both organically and through acquisition over time. 
From a broader policy standpoint, we thought it important for FERC and the regional ISOs to continue to focus on how do you support that transmission build-out. And we certainly are happy to see that to start to be a focus at FERC this year, in particular, and contemplating how do they support it going forward. And I think there's a receptive audience in the Biden administration, making sure that they support laying a foundation that's supportive of renewables not just in the next couple of years but in the next couple of decades. So transmission moves slowly, you know that, so stay tuned. But we're optimistic about our direct prospects in the near term as well as longer term."

And we're really pleased not only with what we've seen looking back and what the team has been able to execute on, but also looking forward. And that's what gave us the confidence just early this year to not only increase but expand the horizon for our development expectations such that our 4-year period starting '21 through '24 is 23 to 30 gigawatts which is just an exceptional number and one that we're really excited and proud of the team for taking on, and we're thrilled to be at 75% already at the low end today.

Near term, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, we feel very comfortable with where we are with our backlog and what we plan to build in the 2021 and 2022 time frame. And our comments reflected that in the prepared remarks. And it's a real credit to the way that we approach this business and our engineering and construction and integrated supply chain teams really working through a variety of different circumstances over the last 1.5 years. And we've secured the equipment that we need to build out those projects and, of course, have some contractual agreements in place that help us feel comfortable about that position. 
From a longer-term standpoint, I think it still remains to be seen in some respects. You can see that in a broad set of discussion across the financial and the broader U.S. economy dialogue of whether or not this is temporary, related to near-term snapbacks in demand and hurdles in the supply chain that may not persist over time or if it is systemic and persisting. So I think that remains a little bit to be seen. 
One thing that's very fortunate for renewables, as you all well know, is that renewable energy projects are very much the least cost form of generation in many parts, if not most of parts, of the U.S. So even if there is a change in pricing, if these cost increases are persistent and systemic over a long period of time, the value proposition is still very clear for renewables relative to alternatives. 
And then beyond that, we also need to think about what implications, if any, there will be from policy changes. So I think the net takeaway is somewhat premised in your question is that we feel comfortable with where we are, we're prepared for a variety of set of circumstances and we're thrilled with the position of renewables and the growth opportunities in, honestly, the decades ahead."

Obviously, Governor Abbott has asked for certain actions to be taken from the PUCT and ERCOT and there's a framework that the PUCT has started to lay out. But I think there's still time to work through what those details look like. From our perspective, you now well we've been very active in a variety of aspects in ERCOT. We know that market well and we certainly have a strong perspective on what needs to be addressed in particular to focus on what really went wrong in February, including a massive amount of disruption across the gas supply, not only from supply, but transmission and ultimately, consumption by end users. And we hope that a lot of the actions will be focused on that as opposed to things that  won't necessarily help and solve the fundamental problems in hand.

Those are all very interesting particularly for the latter part of the 2020s and into 2030 and beyond, which could help support the substantial build-out that we're expecting. 
In the short term, I think the biggest dynamic is what we see at hand, which is the economic value proposition of renewables. What we think could change that probably nearer term than even some of the innovations you're talking about is policy. You all, I know, are following just like we are and participating in a variety of discussions in Washington.

And if I could come back just for 1 second on Stephen Byrd's question on the EBITDA multiples. The EBITDA multiples on this drop-down were consistent with what we've done in the past. You got to remember, it always gets a little bit tricky with tax credits. You also have to remember that even after the sale of the NEP, we own a good portion of NEP. We get cash distributions.

We saw an announcement out of one of them yesterday or the day before about funding a solar and storage start-up. What's that doing in returns?

The middle of it is this market is absolutely growing significantly, and we expect it to continue to grow significantly for years to come. So from our perspective, the pie absolutely is getting bigger. Over a long period of time, our market share has remained very strong, in the 20-ish percent range for wind and probably in the mid-teens, occasionally a little bit higher and occasionally probably in the mid-teens on solar, and storage has actually been higher than both of those as this market has grown significantly over the last couple of years. 
When we look out, we focus on both maintaining market share and also maintaining attractive returns. And we think our competitive advantages have enabled us to do that over time. And we think both is important and be among them is very important. So John and his team are focused on getting the best of the projects that we see out in the marketplace and ultimately being very happy with the projects that we put into the portfolio. 
We get asked the question about new entrants a lot. You know this industry well. If you look back and you stack power purchase agreement awards over many years, you'll see that very big bar to the left when we put the chart together and a couple of bars that are smaller, of course, but still decent-sized and then a whole bunch of small players to get 100 -- a couple of hundred megawatts in a given year, and that dynamic continues to be consistent. That's for greenfield and kind of in the more development-oriented projects. There has been more capital coming in, but that's mostly post-COD. And when we think about capturing the value of developing renewables, it really is on that twinkle in the eye of a developer, the COD is the enormous opportunity to create value, and we continue to be very good at it and enhance those competitive advantages to maintain that position over time. So we're really excited about what we've been able to accomplish, really excited about our position and really excited about the energy transformation overall and the opportunities that presents."

270586,1684486254,2408023,"NextEra Energy, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 20, 2021",2021-10-20,"Earnings Calls","NextEra Energy, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Jessica, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy delivered strong third quarter results with adjusted earnings per share increasing by approximately 12% year-over-year.

NextEra Energy delivered strong third quarter results with adjusted earnings per share increasing by approximately 12% year-over-year. Both the principal businesses executed well on major initiatives, and we continue to advance our opportunity set for new renewables and storage. Building upon solid progress made in the first half of the year, NextEra Energy is well positioned to meet its overall objectives for 2021 and beyond. 
Earlier this month, we were honored to be named on Fortune's 2021 Change the World list. The only electric utility in the world to be recognized. This recognition is a testament to NextEra Energy's best-in-class position in the renewable energy sector and our continued commitment to the customers and communities that we serve. 
At FPL, net income increased approximately 10% versus the prior year comparable period, reflecting contributions from continued investment in the business. Most notably, during the quarter, we reached what we believe is a fair and constructive long-term settlement agreement with a number of intervenors in our rate case, continuing a long history of negotiated outcomes that benefit both customers and shareholders. 
We believe the agreement, if approved, should enable us to continue to focus on operating the business efficiently while investing in the future to ensure resilience, reliability, affordability and clean energy for generations to come in Florida. We expect the Florida Public Service Commission to vote on our agreement at its agenda conference on October 26. And I'll provide more details on the proposed agreement in a few minutes. 
FPL's major capital initiatives continue to progress well, including what will be the world's largest integrated solar power battery system, the 409-megawatt FPL Manatee Energy Storage Center that is now 75% complete and on track to begin serving customers later this year. Gulf Power also had a great quarter of execution, and its strong year-to-date financial performance is attributable to continued successful implementation of the cost reduction initiatives and smart capital investments that we previously outlined. 
Gulf Power's year-to-date net income contribution increased approximately 14% versus the prior year comparable period, and we remain focused on improving Gulf Power value proposition by providing lower costs, higher reliability, outstanding customer service and clean energy solutions for the benefit of our customers. 
At Energy Resources, adjusted earnings for the quarter increased by approximately 12% year-over-year. Our development team had another terrific quarter of new renewables and storage origination, adding approximately 2,160 megawatts to our backlog since the last earnings call, marking the best quarter of overall origination and the best quarter of new wind additions in Energy Resources history. These backlog additions include approximately 225 megawatts of combined solar and storage projects and a 500-megawatt wind project that is intended to power an adjacent new green hydrogen facility, which I'll provide some additional details on in just a few minutes. 
We continue to expect that our competitive advantages will drive meaningful growth in renewables and various forms of energy storage at Energy Resources in the coming years as the trend towards broad decarbonization across many facets of the U.S. economy takes hold. Overall, with 3 strong quarters complete in 2021, we are pleased with the progress we are making at NextEra Energy and we are well positioned to achieve the full year financial expectations that we have previously discussed, subject to our usual caveats. 
Now let's look at the detailed results, beginning with FPL. For the third quarter of 2021, FPL reported net income of $836 million or $0.42 per share, which is an increase of $79 million and $0.04 per share, respectively, year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 10.5% over the same quarter last year and was the principal driver of FPL's year-over-year net income growth of approximately 10%.
FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $1.5 billion in the third quarter, and we expect its full year capital investments to total between $6.6 billion and $6.8 billion. Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.6% for the 12 months ended September 2021. 
During the quarter, we restored $124 million of reserve amortization, leaving FPL with a balance of $597 million. As you know, much of the East Coast of the U.S. was recently impacted by Hurricane Ida, which made landfall on the Gulf Coast as a category 4 hurricane and also caused catastrophic flooding across the Northeastern U.S. Our deepest sympathies are with those that have been impacted by Ida's widespread destruction. 
We value deeply the industry's commitment to mutual assistance, and we were fortunate to be in a position to assist other utilities this year. As part of our assistance efforts, we sent more than 1,250 of our employees and contractors as well as transmission equipment and other supplies to help rebuild the grid to support the restoration efforts of the impacted utilities. 
Let me now turn to Gulf Power, which reported third quarter 2021 net income of $91 million or $0.05 per share. Gulf Power's third quarter EPS contribution was flat versus the prior year comparable quarter. As a reminder, the third quarter of 2020 benefited from the reversal of COVID-19-related expenses that had occurred earlier in that year. 
During the quarter, Gulf Power's regulatory capital employed grew by approximately 13% year-over-year. Gulf Power's capital expenditures were approximately $200 million during the third quarter, and we expect its full year capital investments to be roughly $800 million. For the full year 2021, we continue to expect Gulf Power's regulatory ROE to be in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.25% to 11.25%. 
All of our major capital initiatives at Gulf Power are progressing well. Gulf Power anticipates bringing approximately 150 megawatts of cost-effective zero-emission solar capacity online within the next 6 months. The North Florida Resiliency Connection, which, among other things, will allow customers to benefit from greater diversity and solar output across the 2 different time zones, is expected to be in service in mid-2022. 
These continued smart capital investments in renewables and core infrastructure are expected to drive customer benefits for many years to come. During the quarter, Gulf Power was impacted by Tropical Storm Fred, which experienced an unexpected change in path before striking the service territory. Through a restoration workforce of roughly 1,700 personnel, Gulf Power was able to restore service to essentially all of the approximately 20,000 customers impacted by Fred in Northwest Florida in less than 24 hours. Moreover, the average customer outage was restored in less than 2 hours. 
Our culture of preparation, including our annual storm drills and the team's focused execution helped ensure an efficient, timely and safe response to the tropical storm. The economy in Florida continues to grow at a healthy pace and remains among the strongest in the nation. Florida's labor force participation rate has recovered to its highest level in nearly 18 months, reflecting the ongoing recovery following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic last year. 
The real estate sector in Florida also continues to grow with a 3-month average new housing starts, up over 40% year-over-year. In August alone, there were twice as many new housing starts in Florida than in the average over the last 10 years. Florida building permits, a leading indicator of residential new service accounts are up 47% year-over-year and have outpaced the nation's quarterly growth by 32%. 
As another indicator of Florida's economic health, Florida's retail sales index is up nearly 60% versus the prior year. During the quarter, FPL's average number of customers increased by approximately 77,500 or 1.5% from the comparable year prior quarter, driven by continued solid underlying population growth. FPL's third quarter retail sales decreased 1.4% from the prior year comparable period. A decline in weather-related usage per customer of approximately 2.7% offset the benefits of customer growth. 
On a weather-normalized basis, third quarter sales increased 1.3%, with continued strong underlying usage contributing favorably. For Gulf Power, the average number of customers grew 1.6% versus the comparable prior year quarter. And Gulf Power's third quarter retail sales increased 0.6% year-over-year with strong usage from increased customer growth contributing favorably. 
As a reminder, on March 12, we initiated Florida Power & Light's 2021 base rate proceeding for rate relief beginning in January of 2022. After months of negotiation, we reached a proposed settlement agreement in early August with a number of intervenors in the proceeding. The Office of Public Counsel, the Florida Retail Federation, the Florida Industrial Power Users Group, the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, Boat Solar, the Clio Institute and the Federal Executive Agencies, all joined the agreement, reflecting a broad set of constituents across our customer base. 
The 4-year proposed agreement, which begins on January 2022, provides for retail base revenue adjustments as shown on the accompanying slide and allowed regulatory return on equity of 10.6% with a range of 9.7% to 11.7% and no change to FPL's equity ratio from investor sources for the combined system. Should the average 30-year U.S. treasury yields be 2.49% or greater over any consecutive 6-month period during this term of the agreement, Florida Power & Light's allowed regulatory ROE would increase to 10.8%. with a range of 9.8% to 11.8%. Additionally, if federal or state permanent corporate income tax changes become effective during the term of the proposed agreement, Florida Power & Light would be able to prospectively adjust base rates after a review of the impacts on base revenue requirements. 
The proposed agreement also includes flexibility over the 4-year term to amortize up to $1.45 billion of depreciation reserve surplus. Consistent with the rate plan filed in March, the proposed settlement agreement would unify the rates and tariffs of FPL and Gulf Power by implementing a 5-year transition rider and credit mechanism to address the initial differences in cost of serving the existing FPL and Gulf Power customers. 
Additionally, the proposed settlement agreement also provides 4 solar-based rate adjustments or SoBRA, upon reaching commercial operations of up to 894 megawatts annually of new solar generation in each of 2024 and 2025, subject to a cost cap of $1,250 per kilowatt and showing an overall cost effectiveness for FPL's customers. FPL would also be authorized to expand its solar together voluntary community solar program by constructing an additional 1,788 megawatts of solar generation through 2025, which would more than double the size of our current SolarTogether program and is expected to save our customers millions of dollars of the lifetime of the assets. 
In addition to solar energy, the settlement agreement would support FPL's green hydrogen pilot project in Okujobi County. This innovative technology could 1 day unlock 100% carbon-free electricity that's available 24 hours a day. The proposed settlement agreement also introduces several electric vehicle programs and pilots designed to accelerate the growth of electric vehicle adoption and charging infrastructure investment across Florida with a total capital investment of more than $200 million. 
Under the proposed agreement, FPL would continue to recover prudently incurred storm costs consistent with the framework in the current settlement agreement. Future storm restoration costs would be recoverable on an interim basis beginning 60 days from the filing of a cost recovery petition but capped at an amount that could produce a surcharge of no more than $4 for every 1,000 kilowatt hour of usage on residential bills in the first 12 months of cost recovery. Any additional costs would be eligible for recovery in subsequent years. 
If storm restoration costs were to exceed $800 million in any given calendar year, FPL could request an increase to the $4 surcharge. We believe the proposed settlement is fair, balanced and constructive and supports our continued ability to provide highly reliable, low-cost service for our customers through the end of the decade. FPL's typical resident bill is lower today than it was 15 years ago and is well below the national average. The proposed agreement would keep typical residential bills well below the national average and among the lowest in Florida through 2025. 
Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported third quarter 2021 GAAP losses of $428 million or $0.22 per share. Adjusted earnings for the third quarter were $619 million or $0.31 per share, which is an increase of $68 million and $0.03 per share, respectively, year-over-year. The effect of mark-to-market on nonqualifying hedges, which is excluded from adjusted earnings, was the primary driver of the difference between Energy Resources third quarter GAAP and adjusted earnings results. 
Contributions from new investments added $0.03 per share relative to the prior year comparable quarter, primarily reflecting continued growth in our contracted renewables and battery storage program. The contribution from existing generation assets increased $0.01 per share year-over-year. Our customer supply and trading business contribution was $0.02 higher year-over-year due to favorable market conditions in our retail supply and power marketing businesses. All other impacts decreased results by $0.03 per share versus 2020, driven primarily by miscellaneous tax items. 
As I mentioned earlier, Energy Resources development team had a record quarter of origination success, adding approximately 2,160 megawatts to our backlog. Since our last earnings call, we have added approximately 1,240 megawatts of new wind projects, 515 megawatts of new solar projects and 345 megawatts of new storage assets to our renewables and storage backlog. In addition, our backlog increased by Energy Resources' share of NextEnergy Partners planned acquisition of an approximately 100-megawatt operating wind project that the partnership is announcing today. 
Through the 3 -- first 3 quarters of 2021, we have added more than 5,700 megawatts to our renewables and storage backlog. Energy Resources backlog of signed contracts now stands at approximately 18,100 megawatts. At this early stage, we have made terrific progress towards our long-term development expectations with more than 7,600 megawatts of projects already in our post 2022 backlog. 
Our backlog additions for the third quarter include a 500-megawatt wind project. The majority of which is contracted with a hydrogen fuel cell company. The project's customer intends to construct a nearby hydrogen electrolyzer facility that will use the wind energy production to supply up to 100% of the facilities load requirements. The hydrogen manufactured by the facility would enable commercial and industrial end users to replace their current gray hydrogen and fossil fuel purchases with emissions-free green hydrogen, further accelerating the decarbonization of the industrial and transportation sectors. 
Energy Resources also add nearly 300 megawatts of battery storage projects in California, and we continue to experience significant demand from California-based utilities and commercial and industrial customers for reliable energy storage solutions. We are currently developing nearly 2,400 megawatts of additional co-located and stand-alone battery storage projects in California with the potential to be deployed in 2023 and 2024 and to enhance reliability and help meet the state's energy storage capacity requirements and ambitious clean energy goals. 
More than 30 years, we have been investing in clean energy in California and are proud to help the state lead the country to a carbon-free sustainable future. Consistent with our focus on growing our rate-regulated and long-term contracted business operations, during the third quarter, Energy Resources entered into an agreement to acquire a portfolio of rate regulated water and wastewater utility assets in 8 counties near Houston, Texas. 
The proposed acquisition expands our regulated utility business in an attractive market with significant expected customer growth and furthers our strategy to build a world class water utility in the coming years. Subject to regulatory approvals, the acquisition is expected to close in 2022. Energy Resources is also currently in construction on an innovative water reuse and reclamation project that would help our customer achieve significant savings on its water supply needs and make its operations more efficient and sustainable while at the same time, delivering attractive returns to Energy Resources. 
While the roughly $45 million total equity investment for these transactions is small in context of our overall capital program, we are optimistic about the strong growth anticipated in this new market and the potential for clean water solutions to generate additional contracted renewables opportunities going forward. 
Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the third quarter of 2021, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $447 million or $0.23 per share. NextEra Energy's 2021 third quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $1.48 billion and $0.75 per share, respectively. Adjusted results from Corporate and Other segment increased by $0.01 year-over-year. 
Our long-term financial expectations through 2023 remain unchanged. For 2021, NextEra Energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.40 to $2.54 and we would be disappointed not to be at or near the high end of this range. While we are pleased with our year-to-date results, which have exceeded the top end of our growth rate expectations so far for the year, we expect the fourth quarter results to include impacts from certain liability management activities that we are currently reviewing to take advantage of the low interest rate environment. These initiatives could generate negative adjusted EPS impacts of as much as $0.08 to $0.10 in the fourth quarter before translating to favorable net income contributions in future years and an overall improvement in net present value for our shareholders. 
Looking further ahead, for 2022 and 2023, NextEra Energy expects to grow 6% to 8% off of the expected 2021 adjusted earnings per share. And we would be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of these ranges in 2022 and 2023. Our earnings expectations are supported by what we believe is the most attractive organic investment opportunity set in our industry. From 2018 to 2023, we continue to expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% rate per year through at least 2022 off of a 2020 base. As always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions. 
Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which performed well and delivered third quarter results generally in line with our expectations. Yesterday, the NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.685 per common unit or $2.74 per common unit on an annualized basis, continuing our track record of growing distributions at the top end of our 12% to 15% per year growth range. Inclusive of this increase, NextEnergy Partners has now grown its distribution per unit by more than 265% since the IPO. 
NextEnergy Partners continues to execute against its growth initiatives during the quarter. Since the last earnings call, NextEnergy Partners closed on its previously announced acquisitions of approximately 400 megawatts of operating wind projects from a third party and approximately 590 net megawatts of geographically diverse wind and solar projects from Energy Resources. In addition, today, we are announcing an agreement to acquire an approximately 100-megawatt operating wind asset in California from a third party to further expand NextEra Energy Partners portfolio and enhance its long-term growth visibility. The project is located in a strategic market with strong expected growth in renewables demand, and it also offers significant optionality to NextEra Energy Partners in terms of operational savings and long-term value creation. 
NextEra Energy Partners intends to purchase the asset for a total consideration of approximately $280 million, subject to closing adjustments, which includes the assumption of approximately $150 million in existing project finance debt estimated at the time of closing. NextEnergy Partners expects to recapitalize this project finance debt in 2022 as it executes on its overall financing plan for the year. We expect to fund the approximately $130 million balance of the purchase price using existing debt capacity. Subject to regulatory approvals, the acquisition is expected to close later this year or in 2022. 
Following the project debt paydown next year, the asset is expected to contribute adjusted EBITDA and unlevered cash available for distribution of approximately $22 million to $27 million. Each on a 5-year average run rate -- annual run rate basis beginning December 31, 2022. NextEra Energy Partners continues to leverage its competitive advantages be successful in third-party M&A and extend its long runway of growth. 
Consistent with our long-term growth prospects, today, we are also introducing year-end 2022 run rate expectations which are built upon its strong existing portfolio cash generation and continued ability to access low-cost capital to acquire accretive renewable energy projects. Overall, we are pleased with the year-to-date execution at NextEra Energy Partners and we believe we are well positioned to continue delivering LP unitholder value going forward. 
Now let's look at the detailed results. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $334 million, up approximately 7% from the prior year comparable quarter due to growth in the underlying portfolio. New projects, which primarily reflect the asset acquisitions that closed at the end of 2020 and the recently closed acquisition of 391 megawatts of operating wind assets from a third party contributed $23 million. Existing assets contributed $7 million, primarily driven by the wind repowerings that occurred in the fourth quarter of last year and an improvement in wind resource. 
Wind resource for the third quarter was 101% of the long-term average, versus 96% in the third quarter of 2020. These favorable impacts were partially offset by lower solar resource in the third quarter of this year. Cash available for distribution of $158 million for the third quarter declined by $4 million versus the prior year, primarily as a result of lower year-over-year PAYGO payments after a weaker wind resource period in the second quarter of this year. As a reminder, NextEnergy Partners recapitalized its Genesis Solar project and other existing assets at the end of last year and the impact of this new project level financing cost versus the prior year was offset by an associated reduction in corporate level interest expense as reflected in our other category. Additional details of our third quarter results are shown on the accompanying slide. 
On a year-to-date basis versus 2020, adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution have increased by roughly 9% and 6%, respectively. And NextEra Energy Partners remains well positioned to continue to deliver on its outstanding growth objectives. We continue to expect NextEra Energy Partners portfolio to support an annualized rate of fourth quarter 2021 distribution that is payable in February of 2022 to be in a range of $2.76 to $2.83 per common unit. From a base of our fourth quarter 2020 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.46 and we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024. 
NextEra Energy Partners continues to expect to be in the upper end of our previously disclosed year-end 2021 run rate adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution expectation ranges of $1.44 billion to $1.62 billion and $600 million to $680 million, respectively. We expect to achieve our 2022 distribution growth of 12% to 15% while maintaining a trailing 12-month payout ratio in the low 80% range. By year-end 2022, we expect the run rate for adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.775 billion to $1.975 billion and run rate for cash available for distribution to be in the range of $675 million to $765 million. 
At the midpoint, these revised expectations ranges reflect estimated growth in adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution of roughly 23% and 13%, respectively, from the comparable year-end 2021 run rate expectations. These growth rates are supported by our strong execution against our long-term growth objectives in 2021, including opportunistic third-party transactions that were not previously in our plan. As a reminder, all of our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated IDR fees as we treat these as an operating expense. 
Finally, during the quarter, S&P updated its ratings methodology for NextEra Energy Partners. And in particular, it will now evaluate NextEnergy Partners debt metrics on a funds from operations or FFO to debt basis with a downgrade threshold of 14% instead of a debt-to-EBITDA basis. We believe that the combination of S&P's updated methodology, its assessment of NextEnergy Partners improving diversity and its use of less conservative assumptions in the portfolios and renewable generation cash flows will allow for $700 million more of financing flexibility relative to our previous assumptions, providing the partnership with even greater flexibility going forward to finance accretive acquisition for the benefit of our unitholders. 
In summary, we continue to believe that both NextEra Energy and NextEra Partners have some of the best opportunity sets and execution track records in the industry and we remain as enthusiastic as ever about our future prospects. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open up the line for questions."

And then subsequently, on the origination side, obviously, well down again. How do you think about just the elevated energy price backdrop that we're seeing today? How quickly is that commencing sort of a reinvigorated demand backdrop? And when could that materialize as you think about the backdrop in the '23, '24 backdrop or beyond?"

I appreciate the questions. And as you even prefaced in your set of questions, we're pretty excited about the opportunities for both of the major businesses, both Florida Power & Light and Energy Resources and specifically on the renewable side and Energy Resources. The team just had an awesome origination quarter, and that's kind of on the heels of other awesome origination quarters going back now for quite some time, setting us up for tremendous growth in the coming years. So in terms of demand backdrop to kind of answer the second question first, it's terrific. And we're really excited about the value proposition of renewables looking forward, both in terms of being low cost and the ability to decarbonize both the electricity sector and other sectors as we've talked about. 
It's been an exciting 18 months for our integrated supply chain and engineering construction teams. Lots of opportunities to navigate uncertainties, likes of which we and the industry probably haven't seen in quite some time. And it's also in the midst of enormous growth for us, a record year of renewables deployment last year and another terrific capital deployment year this year. So both growth and opportunities to show what we can do. It's good to be us. And we've highlighted that in the past in the sense of being large in this industry, having significant capital dollars to put to work enables us to have strong relationships and extensive relationships with those in the supply chain to help navigate these uncertainties. We feel good about our ability to navigate them. The plan does get iterated from time to time as the circumstances change but we feel good about the long-term view for renewables and our ability to deliver on our expectations."

So it obviously would benefit that if you mark-to-market that forward position, clearly, there's been some upside with the increase in natural gas prices and some of the congestion you've seen in the Northeast in terms of electricity prices. Whether that lasts in the long term, I think, remains to be seen, but certainly an opportunity for Seabrook. We continue to believe Seabrook is very well placed. It is in a particularly advantageous load zone. It's obviously in a region that values clean energy deeply. And you think about broad decarbonization in any part of the U.S., including the Northeast. Well-positioned nuclear assets will be a key part of making that happen.

I think in the electricity sector, when it's going to be particularly relevant is the latter part of the 2020s into 2030 and beyond. And for the key reason for that being that you really need to have the need for long-duration storage, and it is particularly attractive when you have very, very low cost energy input and particularly low-cost renewables, which will inevitably have when you have substantial renewable deployment, again, probably in the latter part of the 2020s and beyond. What may be different is in the transportation and industrial sector, where there's already built-in use of gray hydrogen and other fossil fuels that could be supplanted with green hydrogen when it's competitive. The big question mark would be whether or not there's a hydrogen production tax credit ultimately in the final reconciliation bill. Clearly, there's one anticipated today and at $3 a kilogram production tax credit, that really closes the gap between gray hydrogen and green hydrogen alternatives. And so that's a terrific opportunity to see growth in the near term. And what that would represent is using green hydrogen alternatives to supplant gray hydrogen. From our perspective, that's opportunities clearly to build a lot of renewables. And you saw the first step in that direction in our announcement today about a power purchase agreement that we've entered into, but there would be a lot more like that in not just the renewable side but also an opportunity for us to invest in the actual hydrogen production equipment such as the electrolyzer. So we'll see. We'll know a lot more in January once we've seen the final package if there is one, as Jim highlighted. And it will develop over time in terms of opportunities.

NextEra Energy delivered strong third quarter results, with adjusted earnings per share increasing by approximately 12% year-over-year. Both the principal businesses executed well on major initiatives, and we continue to advance our opportunity set for new renewables and storage. Building upon solid progress made in the first half of the year, NextEra Energy is well positioned to meet its overall objectives for 2021 and beyond.
Earlier this month, we were honored to be named on Fortune's 2021 Change the World list, the only electric utility in the world to be recognized. This recognition is a testament to NextEra Energy's best-in-class position in the renewable energy sector and our continued commitment to the customers and communities that we serve.
At FPL, net income increased approximately 10% versus the prior year comparable period, reflecting contributions from continued investment in the business. Most notably, during the quarter, we reached what we believe is a fair and constructive long-term settlement agreement with a number of intervenors in our rate case, continuing a long history of negotiated outcomes that benefit both customers and shareholders.
We believe the agreement, if approved, should enable us to continue to focus on operating the business efficiently while investing in the future to ensure resilience, reliability, affordability and clean energy for generations to come in Florida. We expect the Florida Public Service Commission to vote on our agreement at its agenda conference on October 26. And I'll provide more details on the proposed agreement in a few minutes.
FPL's major capital initiatives continue to progress well, including what will be the world's largest integrated solar power battery system, the 409-megawatt FPL Manatee Energy Storage Center that is now 75% complete and on track to begin serving customers later this year.
Gulf Power also had a great quarter of execution, and its strong year-to-date financial performance is attributable to continued successful implementation of the cost reduction initiatives and smart capital investments that we previously outlined. Gulf Power's year-to-date net income contribution increased approximately 14% versus the prior year comparable period, and we remain focused on improving Gulf Power value proposition by providing lower costs, higher reliability, outstanding customer service and clean energy solutions for the benefit of our customers.
At Energy Resources, adjusted earnings for the quarter increased by approximately 12% year-over-year. Our development team had another terrific quarter of new renewables and storage origination, adding approximately 2,160 megawatts to our backlog since the last earnings call, marking the best quarter of overall origination and the best quarter of new wind additions in Energy Resources history. These backlog additions include approximately 225 megawatts of combined solar and storage projects and a 500-megawatt wind project that is intended to power an adjacent new green hydrogen facility, which I'll provide some additional details on in just a few minutes.
We continue to expect that our competitive advantages will drive meaningful growth in renewables and various forms of energy storage at Energy Resources in the coming years as the trend towards broad decarbonization across many facets of the U.S. economy takes hold. Overall, with 3 strong quarters complete in 2021, we are pleased with the progress we are making at NextEra Energy, and we are well positioned to achieve the full year financial expectations that we have previously discussed, subject to our usual caveats.
Now let's look at the detailed results, beginning with FPL. For the third quarter of 2021, FPL reported net income of $836 million or $0.42 per share, which is an increase of $79 million and $0.04 per share, respectively, year-over-year. Regulatory capital employed increased by approximately 10.5% over the same quarter last year and was the principal driver of FPL's year-over-year net income growth of approximately 10%.
FPL's capital expenditures were approximately $1.5 billion in the third quarter, and we expect its full year capital investments to total between $6.6 billion and $6.8 billion. Our reported ROE for regulatory purposes will be approximately 11.6% for the 12 months ended September 2021. During the quarter, we restored $124 million of reserve amortization, leaving FPL with a balance of $597 million.
As you know, much of the East Coast of the U.S. was recently impacted by Hurricane Ida, which made landfall on the Gulf Coast as a Category 4 hurricane and also caused catastrophic flooding across the Northeastern U.S. Our deepest sympathies are with those that have been impacted by Ida's widespread destruction.
We value deeply the industry's commitment to mutual assistance, and we were fortunate to be in a position to assist other utilities this year. As part of our assistance efforts, we sent more than 1,250 of our employees and contractors as well as transmission equipment and other supplies to help rebuild the grid to support the restoration efforts of the impacted utilities.
Let me now turn to Gulf Power, which reported third quarter 2021 net income of $91 million or $0.05 per share. Gulf Power's third quarter EPS contribution was flat versus the prior year comparable quarter. As a reminder, the third quarter of 2020 benefited from the reversal of COVID-19-related expenses that had occurred earlier in that year.
During the quarter, Gulf Power's regulatory capital employed grew by approximately 13% year-over-year. Gulf Power's capital expenditures were approximately $200 million during the third quarter, and we expect its full year capital investments to be roughly $800 million. For the full year 2021, we continue to expect Gulf Power's regulatory ROE to be in the upper half of the allowed band of 9.25% to 11.25%.
All of our major capital initiatives at Gulf Power are progressing well. Gulf Power anticipates bringing approximately 150 megawatts of cost-effective zero-emission solar capacity online within the next 6 months. The North Florida Resiliency Connection, which, among other things, will allow customers to benefit from greater diversity and solar output across the 2 different time zones, is expected to be in service in mid-2022. These continued smart capital investments in renewables and core infrastructure are expected to drive customer benefits for many years to come.
During the quarter, Gulf Power was impacted by Tropical Storm Fred, which experienced an unexpected change in path before striking the service territory. Through a restoration workforce of roughly 1,700 personnel, Gulf Power was able to restore service to essentially all of the approximately 20,000 customers impacted by Fred in Northwest Florida in less than 24 hours. Moreover, the average customer outage was restored in less than 2 hours. Our culture of preparation, including our annual storm drills, and the team's focused execution helped ensure an efficient, timely and safe response to the tropical storm.
The economy in Florida continues to grow at a healthy pace and remains among the strongest in the nation. Florida's labor force participation rate has recovered to its highest level in nearly 18 months, reflecting the ongoing recovery following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic last year.
The real estate sector in Florida also continues to grow, with the 3-month average new housing starts up over 40% year-over-year. In August alone, there were twice as many new housing starts in Florida than in the average over the last 10 years. Florida building permits, a leading indicator of residential new service accounts, are up 47% year-over-year and have outpaced the nation's quarterly growth by 32%. As another indicator of Florida's economic health, Florida's retail sales index is up nearly 60% versus the prior year.
During the quarter, FPL's average number of customers increased by approximately 77,500 or 1.5% from the comparable year prior quarter, driven by continued solid underlying population growth. FPL's third quarter retail sales decreased 1.4% from the prior year comparable period. A decline in weather-related usage per customer of approximately 2.7% offset the benefits of customer growth. On a weather-normalized basis, third quarter sales increased 1.3%, with continued strong underlying usage contributing favorably.
For Gulf Power, the average number of customers grew 1.6% versus the comparable prior year quarter. And Gulf Power's third quarter retail sales increased 0.6% year-over-year, with strong usage from increased customer growth contributing favorably.
As a reminder, on March 12, we initiated Florida Power & Light's 2021 base rate proceeding for rate relief beginning in January of 2022. After months of negotiation, we reached a proposed settlement agreement in early August with a number of intervenors in the proceeding. The Office of Public Counsel, the Florida Retail Federation, the Florida Industrial Power Users Group, the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, Vote Solar, the CLEO Institute and the Federal Executive Agencies all joined the agreement, reflecting a broad set of constituents across our customer base.
The 4-year proposed agreement, which begins on January 2022, provides for retail base revenue adjustments, as shown on the accompanying slide, and allowed regulatory return on equity of 10.6% with a range of 9.7% to 11.7% and no change to FPL's equity ratio from investor sources for the combined system. Should the average 30-year U.S. treasury yields be 2.49% or greater over any consecutive 6-month period during this term of the agreement, Florida Power & Light's allowed regulatory ROE would increase to 10.8% with a range of 9.8% to 11.8%. Additionally, if federal or state permanent corporate income tax changes become effective during the term of the proposed agreement, Florida Power & Light would be able to prospectively adjust base rates after a review of the impacts on base revenue requirements.
The proposed agreement also includes flexibility over the 4-year term to amortize up to $1.45 billion of depreciation reserve surplus. Consistent with the rate plan filed in March, the proposed settlement agreement would unify the rates and tariffs of FPL and Gulf Power by implementing a 5-year transition rider and credit mechanism to address the initial differences in cost of serving the existing FPL and Gulf Power customers.
Additionally, the proposed settlement agreement also provides for Solar Base Rate Adjustments, or SoBRA, upon reaching commercial operations of up to 894 megawatts annually of new solar generation in each of 2024 and 2025, subject to a cost cap of $1,250 per kilowatt and showing an overall cost effectiveness for FPL's customers. FPL would also be authorized to expand its SolarTogether voluntary community solar program by constructing an additional 1,788 megawatts of solar generation through 2025, which would more than double the size of our current SolarTogether program and is expected to save our customers millions of dollars over the lifetime of the asset.
In addition to solar energy, the settlement agreement would support FPL's green hydrogen pilot project in Okeechobee County. This innovative technology could one day unlock 100% carbon-free electricity that's available 24 hours a day. The proposed settlement agreement also introduces several electric vehicle programs and pilots designed to accelerate the growth of electric vehicle adoption and charging infrastructure investment across Florida with a total capital investment of more than $200 million.
Under the proposed agreement, FPL would continue to recover prudently incurred storm costs, consistent with the framework in the current settlement agreement. Future storm restoration costs would be recoverable on an interim basis beginning 60 days from the filing of a cost recovery petition but capped at an amount that could produce a surcharge of no more than $4 for every 1,000 kilowatt hour of usage on residential bills in the first 12 months of cost recovery. Any additional costs would be eligible for recovery in subsequent years. If storm restoration costs were to exceed $800 million in any given calendar year, FPL could request an increase to the $4 surcharge.
We believe the proposed settlement is fair, balanced and constructive and supports our continued ability to provide highly reliable, low-cost service for our customers through the end of the decade. FPL's typical resident bill is lower today than it was 15 years ago and is well below the national average. The proposed agreement would keep typical residential bills well below the national average and among the lowest in Florida through 2025.
Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported third quarter 2021 GAAP losses of $428 million or $0.22 per share. Adjusted earnings for the third quarter were $619 million or $0.31 per share, which is an increase of $68 million and $0.03 per share, respectively, year-over-year. The effect of mark-to-market on nonqualifying hedges, which is excluded from adjusted earnings, was the primary driver of the difference between Energy Resources third quarter GAAP and adjusted earnings results.
Contributions from new investments added $0.03 per share relative to the prior year comparable quarter primarily reflecting continued growth in our contracted renewables and battery storage program. The contribution from existing generation assets increased $0.01 per share year-over-year.
Our customer supply and trading business contribution was $0.02 higher year-over-year due to favorable market conditions in our retail supply and power marketing businesses. All other impacts decreased results by $0.03 per share versus 2020 driven primarily by miscellaneous tax items.
As I mentioned earlier, Energy Resources development team had a record quarter of origination success, adding approximately 2,160 megawatts to our backlog. Since our last earnings call, we have added approximately 1,240 megawatts of new wind projects, 515 megawatts of new solar projects and 345 megawatts of new storage assets to our renewables and storage backlog. In addition, our backlog increased by Energy Resources' share of NextEra Energy Partners' planned acquisition of an approximately 100-megawatt operating wind project that the partnership is announcing today.
Through the 3 -- first 3 quarters of 2021, we have added more than 5,700 megawatts to our renewables and storage backlog. Energy Resources backlog of signed contracts now stands at approximately 18,100 megawatts. At this early stage, we have made terrific progress towards our long-term development expectations, with more than 7,600 megawatts of projects already in our post-2022 backlog.
Our backlog additions for the third quarter include a 500-megawatt wind project, the majority of which is contracted with a hydrogen fuel cell company. The project's customer intends to construct a nearby hydrogen electrolyzer facility that will use the wind energy production to supply up to 100% of the facility's load requirements. The hydrogen manufactured by the facility would enable commercial and industrial end users to replace their current gray hydrogen and fossil fuel purchases with emissions-free green hydrogen, further accelerating the decarbonization of the industrial and transportation sectors.
Energy Resources also added nearly 300 megawatts of battery storage projects in California, and we continued to experience significant demand from California-based utilities and commercial and industrial customers for reliable energy storage solutions. We are currently developing nearly 2,400 megawatts of additional co-located and stand-alone battery storage projects in California with the potential to be deployed in 2023 and 2024 to enhance reliability and help meet the state's energy storage capacity requirements and ambitious clean energy goals. More than 30 years, we have been investing in clean energy in California and are proud to help the state lead the country to a carbon-free, sustainable future.
Consistent with our focus on growing our rate-regulated and long-term contracted business operations, during the third quarter, Energy Resources entered into an agreement to acquire a portfolio of rate regulated water and wastewater utility assets in 8 counties near Houston, Texas. The proposed acquisition expands our regulated utility business in an attractive market with significant expected customer growth and furthers our strategy to build a world-class water utility in the coming years. Subject to regulatory approvals, the acquisition is expected to close in 2022.
Energy Resources is also currently in construction on an innovative water reuse and reclamation project that would help our customer achieve significant savings on its water supply needs and make its operations more efficient and sustainable while at the same time, delivering attractive returns to Energy Resources.
While the roughly $45 million total equity investment for these transactions is small in context of our overall capital program, we are optimistic about the strong growth anticipated in this new market and the potential for clean water solutions to generate additional contracted renewables opportunities going forward.
Turning now to the consolidated results for NextEra Energy. For the third quarter of 2021, GAAP net income attributable to NextEra Energy was $447 million or $0.23 per share. NextEra Energy's 2021 third quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS were $1.48 billion and $0.75 per share, respectively. Adjusted results from Corporate and Other segment increased by $0.01 year-over-year.
Our long-term financial expectations through 2023 remain unchanged. For 2021, NextEra Energy expects adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $2.40 to $2.54, and we would be disappointed not to be at or near the high end of this range. While we are pleased with our year-to-date results, which have exceeded the top end of our growth rate expectations so far for the year, we expect the fourth quarter results to include impacts from certain liability management activities that we are currently reviewing to take advantage of the low interest rate environment. These initiatives could generate negative adjusted EPS impacts of as much as $0.08 to $0.10 in the fourth quarter before translating to favorable net income contributions in future years and an overall improvement in net present value for our shareholders.
Looking further ahead, for 2022 and 2023, NextEra Energy expects to grow 6% to 8% off of the expected 2021 adjusted earnings per share. And we would be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of these ranges in 2022 and 2023. Our earnings expectations are supported by what we believe is the most attractive organic investment opportunity set in our industry.
From 2018 to 2023, we continue to expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate range. We also continue to expect to grow our dividends per share at roughly 10% rate per year through at least 2022 off of a 2020 base. As always, our expectations assume normal weather and operating conditions.
Let me now turn to NextEra Energy Partners, which performed well and delivered third quarter results generally in line with our expectations. Yesterday, the NextEra Energy Partners Board declared a quarterly distribution of $0.685 per common unit or $2.74 per common unit on an annualized basis, continuing our track record of growing distributions at the top end of our 12% to 15% per year growth range. Inclusive of this increase, NextEra Energy Partners has now grown its distribution per unit by more than 265% since the IPO.
NextEra Energy Partners continues to execute against its growth initiatives during the quarter. Since the last earnings call, NextEra Energy Partners closed on its previously announced acquisitions of approximately 400 megawatts of operating wind projects from a third party and approximately 590 net megawatts of geographically diverse wind and solar projects from Energy Resources. In addition, today, we are announcing an agreement to acquire an approximately 100-megawatt operating wind asset in California from a third party to further expand NextEra Energy Partners portfolio and enhance its long-term growth visibility. The project is located in a strategic market with strong expected growth in renewables demand, and it also offers significant optionality to NextEra Energy Partners in terms of operational savings and long-term value creation.
NextEra Energy Partners intends to purchase the asset for a total consideration of approximately $280 million, subject to closing adjustments, which includes the assumption of approximately $150 million in existing project finance debt estimated at the time of closing. NextEra Energy Partners expects to recapitalize this project finance debt in 2022 as it executes on its overall financing plan for the year. We expect to fund the approximately $130 million balance of the purchase price using existing debt capacity. Subject to regulatory approvals, the acquisition is expected to close later this year or in 2022.
Following the project debt paydown next year, the asset is expected to contribute adjusted EBITDA and unlevered cash available for distribution of approximately $22 million to $27 million, each on a 5-year average run rate -- annual run rate basis beginning December 31, 2022. NextEra Energy Partners continues to leverage its competitive advantages to be successful in third-party M&A and extend its long runway of growth.
Consistent with our long-term growth prospects, today, we are also introducing year-end 2022 run rate expectations, which are built upon its strong existing portfolio cash generation and continued ability to access low-cost capital to acquire accretive renewable energy projects. Overall, we are pleased with the year-to-date execution at NextEra Energy Partners, and we believe we are well positioned to continue delivering LP unitholder value going forward.
Now let's look at the detailed results. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $334 million, up approximately 7% from the prior year comparable quarter due to growth in the underlying portfolio. New projects, which primarily reflect the asset acquisitions that closed at the end of 2020 and the recently closed acquisition of 391 megawatts of operating wind assets from a third party, contributed $23 million. Existing assets contributed $7 million primarily driven by the wind repowerings that occurred in the fourth quarter of last year and an improvement in wind resource.
Wind resource for the third quarter was 101% of the long-term average versus 96% in the third quarter of 2020. These favorable impacts were partially offset by lower solar resource in the third quarter of this year. Cash available for distribution of $158 million for the third quarter declined by $4 million versus the prior year primarily as a result of lower year-over-year PAYGO payments after a weaker wind resource period in the second quarter of this year. As a reminder, NextEra Energy Partners recapitalized its Genesis Solar Project and other existing assets at the end of last year, and the impact of this new project level financing cost versus the prior year was offset by an associated reduction in corporate level interest expense as reflected in our other category. Additional details of our third quarter results are shown on the accompanying slide.
On a year-to-date basis versus 2020, adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution have increased by roughly 9% and 6%, respectively. And NextEra Energy Partners remains well positioned to continue to deliver on its outstanding growth objectives.
We continue to expect NextEra Energy Partners portfolio to support an annualized rate of fourth quarter 2021 distribution that is payable in February of 2022 to be in a range of $2.76 to $2.83 per common unit. From a base of our fourth quarter 2020 distribution per common unit at an annualized rate of $2.46, we continue to see 12% to 15% growth per year in LP distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least 2024.
NextEra Energy Partners continues to expect to be in the upper end of our previously disclosed year-end 2021 run rate adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution expectation ranges of $1.44 billion to $1.62 billion and $600 million to $680 million, respectively. We expect to achieve our 2022 distribution growth of 12% to 15% while maintaining a trailing 12-month payout ratio in the low 80% range. By year-end 2022, we expect the run rate for adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $1.775 billion to $1.975 billion and run rate for cash available for distribution to be in the range of $675 million to $765 million.
At the midpoint, these revised expectations ranges reflect estimated growth in adjusted EBITDA and cash available for distribution of roughly 23% and 13%, respectively, from the comparable year-end 2021 run rate expectations. These growth rates are supported by our strong execution against our long-term growth objectives in 2021, including opportunistic third-party transactions that were not previously in our plan. As a reminder, all of our expectations are subject to our normal caveats and include the impact of anticipated IDR fees as we treat these as an operating expense.
Finally, during the quarter, S&P updated its ratings methodology for NextEra Energy Partners. And in particular, it will now evaluate NextEra Energy Partners debt metrics on a funds from operations, or FFO, to debt basis with a downgrade threshold of 14% instead of a debt-to-EBITDA basis. We believe that the combination of S&P's updated methodology, its assessment of NextEra Energy Partners' improving diversity and its use of less conservative assumptions in the portfolios and renewable generation cash flows will allow for [ $700 million ] more of financing flexibility relative to our previous assumptions, providing the partnership with even greater flexibility going forward to finance accretive acquisition for the benefit of our unitholders.
In summary, we continue to believe that both NextEra Energy and NextEra Energy Partners have some of the best opportunity sets and execution track records in the industry, and we remain as enthusiastic as ever about our future prospects. That concludes our prepared remarks. And with that, we will open up the line for questions."

So in terms of demand backdrop, to kind of answer the second question first, it's terrific. And we're really excited about the value proposition of renewables looking forward, both in terms of being low cost and the ability to decarbonize both the electricity sector and other sectors as we've talked about.
It's been an exciting 18 months for our integrated supply chain and engineering construction teams. Lots of opportunities to navigate uncertainties, likes of which we and the industry probably haven't seen in quite some time. And it's also in the midst of enormous growth for us, a record year of renewables deployment last year and another terrific capital deployment year this year. So both growth and opportunities to show what we can do.
It's good to be us. And we've highlighted that in the past in the sense of being large in this industry. Having significant capital dollars to put to work enables us to have strong relationships and extensive relationships with those in the supply chain to help navigate these uncertainties. We feel good about our ability to navigate them. The plan does get iterated from time to time as the circumstances change, but we feel good about the long-term view for renewables and our ability to deliver on our expectations."

And that's not an easy -- as we've seen play out over the last several weeks, that's not an easy -- that's not easy. And there's obviously within that caucus a lot of varying views across the board.
But I think -- so I remain cautiously optimistic that something happens there. And then if something happens there, we feel good about the fact that there'll be a long-term extension of the credits and that there will be support for other types of clean energy such as hydrogen, a stand-alone storage, ITC, et cetera. So yes, it would be very constructive for us. We think it's important part of the decarbonization of the U.S. economy to accelerate that. And I mean we've increasingly -- as we think about our own strategy going forward, we're increasingly thinking about ourselves as the company that's going to lead not only the clean energy transformation of the electric grid, but really the clean energy transformation of the U.S. economy and the decarbonization of the U.S. economy because the electric grid is going to be the key to decarbonizing the transport sector. It's going to be the key to decarbonizing the industrial sector. And so we're really positioning ourselves to be the leader there, and I feel very good about both the policy tailwinds that we have as well as how our business is executing along those goals."

One of the great ways that FPL, and that includes Gulf as part of it, will be to continue to deploy solar over the long term. Because as you all well know, not only does it have the clean energy benefits, but it has low operating costs and no fuel costs, which will be a great offset in diversification in the state of Florida from our existing generation set.

So it obviously would benefit that if you mark-to-market that forward position, clearly, there's been some upside with the increase in natural gas prices and some of the congestion you've seen in the Northeast in terms of electricity prices. Whether that lasts in the long term, I think, remains to be seen, but certainly an opportunity for Seabrook.
We continue to believe Seabrook is very well placed. It is in a particularly advantageous load zone. It's obviously in a region that values clean energy deeply. And you think about broad decarbonization in any part of the U.S., including the Northeast, well-positioned nuclear assets will be a key part of making that happen.

I think in the electricity sector, when it's going to be particularly relevant is the latter part of the 2020s, into 2030s and beyond, and for the key reason of -- for that being that you really need to have the need for long-duration storage. And it is particularly attractive when you have very, very low cost energy input and particularly low-cost renewables, which we'll inevitably have when you have substantial renewable deployment, again, probably in the latter part of the 2020s and beyond.
What may be different is in the transportation and industrial sector, where there is already built-in use of gray hydrogen and other fossil fuels that could be supplanted with green hydrogen when it's competitive. The big question mark would be whether or not there's a hydrogen production tax credit ultimately in the final reconciliation bill. Clearly, there's one anticipated today, and at $3 a kilogram production tax credit, that really closes the gap between gray hydrogen and green hydrogen alternatives. And so that's a terrific opportunity to see growth in the nearer term. And what that would represent is using green hydrogen alternatives to supplant gray hydrogen.
From our perspective, that's opportunities clearly to build a lot of renewables. And you saw the first step in that direction in our announcement today about a power purchase agreement that we've entered into, but there would be a lot more like that in not just the renewable side but also an opportunity for us to invest in the actual hydrogen production equipment such as the electrolyzer. So we'll see. We'll know a lot more in January once we've seen the final package, if there is one, as Jim highlighted. And it will develop over time in terms of opportunities. We think it's exceptionally likely. It's really just a matter of timing."

And then maybe just pivoting over real quick towards transmission, obviously, to optimize and maximize renewables deployment for the country. Transmission build-out is a key ingredient there. Yet it's, as you well know, it's difficult and timely to complete. Just wondering, I guess, your latest thoughts on what expectations you might have for transmission build-out and what role NEE could play there."

We're really excited about transmission opportunities. Our NextEra Energy transmission team has built a terrific business over the last decade with a number of organic wins as well as some acquisitions, as we've talked about in the past of not only Trans Bay Cable but GridLiance more recently. And we see a ton of opportunities going forward for us to be successful in winning some of those big opportunities to invest, realizing great returns but also the strategic side of it of ensuring that it happens so that we can continue to realize the substantial renewables build-out that we already are seeing, and we expect to only continue to grow in this opportunity size over time.
It may not be imperative today to have new transmission, but it's really, really important to start today because it will be imperative in the next decade. And some of the policy considerations that FERC is undertaking today could be helpful to bringing that to reality over time."
