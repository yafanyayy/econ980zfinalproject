First, let me say, I hope that all is well with you and your families at what's been a challenging year for everyone. 
I'll start my comments by thanking more than 9,000 Eversource Energy colleagues for their exceedingly high work and extraordinary difficult circumstances in 2020. Not only did they have to deal with the first pandemic to strike the country in more than a century, but they also had to address the highest level of storm activity ever for our company as well as the hottest summer on record in large parts of our service territory. Through it all, they worked safely and professionally, keeping their fellow workers and our customers first in mind. 
As you can see on Slide 4, despite 107 major and minor storms that struck our service territory in 2020, we successfully executed our $3 billion capital program. These expenditures are critical to enhance the resilience of our energy and water delivery systems as well as to connect new customers and to support state clean energy initiatives. 
2020 was also a year during which we advanced a number of our strategic initiatives. At the end of February, we executed an agreement with NiSource to buy its Columbia Gas of Massachusetts assets, and we closed on that acquisition in early October, just 7 months later. 
The acquisition added about 5% to our regulated business and has been extremely well received by state policymakers and by the more than 330,000 customers that Eversource Gas company of Massachusetts now serves. We continue to expect the transaction to be accretive in 2021 and progressively more accretive in the years ahead, as we steadily increase our level of investment in the Eversource Gas system.  will profile some of these investments shortly. 
Over the past 12 months, we also moved ahead on the permitting of our 3 offshore wind projects and we are developing strategies to meet our industry-leading target achieving carbon neutrality by 2030. 
On the financial side, we achieved balanced outcomes in rate cases affecting our 2 operating companies that have struggled in recent years to earn there a lot of returns. And we also maintained that track record, dating back to the 2012 merger that created Eversource of posting attractive earnings and dividend growth. 
Turning to Slide 5. You can see some of the very solid operating metrics that we achieved in 2020 despite the unprecedented challenges of COVID and incessant storm activity. I am extremely proud of the operating record our employees achieved on behalf of our customers. 
Slide 6 illustrates what we're able to achieve on behalf of our shareholders.  2020 was far from the best year for utilities, as you know, but we were able to achieve a 4.5% total return for our shareholders, keeping us in the top tier of our EEI peers in the short, medium and long term. Medium and longer-term returns also compare favorably to the S&P 500. A key element in achieving that long-term return record is our steady and attractive dividend growth. 
As you can see on Slide 7, last week, the Eversource Board increased the quarterly dividend by approximately 6.2%. You can also see that our payout ratio remains at about 62%, a relatively conservative level that allows about $500 million of our earnings to be invested in our delivery systems each year. We continue to target dividend growth to be in line with earnings growth, which continued in 2020 at a roughly 6% pace. 
As you can see on Slide 8, we expect that growth rate to be enhanced in the coming years by our Atlas Gas acquisition and our offshore wind investments. The math associated with the acquisition is quite straightforward. Adding Eversource Gas increased our total regulated rate base by about 5%. And to finance it, we added about 1.8% to our outstanding share count. 
Since we already operate natural gas and electric utilities adjacent to the Eversource Gas service territory, though considerable opportunities to bring our high level of service and strong safety culture to arduous customers. Phil will discuss the impact on our capital program in a moment. 
I'll now turn to our long-term strategy of being a principal catalyst for greenhouse gas reductions in New England. Slide 9 shows how far we, as a company, have come over the past 30 years as we have divested all of our fossil generation, continue to reduce methane leaks from our distribution system and taken other steps to improve the efficiency of our delivery systems, our facilities and our vehicles. This has enabled us to be in sync with all of the states of New England, which are targeting greenhouse gas reductions within their borders of at least 80% by the year 2050.  Our long-term strategy is built around being a principal enabler of that reduction. 
While our company operations are not a significant contributor to our state's greenhouse gas emissions today, we have set a goal of driving our direct emissions to net 0. The left side of Slide 10 highlights our 5 primary areas of focus in that effort. 
More significant to the region are the items on the right side. Over their lifetime, the more than $500 million that we invested in customers' energy efficiency initiatives in 2019 alone will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 3.2 million metric tons. Efforts to significantly expand our 0 emissions vehicle charging infrastructure and reduce the number of homes heated with oil offer very significant additional opportunities to reduce the region's emissions. But the most significant initiative we have underway is our partnership with that we expect to result in at least 4,000 megawatts of offshore wind facilities being built up the coast of Massachusetts. That will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 6 million tons annually. 
The current status of our offshore wind efforts are noted on Slide 11. As you can see our South Fork project received a strapped environmental impact statement and comments on that draft are due next week. The U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management continues to target January 2022, for issuing a decision of South Fork's construction and operations plan. And assuming a positive decision, we continue to target in-service date by the end of 2023. 
I should note that all the steps in the South Fork renew process have been met either on or ahead of schedule since long established its revised schedule last summer. 
On the state side, New York earnings on South Fork were completed in December, and we expect a state siting decision in the first half of 2021. And on the local side, our Host Community Agreement with the Municipality in East Hampton has been approved. 
On Revolution Wind, we filed our state siting application with Rhode Island at the end of December and was formally docketed last month. We filed our federal application with in March of last year and expect both to establish a review schedule for revolution later this year. 
On Sunrise, we filed our application with in September and our state siting application with the New York Public Service Commission in the fourth quarter. Later this year, we expect both to establish a reduced schedule for Sunrise Wind. 
Our partnership with Ørsted has never been stronger, and we continue to work closely on both the siting and procurement for the projects we have won and bids for additional contracts. While we were disappointed that we did not win additional capacity in the latest New York RFP, we will remain very disciplined in our bidding and know that there are likely to be several additional RFPs over the next 12 months, including Rhode Island, Massachusetts and of New York. 
You can see on Slide 12, why we can be so disciplined with our bidding strategy. The 550 square miles of ocean that we have on the long-term lease for the federal government are the closest to shore and should be the least expensive to develop and maintain. Moreover one lease costs us $1 million, areas that are smaller and much further from shore released a few years ago for $135 million piece. 
This slide shows the current status of megawatts 1 and megawatts still to be bid among the 4 states where we compete. And the number of megawatts being sought will continue to rise with pending legislation in Massachusetts likely adding another 2,400 megawatts to the states already approved 1,600 megawatts of upcoming RFPs. 
President Biden continues to express strong support for renewable energy in general and offshore wind specifically. On January 28, President issued an executive order requiring the Department of Interior to conduct a full assessment of offshore wind siting processes so they are aligned with the administration's goals to advance renewable energy production. 
The President has also established a White House Office of domestic climate policy and created a federal government wide task force to coordinate actions between agencies. Additionally, actions taken by the Columbus and the IRS late last year provide additional financial incentives for Offshore Wind development. 
As you can see on Slide 13, those incentives include 30% investment tax credits for projects that commenced construction before January 2026 with a 10-year safe harbor on projects eligible for tax credits, taken together these changes and more certainty to the tax benefits available for Offshore Wind and underscore the federal government's support for these projects. 
Lastly, before I turn it over to Phil, I want to emphasize the strong strategic position of Eversource for the coming years. Our corporate strategy is fully aligned with the energy policy of the states we serve. Our execution continues to be extremely strong, and our employees and Board of trustees are fully engaged. 
Last week, our Board became the governance, environmental and social responsibility committee with additional direct China oversight responsibilities 
Five years ago, we said we wanted to be viewed as the country's premier energy company, and some of the citations noted on Slide 4 illustrate the recognition that we've received from a number of well-regarded third parties. I'm very confident that our future remains exceedingly bright. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Phil."
292525,703910899,2213536,"Eversource Energy, 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 17, 2021",2021-02-17,"Earnings Calls","Eversource Energy","Executives","Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone, and I'll be covering several topics, our 2020 financial results. I'll be discussing our 2021 guidance, our long-term growth rate, our capital investment plan and recent regulatory developments. So starting with a",2336,"Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone, and I'll be covering several topics, our 2020 financial results. I'll be discussing our 2021 guidance, our long-term growth rate, our capital investment plan and recent regulatory developments. 
So starting with a quick review of our full year results, our GAAP earnings were $3.55 per share, excluding $0.09 per share of transaction costs associated with our October purchase of assets of Columbia Gas. I should say that's including the $0.09 of transaction costs. Excluding those costs, we earned $3.64 per share in 2020, consistent with consensus and with guidance we gave you a year ago. 
Slide 16 summarizes both the year and fourth quarter. Electric distribution earnings totaled $1.60 per share in 2020, up $0.01 per share from 2019. Higher distribution revenues were largely offset by higher O&M, depreciation, property tax expense, interest costs and dilution. 
The higher O&M was primarily attributable to record storm expense as a result of more than 100 major and minor storm events that affected our 3 electric service territories last year. Non-deferred storm expense totaled nearly $77 million and was the highest level we've experienced in recent years in each of the 3 states we serve. These nondeferrable storm costs totaled $0.17 per share in 2020, compared with an average of about $0.10 per share in -- if you look at the years 2016 through 2019 average. It particularly impacted the fourth quarter of 2020 when it was responsible for an incremental $0.05 per share in O&M compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. 
Electric transmission earnings totaled $1.48 per share in 2020, up from $1.43 per share in 2019, excluding the Northern Pass charge. The benefit of increased investment in our transmission system was partially offset by dilution there. 
I should note that 2020 was a very successful year for our transmission segment, placing into service more than $1 billion of investment, including 3 major projects we've been working on for several years, they were the Greater Hartford and Greenwich Substation projects in Connecticut and the Seacoast project in New Hampshire. 
Transmission capital expenditures totaled $964 million in 2020, up a bit compared with our projection that we had a year ago, which was $910 million of investment. Our natural gas distribution business earned $0.40 per share in 2020 compared with $0.30 in 2019. Much of that improvement occurred in the fourth quarter as a result of the addition of Eversource Gas company of Massachusetts. Eversource Gas of mass earned nearly $14 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. 
Our water segment earned $0.12 per share in 2020, with earnings up $6.3 million from 2019. Much of the improvement was due to small gains associated with the sale of our Hingham, Massachusetts system and the sale of a small parcel of property. 
Earnings from the parent and other companies totaled $0.04 per share in 2020, excluding $0.09 per share of acquisition-related costs compared to earnings of $0.02 per share in 2019. The improvement was due to a number of factors, including a lower effective tax rate in 2020 compared with 2019. 
From 2020 results, I'll turn to our 2021 guidance, as you can see on Slide 17, we project earnings per share of between $3.81 and $3.93, excluding certain costs we were incurring to transition our new natural gas franchise into the Eversource system. Key drivers include several distribution rate adjustments that were effective in 2020 or the first quarter of 2021. They also include the benefit from our transmission construction program, which I'll discuss shortly, as well as a full year earnings from Eversource Gas of Massachusetts. 
Offsetting these benefits will be higher depreciation and property taxes, which results from the significant upgrades to our energy and water delivery systems to better serve our customers. 
We'll also have a higher average share count in the first half of 2021, as a result of the shares we issued in March to close out our equity forward and in June to finance the Columbia Gas acquisition. 
In terms of O&M, you should expect the numbers we will report, you'll see, will be higher because of the addition of Eversource Gas of Massachusetts. On a normalized basis, though, we expect O&M will remain relatively stable during the entire forecast period. 
Our long-term growth will be driven by the investments we make to modernize and harden our system, to serve our customers and to support clean energy policies of the states we serve. Our updated core business 5-year capital plan is shown on Slide 18. It shows projected investments of $17 billion over the 5-year period compared with $14.2 billion a year ago. There are many changes from the forecast we provided you a year ago, but the most significant is adding Eversource Gas in Massachusetts. 
Slide 19 reviews the capital forecast changes by segment during the '21 through 2024 period, which is the years that are common to both forecasts. The transmission segment accounts for $508 million of the increased investment during that 4-year period. There are number of drivers here. 
Unlike many of our past forecasts, increased transmission investment is not being driven by large regional projects. Many of those were completed in 2020 on or below budget. In the coming years, there will be more, I'd say, bite size. We'll be replacing equipment that was installed 60 or more years ago that has reached the end of its life expectancy and is vulnerable to more frequent and severe storms we're experiencing in New England. We are making these types of investments as well as investments in cyber, physical security and other areas across our service territory. 
On the electric distribution side, we need to continue to upgrade our facilities to ensure that the reliability gains we've experienced in recent years are continued. Additionally, new legislation that passed the House and Senate in Massachusetts last month is expected to provide NSTAR electric with an opportunity to build 280 megawatts of new rate-based solar generation. We expect the legislation will be enacted and have included $500 million of solar investment in our forecast. 
For the natural gas segment, the continued replacement of aging infrastructure in the form of steel, steel or cast iron pipe with a safer more durable plastic remains a key component of our natural gas CapEx plan. The appendix includes a slide that presents the Eversource Gas capital investment forecast separate from that of the entire natural gas distribution business so you can better model and understand our newest subsidiary. 
And for the water segment, our capital plan increased due to CapEx required for ongoing main replacements, treatment facilities and supply of improvements in Southwest Connecticut. 
On Slide 20, we show the impact on rate base compared -- comparing our actual rate base at the end of 2019 with our projected rate base at the end of 2025. Our rate base CAGR over those years, including the addition of Eversource Gas of Massachusetts is projected to be 8% compared with just under 7% we showed you last year. 
We expect EPS growth to be in the upper half of the previously announced 5% to 7% CAGR range. The higher growth outlook is primarily due to Eversource Gas earnings. This acquisition was immediately accretive, and we expect it will be incrementally accretive each year through the 5-year forecast period, as we migrate off of NiSource systems and increasingly apply Eversource best practices to our newest operating company. 
There are a number of investment opportunities that would significantly benefit our customers but are not reflected in the plans because there's still some uncertainty around their scope and timing. So Slide 21 highlights many of these. As we get clarity of these opportunities, we'll update our subsequent forecast. 
In Connecticut, PURA is moving along on a number of grid modernization dockets, but there are no final outcomes at this time. Implementing AMI solely for our Connecticut and Massachusetts electric customers would involve an investment of approximately $800 million, but none of that sum is in the forecast. 
Additionally, Massachusetts and Connecticut have a commitment to have at least 425,000 electric vehicles on the road by 2025. There's only a fraction of that level are currently on the road and -- but we are only including a limited amount of investment in electric vehicle charging stations in our plan, approximately $15 million a year. 
Two weeks ago, Massachusetts regulators approved extending our recent level of grid modernization investment through the end of this year. In mid-2021, we'll file our new 3-year grid modernization plan in Massachusetts. Additionally, we are now thoroughly reviewing the Eversource Gas of Massachusetts system since we have an obligation to identify the capital investment needs and report that to our regulators by September 1, 2021. As a result of that review, incremental investments may be identified. 
Finally, as Jim mentioned earlier, BOEMs schedules for a review of the Revolution Wind and Sunrise projects are expected this year. I expect that in next February's update, we'll have enough clarity to roll these Offshore Wind outlook into our base forecast, especially since the Biden Administration stated a desire to accelerate Offshore Wind development. But to be clear, in our CAGR guidance today, we reflect no earnings contribution from Offshore Wind. 
From our forecast, I will turn to current regulatory items. 2020 was marked by achieving balanced outcomes in 3 rate reviews that are highlighted on Slide 22. Public service of New Hampshire and NSTAR Gas have been under earning their allowed returns in recent years, but both companies were able to complete lengthy rate reviews towards the end of 2020 with new multiyear plans. 
NSTAR Gas is also able to implement performance-based rate making similar to that of NSTAR Electric. We expect NSTAR gas to continue without a base rate review for up to a decade. Also in October, Massachusetts regulators approved an 8-year rate settlement in connection with our acquisition of the Eversource Gas assets, formerly known as Columbia Gas of Massachusetts. 
With small rate changes in November of '21 and November of '22 and additional rate resets in 2024 and 2027, based on our investments in the system, we don't expect Eversource Gas to undergo a full base case review before 2028. So not in the rate arena for several years. 
At Public Service in New Hampshire in addition to the permanent rate increase that took effect January 1, the settlement approved in December by regulators allows 3 additional distribution rate changes to cover certain resiliency investments. The first of those changes took place last month and resulted in an additional $10 million of annual revenue for PS&H to reflect investments that were made in 2019. 
The next rate resets in August of 2021 and again in August of 2022 will reflect investments during the 2020 and 2021 periods, respectively. We do not expect to file any general rate reviews in 2021. The next review of Connecticut light and power rates would not commence -- would need to commence no later than the first quarter of 2022 under the Connecticut statute that requires rates to be reviewed every 4 years for electric and natural gas distribution companies. 
As you know, we have a large number of other dockets in Connecticut, some of which stem from tropical storm and subsequent legislation that passed in September of 2020 in a special session. We've listed several of the dockets on a slide in the appendix to help you understand which PURA inquiries cover which topics. 
From state regulatory reviews, I'll turn now to FERC, many of the specifics concerning the new England ROE cases as shown on Slide 23. We do not know when these cases will be decided. At this time, pursuant to FERC directive, the transmission owners in New England continue to build their customers based on the 2014 ROE decision in the first complaint or Complaint 1, that was later vacated by the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. And we continue to record transmission earnings based on that decision, that is a base ROE of 10.57% and an RTO adder for the vast majority of our facilities of 50 basis points and an ROE cap of 11.74% on all transmission investments in New England. 
Turning to our expected financings. In 2021, we have about $1 billion of debt that comes due during the year, primarily at the Eversource parent or NSTAR Electric and PSNH, and we expect to refinance all of these maturities. 
We will continue to fund our dividend reinvestment and employee incentive programs with treasury shares raising about $100 million a year -- each year over the forecast period. In 2019 and 2020, we issued just over 1 million treasury shares through these programs. Additionally, we continue to expect that over the next several years, we'll issue about $700 million of equity through an at the market style program. We will continue to evaluate the timing of such equity issuances based on market conditions, our investment program and credit metrics. 
Finally, turning to Slide 24, we know that investors are primarily focused on future earnings and cash flow when evaluating investments. However, I mean, I also believe that a company's track record of performance must be considered in evaluating the credibility of these future forecasts. 
As you can see on this slide, we have a very strong track record of accomplishing what we say. When our merger closed nearly 9 years ago, we said we would improve reliability, achieve a high level of safety performance, control our costs, support our communities and our region's sustainability initiatives, invest in the future and provide very competitive earnings and dividend growth. 
As you can see on this slide, we have been successful in each of these areas and we're confident we can accomplish the very ambitious goals we've set for ourselves over the coming years, delivering for all of our stakeholders, including achieving the carbon neutrality by 2030. 
Thanks again for joining today, and I'll turn the call back to Jeff for Q&A."

So can you maybe just elaborate a little bit more on your strategy with the lease areas? Do you sit on your leases until the other leases sort of are filled, which could take years or would you look to potentially monetize some of the space there? So maybe just, Jim, if you could just elaborate a little bit more around the strategy around those leases?"

As I've told my Board and I've actually presented to the Ørsted Board in the past that they should expect us to lose as many RFPs as we win because we're intent on having these warrants to be profitable. So we're excited about the increasing demand. It seems like every couple of months, the numbers go up in terms of the state's appetite for this. And when we look at our situation, we have plenty of dry powder for those bids. I think it could be one, but I think our leases are undersubscribed compared to the others that are starting to fill up with their existing portfolio of contracts. 
So we will continue to be disciplined, and we're optimistic that the appetite is set for a significant buildout of Offshore Wind. So I think we're in a very good position."

First, let me say, I hope that all is well with you and your families at what's been a challenging year for everyone. 
I'll start my comments by thanking more than 9,000 Eversource Energy colleagues for their exceedingly high work in extraordinary difficult circumstances in 2020. Not only did they had to deal with the first pandemic to strike the country in more than a century, but they also had to address the highest level of storm activity ever for our company as well as the hottest summer on record in large parts of our service territory. Through it all, they worked safely and professionally, keeping their fellow workers and our customers first in mind. 
As you can see on Slide 4, despite 107 major and minor storms that struck our service territory in 2020, we successfully executed our $3 billion capital program. These expenditures are critical to enhance the resilience of our energy and water delivery systems as well as to connect new customers and to support state clean energy initiatives. 
2020 was also a year during which we advanced a number of our strategic initiatives. At the end of February, we executed an agreement with NiSource to buy its Columbia Gas of Massachusetts assets, and we closed on that acquisition in early October, just 7 months later. 
The acquisition added about 5% to our regulated business and has been extremely well received by state policymakers and by the more than 330,000 customers that Eversource Gas company of Massachusetts now serves. We continue to expect the transaction to be accretive in 2021 and progressively more accretive in the years ahead, as we steadily increase our level of investment in the Eversource Gas system. Phil will profile some of these investments shortly. 
Over the past 12 months, we also moved ahead on the permitting of our 3 offshore wind projects, and we are developing strategies to meet our industry-leading target of achieving carbon neutrality by 2030. 
On the financial side, we achieved balanced outcomes in rate cases affecting our 2 operating companies that have struggled in recent years to earn their wild returns. And we also maintained that track record, dating back to the 2012 merger that created Eversource of posting attractive earnings and dividend growth. 
Turning to Slide 5. You can see some of the very solid operating metrics that we achieved in 2020 despite the unprecedented challenges of COVID and incessant storm activity. I am extremely proud of the operating record our employees achieved on behalf of our customers. 
Slide 6 illustrates what we're able to achieve on behalf of our shareholders. 2020 was far from the best year for utilities, as you know, but we were able to achieve a 4.5% total return for our shareholders, keeping us in the top tier of our EEI peers in the short, medium and long term. Medium and longer-term returns also compared favorably to the S&P 500. A key element in achieving that long-term return record is our steady and attractive dividend growth. 
As you can see on Slide 7, last week, the Eversource Board increased the quarterly dividend by approximately 6.2%. You can also see that our payout ratio remains at about 62%, a relatively conservative level that allows about $500 million of our earnings to be invested in our delivery systems each year. We continue to target dividend growth to be in line with earnings growth, which continued in 2020 at a roughly 6% pace. 
As you can see on Slide 8, we expect that growth rate to be enhanced in the coming years by our Eversource Gas acquisition and our offshore wind investments. The math associated with the acquisition is quite straightforward. Adding Eversource Gas increased our total regulated rate base by about 5%. And to finance it, we only added about 1.8% to our outstanding share count. 
Since we already operate natural gas and electric utilities adjacent to the Eversource Gas service territory, there are considerable opportunities to bring our high level of service and strong safety culture to arduous customers. Phil will discuss the impact on our capital program in a moment. 
I'll now turn to our long-term strategy of being a principal catalyst for greenhouse gas reductions in New England. Slide 9 shows how far we, as a company, have come over the past 30 years as we have divested all of our fossil generation, continue to reduce methane leaks from our distribution system and taken other steps to improve the efficiency of our delivery systems, our facilities and our vehicles. This has enabled us to be in sync with all of the states of New England, which are targeting greenhouse gas reductions within their borders of at least 80% by the year 2050.  Our long-term strategy is built around being a principal enabler of that reduction. 
While our company operations are not a significant contributor to our state's greenhouse gas emissions today, we have set a goal of driving our direct emissions to net 0. The left side of Slide 10 highlights our 5 primary areas of focus in that effort. 
More significant to the region are the items on the right side. Over their lifetime, the more than $500 million that we invested in customers' energy efficiency initiatives in 2019 alone will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 3.2 million metric tons. Efforts to significantly expand our 0 emissions vehicle charging infrastructure and reduce the number of homes heated with oil offer very significant additional opportunities to reduce the region's emissions. But the most significant initiative we have underway is our partnership with Ørsted that we expect to result in at least 4,000 megawatts of offshore wind facilities being built up the coast of Massachusetts. That will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 6 million tons annually. 
The current status of our offshore wind efforts are noted on Slide 11. As you can see, our South Fork project received a strapped environmental impact statement and comments on that draft are due next week. The U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management continues to target January 2022, for issuing a decision on South Fork's construction and operations plan. And assuming a positive decision, we continue to target in-service date by the end of 2023. 
I should note that all the steps in the South Fork review process have been met either on or ahead of schedule since long established its revised schedule last summer. 
On the state side, New York hearings on South Fork were completed in December, and we expect a state siting decision in the first half of 2021. And on the local side, our Host Community Agreement with the Municipality in East Hampton has been approved. 
On Revolution Wind, we filed our state siting application with Rhode Island at the end of December and was formally docketed last month. We filed our federal application with BOEM in March of last year and expect BOEM to establish a review schedule for revolution later this year. 
On Sunrise, we filed our application with BOEM in September, and our state siting application with the New York Public Service Commission in the fourth quarter. Later this year, we expect BOEM to establish a review schedule for Sunrise Wind. 
Our partnership with Ørsted has never been stronger, and we continue to work closely on both the siting and procurement for the projects we have won and our bids for additional contracts. While we were disappointed that we did not win additional capacity in the latest New York RFP, we will remain very disciplined in our bidding and know that there are likely to be several additional RFPs over the next 12 months, including Rhode Island, Massachusetts and possibly New York. 
You can see on Slide 12 why we can be so disciplined with our bidding strategy. The 550 square miles of ocean that we have on the long-term lease from the federal government are the closest to shore and should be the least expensive to develop and maintain. Moreover, 1 lease costs us $1 million, areas that are smaller and much further from shore released a few years ago for $135 million apiece. 
This slide shows the current status of megawatts 1 and megawatts still to be bid among the 4 states where we compete. And the number of megawatts being sought will continue to rise with pending legislation in Massachusetts likely adding another 2,400 megawatts to the states already approved 1,600 megawatts of upcoming RFPs. 
President Biden continues to express strong support for renewable energy in general and offshore wind specifically. On January 28, President issued an executive order requiring the Department of Interior to conduct a full assessment of offshore wind siting processes so they are aligned with the administration's goals to advance renewable energy production. 
The President has also established a White House Office on domestic climate policy and created a federal government-wide task force to coordinate actions between agencies. Additionally, actions taken by the Congress and the IRS late last year provide additional financial incentives for offshore wind development. 
As you can see on Slide 13, those incentives include 30% investment tax credits for projects that commenced construction before January 2026 with a 10-year safe harbor on projects eligible for tax credits. Taken together, these changes add more certainty to the tax benefits available for offshore wind and underscore the federal government's support for these projects. 
Lastly, before I turn it over to Phil, I want to emphasize the strong strategic position of Eversource for the coming years. Our corporate strategy is fully aligned with the energy policy of the states we serve. Our execution continues to be extremely strong, and our employees and Board of trustees are fully engaged. 
Last week, our Board's Corporate Governance committee became the Governance, Environmental and Social Responsibility committee with additional direct [ channel ] oversight responsibilities for our expanding ESG initiatives. 
Five years ago, we said we wanted to be viewed as the country's premier energy company, and some of the citations noted on Slide 4  (sic) [ 14 ] illustrate the recognition that we've received from a number of well-regarded third parties. I'm very confident that our future remains exceedingly bright. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Phil."
292525,703910899,2213930,"Eversource Energy, 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 17, 2021",2021-02-17,"Earnings Calls","Eversource Energy","Executives","Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone, and I'll be covering several topics: our 2020 financial results, I'll be discussing our 2021 guidance, our long-term growth rate, our capital investment plan and recent regulatory developments. So starting with a",2335,"Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone, and I'll be covering several topics: our 2020 financial results, I'll be discussing our 2021 guidance, our long-term growth rate, our capital investment plan and recent regulatory developments. 
So starting with a quick review of our full year results, our GAAP earnings were $3.55 per share, excluding $0.09 per share of transaction costs associated with our October purchase of assets of Columbia Gas -- I should say that's including the $0.09 of transaction costs. Excluding those costs, we earned $3.64 per share in 2020, consistent with consensus and with guidance we gave you a year ago. 
Slide 16 summarizes both the year and fourth quarter. Electric distribution earnings totaled $1.60 per share in 2020, up $0.01 per share from 2019. Higher distribution revenues were largely offset by higher O&M, depreciation, property tax expense, interest costs and dilution. 
The higher O&M was primarily attributable to record storm expense as a result of more than 100 major and minor storm events that affected our 3 electric service territories last year. Non-deferred storm expense totaled nearly $77 million and was the highest level we've experienced in recent years in each of the 3 states we serve. These nondeferrable storm costs totaled $0.17 per share in 2020, compared with an average of about $0.10 per share in -- if you look at the years 2016 through 2019 average. It particularly impacted the fourth quarter of 2020 when it was responsible for an incremental $0.05 per share in O&M compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. 
Electric transmission earnings totaled $1.48 per share in 2020, up from $1.43 per share in 2019, excluding the Northern Pass charge. The benefit of increased investment in our transmission system was partially offset by dilution there. 
I should note that 2020 was a very successful year for our transmission segment, placing into service more than $1 billion of investment, including 3 major projects we've been working on for several years. They were the Greater Hartford and Greenwich substation projects in Connecticut and the Seacoast project in New Hampshire. 
Transmission capital expenditures totaled $964 million in 2020, up a bit compared with our projection that we had a year ago, which was $910 million of investment. Our natural gas distribution business earned $0.40 per share in 2020 compared with $0.30 per share in 2019. Much of that improvement occurred in the fourth quarter as a result of the addition of Eversource Gas company of Massachusetts. Eversource Gas of Mass earned nearly $14 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. 
Our water segment earned $0.12 per share in 2020, with earnings up $6.3 million from 2019. Much of the improvement was due to small gains associated with the sale of our Hingham, Massachusetts system and the sale of a small parcel of property. 
Earnings from the parent and other companies totaled $0.04 per share in 2020, excluding $0.09 per share of acquisition-related costs compared to earnings of $0.02 per share in 2019. The improvement was due to a number of factors, including a lower effective tax rate in 2020 compared with 2019. 
From 2020 results, I'll turn to our 2021 guidance. As you can see on Slide 17, we project earnings per share of between $3.81 and $3.93, excluding certain costs we were incurring to transition our new natural gas franchise into the Eversource system. Key drivers include several distribution rate adjustments that were effective in 2020 or the first quarter of 2021. They also include the benefit from our transmission construction program, which I'll discuss shortly, as well as a full year earnings from Eversource Gas of Massachusetts. 
Offsetting these benefits will be higher depreciation and property taxes, which results from the significant upgrades to our energy and water delivery systems to better serve our customers. 
We'll also have a higher average share count in the first half of 2021, as a result of the shares we issued in March to close out our equity forward and in June to finance the Columbia Gas acquisition. 
In terms of O&M, you should expect the numbers we will report, you'll see, will be higher because of the addition of Eversource Gas of Massachusetts. On a normalized basis, though, we expect O&M will remain relatively stable during the entire forecast period. 
Our long-term growth will be driven by the investments we make to modernize and harden our system, to serve our customers and to support clean energy policies of the states we serve. Our updated core business 5-year capital plan is shown on Slide 18. It shows projected investments of $17 billion over the 5-year period compared with $14.2 billion a year ago. There are many changes from the forecast we provided you a year ago, but the most significant is adding Eversource Gas of Massachusetts. 
Slide 19 reviews the capital forecast changes by segment during the '21 through 2024 period, which is the years that are common to both forecasts. The transmission segment accounts for $528 million of the increased investment during that 4-year period. There are number of drivers here. 
Unlike many of our past forecasts, increased transmission investment is not being driven by large regional projects. Many of those were completed in 2020 on or below budget. In the coming years, there will be more, I'd say, bite size. We'll be replacing equipment that was installed 60 or more years ago that has reached the end of its life expectancy and is vulnerable to more frequent and severe storms we're experiencing in New England. We are making these types of investments as well as investments in cyber, physical security and other areas across our service territory. 
On the electric distribution side, we need to continue to upgrade our facilities to ensure that the reliability gains we've experienced in recent years are continued. Additionally, new legislation that passed the House and Senate in Massachusetts last month is expected to provide NSTAR Electric with an opportunity to build 280 megawatts of new rate-based solar generation. We expect the legislation will be enacted and have included $500 million of solar investment in our forecast. 
For the natural gas segment, the continued replacement of aging infrastructure in the form of steel, bare steel or cast iron pipe with a safer more durable plastic remains a key component of our natural gas CapEx plan. The appendix includes a slide that presents the Eversource Gas capital investment forecast separate from that of the entire natural gas distribution business so you can better model and understand our newest subsidiary. 
And for the water segment, our capital plan increased due to CapEx required for ongoing main replacements, treatment facilities and supply of improvements in Southwest Connecticut. 
On Slide 20, we show the impact on rate base compared -- comparing our actual rate base at the end of 2019 with our projected rate base at the end of 2025. Our rate base CAGR over those years, including the addition of Eversource Gas of Massachusetts is projected to be 8% compared with just under 7% we showed you last year. 
We expect EPS growth to be in the upper half of the previously announced 5% to 7% CAGR range. The higher growth outlook is primarily due to Eversource Gas earnings. This acquisition was immediately accretive, and we expect it will be incrementally accretive each year through the 5-year forecast period, as we migrate off of NiSource systems and increasingly apply Eversource best practices to our newest operating company. 
There are a number of investment opportunities that would significantly benefit our customers but are not reflected in the plans because there's still some uncertainty around their scope and timing. So Slide 21 highlights many of these. As we get clarity of these opportunities, we'll update our subsequent forecast. 
In Connecticut, PURA is moving along on a number of grid modernization dockets, but there are no final outcomes at this time. Implementing AMI solely for our Connecticut and Massachusetts electric customers would involve an investment of approximately $800 million, but none of that sum is in the forecast. 
Additionally, Massachusetts and Connecticut have a commitment to have at least 425,000 electric vehicles on the road by 2025. There's only a fraction of that level currently on the road and -- but we are only including a limited amount of investment in electric vehicle charging stations in our plan, approximately $15 million a year. 
Two weeks ago, Massachusetts regulators approved extending our recent level of grid modernization investment through the end of this year. In mid-2021, we'll file our new 3-year grid modernization plan in Massachusetts. Additionally, we are now thoroughly reviewing the Eversource Gas of Massachusetts system since we have an obligation to identify the capital investment needs and report that to our regulators by September 1, 2021. As a result of that review, incremental investments may be identified. 
Finally, as Jim mentioned earlier, BOEM's schedules for a review of the Revolution Wind and Sunrise projects are expected this year. I expect that in next February's update, we'll have enough clarity to roll these offshore wind outlooks into our base forecast, especially since the Biden administration stated a desire to accelerate offshore wind development. But to be clear, in our CAGR guidance today, we reflect no earnings contribution from offshore wind. 
From our forecast, I will turn to current regulatory items. 2020 was marked by achieving balanced outcomes in 3 rate reviews that are highlighted on Slide 22. Public service of New Hampshire and NSTAR Gas have been under-earning their allowed returns in recent years, but both companies were able to complete lengthy rate reviews towards the end of 2020 with new multiyear plans. 
NSTAR Gas was also able to implement performance-based rate making similar to that of NSTAR Electric. We expect NSTAR Gas to continue without a base rate review for up to a decade. Also in October, Massachusetts regulators approved an 8-year rate settlement in connection with our acquisition of the Eversource Gas assets, formerly known as Columbia Gas of Massachusetts. 
With small rate changes in November of '21 and November of '22 and additional rate resets in 2024 and 2027, based on our investments in the system, we don't expect Eversource Gas to undergo a full base case review before 2028. So not in the rate arena for several years. 
At Public Service of New Hampshire in addition to the permanent rate increase that took effect January 1, the settlement approved in December by regulators allows 3 additional distribution rate changes to cover certain resiliency investments. The first of those changes took place last month and resulted in an additional $10 million of annual revenue for PSNH to reflect investments that were made in 2019. 
The next rate resets in August of 2021 and again in August of 2022 will reflect investments during the 2020 and 2021 periods, respectively. We do not expect to file any general rate reviews in 2021. The next review of Connecticut Light & Power rates would not commence -- would need to commence no later than the first quarter of 2022 under the Connecticut statute that requires rates to be reviewed every 4 years for electric and natural gas distribution companies. 
As you know, we have a large number of other dockets in Connecticut, some of which stem from tropical storm Isaias, and subsequent legislation that passed in September of 2020 in a special session. We've listed several of the dockets on a slide in the appendix to help you understand which PURA inquiries cover which topics. 
From state regulatory reviews, I'll turn now to FERC. Many of the specifics concerning the new England ROE cases are shown on Slide 23. We do not know when these cases will be decided. At this time, pursuant to FERC directive, the transmission owners in New England continue to build their customers based on the 2014 ROE decision in the first complaint or Complaint I, that was later vacated by the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. And we continue to record transmission earnings based on that decision, that is a base ROE of 10.57%, an RTO adder for the vast majority of our facilities of 50 basis points and an ROE cap of 11.74% on all transmission investments in New England. 
Turning to our expected financings. In 2021, we have about $1 billion of debt that comes due during the year, primarily at the Eversource parent or NSTAR Electric and PSNH, and we expect to refinance all of these maturities. 
We will continue to fund our dividend reinvestment and employee incentive programs with treasury shares, raising about $100 million a year -- each year over the forecast period. In 2019 and 2020, we issued just over 1 million treasury shares through these programs. Additionally, we continue to expect that over the next several years, we'll issue about $700 million of equity through an at-the-market-style program. We will continue to evaluate the timing of such equity issuances based on market conditions, our investment program and credit metrics. 
Finally, turning to Slide 24. We know that investors are primarily focused on future earnings and cash flow when evaluating investments. However, I mean, I also believe that a company's track record of performance must be considered in evaluating the credibility of these future forecasts. 
As you can see on this slide, we have a very strong track record of accomplishing what we say. When our merger closed nearly 9 years ago, we said we would improve reliability, achieve a high level of safety performance, control our costs, support our communities and our region's sustainability initiatives, invest in the future and provide very competitive earnings and dividend growth. 
As you can see on this slide, we have been successful in each of these areas and we're confident we can accomplish the very ambitious goals we've set for ourselves over the coming years, delivering for all of our stakeholders, including achieving the carbon neutrality by 2030. 
Thanks again for joining today, and I'll turn the call back to Jeff for Q&A."

We hope that all on the phone remain healthy and that your families are safe and well. 
Over the past couple of years, I've spoken to many of the investors who are on this call when I've joined Jim, Phil and Jeff, at various industry conferences, including the last couple of EEI finance conferences. I'm looking forward to meeting many more of you over the coming years in sharing my optimism and enthusiasm for Eversource's future in excellent investment thesis. 
I'm grateful to the Eversource Board of Trustees and to Jim for allowing me to lead an incredibly dedicated and high-performing organization. I'm also thankful that Jim will remain a full-time employee of Eversource as Executive Chairman. 
In approving these executive level changes, the Eversource Board is signaling its confidence in our long-term strategy that focuses on our core regulated business with an exciting investment in offshore wind. We are in a world where customer service, safety and reliability have never been more important. We will never forget that we would not be in the business without our 4.3 million customers. They are our top priority. Customers pay the bills, and they deserve the reliable and safe utility service that we must provide. 
Over the coming decades, the tens of billions of dollars we will invest in our energy and water delivery systems will be critical in helping New England prepare for a clean energy future, and we expect to be a central catalyst for that clean energy transition. 
This morning, I want to cover a couple of topics associated with Eversource's energy initiatives and then turn over the call to Phil. But first, I need to address our company's relationship with Connecticut. We have thousands of employees in Connecticut, who work to provide our 1.7 million natural gas, water and electric customers with the most reliable and responsive service possible. 
During emergency situations, which we have had far too often over the past year due to the historic storm levels, they are working up to 16 hours a day for as many days as it takes to ensure that our customers have their service restored promptly and safely, even in a pandemic. So I cannot tell you how painful it was for me to read certain elements of the Tropical Storm decision that was released on April 28. It did not reflect the hard work of our dedicated employees in the company I've been chosen to lead. 
Our customers, PURA and our company all want the same thing, great service each and every day of the year. And when there is a storm event, power restoration as safely and quickly as possible. The women and men of Eversource work hard each and every day to meet these expectations. 
The PURA order on storm response clearly identified areas for improvement. We know we have to work to do not only our response plan, but also on our relationship with PURA. This was apparent from the April 28 decision and a subsequent notice of violation. I can assure you that we hear this loud in clear and already doing all we can to improve on both counts. 
Turning to our clean energy initiatives. You are probably aware of the climate legislation that Massachusetts Governer signed into law earlier this spring. Among many elements, the law will allow each of the state's utilities to build up to 280 megawatts of solar generation. NSTAR Electric will be able to increase its level of solar generation in rate base from 70 megawatts to 350 megawatts. As Phil mentioned during our year-end earnings call, we have budgeted approximately $500 million for this initiative from 2022 to 2025. 
The other item with direct impact on us is a 2,400 megawatt expansion of Massachusetts offshore wind authorization from 3,200 megawatts to 5,600 megawatts. This expansion will help keep the state at the forefront of offshore wind development in the United States. 
As you can see on Slide 2, there are now more than 10,000 megawatts of unawarded offshore wind authorizations in Southern New England and New York with Massachusetts set to award up to 1,600 megawatts later this year. In fact, Massachusetts RFP was just issued on Friday of last week. 
Our offshore wind partnership with ørsted is very near in data since I have overseen that relationship and work closely with our partner in recent years. It is an important element of our clean energy growth strategy, and we have had a number of positive offshore wind developments already this year. 
Starting with Slide 3 in early January, the Bureau of Ocean Management, or BOEM, released its draft environmental impact statement on Southward project. Comments received by late February, and we expect to see a final EIS late this summer. BOEM is scheduled to rule on our final federal premise for that project in January of 2022. 
Assuming that the January date is met, we expect to begin construction early next year and complete the project in late 2023. Additionally, in late March, the New York Public Service Commission approved the necessary New York state siting permit for the project while the local town and trustees of East Hampton approved the local real estate rights required for the project. 
Turning to Revolution Wind. Late last month, BOEM released is scheduled for reviewing the 704-megawatt project. The schedule calls for a final environmental impact statement to be issued in March of 2023, and for a final decision on construction and operating plan by the end of July 2023. The release of that schedule represents a significant step forward for this project. 
Revolution Wind in Southward are 2 of only 3 projects in the Northeast that have achieved that milestone. Over the coming months, we in ørsted, will be reviewing the bone in the state of Rhode Island permitting process to develop a projection for the Revolution Wind construction schedule. Finally, we expect to receive BOEM review schedule for our 924-megawatt Sunrise Wind project later this year. 
We continue to make significant progress in preparing for the commencement of construction. Over the past couple of months, we have announced agreements with 2 critical ports that will service staging grounds for construction. New England, Connecticut will serve as a hub for tubing construction in Providence, Rhode Island, will be the center for foundation construction. 
Enormous economic benefits will accrue to these communities as a result of their role in our construction activities, including hundreds of direct jobs. We are also very encouraged by the extremely positive signs we see from Washington. President Biden has underscored his support for offshore wind construction along the Atlantic seaboard and has marshaled multiple members of his cabinet to support it. 
The goal is to have about 30,000 megawatts of offshore wind turbines operating in the U.S. by 2030. We expect to be a significant contributor to that output through our partnership with ørsted.  Already, more than 1,750 megawatts are under contract to serve load in Connecticut, New York and Rhode Island. 
Again, I look forward to speaking with many of you at the AGA Virtual conference later this month. Now I will turn over the call to Phil."

So I'll start with Slide #4 and noting that earnings we",1346,"Thanks, Joe. This morning, I'll cover a couple of topics. I'll review the results of our first quarter 2021 and discuss -- and add to some of the regulatory developments in Connecticut and at FERC. 
So I'll start with Slide #4 and noting that earnings were $1.06 per share in the first quarter compared with earnings of $1.01 per share in the first quarter of 2020. Results for both years included after tax costs associated with our recent acquisition of the assets of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts, and that's $0.02 per share this year and $0.01 per share in 2020. 
Results for our electric distribution and natural gas distribution segment showed the most significant changes year-to-year. Electric distribution earned $0.27 per share in the first quarter of this year compared with earnings of $0.39 per share in the first quarter of 2020. 
Lower results were driven by a couple of principal factors. The first is that we recorded a charge of $30 million or $0.07 per share, primarily to reflect customer credits of $28.4 million and an additional penalty of $1.6 million to be paid to the state of Connecticut. These credits relate to a notice of violation that Connecticut regulators announced last week as a result of our performance in restoring power following the catastrophic impact of Tropical Storm last August. The docket established by PURA to review the penalty is scheduled to run through mid-July of this year. 
Additionally, electric distribution results were negatively affected by approximately $20 million of higher storm-related expenses in the first quarter of 2021, and that's compared to a pretty quiet and warm first quarter in 2020. And in fact, in this quarter, we experienced 31 separate storm events across our 3 states versus fairly limited activity in Q1 of 2020. 
So by contrast, our natural gas distribution segment showed a sharp increase in earnings because it's now about 50% larger than it was a year ago. It earned $0.43 per share in the first quarter of 2021 compared with earnings of $0.26 per share in the first quarter of 2020, improved results were due primarily to the addition of Eversource Gas of Massachusetts, which earned $0.14 per share in the quarter. 
In addition, we had higher revenues at NSTAR Gas and Yankee Gas, and these were partially offset by higher O&M and depreciation expense. I should note that the transition process for Eversource Gas of Massachusetts continues to progress extremely well, as we continue to migrate off of NiSource business systems and onto Eversource platforms, reducing costs and improving service. To date, more than 80% of the business processes have been transferred to Eversource from NiSource. It's great progress has been made. Eversource ownership of the distribution system is being well received by customers, communities and employees. And we continue to meet or exceed the financial and operational targets we've set for ourselves. 
On the Electric Transmission segment, we earned $0.39 per share in the first quarter of 2021 compared with $0.38 per share in the first quarter of 2020. Improved results were driven by a higher level of investment in transmission facilities, and this was partially offset by dilution of additional shares issued. 
Our water distribution segment earned $3.6 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared with earnings of $2.1 million in the first quarter of last year. Improved results were due largely to lower interest expense and a lower effective tax rate. 
As you may have noticed, last month, Aquarion announced an agreement to purchase a small investor-owned water system that is based in Connecticut, but also serves portions of Massachusetts and New Hampshire. New England service company, as it's called, serves about 10,000 customers in the 3 states and has a rate base of about $25 million. This acquisition is consistent with the growth strategy we've discussed for our water delivery business. And assuming timely regulatory approvals, we expect to close the transaction by the end of this year and for it to be accretive right away in 2022. 
Rounding out the recognition, Eversource parent was down -- lost $0.02 per share in the first quarter of 2021, and that's excluding the Eversource Gas of Massachusetts transition cost, the same as during the first quarter of last year. So $0.02 in each year. 
As you probably noted in our news release and you can see on Slide 5, we are reaffirming our long-term earnings per share growth rate in the upper half of the 5% to 7% range. However, we modified our current year 2021 earnings guidance to reflect the customer credits I mentioned earlier. We now project EPS towards the lower end of the $3.81 to $3.93 range, and this includes the $0.07 per share impact of the credits. 
On the regulatory side, while our primary operating companies don't have any base rate reviews pending, we have several regulatory dockets open in Connecticut, and I'll summarize the status of a few of them. 
In addition to the penalty I described previously, PURA also identified a 90 basis point reduction in our authorized distribution ROE. This is likely to be addressed in the current CL&P interim rate decrease proceeding. Given the revised schedule that PURA released last week, we believe any ROE reduction would take -- would not take place or take effect until October 1 of this year. 
To help you size that impact, currently, CL&P's authorized ROE is 9.25%, and we have approximately $5 billion of rate base at CL&P. Also on April 28, PURA finalized an interim decision on the recovery of certain tracked cost by CL&P. This decision would result in a number of changes to those track costs that would be implemented on June 1 with other modifications deferred until October 1. The interim decision implemented a number of positive modifications to an earlier draft, and we appreciate PURA making those decisions -- making those changes in its decision. 
PURA also continues to review several other dockets, including potential for grid modernization initiatives, including AMI, electric vehicle programs and storage. And the status of the major open PURA docket is listed in an appendix to our slides. 
Turning from Connecticut to Washington. We were disappointed last month in the developments around the ongoing notice of proposed ratemaking concerning incentives that FERC has granted for many years to utilities that participate in regional transmission organizations, or RTOs. FERC will be taking comments and replies on the proposed changes over the next several weeks before deciding on a final order. I would expect that the New England transmission owners and others will file comments opposing the change, which some see as being inconsistent with the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and with President Biden's focus on building out the nation's electrical infrastructure to bring more clean energy resources to market. 
As a helpful rule of thumb, a 10 basis point reduction in our transmission ROE affects consolidated earnings by about $0.01 per share. 
In terms of financings, we completed $450 million of debt issuances so far this year, primarily to pay off maturities at Eversource parent and at the Aquarion in Connecticut -- Aquarian company in Connecticut. We've not issued any additional equity this year, other than through our ongoing dividend reinvestment and employee incentive programs. However, as you know, and we've stated in the past, we continue to expect to issue approximately $700 million of new equity through some sort of act to market program, and that would occur at various points in time over our forecast period. 
In terms of our operations, we've gotten off to a very strong start this year. Electric reliability continues to be in the top quartile of the industry versus our peers. Through March, our above-average safety record improved even further with fewer employee injuries than we experienced in the first quarter of 2020. All 3 of our natural gas utilities are outperforming on their emergency response requirements, and Aquarion's water quality is solidly exceeding its target. 
So thank you for joining us this morning. I'll turn the call back to Jeff for Q&A."

So I'm not sure how exactly the FERC will look at the interplay between the incentive docket versus the base case docket. But certainly, I think the thing that folks should keep in mind is something I said in my comments, which is very public policy desires by the Biden Administration to electrification and to bring -- clean energy resources. And there's no region of the U.S. that's connecting more clean energy resources than New England. And obviously, we serve the primary load centers in New England and can help deliver that clean energy, both from a offshore wind perspective, but also from a transmission perspective. So we'll have to wait and see the timing in how those play out, but I wish I had a crystal ball that could predict an answer at this stage, but I don't."

So right now, there's no docket number, but the expectation is that, that would be opened by June of 2021. 
So we thrive on performance measures. I mean, I think one of the keys to our success over many years is we have a very aggressive performance management system. We measure and monitor all of our key performance metrics, whether they be reliability, how frequently a customer has an outage, how long the outage takes to restore, what's the safety performance of our employees, what's the diversity of our workforce. 
So we measure many, many different metrics. And we perform well on them, whether you look at comparison to kind of historical performance or where we fall relative to peer group. So performance is part of our DNA, and I think we've delivered that. We have elements of performance-based rates in other jurisdictions. In Massachusetts for many years, they've had these SQI or Service Quality Index measures, where we've had to perform against and we've been very, very successful there. 
So we -- but as you know, the design of those measures is important, and we would hope to work in a collaborative and constructive way with PURA pure and other intervenors during that process.

Don't forget, too, that at a parent company, that there's things that have nothing to do with the kind of the customer rate issues. There's -- there could be investments like nonregulated investments, that's where our offshore wind is financed. During construction, we financed that with debt. 
If you recall, sort of painfully, I know -- I recall that we had a write-off of our Northern Pass transmission project that doesn't impact customers, that goes right to the parent.

Just like our other gas franchise, you can expect that the first quarter is probably going to be the strongest quarter that you see out of -- because it's a heating -- a heavy heating quarter.  The fourth quarter is a heating quarter, not as strong as the first quarter, but it is also a heating quarter. 
Not a lot of heating going on in the second and third quarter in the gas business. So those tend to be none. There's nothing either small or limited contributions or even negative contribution in those months. But the profile -- the earnings profile is very similar to NSTAR Gas and Yankee Gas, in terms of when the earnings come in, and it was just from regular ongoing operations in that business. Nothing unusual."

We think that it fits very well with our clean energy story. It fits very well in terms of our regulated infrastructure skill set. So we would -- we'd like to grow that business, and we can grow it in a couple of different -- 2 or 3 different ways. Organically, through looking at investments that we make in the system, we accumulate small kind of roll-ups. 
We've done half a dozen or 10 or so of those over the last few years or you could do something that is larger in scale and scope, and not that this particular transaction is going to change the footprint so much of Aquarion, but it does add customers into the Aquarion family. And we'll look for opportunities that can do that. We think there are opportunities that are out there, and we are active in evaluating those and then we're active in searching out other opportunities. So we think that there's plenty of opportunities to be had. It may not be just in the 6 state New England region. There could be opportunities in adjacent states that would help increase that -- the number of customers for Aquarion. 
But I can assure you that our goal is not to just add customers. Our goals are always to do: One, there has to be something in it for customers. We want to -- you don't want to get bigger just for the sake of being bigger. What do you bring that can make for better customer service that can kind of lower cost to customers over the long period of time and also be a deal that can be accretive on a financial side. So we carefully -- we probably pass on more deals or lose out on more deals because of our discipline there, but we'll continue to maintain that discipline in any business opportunity that we look at. It doesn't -- we don't want to get bigger just to get bigger."

And I think it would always be fair that you break out what really is the utilities and what is state mandates or regional mandates.

We hope that all on the phone remain healthy and that your families are safe and well.  
Over the past couple of years, I've spoken to many of the investors, who are on this call when I've joined Jim, Phil and Jeff, at various industry conferences, including the last couple of EEI finance conferences. I'm looking forward to meeting many more of you over the coming years and sharing my optimism and enthusiasm for Eversource's future and excellent investment thesis.  
I'm grateful to the Eversource's Board of Trustees and to Jim for allowing me to lead an incredibly dedicated and high-performing organization. I'm also thankful that Jim will remain a full-time employee of Eversource as Executive Chairman. In approving these executive level changes, the Eversource's Board is signaling its confidence in our long-term strategy that focuses on our core regulated business with an exciting investment in offshore wind. 
We are in a world where customer service, safety and reliability have never been more important. We will never forget that we would not be in the business without our 4.3 million customers. They are our top priority. Customers pay the bills, and they deserve the reliable and safe utility service that we must provide.  
Over the coming decades, the tens of billions of dollars we will invest in our energy and water delivery systems will be critical in helping New England prepare for a clean energy future, and we expect to be a central catalyst for that clean energy transition.  
This morning, I want to cover a couple of topics associated with Eversource's energy initiatives and then turn over the call to Phil. But first, I need to address our company's relationship with Connecticut. We have thousands of employees in Connecticut who work hard each day to provide our 1.7 million natural gas, water and electric customers with the most reliable and responsive service possible.  
During emergency situations, which we have had far too often over the past year due to the historic storm levels, they are working up to 16 hours a day for as many days as it takes to ensure that our customers have their service restored promptly and safely, even in a pandemic. So I cannot tell you how painful it was for me to read certain elements of the Tropical Storm Isaias decision that was released on April 28. It did not reflect the hard work of our dedicated employees in the company I've been chosen to lead.  
Our customers, PURA and our company all want the same thing, great service each and every day of the year. And when there is a storm event, power restoration as safely and quickly as possible. The women and men of Eversource work hard each and every day to meet these expectations.  
The PURA order on storm response clearly identified areas for improvement. We know we have to work to do not only our response plan, but also on our relationship with PURA. This was apparent from the April 28 decision and a subsequent notice of violation. I can assure you that we hear this loud and clear and already doing all we can to improve on both counts.  
Turning to our clean energy initiatives. You are probably aware of the climate legislation that Massachusetts Governor, Baker, signed into law earlier this spring. Among many elements, the law will allow each of the state's utilities to build up to 280 megawatts of solar generation. NSTAR Electric will be able to increase its level of solar generation in rate base from 70 megawatts to 350 megawatts. As Phil mentioned during our year-end earnings call, we have budgeted approximately $500 million for this initiative from 2022 to 2025.  
The other item with direct impact on us is a 2,400 megawatt expansion of Massachusetts offshore wind authorization from 3,200 megawatts to 5,600 megawatts. This expansion will help keep the state at the forefront of offshore wind development in the United States.  
As you can see on Slide 2, there are now more than 10,000 megawatts of unawarded offshore wind authorizations in Southern New England and New York with Massachusetts set to award up to 1,600 megawatts later this year. In fact, Massachusetts RFP was just issued on Friday of last week.  
Our offshore wind partnership with Ørsted is very near in [AMI] high since I have overseen that relationship and worked closely with our partner in recent years. It is an important element of our clean energy growth strategy, and we have had a number of positive offshore wind developments already this year.  
Starting with Slide 3, in early January, the Bureau of Ocean Management (sic) [Bureau of Ocean Energy Management], or BOEM, released its draft environmental impact statement on South Fork project. Comments received by late February, and we expect to see a final EIS late this summer. BOEM is scheduled to rule on our final federal premise for that project in January of 2022.  
Assuming that the January date is met, we expect to begin construction early next year and complete the project in late 2023. Additionally, in late March, the New York Public Service Commission approved the necessary New York State siting permit for the project while the local town and trustees of East Hampton approved the local real estate rights required for the project.  
Turning to Revolution Wind. Late last month, BOEM released it's schedule for reviewing the 704-megawatt project. The schedule calls for a final environmental impact statement to be issued in March of 2023, and for a final decision on construction and operating plan by the end of July 2023. The release of that schedule represents a significant step forward for this project.
Revolution Wind and South Fork are 2 of only 3 projects in the Northeast that have achieved that milestone. Over the coming months, we in Ørsted, will be reviewing the BOEM in the state of Rhode Island permitting process to develop a projection for the Revolution Wind construction schedule. Finally, we expect to receive BOEM review schedule for our 924-megawatt Sunrise Wind project later this year.  
We continue to make significant progress in preparing for the commencement of construction. Over the past couple of months, we have announced agreements with 2 critical ports that will serve as staging grounds for construction. London, Connecticut will serve as a hub for turbine construction in Providence, Rhode Island, will be the center for foundation construction. Enormous economic benefits will accrue to these communities as a result of their role in our construction activities, including hundreds of direct jobs. 
We are also very encouraged by the extremely positive signs we see from Washington. President Biden has underscored his support for offshore wind construction along the Atlantic seaboard and has marshaled multiple members of his cabinet to support it. The goal is to have about 30,000 megawatts of offshore wind turbines operating in the U.S. by 2030. We expect to be a significant contributor to that output through our partnership with Ørsted. Already, more than 1,750 megawatts are under contract to serve load in Connecticut, New York and Rhode Island.  
Again, I look forward to speaking with many of you at the AGA Virtual Conference later this month. Now I will turn over the call to Phil."

This morning, I'll cover a couple of topics. I'll review the results of our first quarter 2021 and discuss -- and add to some of the regulatory developments in Connecticut and at FERC.  So I'll start with Slide #4 and noting that earnings w",1344,"Thanks, Joe. This morning, I'll cover a couple of topics. I'll review the results of our first quarter 2021 and discuss -- and add to some of the regulatory developments in Connecticut and at FERC.  
So I'll start with Slide #4 and noting that earnings were $1.06 per share in the first quarter compared with earnings of $1.01 per share in the first quarter of 2020. Results for both years included after tax costs associated with our recent acquisition of the assets of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts, and that's $0.02 per share this year and $0.01 per share in 2020.  
Results for our Electric Distribution and Natural Gas Distribution segment showed the most significant changes year-to-year. Electric Distribution earned $0.27 per share in the first quarter of this year compared with earnings of $0.39 per share in the first quarter of 2020. Lower results were driven by a couple of principal factors. The first is that we recorded a charge of $30 million or $0.07 per share, primarily to reflect customer credits of $28.4 million and an additional penalty of $1.6 million to be paid to the State of Connecticut. These credits relate to a notice of violation that Connecticut regulators announced last week as a result of our performance in restoring power following the catastrophic impact of Tropical Storm Isaias last August. The docket established by PURA to review the penalty is scheduled to run through mid-July of this year.  
Additionally, Electric Distribution results were negatively affected by approximately $20 million of higher storm-related expenses in the first quarter of 2021, and that's compared to a pretty quiet and warm first quarter in 2020. And in fact, in this quarter, we experienced 31 separate storm events across our 3 states versus fairly limited activity in Q1 of 2020. 
So by contrast, our Natural Gas Distribution segment showed a sharp increase in earnings because it's now about 50% larger than it was a year ago. It earned $0.43 per share in the first quarter of 2021 compared with earnings of $0.26 per share in the first quarter of 2020, improved results were due primarily to the addition of Eversource Gas of Massachusetts, which earned $0.14 per share in the quarter.  
In addition, we had higher revenues at NSTAR Gas and Yankee Gas, and these were partially offset by higher O&M and depreciation expense. I should note that the transition process for Eversource Gas of Massachusetts continues to progress extremely well. As we continue to migrate off of NiSource business systems and onto Eversource platforms, reducing costs and improving service. To date, more than 80% of the business processes have been transferred to Eversource from NiSource. Great progress has been made. Eversource ownership of the distribution system is being well received by customers, communities and employees. And we continue to meet or exceed the financial and operational targets we've set for ourselves.  
On the Electric Transmission segment, we earned $0.39 per share in the first quarter of 2021 compared with $0.38 per share in the first quarter of 2020. Improved results were driven by a higher level of investment in transmission facilities, and this was partially offset by dilution of additional shares issued.  
Our Water Distribution segment earned $3.6 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared with earnings of $2.1 million in the first quarter of last year. Improved results were due largely to lower interest expense and a lower effective tax rate.  
As you may have noticed, last month, Aquarion announced an agreement to purchase a small investor-owned water system that is based in Connecticut, but also serves portions of Massachusetts and New Hampshire. New England service company, as it's called, serves about 10,000 customers in the 3 states and has a rate base of about $25 million. This acquisition is consistent with the growth strategy we've discussed for our water delivery business. And assuming timely regulatory approvals, we expect to close the transaction by the end of this year and for it to be accretive right away in 2022.  
Rounding out the reconciliation, Eversource parent was down -- lost $0.02 per share in the first quarter of 2021, and that's excluding the Eversource Gas of Massachusetts transition cost, the same as during the first quarter of last year. So $0.02 in each year.  
As you probably noted in our news release and you can see on Slide 5, we are reaffirming our long-term earnings per share growth rate in the upper half of the 5% to 7% range. However, we modified our current year 2021 earnings guidance to reflect the customer credits I mentioned earlier. We now project EPS towards the lower end of the $3.81 to $3.93 range, and this includes the $0.07 per share impact of the credits.  
On the regulatory side, while our primary operating companies don't have any base rate reviews pending, we have several regulatory dockets open in Connecticut, and I'll summarize the status of a few of them. 
In addition to the penalty I described previously, PURA also identified a 90 basis point reduction in our authorized distribution ROE. This is likely to be addressed in the current CL&P interim rate decrease proceeding. Given the revised schedule that PURA released last week, we believe any ROE reduction would take -- would not take place or take effect until October 1 of this year.  
To help you size that impact, currently, CL&P's authorized ROE is 9.25%, and we have approximately $5 billion of rate base at CL&P. Also on April 28, PURA finalized an interim decision on the recovery of certain tracked cost by CL&P. This decision would result in a number of changes to those track costs that would be implemented on June 1 with other modifications deferred until October 1. The interim decision implemented a number of positive modifications to an earlier draft, and we appreciate PURA making those decisions -- making those changes in its decision.  
PURA also continues to review several other dockets, including potential for grid modernization initiatives, including AMI, electric vehicle programs and storage. And the status of the major open PURA docket is listed in an appendix to our slides.  
Turning from Connecticut to Washington. We were disappointed last month in the developments around the ongoing notice of proposed ratemaking concerning incentives that FERC has granted for many years to utilities that participate in regional transmission organizations, or RTOs. FERC will be taking comments and replies on the proposed changes over the next several weeks before deciding on a final order. I would expect that the New England transmission owners and others will file comments opposing the change which some see as being inconsistent with the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and with President Biden's focus on building out the nation's electrical infrastructure to bring more clean energy resources to market.  
As a helpful rule of thumb, a 10 basis point reduction in our transmission ROE affects consolidated earnings by about $0.01 per share.  
In terms of financings, we completed $450 million of debt issuances so far this year, primarily to pay off maturities at Eversource parent and at the Aquarion in Connecticut -- Aquarion company in Connecticut. We've not issued any additional equity this year, other than through our ongoing dividend reinvestment and employee incentive programs. However, as you know, and we've stated in the past, we continue to expect to issue approximately $700 million of new equity through some sort of at-the-market program, and that would occur at various points in time over our forecast period.  
In terms of our operations, we've gotten off to a very strong start this year. Electric reliability continues to be in the top quartile of the industry versus our peers. Through March, our above-average safety record improved even further with fewer employee injuries than we experienced in the first quarter of 2020. All 3 of our natural gas utilities are outperforming on their emergency response requirements, and Aquarion's water quality is solidly exceeding its target.  
So thank you for joining us this morning. I'll turn the call back to Jeff for Q&A."

So I'm not sure how exactly the FERC will look at the interplay between the incentive docket versus the base case docket. But certainly, I think the thing that folks should keep in mind is something I said in my comments, which is very public policy desires by the Biden Administration to electrification and to bring -- connect clean energy resources. And there's no region of the U.S. that's connecting more clean energy resources than New England. And obviously, we serve the primary load centers in New England and can help deliver that clean energy, both from an offshore wind perspective, but also from a transmission perspective. 
So we'll have to wait and see the timing and how those play out, but I wish I had a crystal ball that could predict an answer at this stage, but I don't."

But I also did remind folks that the storm that equals an Isaias, we've never assembled that many crews, 2,550 crews, during a pandemic. It required double of everything, 6,000 hotel rooms, 14,000 meals a day, double the number of trucks. So it was quite a unique situation.  
And I think that we can always improve, and we will continue to work at that. And we want to win the hearts and minds of our customers back in Connecticut. And obviously, we're sorry if we let them down during that storm."

So right now, there's no docket number, but the expectation is that, that would be opened by June of 2021.  
So we thrive on performance measures. I mean, our -- I think one of the keys to our success over many years is we have a very aggressive performance management system. We measure and monitor all of our key performance metrics, whether they be reliability, how frequently a customer has an outage, how long the outage takes to restore, what's the safety performance of our employees, what's the diversity of our workforce. So we measure many, many different metrics. And we perform well on them, whether you look at comparison to kind of historical performance or where we fall relative to peer group. So performance is part of our DNA, and I think we've delivered that. We have elements of performance-based rates in other jurisdictions. In Massachusetts for many years, they've had these SQI or Service Quality Index measures, where we've had to perform against and we've been very, very successful there.  
So we -- but as you know, the design of those measures is important, and we would hope to work in a collaborative and constructive way with PURA and other intervenors during that process. But the idea of performance-based measures is something that we live with every day and the docket of that is -- the docket for that is starting middle of this year."

And certainly, PURA has broad authority in a rate-setting process. So that's the framework that we work within.  
It hasn't been the practice in the past in Connecticut. It's been the practice to maintain the capital structure for each of the subsidiaries in a way that's appropriate for that subsidiary to finance its capital needs. We do that in a very disciplined manner. Obviously, we have rating agency considerations and any change in sort of capital structure could have a positive or negative effect on ratings, just as regulatory rulings have -- could have a positive or negative impact on ratings. 
So we'll work collaboratively, constructively with PURA over whatever docket, these issues come up in. But at this stage, the precedent has been that the operating companies would have their unique capital structures that reflect their unique characteristics.  
Don't forget, too, that at a parent company, that there's things that have nothing to do with the kind of the customer rate issues. There's -- there could be investments like nonregulated investments, that's where our offshore wind is financed. During construction, we financed that with debt. If you recall, sort of painfully, I know -- I recall that we had a write-off of our Northern Pass transmission project that doesn't impact customers, that goes right to the parent. So there's things that the parent takes that -- so to protect the capital structure of the operating companies.

And so the subsidiary, when we purchased Columbia Gas of Massachusetts from NiSource, we rebranded, renamed that Eversource Gas of Massachusetts. So that Eversource Gas of Massachusetts is kind of the former Columbia Gas subsidiary. NSTAR Gas remains in Massachusetts and Yankee Gas remains in Connecticut.  
So I'll answer the question for Eversource Gas of Massachusetts. There's nothing particularly noteworthy. It's just the operational results of that franchise delivered the $0.14 result. Just like our other gas franchise, you can expect that the first quarter is probably going to be the strongest quarter that you see out of -- because it's a heating -- a heavy heating quarter. And the fourth quarter is a heating quarter, not as strong as the first quarter, but it's also a heating quarter.  
Not a lot of heating going on in the second and third quarters in the gas business. So those tend to be none -- there's nothing either small or limited contributions or even negative contribution in those months. But the profile -- the earnings profile is very similar to NSTAR Gas and Yankee Gas, in terms of when the earnings come in, and it was just from regular ongoing operations in that business.

So we would -- we'd like to grow that business, and we can grow it in a couple of different -- 2 or 3 different ways. Organically, through looking at investments that we make in the system, we can accumulate small kind of roll-ups. We've done half a dozen or 10 or so of those over the last few years or you could do something that is larger in scale and scope, and not that this particular transaction is going to change the footprint so much of Aquarion, but it does add 10,000 customers into the Aquarion family. And we'll look for opportunities that can do that. 
We think there are opportunities that are out there, and we are active in evaluating those and then we're active in searching out other opportunities. So we think that there's plenty of opportunities to be had. It may not be just in the 6-state New England region. There could be opportunities in adjacent states that would help increase that -- the number of customers for Aquarion.  
But I can assure you that our goal is not to just add customers. Our goals are always to do: One, there has to be something in it for customers. We want to -- you don't want to get bigger just for the sake of being bigger. What do you bring that can make for better customer service that can kind of lower cost to customers over the long period of time and also be a deal that can be accretive on a financial side.

Just one thing, Joe, on that, too, is our transmission investments are the investments we've made to -- for increased reliability on our transmission grid really helped to lower kind of what congestion cost in the region. So those are direct savings to customers as it flows through the kind of the energy part of the customer's bill, for capacity market is down, things like that. 
So those are the investments that we make in our transmission business are also helping customers. So that's another way that bills can go down. And certainly, we don't -- we're sort of out of the supply market. But certainly, as supply costs move down, that's a helpful benefit to customers."

We hope that all on the phone are safe and well, and we look forward to seeing you in person later this year. I will cover a few topics this morning and then turn over the call to Phil to discuss our midyear financial results and some new and important grid modernization in AMI developments in Massachusetts. 
I know the most recent months have resulted in weather challenges across the country. In the West, our peers have needed to deal with heat and wildfires. In New England, we've had increased level of thunderstorm activity topped off by a glancing ball from topical storm Elsa. Crews have worked around the clock many days restoring power to our customers from tree cause damage to our overhead system. While our implementation of new technology and vegetation management has limited the scope of many of the resulting power outages, our dedicated crews continue to be on the front line, completing a large amount of emergency restoration work in hot and humid conditions over the past 1.5 months, and doing so in a safe and effective manner. Their work has been excellent, and we continue to receive notes of appreciation for both our customers and municipal leaders. 
I was out all day in Connecticut, the day Elsa passed through, and I cannot say enough about our team and preparing for and responding to storm damage and coastal regions of Connecticut and Massachusetts. We greatly appreciate the recognition of those efforts that we received from Connecticut commissioners at the July 14 meeting. As I mentioned during our first quarter earnings call, improving our relationship with Connecticut policymakers and customers is my top priority as CEO. Earlier this week, a number of Connecticut legislators joined several state, community, education and labor leaders at our Berlin Connecticut campus to celebrate the first class of students while completing our new line worker certification program in partnership with the based capital community college. We continue to see steady monthly improvements in our customer favorability ratings, and we appreciate the positive feedback we are receiving from municipal leaders. But we have to prove ourselves during the next major storm. I strongly believe that the changes we are implementing to our communication systems and processes will put us in a much better place the next time a multi-day storm cleanup effort occurs. 
Next, I want to provide an update on the offshore wind partnership with Ørsted. Over the past few months, we have continued to make significant progress on the 3 projects that I noted on Slide 3. Perhaps the most significant development was the agreement we reached with Dominion Energy to charter a U.S.-built Jones Act compliant wind turbine installation vessel currently under construction in Brownsville, Texas. Once construction of the vessel was complete in late 2023, it will sail to New London, Connecticut, where it will be used to install wind turbines for Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind. The vessel will be one of the largest, most advanced of its kind in the world and will provide a more efficient approach to construction and the use of feedeboges. Work has recently begun a New London at the state-owned ocean facing deepwater to convert it into a major state area for offshore wind. As you know, the primary variable in our construction timetable is citing approval. We continue to be on a good path to secure Federal Bureau of Ocean Management or BOEM approval of 132-megawatt self-park project in January of 2022, which will enable construction to begin early next year and be completed before the end of 2023. 
During hearings this spring that resulted in Rhode Island Coastal Resource Management Council approval of the project, we indicated that we would install 12 11-megawatt turbines in connection with this project. We are making progress on the 2 larger projects as well. State permitting applications in Rhode Island for Revolution Wind and in New York for Sunrise Wind were filed last December. In April, the Rhode Island Energy Facility Siting Board issued a preliminary decision in order and revolution in schedule with advisory opinions for local and state agencies to be submitted by August 26 2021. Evidentiary hearings are due to begin by mid-October. The Sunrise Wind application was deemed complete by New York officials on July 1, initiating a formal review process for the project. 
As we noted in May, BOEM is targeting the completion of the review of Revolution Wind for the third quarter of 2023. Based on that review schedule, we now expect to be able to achieve commercial operation in 2025. We have not yet received the schedule for BOEM's review of the Sunrise Project, but we are in a good position with our New London staging area, our turbine installation ship and our suppliers. So depending on the BOEM review schedule, that we expect to receive within the next few months, we expect Sunrise will reach commercial operation in 2025 as well. These states are consistent with the vision of the Biden administration, which continues to accelerate the review of offshore wind projects proposed for the Atlantic Coast. It is also consistent with the administration's target of having 30,000 megawatts of offshore wind operating in the United States by 2030. 
Offshore wind is one of several initiatives underway to help our states achieve their greenhouse gas reduction targets. On July 14, PURA took a major step forward in furthering the state's clean energy goals when it approved a comprehensive program to support the state's push for having at least 125,000 0 emission vehicles on the road by the end of 2025. The order is described on Slide 4. We appreciate a number of the changes that PURA made to the draft decision to enhance the program's expected success. We will submit an implementation plan based on the PURA order by October 15. 
Also on that slide is a description of a proposal that Massachusetts Utilities submitted on July 14 to further develop the infrastructure that is needed to support rapid conversion of the state's vehicles to 0 emissions. As you can see on the slide, by the end of this year, we will have invested $55 million in our Massachusetts Electric Vehicle Program, helping to connect about 4,000 charge ports. However, since transportation is responsible for more than 40% of the state's greenhouse gas emissions, significantly more support is needed to help the state meet its targets of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030 and 75% by 2040. Massachusetts had only 36,000 electric vehicles registered as of January 1, 2021. And in 2020, only 3% of the light-duty vehicles sold in the state were EVs. While that percentage is above average for the country as a whole, it needs to be enhanced significantly going forward since at the current pace, we will have fewer than 500,000 EVs in Massachusetts as of 2030. 
We need more than 1 million EVs by then for the state to reach its targets. We have proposed spending more than $190 million on EV support from 2022 to 2025, including $68 million of capital investment. These investments are described on the slide and included expanded charger infrastructure investment, some rate incentives and new opportunities to add the EV infrastructure in environmental justice communities. Our support for our state's greenhouse gas reduction efforts is discussed at length in our 2020 Sustainability Report, which was posted on our website earlier this month. A link to the new report is included on Slide 5. The revamp report has incorporated a number of enhancements to provide you with more visibility into our environmental, social and governance efforts. We're also pleased to share updates on our 2030 carbon neutrality goal, including our first third-party verification of our 2020 greenhouse gas footprint. 
We have a number of teams within Eversource, tasked with making our 2030 goal in reality. They include a team focusing on reducing emissions in 5 principal areas, another team working on developing a strategy to offset emissions that cannot be eliminated by 2030 and another team that is encouraging all 9,300 Eversource employees to contribute to their best ideas on how we can achieve our 2030 goal. They've already developed some truly innovative proposals that we are evaluating. Their enthusiasm is just more evidenced on why I am so confident about Eversource's future. 
Now I will turn the call over to Phil Lembo."

This morning, I'm going to cover 3 areas: second quarter results, the status on several of the regulatory dockets pending and some exciting opportunities ahead for us in terms of grid modernization and AMI that Joe alluded to.

This morning, I'm going to cover 3 areas: second quarter results, the status on several of the regulatory dockets pending and some exciting opportunities ahead for us in terms of grid modernization and AMI that Joe alluded to. 
I'll start with our results for the quarter in Slide 6. We earned $0.77 per share for the quarter, including $0.02 per share of cost primarily relating to the transitioning of Eversource Gas Company of Massachusetts into the Eversource systems. Excluding these costs, we earned $0.79 per share in the second quarter and $1.87 per share in the first half of 2021. So let's take a look at each of the segment's performance in the quarter. Our electric transmission business earned $0.40 per share in the second quarter of 2021 compared with earnings of $0.39 per share in the second quarter of 2020. A higher level of necessary investment in our transmission facilities was partially offset by a higher share count there. Our electric distribution business earned $0.35 per share in the second quarter of '21 compared with earnings of $0.34 per share in the second quarter of 2020. 
Higher distribution revenues were partially offset by higher O&M, depreciation and property taxes. The higher O&M was largely driven by increased storm activity in the second quarter of 2021 and higher employee medical expenses. The higher medical expenses was mostly due to the fact that in the second quarter of 2020, in the midst of the worst COVID in New England, the worst of COVID in New England, many routine medical appointments were being canceled, but this has largely returned to normal now in our area. Our natural gas distribution business earned $0.01 per share in the second quarter of both 2021 and 2020. As you know, natural gas utilities in New England tend to have relatively neutral results in the second quarter. 
Our water distribution business, Aquarion earned $0.03 per share in the second quarters of both 2021 and 2020. And Beginning next year, we expect Aquarion revenues to be bolstered by a previously announced acquisition of New England Service Company or NESC. NESC owns a number of small water utilities that serve approximately 10,000 customers in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. We continue to expect to close the transaction before the end of this year. State regulators are currently reviewing the acquisition and its benefits to customers. Our parent and other company segment had modest second quarter losses in both years. 
Turning to Slide 7. You can see that we have reiterated our amended earnings guidance that we issued in May. We continue to expect ongoing earnings towards the lower end of our $3.81 to $3.93 per share guidance. This incorporates a $28.6 million pretax charge relating to our performance in Connecticut following the devastating impact of tropical storm Isaias last summer. We recorded the charge in the first quarter of this year. We also continue to project long-term EPS growth in the upper half of the range of the 5% to 7% through 2025, excluding the impact of our new offshore wind projects. 
From our financial results, I'll turn to the status of various regulatory initiatives and I'll start in Connecticut. We have updated a summary of various proceedings in the appendix of our slides. I mentioned earlier that the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, or PURA, had finalized the $28.6 million civil penalty associated with our storm performance last summer. That followed the April 28 release of a final storm performance decision that we discussed on our first quarter call. As you know, we have appealed that April 28 decision in Connecticut Superior Court. We do not have a full schedule for those court proceedings, but expect the case to take many months before the court renders a decision. A scheduling conference will be held later next month. The April 28 storm order also required a 90 basis point reduction in Connecticut Light & Power's distribution ROE on top of the $28.6 million penalty. That pancaking of penalty forms one of the principal basis of our appeal since we believe it violates the state law that was in effect at the time of the storm. 
Additionally, hearings in the temporary rate reduction docket commenced in May will continue next month. A supplemental hearing is scheduled for August 9, at which time additional testimonial evidence may be presented on certain issues, including the applicability and term of the 90 basis point penalty. PURA just this week notified parties that written testimony on the applicability and term of that penalty may be filed in advance of the August 9 hearing no later than August 4. CL&P's distribution ROE for the 12 months ended March 31, 2021, and was 8.86% and its authorized distribution return was 9.25%. The schedule for this proceeding currently indicates the decision date of October 13. We will continue to update you as this docket proceeds. 
Regardless of the status of this rate review, we and our regulators share a common goal of providing nearly 1.3 million Connecticut electric customers with safe and reliable service and to help the state meet its aggressive carbon reduction and clean energy goals. 
Turning to Massachusetts. Joe mentioned our electric vehicle initiative earlier. On July 1, we submitted 2 other proposals to the Department of Public Utilities. As you can see on Slide 8, the first was an extension of the grid modernization plan that we began implementing with initial DPU approval back in 2018. The investments we've made on this first phase have allowed us to reduce the scope of outages, monitor power conditions much more closely and assist in the installation of distributed energy resources throughout the Massachusetts service territory. The program we submitted to the Massachusetts DPU earlier this month called for the investment of another $200 million from 2022 through 2025 to further improve substation automation, wireless communications and expand other programs that would have a number of other benefits, including reducing peak demand and line losses. Reducing line loss is an important element in achieving our 2030 carbon neutrality goal. In the same docket, we're asking the DPU to take the first steps to allow us to embark on a 6-year effort to implement advanced metering infrastructure for our nearly 1.5 million Massachusetts electric customers along with a new communications network, media data management system and customer information system. 
We project capital investments associated with the full program to be in the $500 million to $600 million range over the period of 2023 through 2028. These technologies are critical enabling investment that support the state's 2050 clean energy goals. And as I've mentioned previously, Connecticut is looking at how AMI should be introduced for CL&P customers. Although PURA has acknowledged the potential for substantial benefits that AMI can deliver, currently, there is no full schedule for the docket at this time. 
Finally, I just want to cover recent financings and rating agency actions. In recent months, both Moody's and Standard & Poor's have changed CL&P's outlook to negative. Moody's changed Eversource parent outlook to negative as well. While we're not happy with these developments, we understand these changes are primarily related to the ongoing regulatory proceedings in Connecticut such as the temporary rate reduction docket and the ROE penalty stemming from the Isaias report. We are pleased that Moody's recently affirmed PSNH, Public Service in New Hampshire's rating and outlook, recognizing the constructive outcome of last year's distribution rate proceeding in New Hampshire. 
Also, we recently filed an application to issue up to $725 million of long-term debt at Eversource Gas Company in Massachusetts. Since we purchased the former Columbia Gas assets last year, Eversource Gas of Massachusetts has been borrowing long term exclusively through the Eversource parent. We believe that borrowing at the subsidiary level ultimately will be less costly for customers, and we expect a DPU decision on this application later this year. Like NSTAR Gas and Yankee Gas, we would expect Eversource Gas of Massachusetts to borrow in the private markets. 
Thank you very much for joining us this morning, and I'll turn the call over to Jeff for Q&A."

That's something we were not able to do with Isaias. 
As you know, at that point in time, everybody was in lockdown. It was a very complex recovery effort because we needed double of everything. We had to have single workers in vehicles, we have single workers in hotel rooms, and it was a very, very challenging matter. So when we had this last event there, Elsa, things are a little more back to normal, and we had a lot of kind of technology portals that we have deployed, which were very, very well received.

Securitization certainly was a topic that's come up from time to time in Connecticut in terms of storm costs. But usually in a rate proceeding, where you're looking at all your costs and what's in your cost of service, et cetera. In our last settled rate proceeding at CL&P, we spent a lot of time on storms and what the right level of storm activity was to collect in rates and what appropriate deferral mechanisms might be there. So there's long been a recognition that these costs can move around and what's the best way of making sure that customer rates remain as stable as possible, but there's still an opportunity for collecting these costs going forward. So those kinds of discussions will continue and the dialogue will continue. 
There's nothing specifically on the table per se in terms of storm cost recovery at this stage. But we've had discussions on various topics. We spend -- so before you get to storm recovery, one of the areas we do is try to not have to recover, right? So that means we try to do an effective job on our vegetation management and the capital spending that we do on technologies to restore customers quickly and remotely. So in the -- and we spent $200 million a year on vegetation management just to -- across our system to remove trees and open up rights of way, et cetera. So the best outage to have is not to have it. I guess that's the best possibility. So we do things -- and the commission has been receptive to our request for additional funding, but there's still a lot of tree work that can be done in Connecticut as in other states, but that's an area that we continue or we'd like to continue to have a dialogue on."

We hope that all on the phone are safe and well, and we look forward to seeing you in person later this year. I will cover a few topics this morning and then turn over the call to Phil to discuss our midyear financial results and some new and important grid modernization and AMI developments in Massachusetts. 
I know the most recent months have resulted in weather challenges across the country. In the West, our peers have needed to deal with heat and wildfires. In New England, we've had increased level of thunderstorm activity topped off by a glancing blow from topical storm, Elsa. Crews have worked around the clock many days restoring power to our customers from tree caused damage to our overhead system. While our implementation of new technology in vegetation management has limited the scope of many of the resulting power outages, our dedicated crews continue to be on the front line completing a large amount of emergency restoration work in hot and humid conditions over the past 1.5 months, and doing so in a safe and effective manner. Their work has been excellent, and we continue to receive notes of appreciation from both our customers and municipal leaders.  
I was out all day in Connecticut the day Elsa passed through, and I cannot say enough about our team in preparing for and responding to storm damage in coastal regions of Connecticut and Massachusetts. We greatly appreciate the recognition of those efforts that we received from Connecticut PURA Commissioners at the July 14 meeting. As I mentioned during our first quarter earnings call, improving our relationship with Connecticut policymakers and customers is my top priority as CEO. Earlier this week, a number of Connecticut legislators joined several state, community, education and labor leaders at our Berlin Connecticut campus to celebrate the first class of students who are completing our New Lineworker Certification Program in partnership with the Hartford based Capital Community College. 
We continue to see steady monthly improvements in our customer favorability ratings, and we appreciate the positive feedback we are receiving from municipal leaders. But we have to prove ourselves during the next major storm. I strongly believe that the changes we are implementing to our communication systems and processes will put us in a much better place the next time a multi-day storm cleanup effort occurs. 
Next, I want to provide an update on the offshore wind partnership with Orsted. Over the past few months, we have continued to make significant progress on the 3 projects that are noted on Slide 3. Perhaps the most significant development was the agreement we reached with Dominion Energy to charter the U.S.-built Jones Act compliant wind turbine installation vessel currently under construction in Brownsville, Texas. Once construction of the vessel was complete in late 2023, it will sail to New London, Connecticut, where it will be used to install wind turbines for Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind. 
The vessel will be one of the largest, most advanced of its kind in the world and will provide a more efficient approach to construction and use of [indiscernible]. Work has recently begun in New London at the state-owned ocean-facing deepwater pier to convert it into a major station area for offshore wind. As you know, the primary variable in our construction timetable is siting approval. We continue to be on a good path to secure Federal Bureau of Ocean Management or BOEM approval of 132-megawatt South Fork project in January of 2022, which will enable construction to begin early next year and be completed before the end of 2023. 
During hearings this spring that resulted in Rhode Island Coastal Resource Management Council approval of the project, we indicated that we would install 12 11-megawatt turbines in connection with this project. We are making progress on the 2 larger projects as well. State permitting applications in Rhode Island for Revolution Wind and in New York for Sunrise Wind were filed last December. In April, the Rhode Island Energy Facility Siting Board issued a preliminary decision in order in Revolution Wind schedule with advisory opinions for local and state agencies to be submitted by August 26, 2021. Evidentiary hearings are due to begin by mid-October. The Sunrise Wind application was deemed complete by New York officials on July 1, initiating a formal review process for the project.  
As we noted in May, BOEM is targeting the completion of the review of Revolution Wind for the third quarter of 2023. Based on that review schedule, we now expect to be able to achieve commercial operation in 2025. We have not yet received the schedule for BOEM's review of the Sunrise Project, but we are in a good position with our New London staging area, our turbine installation ship and our suppliers. So depending on the BOEM review schedule that we expect to receive within the next few months, we expect Sunrise will reach commercial operation in 2025 as well. These states are consistent with the vision of the Biden administration which continues to accelerate the review of offshore wind projects proposed for the Atlantic Coast. It is also consistent with the administration's target of having 30,000 megawatts of offshore wind operating in the United States by 2030.  
Offshore wind is one of several initiatives underway to help our states achieve their greenhouse gas reduction targets. On July 14, PURA took a major step forward in furthering the state's clean energy goals when it approved a comprehensive program to support the state's push for having at least 125,000 zero emission vehicles on the road by the end of 2025. The order is described on Slide 4. We appreciate a number of the changes that PURA made to the draft decision to enhance the program's expected success. We will submit an implementation plan based on the PURA order by October 15. 
Also on that slide is a description of a proposal that Massachusetts Utilities submitted on July 14 to further develop the infrastructure that is needed to support rapid conversion of the state's vehicles to zero emissions. As you can see on the slide, by the end of this year, we will have invested $55 million in our Massachusetts Electric Vehicle Program, helping to connect about 4,000 charge ports. However, since transportation is responsible for more than 40% of the state's greenhouse gas emissions, significantly more support is needed to help the state meet its targets of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030 and 75% by 2040. 
Massachusetts had only 36,000 electric vehicles registered as of January 1, 2021. And in 2020, only 3% of the light-duty vehicles sold in the state were EVs. While that percentage is above average for the country as a whole, it needs to be enhanced significantly going forward since at the current pace, we will have fewer than 500,000 EVs in Massachusetts as of 2030. 
We need more than 1 million EVs by then for the state to reach its targets. We have proposed spending more than $190 million on EV support from 2022 to 2025, including $68 million of capital investment. These investments are described on the slide and included expanded charger infrastructure investment, some rate incentives and new opportunities to add EV infrastructure in environmental justice communities. Our support for our state's greenhouse gas reduction efforts is discussed at length in our 2020 Sustainability Report, which was posted on our website earlier this month. A link to the new report is included on Slide 5. 
The revamp report has incorporated a number of enhancements to provide you with more visibility into our environmental, social and governance efforts. We're also pleased to share updates on our 2030 carbon neutrality goal, including our first third-party verification of our 2020 greenhouse gas footprint. We have a number of teams within Eversource tasked with making our 2030 goal a reality. They include a team focusing on reducing emissions in 5 principal areas, another team working on developing a strategy to offset emissions that cannot be eliminated by 2030 and another team that is encouraging all 9,300 Eversource employees to contribute to their best ideas on how we can achieve our 2030 goal. They've already developed some truly innovative proposals that we are evaluating. Their enthusiasm is just more evidenced on why I am so confident about Eversource's future. 
Now I will turn the call over to Phil Lembo."
292525,1674474171,2356802,"Eversource Energy, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2021",2021-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Eversource Energy","Executives","Thank you, Joe. This morning, I'm going to cover 3 areas: second quarter results, the status on several of the regulatory dockets pending and some exciting opportunities ahead for us in terms of grid modernization and AMI that Joe alluded to. I'll start",1356,"Thank you, Joe. This morning, I'm going to cover 3 areas: second quarter results, the status on several of the regulatory dockets pending and some exciting opportunities ahead for us in terms of grid modernization and AMI that Joe alluded to. 
I'll start with our results for the quarter in Slide 6. We earned $0.77 per share for the quarter, including $0.02 per share of cost primarily relating to the transitioning of Eversource Gas Company of Massachusetts into the Eversource systems. Excluding these costs, we earned $0.79 per share in the second quarter and $1.87 per share in the first half of 2021. So let's take a look at each of the segment's performance in the quarter. Our electric transmission business earned $0.40 per share in the second quarter of 2021 compared with earnings of $0.39 per share in the second quarter of 2020. A higher level of necessary investment in our transmission facilities was partially offset by a higher share count there. Our electric distribution business earned $0.35 per share in the second quarter of '21 compared with earnings of $0.34 per share in the second quarter of 2020.  
Higher distribution revenues were partially offset by higher O&M, depreciation and property taxes. The higher O&M was largely driven by increased storm activity in the second quarter of 2021 and higher employee medical expenses. The higher medical expenses was mostly due to the fact that in the second quarter of 2020, in the midst of the worst COVID in New England -- the worst of COVID in New England, many routine medical appointments were being canceled, but this has largely returned to normal now in our area. Our natural gas distribution business earned $0.01 per share in the second quarter of both 2021 and 2020. As you know, natural gas utilities in New England tend to have relatively neutral results in the second quarter. 
Our water distribution business, Aquarion earned $0.03 per share in the second quarters of both 2021 and 2020. Beginning next year, we expect Aquarion revenues to be bolstered by a previously announced acquisition of New England Service Company or NESC. NESC owns a number of small water utilities that serve approximately 10,000 customers in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. We continue to expect to close the transaction before the end of this year. State regulators are currently reviewing the acquisition and its benefits to customers. Our parent and other company segment had modest second quarter losses in both years. 
Turning to Slide 7. You can see that we have reiterated our amended earnings guidance that we issued in May. We continue to expect ongoing earnings towards the lower end of our $3.81 to $3.93 per share guidance. This incorporates a $28.6 million pretax charge relating to our performance in Connecticut following the devastating impact of tropical storm, Isaias last summer. We recorded the charge in the first quarter of this year. We also continue to project long-term EPS growth in the upper half of the range of the 5% to 7% through 2025, excluding the impact of our new offshore wind projects.  
From our financial results, I'll turn to the status of various regulatory initiatives and I'll start in Connecticut. We have updated a summary of various proceedings in the appendix of our slides. I mentioned earlier that the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority or PURA, had finalized the $28.6 million civil penalty associated with our storm performance last summer. That followed the April 28 release of a final storm performance decision that we discussed on our first quarter call. As you know, we have appealed that April 28 decision in Connecticut Superior Court. We do not have a full schedule for those court proceedings, but expect the case to take many months before the court renders a decision. A scheduling conference will be held later next month. The April 28 storm order also required a 90 basis point reduction in Connecticut Light & Power's distribution ROE on top of the $28.6 million penalty. That pancaking of penalty forms one of the principal basis of our appeal since we believe it violates the state law that was in effect at the time of the storm.  
Additionally, hearings in the temporary rate reduction docket commenced in May will continue next month. A supplemental hearing is scheduled for August 9, at which time, additional testimonial evidence may be presented on certain issues, including the applicability and term of the 90 basis point penalty. PURA just this week notified parties that written testimony on the applicability and term of that penalty may be filed in advance of the August 9 hearing no later than August 4. CL&P's distribution ROE for the 12 months ended March 31, 2021 was 8.86% and its authorized distribution return was 9.25%. The schedule for this proceeding currently indicates the decision date of October 13. We will continue to update you as this docket proceeds. 
Regardless of the status of this rate review, we and our regulators share a common goal of providing nearly 1.3 million Connecticut electric customers with safe and reliable service and to help the state meet its aggressive carbon reduction and clean energy goals. 
Turning to Massachusetts. Joe mentioned our electric vehicle initiative earlier. On July 1, we submitted 2 other proposals to the Department of Public Utilities. As you can see on Slide 8, the first was an extension of the grid modernization plan that we began implementing with initial DPU approval back in 2018. The investments we've made on this first phase have allowed us to reduce the scope of outages, monitor power conditions much more closely and assist in the installation of distributed energy resources throughout the Massachusetts service territory. The program we submitted to the Massachusetts DPU earlier this month called for the investment of another $200 million from 2022 through 2025 to further improve substation automation, wireless communications and expand other programs that would have a number of other benefits, including reducing peak demand and line losses.
Reducing line loss is an important element in achieving our 2030 carbon neutrality goal. In the same docket, we're asking the DPU to take the first steps to allow us to embark on a 6-year effort to implement advanced metering infrastructure for our nearly 1.5 million Massachusetts electric customers along with a new communications network, media data management system and customer information system. 
We project capital investments associated with the full program to be in the $500 million to $600 million range over the period of 2023 through 2028. These technologies are critical enabling investment that support the state's 2050 clean energy goals. And as I've mentioned previously, Connecticut is looking at how AMI should be introduced for CL&P customers. Although PURA has acknowledged the potential for substantial benefits that AMI can deliver, currently there is no full schedule for the docket at this time. 
Finally, I just want to cover recent financings and rating agency actions. In recent months, both Moody's and Standard & Poor's have changed CL&P's outlook to negative. Moody's changed Eversource parent outlook to negative as well. While we're not happy with these developments, we understand these changes are primarily related to the ongoing regulatory proceedings in Connecticut such as the temporary rate reduction docket and the ROE penalty stemming from the Isaias report. We are pleased that Moody's recently affirmed PSNH, Public Service in New Hampshire's rating and outlook, recognizing the constructive outcome of last year's distribution rate proceeding in New Hampshire. 
Also, we recently filed an application to issue up to $725 million of long-term debt at Eversource Gas Company in Massachusetts. Since we purchased the former Columbia Gas assets last year, Eversource Gas of Massachusetts has been borrowing long term exclusively through the Eversource parent. We believe that borrowing at the subsidiary level ultimately will be less costly for customers, and we expect DPU decision on this application later this year. Like NSTAR Gas and Yankee Gas, we would expect Eversource Gas of Massachusetts to borrow in the private markets.  
Thank you very much for joining us this morning, and I'll turn the call over to Jeff for Q&A."

We have folks that are located in each of these cities and towns. That's something we were not able to do with Isaias. 
As you know, at that point in time, everybody was in lockdown. It was a very complex recovery effort because we needed double of everything. We had to have single workers in vehicles, we had to have single workers in hotel rooms, and it was a very, very challenging matter. So when we had this last event there, Elsa, things were little more back to normal and we had a lot of kind of technology portals that we have deployed, which were very, very well received.

Securitization certainly was a topic that's come up from time to time in Connecticut in terms of storm costs. But usually in a rate proceeding where you're looking at all your costs and what's in your cost of service, et cetera., in our last settled rate proceeding at CL&P, we spent a lot of time on storms and what the right level of storm activity was to collect in rates and what appropriate deferral mechanisms might be there. So there's long been a recognition that these costs can move around and what's the best way of making sure that customer rates remain as stable as possible, but there's still an opportunity for collecting these costs going forward. So those kinds of discussions will continue and the dialogue will continue. 
There's nothing specifically on the table per se in terms of storm cost recovery at this stage. But we've had discussions on various topics. We spend -- so before you get to storm recovery, one of the areas we do is try to not have to recover, right? So that means we try to do an effective job on our vegetation management and the capital spending that we do on technologies to restore customers quickly and remotely. So in the -- and we spent $200 million a year on vegetation management just to -- across our system to remove trees and open up rights of way, et cetera. So the best outage to have is not to have it. I guess that's the best possibility. So we do things -- and the commission has been receptive to our request for additional funding, but there's still a lot of tree work that can be done in Connecticut as in other states, but that's an area that we continue or we'd like to continue to have a dialogue on."

We hope that all on the phone are safe and well, and we look forward to seeing you in person later this year. I will cover a few topics this morning and then turn over the call to Phil to discuss our mid-year financial results and some new and important grid modernization and AMI developments in Massachusetts. 
I know the most recent months have resulted in weather challenges across the country. In the West, our peers have needed to deal with heat and wildfires. In New England, we've had increased level of thunderstorm activity topped off by a glancing blow from tropical storm, Elsa. Crews have worked around the clock many days restoring power to our customers from tree caused damage to our overhead system. While our implementation of new technology in vegetation management has limited the scope of many of the resulting power outages, our dedicated crews continue to be on the front line completing a large amount of emergency restoration work in hot and humid conditions over the past 1.5 months, and doing so in a safe and effective manner. Their work has been excellent, and we continue to receive notes of appreciation from both our customers and municipal leaders. 
I was out all day in Connecticut the day Elsa passed through, and I cannot say enough about our team in preparing for and responding to storm damage in coastal regions of Connecticut and Massachusetts. We greatly appreciate the recognition of those efforts that we received from Connecticut PURA Commissioners at the July 14 meeting. As I mentioned during our first quarter earnings call, improving our relationship with Connecticut policymakers and customers is my top priority as CEO. Earlier this week, a number of Connecticut legislators joined several state, community, education and labor leaders at our Berlin Connecticut campus to celebrate the first class of students who are completing our New Lineworker Certification Program in partnership with the Hartford-based Capital Community College. 
We continue to see steady monthly improvements in our customer favorability ratings, and we appreciate the positive feedback we are receiving from municipal leaders. But we have to prove ourselves during the next major storm. I strongly believe that the changes we are implementing to our communication systems and processes will put us in a much better place the next time a multi-day storm cleanup effort occurs. 
Next, I want to provide an update on the offshore wind partnership with Orsted. Over the past few months, we have continued to make significant progress on the 3 projects that are noted on Slide 3. Perhaps the most significant development was the agreement we reached with Dominion Energy to charter the U.S.-built Jones Act-compliant wind turbine installation vessel currently under construction in Brownsville, Texas. Once construction of the vessel is complete in late 2023, it will sail to New London, Connecticut, where it will be used to install wind turbines for Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind. 
The vessel will be one of the largest, most advanced of its kind in the world and will provide a more efficient approach to construction than the use of feeder barges. Work has recently begun in New London at the state-owned ocean-facing deepwater pier to convert it into a major staging area for offshore wind. As you know, the primary variable in our construction timetable is siting approval. We continue to be on a good path to secure federal Bureau of Ocean Management (sic) [ Bureau of Ocean Energy Management ] or BOEM approval of 132-megawatt South Fork project in January of 2022, which will enable construction to begin early next year and be completed before the end of 2023. 
During hearings this spring that resulted in Rhode Island Coastal Resource Management Council approval of the project, we indicated that we would install 12 11-megawatt turbines in connection with this project. We are making progress on the 2 larger projects as well. State permitting applications in Rhode Island for Revolution Wind and in New York for Sunrise Wind were filed last December. In April, the Rhode Island Energy Facility Siting Board issued a preliminary decision and order on Revolution Wind schedule with advisory opinions for local and state agencies to be submitted by August 26, 2021. Evidentiary hearings are due to begin by mid-October. The Sunrise Wind application was deemed complete by New York officials on July 1, initiating a formal review process for the project. 
As we noted in May, BOEM is targeting the completion of the review of Revolution Wind for the third quarter of 2023. Based on that review schedule, we now expect to be able to achieve commercial operation in 2025. We have not yet received the schedule for BOEM's review of the Sunrise Project, but we are in a good position with our New London staging area, our turbine installation ship and our suppliers. So depending on the BOEM review schedule that we expect to receive within the next few months, we expect Sunrise will reach commercial operation in 2025 as well. These states are consistent with the vision of the Biden administration which continues to accelerate the review of offshore wind projects proposed for the Atlantic Coast. It is also consistent with the administration's target of having 30,000 megawatts of offshore wind operating in the United States by 2030. 
Offshore wind is one of several initiatives underway to help our states achieve their greenhouse gas reduction targets. On July 14, PURA took a major step forward in furthering the state's clean energy goals when it approved a comprehensive program to support the state's push for having at least 125,000 zero emission vehicles on the road by the end of 2025. The order is described on Slide 4. We appreciate a number of the changes that PURA made to the draft decision to enhance the program's expected success. We will submit an implementation plan based on the PURA order by October 15. 
Also on that slide is a description of a proposal that Massachusetts Utilities submitted on July 14 to further develop the infrastructure that is needed to support rapid conversion of the state's vehicles to zero emissions. As you can see on the slide, by the end of this year, we will have invested $55 million in our Massachusetts Electric Vehicle Program, helping to connect about 4,000 charge ports. However, since transportation is responsible for more than 40% of the state's greenhouse gas emissions, significantly more support is needed to help the state meet its targets of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030 and 75% by 2040. 
Massachusetts had only 36,000 electric vehicles registered as of January 1, 2021. And in 2020, only 3% of the light-duty vehicles sold in the state were EVs. While that percentage is above average for the country as a whole, it needs to be enhanced significantly going forward, since at the current pace, we will have fewer than 500,000 EVs in Massachusetts as of 2030. 
We need more than 1 million EVs by then for the state to reach its targets. We have proposed spending more than $190 million on EV support from 2022 to 2025, including $68 million of capital investment. These investments are described on the slide and include expanded charger infrastructure investment, some rate incentives and new opportunities to add EV infrastructure in environmental justice communities. Our support for our state's greenhouse gas reduction efforts is discussed at length in our 2020 Sustainability Report, which was posted on our website earlier this month. A link to the new report is included on Slide 5. 
The revamp report has incorporated a number of enhancements to provide you with more visibility into our environmental, social and governance efforts. We're also pleased to share updates on our 2030 carbon neutrality goal, including our first third-party verification of our 2020 greenhouse gas footprint. We have a number of teams within Eversource tasked with making our 2030 goal a reality. They include a team focusing on reducing emissions in 5 principal areas, another team working on developing a strategy to offset emissions that cannot be eliminated by 2030 and another team that is encouraging all 9,300 Eversource employees to contribute to their best ideas on how we can achieve our 2030 goal. They've already developed some truly innovative proposals that we are evaluating. Their enthusiasm is just more evidenced on why I am so confident about Eversource's future. 
Now I will turn the call over to Phil Lembo."
292525,1674474171,2379880,"Eversource Energy, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2021",2021-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Eversource Energy","Executives","Thank you, Joe. This morning, I'm going to cover 3 areas: second quarter results, the status on several of the regulatory dockets pending and some exciting opportunities ahead for us in terms of grid modernization and AMI that Joe alluded to. I'll start",1347,"Thank you, Joe. This morning, I'm going to cover 3 areas: second quarter results, the status on several of the regulatory dockets pending and some exciting opportunities ahead for us in terms of grid modernization and AMI that Joe alluded to. 
I'll start with our results for the quarter in Slide 6. We earned $0.77 per share for the quarter, including $0.02 per share of cost primarily relating to the transitioning of Eversource Gas Company of Massachusetts into the Eversource systems. Excluding these costs, we earned $0.79 per share in the second quarter and $1.87 per share in the first half of 2021. So let's take a look at each of the segment's performance in the quarter. Our electric transmission business earned $0.40 per share in the second quarter of 2021 compared with earnings of $0.39 per share in the second quarter of 2020. A higher level of necessary investment in our transmission facilities was partially offset by a higher share count there. Our electric distribution business earned $0.35 per share in the second quarter of '21 compared with earnings of $0.34 per share in the second quarter of 2020. 
Higher distribution revenues were partially offset by higher O&M, depreciation and property taxes. The higher O&M was largely driven by increased storm activity in the second quarter of 2021 and higher employee medical expenses. The higher medical expenses was mostly due to the fact that in the second quarter of 2020, in the midst of the worst COVID in New England, many routine medical appointments were being canceled, but this has largely returned to normal now in our area. Our natural gas distribution business earned $0.01 per share in the second quarter of both 2021 and 2020. As you know, natural gas utilities in New England tend to have relatively neutral results in the second quarter. 
Our water distribution business, Aquarion earned $0.03 per share in the second quarters of both 2021 and 2020. Beginning next year, we expect Aquarion revenues to be bolstered by a previously announced acquisition of New England Service Company or NESC. NESC owns a number of small water utilities that serve approximately 10,000 customers in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. We continue to expect to close the transaction before the end of this year. State regulators are currently reviewing the acquisition and its benefits to customers. Our parent and other company segment had modest second quarter losses in both years. 
Turning to Slide 7. You can see that we have reiterated our amended earnings guidance that we issued in May. We continue to expect ongoing earnings towards the lower end of our $3.81 to $3.93 per share guidance. This incorporates a $28.6 million pretax charge relating to our performance in Connecticut following the devastating impact of tropical storm, Isaias last summer. We recorded the charge in the first quarter of this year. We also continue to project long-term EPS growth in the upper half of the range of 5% to 7% through 2025, excluding the impact of our new offshore wind projects. 
From our financial results, I'll turn to the status of various regulatory initiatives, and I'll start in Connecticut. We have updated a summary of various proceedings in the appendix of our slides. I mentioned earlier that the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, or PURA, had finalized the $28.6 million civil penalty associated with our storm performance last summer. That followed the April 28 release of a final storm performance decision that we discussed on our first quarter call. As you know, we have appealed that April 28 decision in Connecticut Superior Court. We do not have a full schedule for those court proceedings, but expect the case to take many months before the court renders a decision. A scheduling conference will be held later next month. The April 28 storm order also required a 90 basis point reduction in Connecticut Light & Power's distribution ROE on top of the $28.6 million penalty. That pancaking of penalty forms one of the principal basis of our appeal since we believe it violates the state law that was in effect at the time of the storm. 
Additionally, hearings in the temporary rate reduction docket commenced in May will continue next month. A supplemental hearing is scheduled for August 9, at which time, additional testimonial evidence may be presented on certain issues, including the applicability and term of the 90 basis point penalty. PURA just this week notified parties that written testimony on the applicability and term of that penalty may be filed in advance of the August 9 hearing no later than August 4. CL&P's distribution ROE for the 12 months ended March 31, 2021 was 8.86% and its authorized distribution return was 9.25%. The schedule for this proceeding currently indicates the decision date of October 13. We will continue to update you as this docket proceeds. 
Regardless of the status of this rate review, we and our regulators share a common goal of providing nearly 1.3 million Connecticut electric customers with safe and reliable service and to help the state meet its aggressive carbon reduction and clean energy goals. 
Turning to Massachusetts. Joe mentioned our electric vehicle initiative earlier. On July 1, we submitted 2 other proposals to the Department of Public Utilities. As you can see on Slide 8, the first was an extension of the grid modernization plan that we began implementing with initial DPU approval back in 2018. The investments we've made on this first phase have allowed us to reduce the scope of outages, monitor power conditions much more closely and assist in the installation of distributed energy resources throughout the Massachusetts service territory. The program we submitted to the Massachusetts DPU earlier this month called for the investment of another $200 million from 2022 through 2025 to further improve substation automation, wireless communications and expand other programs that would have a number of other benefits, including reducing peak demand and line losses.
Reducing line loss is an important element in achieving our 2030 carbon neutrality goal. In the same docket, we're asking the DPU to take the first steps to allow us to embark on a 6-year effort to implement advanced metering infrastructure for our nearly 1.5 million Massachusetts electric customers along with a new communications network, media data management system and customer information system. 
We project capital investments associated with the full program to be in the $500 million to $600 million range over the period of 2023 through 2028. These technologies are critical enabling investment that support the state's 2050 clean energy goals. And as I've mentioned previously, Connecticut is looking at how AMI should be introduced for CL&P customers. Although PURA has acknowledged the potential for substantial benefits that AMI can deliver, currently there is no full schedule for the docket at this time. 
Finally, I just want to cover recent financings and rating agency actions. In recent months, both Moody's and Standard & Poor's have changed CL&P's outlook to negative. Moody's changed Eversource parent outlook to negative as well. While we're not happy with these developments, we understand these changes are primarily related to the ongoing regulatory proceedings in Connecticut such as the temporary rate reduction docket and the ROE penalty stemming from the Isaias report. We are pleased that Moody's recently affirmed PSNH, Public Service in New Hampshire's rating and outlook, recognizing the constructive outcome of last year's distribution rate proceeding in New Hampshire. 
Also, we recently filed an application to issue up to $725 million of long-term debt at Eversource Gas Company in Massachusetts. Since we purchased the former Columbia Gas assets last year, Eversource Gas of Massachusetts has been borrowing long term exclusively through the Eversource parent. We believe that borrowing at the subsidiary level ultimately will be less costly for customers, and we expect DPU decision on this application later this year. Like NSTAR Gas and Yankee Gas, we would expect Eversource Gas of Massachusetts to borrow in the private markets. 
Thank you very much for joining us this morning, and I'll turn the call over to Jeff for Q&A."

That's something we were not able to do with Isaias. 
As you know, at that point in time, everybody was in lockdown. It was a very complex recovery effort because we needed double of everything. We had to have single workers in vehicles, we had to have single workers in hotel rooms, and it was a very, very challenging matter. So when we had this last event there, Elsa, things were little more back to normal and we had a lot of kind of technology portals that we had deployed, which was very, very well received.

So those kinds of discussions will continue. and the dialogue will continue. 
There's nothing specifically on the table per se in terms of storm cost recovery at this stage. But we've had discussions on various topics. We spend -- so before you get to storm recovery, one of the areas we do is try to not have to recover, right? So that means we try to do an effective job on our vegetation management and the capital spending that we do on technologies to restore customers quickly and remotely. So in the -- and we spent $200 million a year on vegetation management just to -- across our system to remove trees and open up rights of way, et cetera. So the best outage to have is not to have it. I guess that's the best possibility.

We hope that all on the phone are safe and well, and we look forward to seeing you in person later this year. I will cover a few topics this morning and then turn over the call to Phil to discuss our mid-year financial results and some new and important grid modernization and AMI developments in Massachusetts. 
I know the most recent months have resulted in weather challenges across the country. In the West, our peers have needed to deal with heat and wildfires. In New England, we've had increased level of thunderstorm activity topped off by a glancing blow from tropical storm, Elsa. Crews have worked around the clock many days restoring power to our customers from tree caused damage to our overhead system. While our implementation of new technology in vegetation management has limited the scope of many of the resulting power outages, our dedicated crews continue to be on the front line completing a large amount of emergency restoration work in hot and humid conditions over the past 1.5 months, and doing so in a safe and effective manner. Their work has been excellent, and we continue to receive notes of appreciation from both our customers and municipal leaders. 
I was out all day in Connecticut the day Elsa passed through, and I cannot say enough about our team in preparing for and responding to storm damage in coastal regions of Connecticut and Massachusetts. We greatly appreciate the recognition of those efforts that we received from Connecticut PURA Commissioners at the July 14 meeting. As I mentioned during our first quarter earnings call, improving our relationship with Connecticut policymakers and customers is my top priority as CEO. Earlier this week, a number of Connecticut legislators joined several state, community, education and labor leaders at our Berlin Connecticut campus to celebrate the first class of students who are completing our New Lineworker Certification Program in partnership with the Hartford-based Capital Community College. 
We continue to see steady monthly improvements in our customer favorability ratings, and we appreciate the positive feedback we are receiving from municipal leaders. But we have to prove ourselves during the next major storm. I strongly believe that the changes we are implementing to our communication systems and processes will put us in a much better place the next time a multi-day storm cleanup effort occurs. 
Next, I want to provide an update on the offshore wind partnership with Orsted. Over the past few months, we have continued to make significant progress on the 3 projects that are noted on Slide 3. Perhaps the most significant development was the agreement we reached with Dominion Energy to charter the U.S.-built Jones Act-compliant wind turbine installation vessel currently under construction in Brownsville, Texas. Once construction of the vessel is complete in late 2023, it will sail to New London, Connecticut, where it will be used to install wind turbines for Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind. 
The vessel will be one of the largest, most advanced of its kind in the world and will provide a more efficient approach to construction than the use of feeder barges. Work has recently begun in New London at the state-owned ocean-facing deepwater pier to convert it into a major staging area for offshore wind. As you know, the primary variable in our construction timetable is siting approval. We continue to be on a good path to secure federal Bureau of Ocean Management (sic) [ Bureau of Ocean Energy Management ] or BOEM approval of 132-megawatt South Fork project in January of 2022, which will enable construction to begin early next year and be completed before the end of 2023. 
During hearings this spring that resulted in Rhode Island Coastal Resource Management Council approval of the project, we indicated that we would install 12 11-megawatt turbines in connection with this project. We are making progress on the 2 larger projects as well. State permitting applications in Rhode Island for Revolution Wind and in New York for Sunrise Wind were filed last December. In April, the Rhode Island Energy Facility Siting Board issued a preliminary decision and order on Revolution Wind schedule with advisory opinions for local and state agencies to be submitted by August 26, 2021. Evidentiary hearings are due to begin by mid-October. The Sunrise Wind application was deemed complete by New York officials on July 1, initiating a formal review process for the project. 
As we noted in May, BOEM is targeting the completion of the review of Revolution Wind for the third quarter of 2023. Based on that review schedule, we now expect to be able to achieve commercial operation in 2025. We have not yet received the schedule for BOEM's review of the Sunrise Project, but we are in a good position with our New London staging area, our turbine installation ship and our suppliers. So depending on the BOEM review schedule that we expect to receive within the next few months, we expect Sunrise will reach commercial operation in 2025 as well. These states are consistent with the vision of the Biden administration which continues to accelerate the review of offshore wind projects proposed for the Atlantic Coast. It is also consistent with the administration's target of having 30,000 megawatts of offshore wind operating in the United States by 2030. 
Offshore wind is one of several initiatives underway to help our states achieve their greenhouse gas reduction targets. On July 14, PURA took a major step forward in furthering the state's clean energy goals when it approved a comprehensive program to support the state's push for having at least 125,000 zero emission vehicles on the road by the end of 2025. The order is described on Slide 4. We appreciate a number of the changes that PURA made to the draft decision to enhance the program's expected success. We will submit an implementation plan based on the PURA order by October 15. 
Also on that slide is a description of a proposal that Massachusetts Utilities submitted on July 14 to further develop the infrastructure that is needed to support rapid conversion of the state's vehicles to zero emissions. As you can see on the slide, by the end of this year, we will have invested $55 million in our Massachusetts Electric Vehicle Program, helping to connect about 4,000 charge ports. However, since transportation is responsible for more than 40% of the state's greenhouse gas emissions, significantly more support is needed to help the state meet its targets of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030 and 75% by 2040. 
Massachusetts had only 36,000 electric vehicles registered as of January 1, 2021. And in 2020, only 3% of the light-duty vehicles sold in the state were EVs. While that percentage is above average for the country as a whole, it needs to be enhanced significantly going forward, since at the current pace, we will have fewer than 500,000 EVs in Massachusetts as of 2030. 
We need more than 1 million EVs by then for the state to reach its targets. We have proposed spending more than $190 million on EV support from 2022 to 2025, including $68 million of capital investment. These investments are described on the slide and include expanded charger infrastructure investment, some rate incentives and new opportunities to add EV infrastructure in environmental justice communities. Our support for our state's greenhouse gas reduction efforts is discussed at length in our 2020 Sustainability Report, which was posted on our website earlier this month. A link to the new report is included on Slide 5. 
The revamp report has incorporated a number of enhancements to provide you with more visibility into our environmental, social and governance efforts. We're also pleased to share updates on our 2030 carbon neutrality goal, including our first third-party verification of our 2020 greenhouse gas footprint. We have a number of teams within Eversource tasked with making our 2030 goal a reality. They include a team focusing on reducing emissions in 5 principal areas, another team working on developing a strategy to offset emissions that cannot be eliminated by 2030 and another team that is encouraging all 9,300 Eversource employees to contribute to their best ideas on how we can achieve our 2030 goal. They've already developed some truly innovative proposals that we are evaluating. Their enthusiasm is just more evidenced on why I am so confident about Eversource's future. 
Now I will turn the call over to Phil Lembo."
292525,1674474171,2379881,"Eversource Energy, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 30, 2021",2021-07-30,"Earnings Calls","Eversource Energy","Executives","Thank you, Joe. This morning, I'm going to cover 3 areas: second quarter results, the status on several of the regulatory dockets pending and some exciting opportunities ahead for us in terms of grid modernization and AMI that Joe alluded to. I'll start",1347,"Thank you, Joe. This morning, I'm going to cover 3 areas: second quarter results, the status on several of the regulatory dockets pending and some exciting opportunities ahead for us in terms of grid modernization and AMI that Joe alluded to. 
I'll start with our results for the quarter in Slide 6. We earned $0.77 per share for the quarter, including $0.02 per share of cost primarily relating to the transitioning of Eversource Gas Company of Massachusetts into the Eversource systems. Excluding these costs, we earned $0.79 per share in the second quarter and $1.87 per share in the first half of 2021. So let's take a look at each of the segment's performance in the quarter. Our electric transmission business earned $0.40 per share in the second quarter of 2021 compared with earnings of $0.39 per share in the second quarter of 2020. A higher level of necessary investment in our transmission facilities was partially offset by a higher share count there. Our electric distribution business earned $0.35 per share in the second quarter of '21 compared with earnings of $0.34 per share in the second quarter of 2020. 
Higher distribution revenues were partially offset by higher O&M, depreciation and property taxes. The higher O&M was largely driven by increased storm activity in the second quarter of 2021 and higher employee medical expenses. The higher medical expenses was mostly due to the fact that in the second quarter of 2020, in the midst of the worst COVID in New England, many routine medical appointments were being canceled, but this has largely returned to normal now in our area. Our natural gas distribution business earned $0.01 per share in the second quarter of both 2021 and 2020. As you know, natural gas utilities in New England tend to have relatively neutral results in the second quarter. 
Our water distribution business, Aquarion earned $0.03 per share in the second quarters of both 2021 and 2020. Beginning next year, we expect Aquarion revenues to be bolstered by a previously announced acquisition of New England Service Company or NESC. NESC owns a number of small water utilities that serve approximately 10,000 customers in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. We continue to expect to close the transaction before the end of this year. State regulators are currently reviewing the acquisition and its benefits to customers. Our parent and other company segment had modest second quarter losses in both years. 
Turning to Slide 7. You can see that we have reiterated our amended earnings guidance that we issued in May. We continue to expect ongoing earnings towards the lower end of our $3.81 to $3.93 per share guidance. This incorporates a $28.6 million pretax charge relating to our performance in Connecticut following the devastating impact of tropical storm, Isaias last summer. We recorded the charge in the first quarter of this year. We also continue to project long-term EPS growth in the upper half of the range of 5% to 7% through 2025, excluding the impact of our new offshore wind projects. 
From our financial results, I'll turn to the status of various regulatory initiatives, and I'll start in Connecticut. We have updated a summary of various proceedings in the appendix of our slides. I mentioned earlier that the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, or PURA, had finalized the $28.6 million civil penalty associated with our storm performance last summer. That followed the April 28 release of a final storm performance decision that we discussed on our first quarter call. As you know, we have appealed that April 28 decision in Connecticut Superior Court. We do not have a full schedule for those court proceedings, but expect the case to take many months before the court renders a decision. A scheduling conference will be held later next month. The April 28 storm order also required a 90 basis point reduction in Connecticut Light & Power's distribution ROE on top of the $28.6 million penalty. That pancaking of penalty forms one of the principal basis of our appeal since we believe it violates the state law that was in effect at the time of the storm. 
Additionally, hearings in the temporary rate reduction docket commenced in May will continue next month. A supplemental hearing is scheduled for August 9, at which time, additional testimonial evidence may be presented on certain issues, including the applicability and term of the 90 basis point penalty. PURA just this week notified parties that written testimony on the applicability and term of that penalty may be filed in advance of the August 9 hearing no later than August 4. CL&P's distribution ROE for the 12 months ended March 31, 2021 was 8.86% and its authorized distribution return was 9.25%. The schedule for this proceeding currently indicates the decision date of October 13. We will continue to update you as this docket proceeds. 
Regardless of the status of this rate review, we and our regulators share a common goal of providing nearly 1.3 million Connecticut electric customers with safe and reliable service and to help the state meet its aggressive carbon reduction and clean energy goals. 
Turning to Massachusetts. Joe mentioned our electric vehicle initiative earlier. On July 1, we submitted 2 other proposals to the Department of Public Utilities. As you can see on Slide 8, the first was an extension of the grid modernization plan that we began implementing with initial DPU approval back in 2018. The investments we've made on this first phase have allowed us to reduce the scope of outages, monitor power conditions much more closely and assist in the installation of distributed energy resources throughout the Massachusetts service territory. The program we submitted to the Massachusetts DPU earlier this month called for the investment of another $200 million from 2022 through 2025 to further improve substation automation, wireless communications and expand other programs that would have a number of other benefits, including reducing peak demand and line losses.
Reducing line loss is an important element in achieving our 2030 carbon neutrality goal. In the same docket, we're asking the DPU to take the first steps to allow us to embark on a 6-year effort to implement advanced metering infrastructure for our nearly 1.5 million Massachusetts electric customers along with a new communications network, media data management system and customer information system. 
We project capital investments associated with the full program to be in the $500 million to $600 million range over the period of 2023 through 2028. These technologies are critical enabling investment that support the state's 2050 clean energy goals. And as I've mentioned previously, Connecticut is looking at how AMI should be introduced for CL&P customers. Although PURA has acknowledged the potential for substantial benefits that AMI can deliver, currently there is no full schedule for the docket at this time. 
Finally, I just want to cover recent financings and rating agency actions. In recent months, both Moody's and Standard & Poor's have changed CL&P's outlook to negative. Moody's changed Eversource parent outlook to negative as well. While we're not happy with these developments, we understand these changes are primarily related to the ongoing regulatory proceedings in Connecticut such as the temporary rate reduction docket and the ROE penalty stemming from the Isaias report. We are pleased that Moody's recently affirmed PSNH, Public Service in New Hampshire's rating and outlook, recognizing the constructive outcome of last year's distribution rate proceeding in New Hampshire. 
Also, we recently filed an application to issue up to $725 million of long-term debt at Eversource Gas Company in Massachusetts. Since we purchased the former Columbia Gas assets last year, Eversource Gas of Massachusetts has been borrowing long term exclusively through the Eversource parent. We believe that borrowing at the subsidiary level ultimately will be less costly for customers, and we expect DPU decision on this application later this year. Like NSTAR Gas and Yankee Gas, we would expect Eversource Gas of Massachusetts to borrow in the private markets. 
Thank you very much for joining us this morning, and I'll turn the call over to Jeff for Q&A."

We hope that all on the phone are safe and well, and we look forward to seeing many of you in person next week at the EEI conference.

We hope that all on the phone are safe and well, and we look forward to seeing many of you in person next week at the EEI conference. I will cover a few topics this morning and then turn over the call to Phil to discuss our third quarter financial results and our regulatory activity. 
First, I want to discuss last week's Northeastern, which impacted approximately 525,000 customers across our service territory. Our Eastern Massachusetts customers sustained the greatest damage with more than 450,000 customers impacted. That's over 35% of Eversource's customers in Eastern Massachusetts. This storm was far less damaging in Connecticut, Western Massachusetts and New Hampshire. So as we wrapped up the restoration in those areas, we were able to quickly redeploy resources to the Southeastern Massachusetts, Cape Card in Matas Vinea, areas that took the brunt of the storm. Our internal resources were supplemented by hundreds of crews from outside the region, and we were able to essentially complete the work over this past weekend. This experience underscores the benefits of a large T&D organization, one where resources can be shifted based on the greatest need. Last year, it was Connecticut. 
Last week, it was Massachusetts. Next time, it might be in New Hampshire. We have 9,300 dedicated employees, all focused on providing the best possible experience for our customers. lessons we learned last year in Connecticut, particularly regarding communication with municipalities have been vigorously applied this year. Our customers and community leaders have certainly noticed our enhancements, and we have received many positive comments on our storm response. Customers are noting that not all the best alignment in New England worked for the New England Patriots. When storms have threatened us and recall that we have had glancing blows from 3 tropical storms this summer in last week's events that I described at the beginning of my comments, I have been at the center of the action from before the storm hits into the loss of our customers has power restored. I believe that's critical for us to be out front, visible, transparent and collaborative during these major events. -- something that has been difficult to do as we all work in a remote pandemic restricted environment for the last 18 months. 
Next, I want to discuss our Connecticut rate settlement. To start, I want to thank the parties from Deep, the Connecticut Attorney General's office, the Office of Consumer Counsel and the state's industrial consumers, for billing being willing to sit down and work out a settlement that will yield meaningful and immediate bill credits to customers and strengthen the Connecticut focus in control at Connecticut Light and Power. In news reports, Governor Lamont, Attorney General William Tong and state leaders were quoted as saying that the settlement provides customers with some well-deserved relief in the short term, greater local control and oversight and an improved customer experience. We agree. I also want to thank PURA for approving the settlement agreement last Wednesday. 
Phil will discuss settlement specifics in a moment. but we are very grateful to PURA for the opportunity to move forward on a positive note. Settling critical regulatory and legal disputes was a necessity to reset our relationship with key Connecticut stakeholders. We all want the state to move ahead on addressing critical energy and climate issues, and the outstanding disputes have the potential to delay some of this important work. Since becoming CEO this past spring, my top priority has been to strengthen our relationship in Connecticut. I have met regularly with key state policymakers as well as business leaders and customers, underscoring our commitment to the state with the largest number of Eversource employees live and work. This will continue to be a strong focus for me going forward. 
Eversource is fully committed to providing each and every one of our 4.3 million electric, natural gas and water customers across New England with exceptional service. With Connecticut temporary rate docket now behind us, we can move on to other important topics where progress has been hindered by the drain in time and resources devoted to strong Isaias in the interim rate reduction, supporting the build-out of electric vehicle infrastructure, incenting the construction of customer-owned energy storage, installing AMI, that is the clean energy future, and we will work together with our customers and policymakers to get there. Changing topics. I'm going to cover some very positive developments in recent months concerning our offshore wind partnership with Orsted. You can see the status of our current projects on Slide 3. Each has advanced since our last earnings call. 
To start, our smaller projects, South Fork has received its final environmental impact statement, and we expect a record of decision to be posted later this month. BOM's project website anticipates a decision on South Fox construction and operating permit or a cap in January of 2022, and we anticipate construction beginning early next year. We continue to expect commercial operation of the 12 turbines 130-megawatt project by the end of 2023. In August, we announced that Kiwi will commence construction of the project substation this month in Texas that we expect it to be installed in the summer of 2023. We -- Moving to the 704-megawatt Revolution Wind project that will deliver clean power to Connecticut and Rhode Island. BOM continues to anticipate a COP decision in July of 2023, which would support a 2025 in-service date. State siting hearings have commenced. Finally, our largest project, Sunrise Wind, which will supply 924 megawatts to New York. We are looking for federal agencies to complete their final reviews in late 2023, a schedule that would support a late 2025 in-service date. 
Last week, we announced that Sunrise will be the first offshore wind project in the United States that will utilize high-voltage direct current technology. HVDC offers advantages over AC technology when used over long distances. In Sunrise, we'll have an approximately 100-mile submarine transmission cable from offshore energy production area to the grid connection in Brookhaven, Long Island, New York. We continue to project mid-teens equity returns for these 3 projects. The Big administration continues to show significant support for offshore wind in both words and actions, targeting 30,000 megawatts of offshore turbines by 2030. We view our partnerships to ocean tracks off of Massachusetts as the best offshore wind sites on the Atlantic seaboard. 
Our leases are in close proximity to both the New England and New York markets. They enjoy strong offshore wins, particularly in the winter, and they have modest ocean depths. They can hold at least 4,000 megawatts of offshore wind turbines, far more than the approximately 760 megawatts we currently have on the contract. We continue to exercise strong fiscal discipline in using the remaining offshore acreage that we have leased from the federal government. We did not bid into Massachusetts, September RFP for up to 1,600 megawatts of offshore wind. Current Massachusetts bidding rules discourage imaginative bid packages. Governor Baker and some Massachusetts policymakers are now recognizing that Massachusetts is not benefiting from the same level of economic development as states that place greater emphasis on infrastructure and supply chain development. 
As such, the governor recently filed legislation that would eliminate the current price gap. In Rhode Island, we are constructing a service vessel in the state. In Connecticut, we are partnering with the state on more than $200 million upgrade of the New London State peer. The pie will become the premier site in the entire Northeast for staging offshore wind development. Onshore construction is underway, which you can see from either I-95 or Amtrex nearby Boston to New York line. In New York, I joined members of the Governor Hawkes administration last month in announcing the largest single offshore wind supply chain contract award in New York to support the Sunrise project. The local company, rigs Distiller, will construct advanced foundation components at the port on Hudson near Albany. It is just the latest commitment we have made to New York, which also includes basin and offshore wind maintenance hub in Port Jefferson. We have an excellent relationship with New York policymakers, and that is where most of our currently contracted offshore wind capacity is headed. We look forward to bidding into future RFPs where our strong mix of sites, skill sets, disciplined bidding strategies in Allstate's vast offshore wind experience will make us a formidable contender in any competition that takes a broad look at the benefits of offshore wind. Now I will turn the call over to Phil."

This morning, I'll cover a few topics, our third quarter results, details about the Connecticut settlement. An update on grid modernization, electric vehicle initiatives. -- and look at natural gas outlook for the coming winter. I'll start",2478,"Thank you, Joe. This morning, I'll cover a few topics, our third quarter results, details about the Connecticut settlement. An update on grid modernization, electric vehicle initiatives. -- and look at natural gas outlook for the coming winter. I'll start with our results for the quarter. Slide 4. Our GAAP earnings were $0.82 per share for the quarter, including a $0.19 charge associated with the Connecticut electric rate settlement and a $0.01 charge relating to our integration of Eversource Gas of Massachusetts. 
Overall, we experienced improved operating results at the electric transmission and distribution segments and lower results at the natural gas and water segments as well as the parents and other. Our electric transmission business earned $0.40 per share in the third quarter of 2021 compared with earnings of $0.36 in the third quarter of last year, reflecting a higher level of necessary investment in our transmission facilities. Our electric distribution business, excluding charges related to the Connecticut rate settlement earned $0.62 per share in the third quarter of 2021 compared with earnings of $0.60 in the third quarter of 2020. Higher distribution revenues were partially offset by higher O&M, depreciation, interest and property taxes. Storm-related expenses remain a headwind for us, costing us $0.01 a share in the third quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 and a total of $0.05 a share more in 2021 than last year on a year-to-date basis. Our natural gas distribution business lost $0.06 per share in the third quarter of 2021 compared with a loss of $0.04 in the third quarter of 2020. Given the seasonal nature of customer usage, natural gas utilities tend to recur natural gas segment now, our natural gas segment loss is now about 50% larger as a result of the acquisition of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts assets back in last October. And as you recall, we now refer to that franchise as Eversource Gas of Massachusetts. So 
Eversource Gas of Massachusetts lost about $0.03 per share in the quarter. It had no comparable amount in the third quarter of 2020. I think it's important to point out here that given this is the first full year for our Eversource Gas of Massachusetts or EGMA franchise, modeling its quarterly earnings contribution has varied widely across street estimates, at least the ones that I've seen. Just to summarize, investors underestimated the $0.14 per share positive contribution from eGMA in the first quarter, I believe there may have been some underestimate of eGMA losses in the third quarter. As I said, eGMA lost $0.03 in the quarter, and it was not part of the Eversource family in the third quarter 2020. I say going forward with the year's track record behind us, I'm sure that the estimates will better reflect the earnings pattern we have for that franchise going forward. 
Our water distribution business, Aquarion earned $0.05 per share in the third quarter of 2021 compared with earnings of $0.07 in the third quarter of 2020.-- The lower results were due primarily to the absence of the Hingham, Massachusetts, water system that we sold at the end of July of 2020. The $17.5 million that we earned at our water segment in the third quarter of 2021 is a more normalized level for that segment. Our parent and other earned $0.01 per share in the third quarter of 2021 compared with earnings of $0.03 in the third quarter of 2020. Lower earnings were primarily due to a higher effective tax rate our consolidated rate was 24.8% in the third quarter of 2021 compared with 23.7% in the third quarter of 2020. 
Turning to Slide 5. You can see that we have reiterated the $3.81 to $3.93 EPS guidance that we issued in February. That range excludes the $0.25 per share of charges related to our Connecticut settlement and storm-related bill credits that we recognized in the first quarter of this year as well as the transition costs related to the integration of the former Columbia Gas of Massachusetts assets into the Eversource system. Also, we project long-term EPS growth in the upper half of the range of 5% to 7% through 2025, excluding the impact or the positive impact that we expect from our offshore wind projects. That growth is largely driven by our $17 billion 5-year capital program and continued strong operational effectiveness throughout the business. For reference, our 5-year capital forecast is shown in the appendix, and through September 30, our capital expenditures totaled $2.3 billion. From the financial results, I'll turn to our recently approved Connecticut settlement on Slide #6. Earlier, Joe provided you with an overview, I'll just add a few additional details. The settlement calls for $65 million in rate credits to CL&P customers over the course of December of 2021 in January of 2022. And that's about, in total, $35 per customer over the 2 months for the typical residential customer. It provides another $10 million of shareholder pay benefits to customers who are most in need of help with their energy bills. 
Further, as part of the settlement, we'll withdraw our superior court appeal of the $28.4 million total storm-related credits that customers first saw in their bills in September '21. So these customers will continue. They'll continue to flow back to customers through August of next year. As prior to the settlement, the 90 basis point indefinite reduction of CL&P's distribution ROE will not be implemented. Additionally, the current 9.25% ROE and capital structure will remain in effect. This will avoid an appeal of the interim rate reduction and will withdraw the pending appeal of the 90 basis point reduction. CL&P cannot implement new base distribution rates before January 1, 2024. Parties to the settlement agreed that this review satisfies the statutory requirement in Connecticut that all electric and natural gas distribution company rates be reviewed once every 4 years, that's to determine whether they're just and reasonable. 
So as a result, the next statutory mandated review would be in late 2025. Since CL&P's last distribution rate case was effective in May of '18, the actual -- the company's actual ROEs have generally ranged between 8.6% and 9%, with the latest reported quarter at 8.6%. There are some tracking mechanisms that will allow us to recover costs associated with certain new investments over the coming years, such as those to improve reliability or implement grid modernization initiatives, but we'll not be able to obtain any additional revenues to offset higher wages, employee benefits costs, property taxes and other inflationary items. We'll continue to provide superior service to our nearly 1.3 million CL&P customers. We will also be effectively managing our operations. It will certainly be a challenge, but one I know that our entire CL&P and Eversource team is up to meeting. 
From the Connecticut settlement, I'll turn to our various grid mod, AMI, electric vehicle initiatives in Connecticut and Massachusetts. So first, I'll turn to Slide 7 and cover the Connecticut programs. On October 1, CL&P filed final electric vehicle program design documents for PURA review and approval, including a proposed budget and program implementation plan for residential managed charging. PURA will conduct a review process with a final decision targeted for December 8. The program is planned to launch January 1, 2022, and will support the state's target of having at least 125,000 electric vehicles on the road by the end of 2025. 
In terms of AMI in Connecticut, CLP is preparing to file an updated proposal based on a straw proposal from PURA to have all our customers on AMI by the end of 2025. To date, we'll need to replace more than 800,000 meters over the next -- to do that, we'll have to replace over 800,000 meters over the next several years. Altogether, moving CL&P fully to AMI would involve a capital investment of nearly $500 million we estimate in meters and communication-related technologies. 
In Massachusetts, on Slide 8, as we mentioned on our July earnings call, we've submitted nearly $200 million grid modernization plan to regulators for the 2022 through 2025 period. The vast majority of that investment would be capital. We expect a ruling on the entire program by the second quarter of 2022. Our Massachusetts AMI program is now being evaluated by the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities with a decision expected in 2022. It would involve about $575 million of capital investments over multi-years from 2022 through 2027, and like Connecticut, would provide significant customer service, reliability, energy efficiency, grid modernization and demand management improvements. 
Also, in Massachusetts, the DPU is evaluating an extension of our electric vehicle program. The extension was provided investments of nearly $200 million over the next 4 years, with about $68 million being capital investments. We currently expect a decision on this by mid-2022. 
Turning to Slide 9. We've been receiving regular questions over the past couple of months about the impact of higher natural gas prices on this winter's electric and natural gas supplies and prices. So I'll first start with supplies. First, what do we have for supplies. Our 3 natural gas distribution companies are required to have access to enough natural gas to be able to serve our firm customers on the coldest day in the last 30-year period. So we accomplished that through a combination of firm capacity contracts across multiple interstate pipeline systems and through storage, both inside and outside of our service territory. Our regulators in Connecticut and Massachusetts have had the foresight to allow us to maintain significant in-region LNG storage in Waterbury, Connecticut; in Hopkinton and Acushnet, Massachusetts, as well as various facilities that we purchased as part of the Columbia Gas of Massachusetts transaction. Although these facilities provide us with -- altogether, these facilities provide us with storage connected to our distribution system of nearly 6.5 billion cubic feet. Our regulators have also permitted us to require additional firm delivery capacity that was added to the Algonquin system in recent years through the AIM and Atlantic Bridge expansion projects. 
We've also acquired additional firm capacity on the Tennessee and Portland pipelines. So from a reliability standpoint and supplies, we consider ourselves very well prepared for the winter. 
In terms of price, our natural gas sources include a combination of stored gas where the price has been fixed and pipeline gas from Marcellus Shale Basin that is price based off of NYMEX-related indices. Because our firm pipeline capacity, we are able to purchase at the Marcellus-related price, not at the New England Citygate price. You can see on the slide that we have in our deck that there's significant difference in pricing between the 2. Nonetheless, even the Marcellus price is higher this year. And as of now, we expect the commodity portion of natural gas bills to be approximately 20% higher than last winter's extremely low levels. Due to COVID prices were pretty low last year and well below levels we experienced a decade ago after Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf of Mexico and Louisiana. 
Overall, including the distribution charge we expect natural gas heating bills will be up about 15% on average. That's about $30 a month to the average for a typical heating customer compared to last winter, and that's an average across our 3 natural gas distribution companies. While a 15% increase is significant it is far less than the more than 30% increase that propane heating customers are facing and really a 60% increase that's out there for home heating oil as the alternatives for customers. Of course, a primary determinant of the total bill is usage, right? The autumn has been quite mild here in New England thus far and natural gas usage has been particularly low. 
Nonetheless, a bitterly cold month of December, January could cause natural gas cost to increase. Recognizing the stress that this situation could place on customers. We've been proactive. We've suggested to our regulators that we spread out the recovery of certain charges in our distribution portion of our bill to moderate the potential bill impacts were possible. We're also taking additional proactive steps and working closely with regulators so that customers understand the current price environment and take actions to address it. We're intensifying our communications to be sure customers understand the bigger picture macro factors affecting natural gas bills. And we are urging customers to take advantage of our nationally recognized energy efficiency programs and leverage payment options that we have available. 
So on the electric side, it's a bit different. Natural gas power plants are on the margin in New England year-round, really, except for the coldest days of the year. So rising natural gas prices are significantly affecting power prices. Between 60% and 65% of our electric load is bought by customers directly from third-party suppliers. For the 35% to 40% of our load that continues to buy through our franchises, Connecticut Light & Power, NSTAR Electric and Public Service in New Hampshire, this is mostly residential load and customers will see higher prices, but they are partially protected by the fact that we contract for power in multiple tranches throughout the year. So lower cost tranches from our purchases earlier in 2022 will offset some of the higher priced tranches that we purchased more recently. 
Due to winter time natural gas constraints in New England, our customers normally see $0.015 to $0.02 per kilowatt hour increase in their retail electric prices in January, an increase that usually reverses as we move into the summer. This January customers in Massachusetts and Connecticut elected to experience an additional $0.02 to $0.03 increase due to higher gas prices driving power production. This would be an additional $20, $25 per month for a typical residential customer compared with last winter. 
Our New Hampshire customers, the rates remain in effect until February, so there's really no impact at this stage for our New Hampshire customers. While the vast majority of our residential customers do not use electricity for space heating, we recognize that any increase in energy bills add stress to the household budget. And we've redoubled our efforts again to urge customers to take advantage of the more than $500 million that we have available on energy efficiency initiatives that we provide customers throughout our states each year. I should note that similar to natural gas prices, wholesale electric prices were extremely low in 2020. In fact, they were at a 10-year low. So the percentage increase is -- that we're reporting here comes off some very low base numbers from last year. As a reminder, increases and/or decreases in the energy component of our electric bills, our pass-throughs dollar-for-dollar pass-throughs, we earn nothing on providing the procurement service for customers. 
So thank you very much for joining us this morning. I'll turn the call back over to Jeff for Q&A."

As I mentioned, it's Connecticut Light & Power and NSTAR Electric, Public Service in New Hampshire, the Eversource family has a strong track record for for managing operations in an effective manner, and we'll continue to do that throughout all of our franchises, Connecticut included. So as I mentioned, the last reported quarterly ROE in Connecticut was just under 8.7%. I think it was 8.1% or 8.6%. So even though we're allowed a 9.25% ROE, we've been sort of operating underneath that measure since the settlement in 2018. So I would expect that we'll continue to operate that franchise effectively. I can't really predict at this moment what an ROE might look like there, but I can assure you that we're going to do everything possible to first provide customers with the outstanding service that they deserve and we fully expect to deliver and do that in an efficient and effective way. 
In terms of when we file our next rate case, the ink is just dry on the settlement, and we can't go in, there's nothing that we can implement before 2024.

And as you point out, given the schedule of the projects, we're going to see significant contribution from the bigger projects in that time frame. So the expectation is that as we roll out that next forecast in February, there would be more clarity, more transparency, more information on that segment. So that they'll be able to either model it in a way that you want, in a way that makes sense.

What do we have out there? What do we have in expectation-wise? Certainly, electrification is a category. The states have targets. We have to meet -- we have to enable those targets to be met. So there could be additional transmission in that category. 
And the third category and one that you highlight is sort of connecting distributed energy resources to the grid upgrades that are required to connect, either currently contracted offshore wind or future offshore wind into the service territory. There's a large desire for offshore wind across New England, New York and making sure that we have the connectability or interconnections and the transmission to not be a bottleneck for that, there's likely to be some increased investment needed on the system.

So in terms of incremental storage, we do have programs that we do have in place to refurbish some of our LNG facilities or make sure that they're operating at the maximum capacity. But we haven't looked to expand those facilities. We naturally expanded them just by the acquisition or the purchase of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts almost doubling the storage capacity that we have as an entity. And as Joe mentioned, size matters in this case, too. I mean, it matters in terms of storm response, but it matters in this case, too, because we can operate the by moving those 2 companies together between Star Gas in Massachusetts and Eversource Gas of mass. 
We can use contracts better than each company could have used them individually, and we can use our storage better than either company could. So the natural benefits for us. So that was a point that we made in terms of getting the deal approved at the DPU.

We hope that all on the phone are safe and well, and we look forward to seeing many of you in person next week at the EEI conference. I will cover a few topics this morning and then turn over the call to Phil to discuss our third quarter financial results and our regulatory activity.
First, I want to discuss last week's Northeast, which impacted approximately 525,000 customers across our service territory. Our Eastern Massachusetts customers sustained the greatest damage with more than 450,000 customers impacted. That's over 35% of Eversource's customers in Eastern Massachusetts. This storm was far less damaging in Connecticut, Western Massachusetts and New Hampshire. So as we wrapped up the restoration in those areas, we were able to quickly redeploy resources to the Southeastern Massachusetts, Cape Cod in Martha’s Vineyard, areas that took the brunt of the storm.
Our internal resources were supplemented by hundreds of crews from outside the region, and we were able to essentially complete the work over this past weekend. This experience underscores the benefits of a large T&D organization, one where resources can be shifted based on the greatest need. Last year, it was Connecticut. Last week, it was Massachusetts. Next time it might be in New Hampshire. We have 9,300 dedicated employees, all focused on providing the best possible experience for our customers.
Lessons we learned last year in Connecticut, particularly regarding communication with municipalities have been vigorously applied this year. Our customers and community leaders have certainly noticed our enhancements, and we have received many positive comments on our storm response. Customers are noting that not all the best alignment in New England work for the New England Patriots. When storms have threatened us and recall that we have had glancing blows from 3 tropical storms this summer in last week's events that I described at the beginning of my comments, I have been at the center of the action from before the storm hits into the lost of our customers has power restored.
I believe that's critical for us to be out front, visible, transparent and collaborative during these major events, something that has been difficult to do as we all work in a remote pandemic restricted environment for the last 18 months.
Next, I want to discuss our Connecticut rate settlement. To start, I want to thank the parties from deep, the Connecticut attorney general's office, the office of Consumer Counsel and the state's industrial consumers for billing being willing to sit down and work out a settlement that will yield meaningful and immediate bill credits to customers and strengthen the Connecticut focus in control at Connecticut Light and Power.
In News reports, Governor Lamont, Attorney General William Tong and state leaders were quoted as saying that the settlement provides customers with some well-deserved relief in the short term, greater local control and oversight and an improved customer experience. We agree. I also want to thank PURA for approving the settlement agreement last Wednesday. Phil will discuss settlement specifics in a moment, but we are very grateful to PURA for the opportunity to move forward on a positive note.
Settling critical regulatory and legal disputes was a necessity to reset our relationship with key Connecticut stakeholders. We all want the state to move ahead on addressing critical energy and climate issues. And the outstanding disputes have the potential to delay some of this important work.
Since becoming CEO this past spring, my top priority has been to strengthen our relationship Ins' Connecticut. I've met regularly with key state policymakers as well as business leaders and customers, underscoring our commitment to the state with the largest number of Eversource employees live and work. This will continue to be a strong focus for me going forward. Eversource is fully committed to providing each and every one of our 4.3 million electric, natural gas and water customers across New England with exceptional service.
With Connecticut temporary rate docket now behind us, we can move on to other important topics, where progress has been hindered by the drain in time and resources devoted to strong ESA ES and the interim rate reduction, supporting the build-out of electric vehicle infrastructure, incenting the construction of customer-owned energy storage, installing AMI. That is the clean energy future, and we will work together with our customers in policymakers to get there.
Changing topics. I'm going to cover some very positive developments in recent months concerning our offshore wind partnership with Ørsted. You can see the status of our current projects on Slide 3. Each has advanced since our last earnings call. To start, our smaller projects, South Fork, has received its final environmental impact statement, and we expect a record of decision to be posted later this month. BOEM's project website anticipates a decision on South Fork's construction and operating permit or COP in January of 2022, and we anticipate construction beginning early next year. We continue to expect commercial operation of the 12 turbines, 130-megawatt project by the end of 2023. In August, we announced that Kiewit will commence construction of the project substation this month in Texas, and that we expect it to be installed in the summer of 2023.
Moving to the 704-megawatt Revolution Wind project that will deliver clean power to Connecticut and Rhode Island. BOEM continues to anticipate a COP decision in July of 2023, which would support a 2025 in-service date. State siting hearings have commenced. Finally, our largest project, Sunrise Wind, which will supply 924 megawatts to New York. We are looking for federal agencies to complete their final reviews in late 2023, a schedule that would support a late 2025 in-service date.
Last week, we announced that Sunrise will be the first offshore wind project in the United States that will utilize high-voltage direct current technology. HVDC offers advantages over AC technology when used over long distances. In Sunrise, we'll have an approximately 100-mile submarine transmission cable from offshore energy production area to the grid connection in Brookhaven, Long island, New York. We continue to project mid-teens equity returns for these 3 projects.
The Biden administration continues to show significant support for offshore wind in both words and actions, targeting 30,000 megawatts of offshore turbines by 2030. We view our partnerships to ocean tracks off of Massachusetts as the best offshore wind sites on the Atlantic seaboard. Our leases are in close proximity to both the New England and New York markets. They enjoy strong offshore winds, particularly in the winter, and they have modest ocean depths. They can hold at least 4,000 megawatts of offshore wind turbines, far more than the approximately 760 megawatts we currently have under contract.
We continue to exercise strong fiscal discipline in using the remaining offshore acreage that we have leased  from the federal government. We did not bid into Massachusetts September RFP for up to 1,600 megawatts of offshore wind. Current Massachusetts bidding rules discourage imaginative bid packages, Governor Baker and some Massachusetts policymakers are now recognizing that Massachusetts is not benefiting from the same level of economic development as states that place greater emphasis on infrastructure and supply chain development. As such, the governor recently filed legislation that would eliminate the state's current price cap.
In Rhode Island, we are constructing a service vessel in the state. In Connecticut, we are partnering with the state on more than $200 million upgrade of the New London State Pier. The Pier will become the premier site in the entire Northeast for staging offshore wind development. Onshore construction is underway, which you can see from either I-95 or Amtrak's nearby Boston to New York line.
In New York, I joined members of the Governor Hochul's administration last month and announcing the largest single offshore wind supply chain contract award in New York to support the Sunrise project. The local company, Riggs Distler, will construct advanced foundation components at the port on the Hudson near Albany. It is just the latest commitment we have made to New York, which also includes basing an offshore wind maintenance hub in Port Jefferson. We have an excellent relationship with New York policymakers, and that is where most of our currently contracted offshore wind capacity is headed. We look forward to bidding into future RFPs, with our strong mix of sites, skill sets, discipline bidding strategies and offsets vast offshore wind experience will make us a formidable contender in any competition that takes a broad look at the benefits of shore winds.
Now I will turn the call over to Phil."

This morning I'll cover a few topics on third quatre results details about the Connecticut sell in, an update on grid monetization, electric vehicle initiatives and to look at natural gas outlook for the coming winter.I'll start with our",2499,"Thank you, Joe. This morning I'll cover a few topics on third quatre results details about the Connecticut sell in, an update on grid monetization, electric vehicle initiatives and to look at natural gas outlook for the coming winter.
I'll start with our results for the quarter Slide 4. Our GAAP earnings were $0.82 per share for the quarter, including the $0.19 charge associated with the Connecticut electric rate settlement and the $0.01 charge relating to our integration of Eversource gas of Massachusetts. Overall, we experienced improved operating results at the electric transmission and distribution segments and lower results at the natural gas and water segments as well as the parents and other.
Our electric transmission business earned $0.40 per share in the third quarter of 2021 compared with earnings of $0.36 in the third quarter of last year, reflecting a higher level of necessary investment in our transmission facilities. Our electric distribution business, excluding charges related to the Connecticut rate settlement, earned $0.62 per share in the third quarter of 2021 compared with earnings of $0.60 in the third quarter of 2020.
Higher distribution revenues were partially offset by higher O&M, depreciation, interest and property taxes. Storm-related expenses remain a headwind for us, costing us $0.01 a share in the third quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 and a total of $0.05 a share more in 2021 than last year on a year-to-date basis.
Our natural gas distribution business lost $0.06 per share in the third quarter of 2021 compared with a loss of $0.04 in the third quarter of 2020. Given the seasonal nature of customer usage, natural gas utilities tend to record losses over the summer months, our natural gas segment now -- our natural gas segment loss is now about 50% larger as a result of the acquisition of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts assets back in last October. And as you recall, we now refer to that franchises as Eversource Gas of Massachusetts. So Eversource Gas of Massachusetts lost about $0.03 per share in the quarter. It had no comparable amount in the third quarter of 2020.
I think it's important to point out here that given this is the first full year for our Eversource Gas of Massachusetts or EGMA franchise, modeling its quarterly earnings contribution has varied widely across street estimates, at least the ones that I've seen.
Just to some investors underestimated the $0.14 per share positive contribution from EGMA in the first quarter. I believe there may have been some underestimate of EGMA losses in the third quarter. As I said, EGMA lost $0.03 in the quarter, and it was not part of the Eversource family in the third quarter of 2020. I'd say going forward with a year's track record behind us, I'm sure that the estimates will better reflect the earnings pattern we have for that franchise going forward.
Our water distribution business, Aquarion, earned $0.05 per share in the third quarter of 2021 compared with earnings of $0.07 in the third quarter of 2020. The lower results were due primarily to the absence of the Hingham, Massachusetts water system that we sold at the end of July of 2020. The $17.5 million that we earned at our water segment in the third quarter of 2021 is more on -- a more normalized level for that segment.
Our parent and other earned $0.01 per share in the third quarter of 2021 compared with earnings of $0.03 in the third quarter of 2020. Lower earnings were primarily due to a higher effective tax rate. Our consolidated rate was 24.8% in the third quarter of 2021 compared with 23.7% in the third quarter of 2020.
Turning to Slide 5. You can see that we have reiterated the $3.81 to $3.93 EPS guidance that we issued in February. That range excludes the $0.25 per share of charges related to our Connecticut settlement and storm-related bill credits that we recognized in the first quarter of this year as well as the transition costs related to the integration of the former Columbia Gas of Massachusetts assets into the Eversource system.
Also, we project long-term EPS growth in the upper half of the range of 5% to 7% through 2025. Excluding the impact of the positive impact that we expect from our offshore wind projects. That growth is largely driven by our $17 billion 5-year capital program and continued strong operational effectiveness throughout the business. For reference, our 5-year capital forecast is shown in the appendix. And through September 30, our capital expenditures totaled $2.3 billion.
From the financial results, I'll turn to our recently approved Connecticut settlement on Slide #6. Earlier, Joe provided you with an overview. I'll just add a few additional details. The settlement calls for $65 million in rate credits to CL&P customers over the course of December of 2021 in January of 2022. And that's about -- in total, $35 per customer over the 2 months for the typical residential customer. It provides another $10 million of shareholder pay benefits to customers who are most in need of help with their energy bills. Further, as part of the settlement, we will withdraw our superior court appeal of the $28.4 million total storm-related credits that customers first saw in their bills in September of '21. So these customers will continue. They'll continue to flow back to customers through August of next year.
As prior of the settlement, the 90 basis point indefinite reduction of CL&P's distribution ROE will not be implemented. Additionally, the current 9.25% ROE and capital structure will remain in effect. This will avoid an appeal of the interim rate reduction and will withdraw the pending appeal of the 90 basis point reduction.
CL&P cannot implement new base distribution rates before January 1, 2024. Priorities to the settlement agreed that this review satisfies the statutory requirement in Connecticut that all-electric and natural gas distribution company rates be reviewed once every 4 years. That's to determine whether they're just unreasonable. So as a result, the next statutory mandated review would be in late 2025. Since CL&P's last distribution rate case was effective in May of '18, the actual -- the company's actual ROEs have generally ranged between 8.6% and 9%, with the latest reported quarter at 8.6%.
There are some tracking mechanisms that will allow us to recover costs associated with certain new investments over the coming years, such as those to improve reliability or implement grid modernization initiatives, but we will not be able to obtain any additional revenues to offset higher wages, employee benefits costs, property taxes and other inflationary items. We'll continue to provide superior service to our nearly 1.3 million CL&P customers will also be effectively managing our operations.
It will certainly be a challenge, but one, I know that our entire CL&P and Eversource team is up to meeting. From the Connecticut settlement, I'll turn to our various grid mod, AMI, electric vehicle initiatives in Connecticut and Massachusetts. So first, I'll turn to Slide 7 and cover the Connecticut programs.
On October 15, CL&P filed a final electric vehicle program designed documents for PURA review and approval, including a proposed budget and program implementation plan for residential managed charging. PURA will conduct a review process with a final decision targeted for December the 8. The program is planned to launch January 1 of 2022, and will support the state's target of having at least 125,000 electric vehicles on the road by the end of 2025.
In terms of AMI, in Connecticut, CL&P is preparing to file an updated proposal based on a straw proposal from Pier to have all our customers on AMI by the end of 2025.
To date, we'll need to replace more than 800,000 meters over the next -- to do that, we'll have to replace over 800,000 meters over the next several years. Altogether, moving CL&P fully to AMI would involve a capital investment of nearly $500 million we estimate in meters and communication related technologies.
In Massachusetts on Slide 8, as we mentioned on our July earnings call. We've submitted nearly $200 million grid modernization plan to regulators for the 2022 through 2025 period. The vast majority of that investment would be capital. We expect a ruling on the entire program by the second quarter of 2022.
Our Massachusetts AMI program is now being evaluated by the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities, with a decision expected in 2022. It would involve about $575 million of capital investments over multi-years from 2022 through 2027. And like Connecticut, would provide significant customer service, reliability, energy efficiency, grid modernization and demand management improvements.
Also in Massachusetts, the DPU is evaluating an extension of our electric vehicle program. The extension would provide investments of nearly $200 million over the next 4 years, with about $68 million being capital investments. We currently expect a decision on this by mid-2022.
Turning to Slide 9. We've been receiving regular questions over the past couple of months about the impact of higher natural gas prices on this winter's electric and natural gas supplies and prices. So I'll first start with supplies. First, what do we have to supply? Our 3 natural gas distribution companies are required to have access to enough natural gas to be able to serve our firm customers on the coldest day in the last 30-year period. So we accomplished that through a combination of firm capacity contracts across multiple interstate pipeline systems and through storage, both inside and outside of our service territory.
Our regulators in Connecticut and Massachusetts have had the foresight to allow us to maintain significant in region LNG storage in Waterbury, Connecticut. And Hopkinton and Acushnet, Massachusetts as well as various facilities that we purchased as part of the Columbia gas of Massachusetts transaction.
Although, these facilities provide us with -- altogether, these facilities provide us with storage connected to our distribution system of nearly 6.5 billion cubic feet. Our regulators have also permitted us to acquire additional firm delivery capacity that was added to the Algonquin system in recent years through the AIM and Atlantic Bridge expansion projects. We've also acquired additional firm capacity on the Tennessee and Portland pipelines. So from a reliability standpoint and supplies, we consider ourselves very well prepared for the winter.
In terms of price, our natural gas sources include a combination of stored gas, where the price has been fixed and pipeline gas from Marcellus Shale basin that is price based off of NYMEX related indices. Because our firm pipeline capacity, we are able to purchase at the Marcellus related price, not at the New England Citygate price. You can see on the slide that we have in our deck, that there's significant difference in pricing between the 2.
Nonetheless, even the Marcellus price is higher this year. And as of now, we expect the commodity portion of natural gas bills to be approximately 20% higher than last winter's extremely low levels due to COVID, prices were pretty low last year and well below levels we experienced a decade ago after Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf of Mexico and Louisiana.
Overall, including the distribution charge, we expect natural gas heating bills will be up about 15% on average. That's about $30 a month to the average for a typical heating customer compared to last winter. And that's an average across our 3 natural gas distribution companies. While a 15% increase is significant it is far less than the -- more than 30% increase that propane heating customers are facing and really a 60% increase that's out there for home heating oil as the alternatives for customers.
Of course, a primary determinant of the total bill is usage, right? The autumn has been quite mild here in New England, thus far, and natural gas usage has been particularly low. Nonetheless, a bitly cold month of December or January could cause natural gas cost to increase. Recognizing the stress that this situation could place on customers. We've been proactive. We've suggested to our regulators that we spread out the recovery of certain charges in our distribution portion of our bill to moderate the potential bill impacts where possible. We're also taking additional proactive steps and working closely with regulators so that customers understand the current price environment and take actions to address it. We're intensifying our communications to be sure customers understand the bigger picture macro factors affecting natural gas bills. And we are urging customers to take advantage of our nationally recognized energy efficiency programs and leverage payment options that we have available.
So on the electric side, it's a bit different. Natural gas power plants are on the margin in New England year-round, really, except for the coldest days of the year. So rising natural gas prices are significantly affecting power prices. Between 60% and 65% of our electric load is bought by customers directly from third-party suppliers. For the 35% to 40% of our load that continues to buy through our franchises, Connecticut Light & Power, NSTAR Electric and Public Service in New Hampshire, this is mostly residential load and customers will see higher prices, but they are partially protected by the fact that we contract for power in multiple tranches throughout the year. So lower cost tranches from our purchases earlier in 2022 will offset some of the higher priced tranches that we purchased more recently.
Due to wintertime natural gas constraints in New England, our customers normally see $0.015 to $0.02 per kilowatt hour increase in their retail electric prices in January, an increase that usually reverses as we move into the summer. This January customers in Massachusetts and Connecticut elected to experience an additional $0.02 to $0.03 increase due to higher gas prices driving power production. This would be an additional $20, $25 per month for a typical residential customer compared with last winter.
Our New Hampshire customers, the rates remain in effect until February, so there's really no impact at this stage for our New Hampshire customers. While the vast majority of our residential customers do not use electricity for space heating, we recognize that any increase in energy bills add stress to the household budget. And we've redoubled our efforts again to urge customers to take advantage of the more than $500 million that we have available on energy efficiency initiatives that we provide customers throughout our states each year.
I should note that similar to natural gas prices, wholesale electric prices were extremely low in 2020. In fact, they were at a 10-year low. So the percentage increase is -- that we're reporting here comes off some very low base numbers from last year. As a reminder, increases and/or decreases in the energy component of our electric bills, our pass-throughs dollar-for-dollar pass-throughs, we earn nothing on providing the procurement service for customers.
So thank you very much for joining us this morning. I'll turn the call back over to Jeff for Q&A."

As I mentioned, it's Connecticut Light & Power and NSTAR Electric, Public Service in New Hampshire, the Eversource family has a strong track record for managing operations in an effective manner, and we'll continue to do that throughout all of our franchises, Connecticut included. So as I mentioned, the last reported quarterly ROE in Connecticut was just under 8.7%. I think it was 8.1% or 8.6%.
So even though we're allowed a 9.25% ROE, we've been sort of operating underneath that measure since the settlement in 2018. So I would expect that we'll continue to operate that franchise effectively. I can't really predict at this moment what an ROE might look like there, but I can assure you that we're going to do everything possible to first provide customers with the outstanding service that they deserve, and we fully expect to deliver and do that in an efficient and effective way.
In terms of when we file our next rate case, the ink is just dry on the settlement, and we can't go in, there's nothing that we can implement before 2024. And as I said, with the 4-year sort of legislative requirement, we wouldn't mandate it to be in there until 2025. So we haven't really thought about that at this point. We're thinking about how we operate our franchises and effective manner for customers."

And as you point out, given the schedule of the projects, we're going to see significant contribution from the bigger projects in that time frame. So the expectation is that as we roll out that next forecast in February, there would be more clarity, more transparency, more information on that segment. So that they'll be able to either model it in a way that you want, in a way that makes sense.

And that was a big, big step, I think, for offshore wind opportunities we're seeing for offshore wind RFPs and in 2022, looking at New York, potential in Connecticut as well as in Rhode Island and Massachusetts.
So I think there's opportunities everywhere. I think the first one you'll see will be New York. They are very, very aggressive with their targets, and that's a place that we know will put out another big RFP."

So as I've talked about before, there are puts and takes for all these projects. So some costs maybe move in one direction and other things are moving in a different direction.
So taking all that, if there are price changes or if there are schedule impacts, all of that allows us to be confident in the schedules that we've put out to date and in our estimate and our expectations that these projects will earn in the mid-teens in terms of ROE.

What do we have out there? What do we have in expectation-wise? Certainly, electrification is a category. The states have targets. We have to meet -- we have to enable those targets to be met. So there could be additional transmission in that category.
And the third category and one that you highlight is sort of connecting distributed energy resources to the grid upgrades that are required to connect, either currently contracted offshore wind or future offshore wind into the service territory. There's a large desire for offshore wind across New England, New York and making sure that we have the connectability or interconnections and the transmission to not be a bottleneck for that, there's likely to be some increased investment needed on the system.

If you look at what we have in storage and what's fixed, I'd say it's about 1/3 of that supply. And as I mentioned, the remaining part of the supply, we have the capability. We have the pipeline contracts to obtain it, and we",257,"Yes, I'd say about 1/3 of it. If you look at what we have in storage and what's fixed, I'd say it's about 1/3 of that supply. And as I mentioned, the remaining part of the supply, we have the capability. We have the pipeline contracts to obtain it, and we have the capability of obtaining it from a lower-priced region than a Citygate pricing. So in terms of incremental storage, we do have programs that we do have in place to refurbish some of our LNG facilities or make sure that they're operating at the maximum capacity. But we haven't looked to expand those facilities. We naturally expanded them just by the acquisition or the purchase of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts almost doubling the storage capacity that we have as an entity.
And as Joe mentioned, size matters in this case, too. I mean, it matters in terms of storm response, but it matters in this case, too, because we can operate the by moving those 2 companies together between NSTAR Gas in Massachusetts and Eversource Gas of mass. We can use contracts better than each company could have used them individually, and we can use our storage better than either company could. So this is the natural benefits for us. So that was a point that we made in terms of getting the deal approved at the DPU. So I guess that is a way of saying we've increased the ability to have storage, but we're not looking to build anything extra at this point."
