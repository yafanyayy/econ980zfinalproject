As you know, health safety and security of our employees remain our #1 priority. And consistent with our desire to keep our people safe, we continue to have 10,000 people working remotely, maintaining the safety measures that we put in place nearly 1 year ago. 
Let me give you a brief update on our COVID status. Today, we have 78 colleagues who are infected with COVID-19, about 40% down versus last month and 88 employees in quarantine and wish them all a prompt recovery. And while I'm on the subject of safety, I am pleased to share that we concluded 2020 with no fatalities and no irreversible injuries. This marks 3 consecutive years without a fatality, something extremely important to us. 
Moving to the full year results. The crisis presented some challenging headwinds this past year. Yet our portfolio was fairly resilient, with sales down by 10% on an organic basis for the full year. If you exclude our most challenged markets of civil aerospace and oil and gas, sales were down by 5% for the year, thanks to resilient markets, including health care, Home & Personal Care, Consumer Goods and Agro. 
We provided a view of our key markets and recent trends on Slide 4. And Karim will share more color when he reviews business performance. In the fourth quarter, sales improved in a number of key markets, driven by strong demand in auto and electronics, driving group sales up by 5% sequentially versus the third quarter. Regionally, fourth quarter sales in China were up by 5% while Europe was down by 2% and the U.S. down by 10% year-on-year. I'm truly proud of our teams because they stayed the course in the face of the challenging macro and maintained an relenting focus on the areas within our control, including costs, cash and of course, our customers. In each of these areas, we can recognize great results today. On cost, we delivered EUR 330 million of savings in 2020. Of this amount, EUR 175 million were structural savings, of which EUR 156 million are fixed costs. That's more than half of the original midterm commitments we made weeks before the crisis began. You may remember 15 short months ago, we committed to EUR 300 million cost reduction. We raised debt to EUR 410 million in mid-2020, and today's announcement of an additional restructuring plan impacting a further 500 functional support rolls takes the new cumulative commitments to EUR 500 million by 2024. The decisive cost action we delivered in 2020, together with pricing power allowed us to contain the EBITDA decline to [indiscernible] in 2020. Though more importantly, we achieved a 22% EBITDA margin. Our cash delivery is equally noteworthy. We laid the groundwork for this back in 2019 with the new incentive structure, clear programs and a disciplined process and we use the crisis to accelerate our delivery. If you would have asked me a year ago, if you were capable of delivering almost EUR 1 billion in cash in 2020, I would not have thought it was possible, but the Solvay team did it. And I'd like to congratulate all of our employees for these record achievements at such a critical time. 
Moving to Slide 6. We continue to win with our customers by developing new innovations that address their challenges and unmet needs. Much of this work is directly aligned to our sustainability efforts, and we are very proud of our success with many key partners. I'd like for the sake of time to highlight just a few of them today. 
First, together with Bridgestone, a key customer of our Silica business and together with [indiscernible], we co-developed a new tire platform called Texin which has 30% better wear efficiency and reduces rolling resistance by 6%. This not only reduces CO2 emissions, but also extends the life of tires. We are very proud of this partnership and innovation developed in only 24 months around half the typical innovation cycle of 3 to 5 years. The second customer news I'll highlight comes from Henkel. A key customer of [indiscernible] care, Home & Personal Care business, who launched new products based on 2 of Solvay's recent innovations. You may remember, Actizone, our brand-new hygiene and cleaning technology, which we launched this year or 2020, that protect surfaces against viruses, including COVID-19 and is unique as it lasts for 24 hours. Another one, Rhodasurf makes our new bio-based surfactants, which is 100% renewable and part of a newly launched liquid laundry detergents by Henkel. It brings them a sustainable innovation which reduces CO2 emissions by 20%. And the last one, I'll highlight the new partnership with Vertical Aerospace, which you may have seen in the news where we are developing composite structures for air taxis. They will be electrically powered. Therefore, there is 0 emissions and will have its first test flights later this year. This is really cool to be at the front line of innovation. Our innovation pipeline is becoming more aligned with our growth strategic trends, including light weighting, electrification, bio friendly chemicals and resources efficiency. To be clear, this will not only support the planet, but also the bottom line. And these sustainable driven innovations are what customers are asking for and what will create value for both Solvay and our customers, which brings me to the One Planet program which is an integral part of our strategy launched 1 year ago. And here, in only our first full year of a 10-year plan, we have also made very good progress in 2020 despite facing an unprecedented crisis. 
I'd like to highlight a few points in reference to Slide 7. Our sustainability metrics are embedded into our operational and strategic decision-making and progress impacts 10% of our short-term incentive for the group. You may have heard me saying you impact behaviors when you impact the pockets, it's about walking the talk and being coherent. As you have seen, we have highlighted our progress against 10 metrics. While progress is broad and deep, in the interest of time, I will only cover our carbon emissions. Reducing our carbon emissions is a top priority for Solvay. And if you may remember, we joined the Paris agreement in February 2020. In October 2020, you may remember that we have committed to set science-based targets or scope 3, and have begun working with customers and engage already with more than 500 suppliers in quarter 4 2020. You can see that we have progressed by 20% in 2020 versus our baseline 2018. About 60% of the improvement results from the reduction in activity levels due to COVID and 40% is structural and reflects the impact of our projects. We launched 27 emission reduction projects since 2018 baseline, delivering on them represents an annual reduction of 1.8 million tons of CO2 per annum and to give you an idea, this is the equivalent of taking 1 million cars off the road. 18 of these projects were already operational in 2020, and the remaining 9 projects will be implemented within the next 3 years. 
We have included a map of the projects on Slide 8, to give you an idea of the magnitude of our scope. And I'm pleased to confirm that the COVID crisis did not derail us nor de-track us from our commitment to One Planet. In fact, we came a long way. Also at the risk of stating the obvious, I also wish to emphasize that our investments generate adequate economic returns whilst also derisking the operations in a strategic sense. Going forward, we continue to advocate for uniformed global corporate reporting standards with respect to ESG matters. This year, we are taking 2 additional steps. Our 2020 annual integrated report to be published on April 1. We not only continue to align with the global reporting initiative, or GRI, but also will map to the relevant SaaS B metrics as part of our 2020 annual report. And we will not stop there. We piloted and signed on as part of 67 companies globally and agreed to disclose new elements consistent with the World Economic forum, or IBC nonfinancial disclosures. And I invite you to take the time to review these in due course. 
And now Karim will review in more detail the group's segments and financial performance. Karim?"

I'll start with an overview of the 3 business segments, and I'll refer to figures as usual on an organic basis, by which I mean constant scope, constant currency. 
Starting with materials that you see on Slide #9. The facts are that net sales in the fourth quarter increased by 2.3% versus the third quarter of this year, driven by strong demand in the automotive industry. Specialty Polymers year-on-year sales turned positive for the first time since the start of the crisis. And sequentially, they improved by 8% against the third quarter. Strong demand from the auto sector drove that improvement. And this sector, you remember, represents 14%, 1-4 percent of group sales. Our polymer sales into the broader auto market in 2020 were down 9% for the year, outpacing -- outperforming the general market decline of around 16%. In particular, sales into EV batteries increased by 50% in the fourth quarter 2020 compared to the prior year, and we expect demand to remain strong given the latest industry projections for electric vehicles. In fact, we have invested in a PVDF line in Tavaux in France, and full production is already on stream as of Jan this year, 2021. We also have another new line coming on stream in China in the first quarter of 2022. Together, this will more than double our capacity and will help us to meet significant demand growth in batteries. Solvay's polymer sales also outperformed other major markets, including health care and small devices. Sales of peek, PEEK, specifically, have remained resilient during the crisis with [ full year ] sales up 4.4%. Full year sales across all markets up by double digits, thanks to further penetration of polymers and some share gain. In short, you can see that we continue to outgrow markets in a few instances. You probably won't be surprised that sales of Composites in the fourth quarter dropped 10% versus the third quarter as we reached the low point in civil aircraft demand, whereas sales into the defense sector continued to grow, and in fact, are up by double digits versus the fourth quarter of 2019. Sales into civil aero represents 5% of group sales in 2020. This is clearly down on the prior year. The business is on track with the closure of its second facility, part of its ongoing manufacturing footprint strategy. I'm pleased to share the news that the annual run rate of cost savings related to these actions will reach EUR 70 million as of 2021 this year, EUR 10 million higher than originally anticipated. Also, the Composites business is taking yet another step to deepen to accelerate this manufacturing efficiency and to improve returns further and alignment with our customers, and it recently announced plans to close a third site in the U.S. in Orange County, California, which will happen in the second quarter of 2022. These closures will concentrate production on fewer, more efficient assets, and it will help us to improve service levels to our customers whilst increasing productivity. 
Wrapping up Materials. Segment EBITDA in the fourth quarter was down 11.4% organically, and 18.7% for the year, with full year EBITDA margins at 26.4%, thanks to sustained pricing and robust cost reduction actions. This achievement reflects timely, it reflects decisive corrective actions in the face of unprecedented decline in civil aero volumes in 2020. 
Turning to the Chemical segment on Slide 10. Fourth quarter sales were flat versus Q4 2019 as demand improved in every business. Sales in soda ash, which represents 16%, 1-6 percent of group sales and about half the segment increased by 2.7% sequentially against the third quarter of 2020 as demand for flat glass using construction increased, whereas demand for container glass used in the hospitality sector remained weak. Soda ash contracts for the 2021 period have concluded and you have likely seen publicly available data, such as IHS which gives you a good proxy of what to expect for the industry. Against that backdrop, you can assume that Solvay will again seek to outperform by effectively executing against the cost reduction program, building on our historic track record, which actually speaks for itself. Our focus will remain on cash generation on maintaining our leading market position as well as driving our energy transition plan. 
Turning to peroxides. Sales are up 4% in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, [ ripping ] demand improvement for HPPO, mainly driven by strong polyol market-based on consumer goods, construction and an improving auto sector. Sales in Silica increased sequentially by 11%, showing the robust auto market demand, where our technology is used in high-efficiency tires. The business outperformed the broader market, thanks again to innovation and to our global footprint as well as to our strengthened position with our key strategic customers. [ Quarter ] sales increased by 11%, with a strong rebound in the fourth quarter in Latin America and in particular, reflecting growing demand for our innovative [indiscernible], by degradable and renewable material. In the past 2 years, the business has optimized its costs and has focused on sustainable technologies. In fact, we've just doubled production capacity less than 2 years after the product launch, thanks to one thing, strong customer demand. Overall, the Chemicals segment EBITDA rose sequentially by 4.3% in the fourth quarter as a result of the stepped-up demand that I've described across all those businesses. Full year EBITDA was, however, down 9.4% and margins were held at 27.7%, reflecting pricing and the cost initiatives that helped to offset some of the volume declines. 
Turning to Solutions segment on Slide 11. Fourth quarter sales showed significant sequential improvement against Q3, up 7.6%, driven by strong demand again in auto, electronics, which represents 1-4, 14% and 7% of group sales, respectively. 
Starting with Novecare. Q4 sales were up modestly in Home & Personal Care, Coatings and Agro markets, and they were up double digits year-on-year. Speaking of Agro, the business, which represents about 13% of group sales. We recently just completed an agreement to purchase a seed coating product line, which is a small bolt-on acquisition with revenues of about EUR 30 million. This acquisition represents a natural extension to our bio-based agro solutions within the Novecare business. And it will enable us to generate compelling innovation synergies. The Special Chem business had an excellent fourth quarter with sequential sales growth of 19% versus Q3, driven by the rebound in auto, together with share gain in China as well as strong demand in electronics. In Technology Solutions, Q4 sales increased 6% sequentially as the mining industry, which represents 4% of group sales is beginning to recover, driven by the demand for copper and further supported by price. Yet having said that, some key mining customers remain impacted by COVID and are not yet fully operational as I speak today. In Aroma, performance was slightly down versus Q3, following significant volume increases, maintaining the strong momentum over the first 9 months. Given the exceptionally strong cast of demand for our natural vanillin from the food and flavor industry, the Aroma business has decided to expand this production of natural vanillin. In fact, we're doubling capacity for the second time since 2017, the additional capacity will become operational by the end of 2021. And by the way, this is a prime example of what is referred to as circular economy. Solvay's natural product is derived from rice brand oil and this is used to produce natural vanillin. Overall, the Solutions segment EBITDA was down 2.8% versus Q4 2019 and 11.8% for the full year. With EBITDA margins relatively stable at 17.1%, reflecting disciplined cost management. It further demonstrates the resilience of this segment despite the major headwinds in oil and gas that we've seen throughout 2020, and it also shows the growth that is being achieved, thanks to our innovation. 
Moving to costs, which I'm detailing, which we detail on Slide #12. You can see that we have made significant progress against our targets in 2020. And we have delivered EUR 332 million in savings for the year, which more than offset inflation of EUR 75 million. Temporary cost savings totaled EUR 157 million in 2020, and these will not repeat in 2021. Our structural savings were EUR 175 million, of which EUR 156 million are fixed costs, EUR 19 million variable costs. Those cost savings fall into the 3 categories that hopefully you're familiar with: one, restructuring. This is the largest contributor and essentially comprises labor cost reductions, representing about EUR 90 million or half -- about half the structural savings that we've delivered. Indirect spend represents about 35% of the savings, around EUR 60 million, involves many, many actions and initiatives. Too many examples to site. But for example, we use recycled containers, we've standardized packaging across a number of our businesses, and the drive continues. And of course, we continue to drive productivity efficiencies including yield improvements in several businesses, such as in Specialty Polymers, in soda ash, in Novecare. And that represents about 15% of the structural savings at around EUR 25 million. The strength of this delivery actually brings to life the notion that there is no such thing as fixed costs. That indeed all costs can be variabilized. And the only legitimate question we ask ourselves is how fast will it take to variabilize costs? That's how we tackle them. 
I will now turn my review to how the group's performance has evolved overall. And by way of general context, look at our portfolio, it has delivered value during the crisis. And I say that because 60%, 6-0, of our portfolio proved resilience and are reflecting here markets such as health care, Home & Personal Care, Consumer Goods, food, Agro. About 25% of the portfolio is related to markets where we see a progressive recovery underway. And by that, I include auto and mining. The remaining 15% will take a bit longer. We talk markets such as aero and oil and gas. Based on current economic forecasts, we currently expect our portfolio to be back to 2019 levels in 2022. 
I now invite you to turn to Slide 13. By way of context, many of you told us that you really valued the previous EBITDA bridges that show the evolution of volumes, costs. And you asked us to reconsider putting them back in to reinstate them. Now even though very few companies actually do that, we listen to you and we have decided to bring back those EBITDA bridges as a supplement on an annual basis. What you can see from this view is how it all comes together. Volumes were down EUR 568 million, in large part due to [indiscernible], oil and gas and about half a year of reduced demand in auto. Net pricing up EUR 50 million, in many ways, reflecting the premium value-added nature of many of our technologies in the market. Total cost savings, EUR 175 million structural, EUR 157 million temporary, less EUR 32 million in relation to other factors, many other factors, such as destocking impacts, less, of course, inflation of EUR 71 million for a net positive effect in 2020 of EUR 228 million. This performance evidences both the quality of our portfolio, and the strength of our delivery in 2020, notwithstanding the very significant volume headwinds. 
I'll turn now to Slide 14 and talk about cash. EUR 161 million is the cash we generated in the fourth quarter, bringing the total for the year to a record EUR 963 million. That's about 60% more than 2019 and the improvement in performance can be summarized as follows: first, we took the size of steps, as you know, as you've seen, as the crisis unfolded to adapt our investments to accelerate and deepen our cost reductions. And to strengthen our working capital discipline. So to start off with, our cost mitigation contained the EBITDA drop to EUR 377 million, although this drop was more than offset by lower cash taxes of EUR 144 million, by reduced working capital of EUR 190 million and by lower CapEx of EUR 215 million. Against that, we also invested EUR 31 million more into restructuring charges in 2020 relative to 2019 to reach a total of EUR 90 million, 9-0. That's more than you've seen historically. You will also recall us saying that we've been optimizing our debt and working to deleverage our pensions in the last 2 years. Indeed, we've deployed EUR 0.6 billion of funds towards our pension schemes. And we actually plan to do a further EUR 0.2 billion in the next 12 to 24 months. We indicated to you that these steps help to both derisk our balance sheet and to improve our cash flow. And the fact before you today actually demonstrate that. In 2020, our pension cash service costs were EUR 77 million lower than in 2019. Our financial charges were EUR 27 million lower than in 2019 and the good news is that we will have further reductions to look forward to in 2021. That said, and with that detracting in any way from the strength of that cash flow delivery, we also indicated during the year that we had a number of non-repeat onetime items. In that context, we have around EUR 140 million of structural improvements in relation to working capital. And in Q4, we were surprised that a few customers even prepared invoices to us to the tune of EUR 40 million. Now this will obviously reverse in 2021. And you'll recall, we had around EUR 80 million in relation to taxes early in 2020. These onetime elements come to EUR 260 million. 
Now as you look ahead to 2021, it's important to also take into account that foreign exchange developments the anticipated completion of divestments that are currently in the pipeline will also account for a further EUR 50 million in cash that won't be with us in 2021 as we monetize the value of these businesses. 
What does that mean? It means that as you look at 2021 cash flow, what is I would love to be able to tell you that the EUR 963 million is sustainable. The reality is that we're going to have to be patient for that because the normalized reference free cash flow for 2020 is near to EUR 650 million because of the reasons I've explained. This is what I've suggested is the relevant level against which to consider free cash flow going forward into 2021. 
And with that, I'll hand you back to Ilham to review our outlook and some closing remarks."

We began 2020 closing the sales of the Polyamide business, if you may remember end of January 2020. Since then, we began taking steps to prune our portfolio. And to date, we have signed 6 agreements to divest different noncore business lines, 4 of which will close in the coming weeks and the balance will close in quarter 2. In total, these divestments represents about EUR 50 million of EBITDA. Today, we are taking a next step in our strategy by organizing the soda ash business units into a separate and fully controlled legal structure. This step is in line with its business mandates of optimizing cash flow generation and returns. And will further reinforce internal financial and operational transparency and accountability, while increasing future strategic portfolio flexibility. 
Now moving to our outlook for 2021 on Slide 15. We continue to remain confident in the areas within our control. I explained earlier that we raised our strategic cost targets to EUR 500 million by 2024. And you know that we've delivered EUR 175 million already. So we are well underway. In 2021, we estimate delivery of an additional EUR 150 million in 2021, reflecting both the full year effects of last year action and new measures and will more than offset fixed cost inflation of around EUR 75 million. When you look forward at 2021, you will remember the 2020 EBITDA of EUR [ 1,945 ] million includes EUR 157 million of temporary cost savings, as Karim shared with you earlier. 
Moving to business performance. It's clear the momentum from the fourth quarter is continuing into the first quarter this year. We see that most strongly in businesses supplying the automotive and electronics sectors. Yet whilst we are close to our customers, visibility beyond quarter 1 is limited. And uncertainty remains on the continuing impact of COVID on our businesses. Further, as many other companies have expressed, we too are experiencing logistics and raw material supply issues that are challenging our ability to meet orders. Further, we have experienced some operational outages in relation to the extreme weather in the United States of America. Accordingly and taking all these factors into account, we estimate first quarter EBITDA between EUR 520 million and EUR 550 million. We will provide you with a better view of the full year once market visibility improves. On free cash flow, as Karim already explained, some positives in our 2020 free cash flow won't repeat in 2021, as expected. And when we also factor FX and scope effects, it implies a normalized reference 2020 free cash flow of around EUR 650 million. 
Turning to 2021. We expect to increase our CapEx investments between EUR 700 million to EUR 750 million and to invest around EUR 150 million in restructuring costs as we accelerate the transformation. The investment, the CapEx investment will focus on our growth platforms, including batteries and hydrogen. In addition, we will have the benefit of the deleveraging of pensions and debt, which we started back when I joined the company in 2019 and will contribute an additional EUR 90 million of improvement relative to 2020. 
To summarize, we expect to deliver free cash flow of between EUR 600 million and EUR 650 million. Finally, we recommended a stable dividend of EUR 3.75 per share. 
Before we begin Q&A, I just want to share that in a few days, it will be my 2-year anniversary leading Solvay. And what a ride it has been. We've accomplished a lot in this period. We united the organization around the common purpose. We launched our growth strategy, including our One Planet sustainability road map. We accelerated our delivery on cost and cash in the midst of a crisis. We focus innovation around 3 key platforms, batteries, composites and hydrogen with a multibillion sized addressable markets, and we started our journey to transform and simplify the company. Indeed, if I were to summarize what we've done and what we will continue to do, it is that we will continue to be resolutely focused on value creation, whilst leveraging fully on our values. In fact, we are making more changes at the top of the organization as we speak. While reducing an organizational layer that will further simplify the structure and combining 17 distinct functions into 7, which will drive accountability and improve decision making. These changes are the natural next steps as we seek to embed and advance the simplification that is already underway. I'm sure this year, will also have its share of challenges as we emerge from the crisis. Our team has demonstrated our ability to manage through these near-term headwinds while continuing our transformation. Our high-quality portfolio, coupled with our financial flexibility and structural improvements will enable us to emerge leaner, stronger and well positioned to unleash our full potential.

Wouldn't it be a good time to think about selling these assets? So more generally, what's your thought process with regards to these assets? And my second question is around the use of cash and deleveraging. So based on my calculation, you should end up with a leverage ratio below 2x in 2021. And that's not even assuming additional disposal proceeds, which could potentially materially lower the ratio. I'm assuming that a large acquisition is not on the agenda currently. So would you consider buying back shares at some point in the interim period? I think you got your approval to do so at the last AGM."

Well, listen, you may remember [indiscernible], when I joined the company, and I think by now, you know me in 2019, I said that there is no sacred cow, right? And there will be no stone and churn. So I spend much quality time with the team, including crafts in the growth strategy right around different distinct mandates by global business units and by segment to ensure that we differentiate the business mandate, the strategic mandates, and we ask each business to act accordingly and reach its full potential. So since then, you've seen that EUR 2 billion EV have been -- almost EUR 2 billion EV have been out. Obviously, there was the big chunk of Polyamide, which I inherited with, but it was not a done deal in 2019 because we were asked to find a second buyer, right? And we closed it successfully in January 2020. And then since then, obviously, we have been busy behind the curtain. And today, we have a total divestiture of 6, which represent EUR 300 million of sales, more or less EUR 50 million of EBITDA bottom line. And as I told you in my prepared remarks, we are going to close it in the first half of 2021 and some of them actually in the coming weeks, right? So we will continue to look for ways to simplify the portfolio. Obviously, on the M&A side, then we'll go to the use of cash. We entertain bolt-on acquisitions. Today, we've announced that we purchased a bolt-on seed coating technologies, the natural extension to our portfolio and supports the bio-based sustainable agro businesses of Novecare, right? But again, this is a small bolt-on technology. 
On the use of cash, I think you've seen us already. I mean, cash is king. When I joined the company in 2019. I said it publicly, I was not happy with the generation of cash. Needed the total amount, but also the quality phasing of it. And I invite you to look since quarter 1 2019 when we had a negative cash flow, we had the 7 consecutive positive free cash flow, including structurally improving it across the board in all GBUs, by the way, global business unit. And we use our cash actually to deleverage the balance sheet, a total of EUR 1.8 billion, right, Karim between deleveraging the debt, but also, we funded EUR 6 million in pension, which has been historically a nail in the shoe of Solvay, and I'm very proud of the team and what they have been doing in '19 and '20, actually giving us more flexibility and decrease in the pension expenses. 
On acquisition, listen, we are really busy. I think there is much we can do. So prioritization is important. I give a high -- I mean, the allocation of resources is in the top of my agenda. And you may remember that one of the first thing I've done is to change the allocation and resources from a fully decentralized to bring it to the hands of the Executive Committee members and I, right? Because I think this is why what we are paid for is to allocate the -- the limited -- not unlimited available resources the best available opportunities creating shareholder value in the company. So we have hard talks. We look at business case, Solvay One Planet, it is part of those. And yes, we will continue as part of our corporate M&A to look as you know, the value of bringing more bolt-on technologies and so on.

On the civil aviation, this is obviously the other states, right? In across the portfolio with oil and gas. We acted decisively. You've seen us last year we've already announced 20% head count reduction rights and 2 closure of manufacturing assets, the least efficient in our industrial portfolio and footprint. We closed Manchester in July. Tulsa is underway and will be completed on time. And a week ago or a few weeks ago, we announced internally, but now it's public, the third asset in the U.S. Obviously, moving to volumes, which are not lost to other plans. So you in us really -- and again, the least efficient plans out first, right? So the team has done really a good job in a very, very, very tough environment to really mitigate the top line decline and variabilize the cost as much as possible and actually use it as a way to improve the ROCE, the return on capital employed of this business. 
Now on the outlook, remember, there is a large parking lot, I would call it, of MAX planes. The Boeing likely to deliver 150 737 MAX this year, the rest they're phased over several years as we are hearing. But they are restarting the production. Will not really see the impact yet in 2021 as it will take time to deplete the inventory, right? Yet, you follow the numbers, assume domestic traffic back at 2019 levels only in 2023, which is likely to be a proxy for the single ail demand and obviously, Wim, the vaccine rollout with also [indiscernible], how quickly people will return to travel by air. So that nobody knows, and we shall see between now and the end of the year. So international traffic, in general, we believe doesn't recover until '23, '25 in the best case, which should translate into a weaker expectation. So we've done what we had to do, and we will continue, which is managing costs, right? The cash situation, et cetera. And we believe that in quarter 4, we reached the bottom, right?

So the first question is, how do you look at the EUR 157 million? An easy way to do it is you take the EUR 1.945 and deduct that EUR 157 million, that is absolutely by definition, temporary.

An easy way to do it is you take the EUR 1.945 and deduct that EUR 157 million, that is absolutely by definition, temporary. But it doesn't mean that we're getting our foot off the panel, absolutely not, which is why we've also clarified that we'll be committing to delivering another EUR 150 million this year over and above the EUR 175 million structural delivered in 2020. Now if you take the combination of both, it comes to EUR 325 million, simple math. It's more than what we announced when we delivered, the EUR [ 300 million ] in November 2019, and it's over 60% of the new higher EUR 500 million target. So that's really what we are looking at. 
Now clearly, if we can do better because people are traveling less, we're tele working. Yes, we'll find a few more. But fundamentally, we're really -- I said battened down, really nailed things down in our internal plans and ways of working. So that's the best thing I can -- so that's probably the most helpful way to describe it. 
Your second question related..."

So here, in 2021, Lisa, we are planning, as you said, EUR 700 million to EUR 750 million of CapEx. And we are redirecting the CapEx towards growth platforms. You may remember, in 2019, when we launched our growth strategy. We'",603,"Was on CapEx. I can take it. So here, in 2021, Lisa, we are planning, as you said, EUR 700 million to EUR 750 million of CapEx. And we are redirecting the CapEx towards growth platforms. You may remember, in 2019, when we launched our growth strategy. We've been very, very bold, and we told you that we are going to redirect not only CapEx, but also resources including human capital right towards growth initiatives, be it in the Material segments or other growth initiatives. And you've seen us since then, launching 3 platforms, namely the EV batteries, the thermoplastic composites and the new one, the hydrogen, so as much we need to reinvest in those growth platforms. And we are using digitalization, by the way, to improve the efficiency. We hired recently Chief Digital Officer. We are investing in digital in industry [ 4.0 ]. So what's in there for CapEx is that sometimes and often, actually, when we do digitalization, we can debottleneck and increase capacity in our assets with very, very low CapEx, ultimately, I want 0 CapEx and and squeeze the lemon and extract any pound of products right with the digitalization and better efficiency. 
On the look forward, you were asking beyond 2021. Too early to tell you, but yes, we'll give it to you at one point of time. But listen, we are working on what I call the zero-based budget on maintenance, right? I mean, we're an industrial company. We have a large industrial footprint. It's legacies, right? From the different businesses. And there are 2 things you have to do, first of all, ensure that what's concerned in maintenance and half of our CapEx can go to maintenance is zero-based budget and that you leverage the scale of Solvay as a company in procurement of services of spare part of everything and doing more with less. So that's number one. And this is very important, and we believe we can save a lot of money there and reinvest it in actually building capacity and debottlenecking. 
And the second is really improving our industrial footprint. Lisa, we've seen us closing 3 manufacturing assets in less than a year in Composite, Material. Obviously, we couldn't defy gravity and the crisis in aerospace has been accelerating our plan. But frankly, we would have done it, right? Just probably over time longer if the crisis was not there. And then obviously, we want to expand for growth projects. And without saying it publicly, but by now, you know it, we've been investing in our PVDF membrane technologies last year, during the crisis, and we are so happy actually because there is a new line in Tavaux in France, which started in January 2020, just 2021, just a month ago. And we are, as we speak, investing in China, and the new line will come on stream in Q1 2022. And in less than 2 years, we will be doubling our global capacity in PVDF. Karim said is on Aroma. We doubled the capacity for the second time. And we will be sold out soon. So we are industrializing our Equivio hydrogen membrane technology for few sales. Our customers have already validated and qualified this membrane. So now we are building a semi commercial pilots et cetera. So I think it's a nice exercise for an industrial company with our agent complexity to really look at the allocation of resources inside your CapEx portfolio, do more with less, challenge and restructure the industrial footprint and will remove the low ROCE assets and then invest for growth and double down there."

But we have given you a guidance, and we feel very comfortable with our quarter 1 bottom line. 
Now on the Rare Earth, it's probably a different story. And there is a lot of geopolitical potential issues, which can likely impact our business right? First of all, we don't operate in magnets, right? There are different Rare Earth. There is the light and the heavy one. Our main business, and you remember it well is mixed oxide Rare Earth so primarily for automotive catalysts and to the semiconductor industry. This is a sort of chemical mechanical polishing, right? We have separation capabilities only in France, La Rochelle, which we use as a base for our most downstream, I would say, products we don't have upstream integration, meaning that our separation units relies on concentrated third parties and as of today, we are not active in the business of Rare Earth magnets, as I said, so we would need to develop or acquire capabilities to move in this direction, and this is not in the agenda. So all in all, we buy in China for Chinese, right? In China for China, and for European and the French separation units, we buy from Australia. So this is not impacting us.

As you know, health, safety and security of our employees remain our #1 priority. And consistent with our desire to keep our people safe, we continue to have 10,000 people working remotely, maintaining the safety measures that we put in place nearly 1 year ago.  
Let me give you a brief update on our COVID status. Today, we have 78 colleagues who are infected with COVID-19, about 40% down versus last month, and 88 employees in quarantine and wish them all a prompt recovery. And while I'm on the subject of safety, I am pleased to share that we concluded 2020 with no fatalities and no irreversible injuries. This marks 3 consecutive years without a fatality, something extremely important to us.  
Moving to the full year results. The crisis presented some challenging headwinds this past year. Yet our portfolio was fairly resilient, with sales down by 10% on an organic basis for the full year. If you exclude our most challenged markets of civil aerospace and oil and gas, sales were down by 5% for the year, thanks to resilient markets, including health care, home and personal care, consumer goods and agro. We provided a view of our key markets and recent trends on Slide 4. And Karim will share more color when he reviews business performance. 
In the fourth quarter, sales improved in a number of key markets, driven by strong demand in auto and electronics, driving group sales up by 5% sequentially versus the third quarter. Regionally, fourth quarter sales in China were up by 5% while Europe was down by 2% and the U.S. down by 10% year-on-year. I'm truly proud of our teams because they stayed the course in the face of the challenging macro and maintained a relenting focus on the areas within our control, including costs, cash and of course, our customers. In each of these areas, we can recognize great results today. 
On cost, we delivered EUR 330 million of savings in 2020. Of this amount, EUR 175 million were structural savings, of which EUR 156 million are fixed costs. That's more than half of the original midterm commitments we made weeks before the crisis began. You may remember 15 short months ago, we committed to EUR 300 million cost reduction. We raised debt to EUR 410 million in mid-2020, and today's announcement of an additional restructuring plan impacting a further 500 functional support roles takes the new cumulative commitments to EUR 500 million by 2024. 
The decisive cost action we delivered in 2020, together with pricing power allowed us to contain the EBITDA decline to [Audio Gap] in 2020. Though more importantly, we achieved a 22% EBITDA margin. Our cash delivery is equally noteworthy. We laid the groundwork for this back in 2019 with the new incentive structure, clear programs and a disciplined process, and we use the crisis to accelerate our delivery. If you would have asked me a year ago, if you were capable of delivering almost EUR 1 billion in cash in 2020, I would not have thought it was possible, but the Solvay team did it. And I'd like to congratulate all of our employees for these record achievements at such a critical time.  
Moving to Slide 6. We continue to win with our customers by developing new innovations that address their challenges and unmet needs. Much of this work is directly aligned to our sustainability efforts, and we are very proud of our success with many key partners. I'd like for the sake of time to highlight just a few of them today.  
First, together with Bridgestone, a key customer of our Silica business and together with ARLANXEO, we co-developed a new tire platform called TECHSYN, which has 30% better wear efficiency and reduces rolling resistance by 6%. This not only reduces CO2 emissions, but also extends the life of tires. We are very proud of this partnership and innovation developed in only 24 months around half the typical innovation cycle of 3 to 5 years. The second customer news I'll highlight comes from Henkel. A key customer of Novecare's, Home & Personal Care business, who launched new products based on 2 of Solvay's recent innovations. 
You may remember, Actizone, our brand-new hygiene and cleaning technology, which we launched this year or 2020, that protect surfaces against viruses, including COVID-19 and is unique as it lasts for 24 hours. Another one, Rhodasurf NAT, our new bio-based surfactant, which is 100% renewable and part of a newly launched liquid laundry detergents by Henkel. It brings them a sustainable innovation which reduces CO2 emissions by 20%. 
And the last one, I'll highlight the new partnership with Vertical Aerospace, which you may have seen in the news where we are developing composite structures for air taxis. They will be electrically powered. Therefore, there is 0 emissions and will have its first test flights later this year. This is really cool to be at the front line of innovation. Our innovation pipeline is becoming more aligned with our growth strategic trends, including light weighting, electrification, bio-friendly chemicals and resources efficiency. To be clear, this will not only support the planet, but also the bottom line. And these sustainable driven innovations are what customers are asking for and what will create value for both Solvay and our customers, which brings me to the One Planet program which is an integral part of our strategy launched 1 year ago. And here, in only our first full year of a 10-year plan, we have also made very good progress in 2020 despite facing an unprecedented crisis.  
I'd like to highlight a few points in reference to Slide 7. Our sustainability metrics are embedded into our operational and strategic decision-making. And progress impacts 10% of our short-term incentive for the group. You may have heard me saying you impact behaviors when you impact the pockets, it's about walking the talk and being coherent. As you have seen, we have highlighted our progress against 10 metrics. While progress is broad and deep, in the interest of time, I will only cover our carbon emissions. 
Reducing our carbon emissions is a top priority for Solvay. And if you may remember, we joined the Paris Agreement in February 2020. In October 2020, you may remember that we have committed to set science-based targets or Scope 3, and have begun working with customers and engage already with more than 500 suppliers in quarter 4, 2020. You can see that we have progressed by 20% in 2020 versus our baseline 2018. About 60% of the improvement results from the reduction in activity levels due to COVID, and 40% is structural and reflects the impact of our projects. 
We launched 27 emission-reduction projects since 2018 baseline. Delivering on them represents an annual reduction of 1.8 million tons of CO2 per annum. And to give you an idea, this is the equivalent of taking 1 million cars off the road. 18 of these projects were already operational in 2020, and the remaining 9 projects will be implemented within the next 3 years.  
We have included a map of the projects on Slide 8, to give you an idea of the magnitude of our scope. And I'm pleased to confirm that the COVID crisis did not derail us nor de-tracked us from our commitment to One Planet. In fact, we came a long way. Also at the risk of stating the obvious, I also wish to emphasize that our investments generate adequate economic returns whilst also derisking the operations in a strategic sense. 
Going forward, we continue to advocate for uniformed global corporate reporting standards with respect to ESG matters. This year, we are taking 2 additional steps. Our 2020 annual integrated report to be published on April 1 will not only continue to align with the Global Reporting Initiative, or GRI, but also will map to the relevant SaaS B metrics as part of our 2020 annual report. And we will not stop there. We piloted and signed on as part of 67 companies globally and agreed to disclose new elements consistent with the World Economic Forum, or IBC nonfinancial disclosures. And I invite you to take the time to review these in due course.  
And now Karim will review in more detail the group's segments and financial performance. Karim?"

I'll start with an overview of the 3 business segments, and I'll refer to figures as usual on an organic basis, by which I mean constant scope, constant currency.  Starting with materials that yo",2447,"Thank you, Ilham. Good morning, good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with an overview of the 3 business segments, and I'll refer to figures as usual on an organic basis, by which I mean constant scope, constant currency.  
Starting with materials that you see on Slide #9. The facts are that net sales in the fourth quarter increased by 2.3% versus the third quarter of this year, driven by strong demand in the automotive industry. Specialty Polymers year-on-year sales turned positive for the first time since the start of the crisis. And sequentially, they improved by 8% against the third quarter. Strong demand from the auto sector drove that improvement. And this sector, you remember, represents 14%, 1-4, of group sales. 
Our polymer sales into the broader auto market in 2020 were down 9% for the year, outpacing -- outperforming the general market decline of around 16%. In particular, sales into EV batteries increased by 50% in the fourth quarter 2020 compared to the prior year, and we expect demand to remain strong given the latest industry projections for electric vehicles. In fact, we have invested in a PVDF line in Tavaux in France, and full production is already on stream as of Jan this year, 2021. We also have another new line coming on stream in China in the first quarter of 2022. Together, this will more than double our capacity and will help us to meet significant demand growth in batteries. 
Solvay's polymer sales also outperformed other major markets, including health care and small devices. Sales of PEEK, P-E-E-K, specifically, have remained resilient during the crisis with fourth quarter sales up 4.4%. Full year sales across all markets up by double digits, thanks to further penetration of polymers and some share gain. In short, you can see that we continue to outgrow markets in a few instances. 
You probably won't be surprised that sales of composites in the fourth quarter dropped 10% versus the third quarter as we reached the low point in civil aircraft demand. Whereas sales into the defense sector continued to grow, and in fact, are up by double digits versus the fourth quarter of 2019. Sales into civil aero represents 5% of group sales in 2020. This is clearly down on the prior year. The business is on track with the closure of its second facility, part of its ongoing manufacturing footprint strategy. 
I'm pleased to share the news that the annual run rate of cost savings related to these actions will reach EUR 70 million as of 2021 this year, EUR 10 million higher than originally anticipated. Also, the Composites business is taking yet another step to deepen to accelerate it's manufacturing efficiency and to improve returns further and align it with our customers. And it recently announced plans to close a third site in the U.S. in Orange County, California, which will happen in the second quarter of 2022. These closures will concentrate production on fewer, more efficient assets, and it will help us to improve service levels to our customers whilst increasing productivity.  
Wrapping up materials. Segment EBITDA in the fourth quarter was down 11.4% organically, and 18.7% for the year, with full year EBITDA margins at 26.4%, thanks to sustained pricing and robust cost reduction actions. This achievement reflects timely, it reflects decisive corrective actions in the face of unprecedented decline in civil aero volumes in 2020.  
Turning to the chemical segment on Slide 10. Fourth quarter sales were flat versus Q4 2019 as demand improved in every business. Sales in soda ash, which represents 16%, 1-6, of group sales and about half the segment, increased by 2.7% sequentially against the third quarter of 2020 as demand for flat glass using construction increased, whereas demand for container glass used in the hospitality sector remained weak. Soda ash contracts for the 2021 period have concluded. And you have likely seen publicly available data, such as IHS which gives you a good proxy of what to expect for the industry. 
Against that backdrop, you can assume that Solvay will again seek to outperform by effectively executing against the cost reduction program, building on our historic track record, which actually speaks for itself. Our focus will remain on cash generation, on maintaining our leading market position as well as driving our energy transition plan.  
Turning to peroxides. Sales are up 4% in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, reflecting demand improvement for HPPO, mainly driven by strong polyol market based on consumer goods, construction and an improving auto sector. Sales in Silica increased sequentially by 11%, showing the robust auto market demand, where our technology is used in high-efficiency tires. The business outperformed the broader market, thanks again to innovation and to our global footprint as well as to our strengthened position with our key strategic customers. Coatis sales increased by 11%, with a strong rebound in the fourth quarter in Latin America and in particular, reflecting growing demand for our innovative [ Petajoule ] biodegradable and renewable material. 
In the past 2 years, the business has optimized its costs and has focused on it's sustainable technologies. In fact, we've just doubled production capacity less than 2 years after the product launch, thanks to one thing, strong customer demand. Overall, the chemicals segment EBITDA rose sequentially by 4.3% in the fourth quarter as a result of the stepped-up demand that I've described across all those businesses. Full year EBITDA was, however, down 9.4% and margins were held at 27.7%, reflecting pricing and the cost initiatives that helped to offset some of the volume declines.  
Turning to solutions segment on Slide 11. Fourth quarter sales showed significant sequential improvement against Q3, up 7.6%, driven by strong demand again in auto -- electronics, which represents 1-4, 14% and 7% of group sales, respectively.  
Starting with Novecare. Q4 sales were up modestly in home and personal care, coatings and agro markets, and they were up double digits year-on-year. Speaking of agro, the business which represents about 13% of group sales, we recently just completed an agreement to purchase a seed coating product line, which is a small bolt-on acquisition with revenues of about EUR 30 million. This acquisition represents a natural extension to our bio-based agro solutions within the Novecare business. And it will enable us to generate compelling innovation synergies. The Special Chem business had an excellent fourth quarter with sequential sales growth of 19% versus Q3, driven by the rebound in auto, together with share gain in China as well as strong demand in electronics. 
In Technology Solutions, Q4 sales increased 6% sequentially as the mining industry, which represents 4% of group sales, is beginning to recover, driven by the demand for copper and further supported by price. Yet, having said that, some key mining customers remain impacted by COVID and are not yet fully operational as I speak today. 
In Aroma, performance was slightly down versus Q3, following significant volume increases, maintaining the strong momentum of the first 9 months. Given the exceptionally strong customer demand for our natural vanillin from the food and flavor industry, the Aroma business has decided to expand it's production of natural vanillin. In fact, we're doubling capacity for the second time since 2017, the additional capacity will become operational by the end of 2021. And by the way, this is a prime example of what is referred to as circular economy. Solvay's natural product is derived from rice brand oil and this is used to produce natural vanillin. 
Overall, the solutions segment EBITDA was down 2.8% versus Q4 2019 and 11.8% for the full year, with EBITDA margins relatively stable at 17.1%, reflecting disciplined cost management. It further demonstrates the resilience of this segment despite the major headwinds in oil and gas that we've seen throughout 2020, and it also shows the growth that is being achieved, thanks to our innovation.  
Moving to costs, which I'm detailing -- which we detailed on Slide #12. You can see that we have made significant progress against our targets in 2020. And we have delivered EUR 332 million in savings for the year, which more than offset inflation of EUR 75 million. Temporary cost savings totaled EUR 157 million in 2020, and these will not repeat in 2021. Our structural savings were EUR 175 million, of which EUR 156 million are fixed costs, EUR 19 million variable costs. Those cost savings fall into the 3 categories that hopefully you're familiar with: one, restructuring. This is the largest contributor and essentially comprises labor cost reductions, representing about EUR 90 million or half -- about half the structural savings that we've delivered. Indirect spend represents about 35% of the savings, around EUR 60 million, involves many, many actions and initiatives. Too many examples to site. But for example, we use recycled containers, we've standardized packaging across a number of our businesses, and the drive continues. And of course, we continue to drive productivity efficiencies including yield improvements in several businesses, such as in Specialty Polymers, in soda ash, in Novecare. And that represents about 15% of the structural savings at around EUR 25 million. 
The strength of this delivery actually brings to life the notion that there is no such thing as fixed costs, that indeed all costs can be variabilized. And the only legitimate question we ask ourselves is how fast will it take to variabilize costs? That's how we tackle them.  
I will now turn my review to how the group's performance has evolved overall. And by way of general context, look at our portfolio, it has delivered value during the crisis. And I say that because 60%, 6-0, of our portfolio proved resilience. And are reflecting here markets such as health care, home and personal care, consumer goods, food, agro. About 25% of the portfolio is related to markets where we see a progressive recovery underway, and by that, I include auto and mining. The remaining 15% will take a bit longer. We're talking markets here such as aero and oil and gas. Based on current economic forecasts, we currently expect our portfolio to be back to 2019 levels in 2022.  
I now invite you to turn to Slide 13. By way of context, many of you told us that you really valued the previous EBITDA bridges that show the evolution of volumes, costs. And you asked us to reconsider putting them back in to reinstate them. Now even though very few companies actually do that, we listened to you and we have decided to bring back those EBITDA bridges as a supplement on an annual basis. What you can see from this view is how it all comes together. Volumes were down EUR 568 million, in large part due to civil aero, oil and gas and about half a year of reduced demand in auto. Net pricing up EUR 50 million, in many ways, reflecting the premium value-added nature of many of our technologies in the market. 
Total cost savings, EUR 175 million structural, EUR 157 million temporary, less EUR 32 million in relation to other factors, many other factors, such as destocking impacts, less, of course, inflation of EUR 71 million for a net positive effect in 2020 of EUR 228 million. This performance evidences both the quality of our portfolio, and the strength of our delivery in 2020, notwithstanding the very significant volume headwinds.  
I'll turn now to Slide 14 and talk about cash. EUR 161 million is the cash we generated in the fourth quarter, bringing the total for the year to a record EUR 963 million, that's about 60% more than 2019. The improvement in performance can be summarized as follows: first, we took decisive steps, as you know, as you've seen, as the crisis unfolded to adapt our investments to accelerate and deepen our cost reductions, and to strengthen our working capital discipline. So to start off with, our cost mitigation contained the EBITDA drop to EUR 377 million, although this drop was more than offset by lower cash taxes of EUR 144 million, by reduced working capital of EUR 190 million and by lower CapEx of EUR 215 million. 
Against that, we also invested EUR 31 million more into restructuring charges in 2020 relative to 2019 to reach a total of EUR 90 million, 9-0. That's more than you've seen historically. You will also recall us saying that we've been optimizing our debt and working to deleverage our pensions in the last 2 years. Indeed, we've deployed EUR 0.6 billion of funds towards our pension schemes. And we actually plan to do a further EUR 0.2 billion in the next 12 to 24 months. 
We indicated to you that these steps help to both derisk our balance sheet and to improve our cash flow. And the fact before you today, actually demonstrate that. In 2020, our pension cash service costs were EUR 77 million lower than in 2019. Our financial charges were EUR 27 million lower than in 2019. And the good news is that we will have further reductions to look forward to in 2021. That said, and with that detracting in any way from the strength of that cash flow delivery, we also indicated during the year that we had a number of non-repeat onetime items. In that context, we have around EUR 140 million of structural improvements in relation to working capital. 
And in Q4, we were surprised that a few customers even prepared invoices to us to the tune of EUR 40 million. Now this will obviously reverse in 2021. And you'll recall, we had around EUR 80 million in relation to taxes early in 2020. These onetime elements come to EUR 260 million.  
Now as you look ahead to 2021, it's important to also take into account that foreign exchange developments, the anticipated completion of divestments that are currently in the pipeline will also account for a further EUR 50 million in cash that won't be with us in 2021 as we monetize the value of these businesses.  
What does that mean? It means that as you look at 2021 cash flow, what is -- which I would love to be able to tell you that the EUR 963 million is sustainable. The reality is that we're going to have to be patient for that because the normalized reference free cash flow for 2020 is near to EUR 650 million because of the reasons I've explained. This is what I've suggested is the relevant level against which to consider free cash flow going forward into 2021.  
And with that, I'll hand you back to Ilham to review our outlook and some closing remarks."

And to date, we have signed 6 agre",830,"Thank you, Karim. And now a few words regarding our portfolio. We began 2020 closing the sales of the Polyamide business, if you may remember end of January 2020. Since then, we began taking steps to prune our portfolio. And to date, we have signed 6 agreements to divest different noncore business lines, 4 of which will close in the coming weeks and the balance will close in quarter 2. In total, these divestments represents about EUR 50 million of EBITDA. 
Today, we are taking a next step in our strategy by organizing the soda ash business units into a separate and fully controlled legal structure. This step is in line with its business mandates of optimizing cash flow generation and returns. And will further reinforce internal financial and operational transparency and accountability, while increasing future strategic portfolio flexibility.  
Now moving to our outlook for 2021 on Slide 15. We continue to remain confident in the areas within our control. I explained earlier that we raised our strategic cost targets to EUR 500 million by 2024. And you know that we've delivered EUR 175 million already. So we are well underway. In 2021, we estimate delivery of an additional EUR 150 million in 2021, reflecting both the full year effects of last year action and new measures and will more than offset fixed cost inflation of around EUR 75 million. When you look forward at 2021, you will remember the 2020 EBITDA of EUR 1,945 million includes EUR 157 million of temporary cost savings, as Karim shared with you earlier.  
Moving to business performance. It's clear the momentum from the fourth quarter is continuing into the first quarter this year. We see that most strongly in businesses supplying the automotive and electronics sectors. Yet whilst we are close to our customers, visibility beyond quarter 1 is limited. And uncertainty remains on the continuing impact of COVID on our businesses. Further, as many other companies have expressed, we too are experiencing logistics and raw material supply issues that are challenging our ability to meet orders. Further, we have experienced some operational outages in relation to the extreme weather in the United States of America. Accordingly, and taking all these factors into account, we estimate first quarter EBITDA between EUR 520 million and EUR 550 million. We will provide you with a better view of the full year once market visibility improves. 
On free cash flow, as Karim already explained, some positives in our 2020 free cash flow won't repeat in 2021, as expected. And when we also factor FX and scope effects, it implies a normalized reference 2020 free cash flow of around EUR 650 million.  
Turning to 2021. We expect to increase our CapEx investments between EUR 700 million to EUR 750 million and to invest around EUR 150 million in restructuring costs as we accelerate the transformation. The investment, the CapEx investment will focus on our growth platforms, including batteries and hydrogen. In addition, we will have the benefit of the deleveraging of pensions and debt, which we started back when I joined the company in 2019 and will contribute an additional EUR 90 million of improvement relative to 2020.  
To summarize, we expect to deliver free cash flow of between EUR 600 million and EUR 650 million. Finally, we recommended a stable dividend of EUR 3.75 per share.  
Before we begin Q&A, I just want to share that in a few days, it will be my 2-year anniversary leading Solvay. And what a ride it has been. We've accomplished a lot in this period. We united the organization around a common purpose. We launched our growth strategy, including our One Planet sustainability roadmap. We accelerated our delivery on cost and cash in the midst of a crisis. We focused innovation around 3 key platforms: batteries, composites and hydrogen with a multibillion-sized addressable markets, and we started our journey to transform and simplify the company. 
Indeed, if I were to summarize what we've done and what we will continue to do, it is that we will continue to be resolutely focused on value creation, whilst leveraging fully on our values. In fact, we are making more changes at the top of the organization as we speak. While reducing an organizational layer that will further simplify the structure and combining 17 distinct functions into 7, which will drive accountability and improve decision making. These changes are the natural next steps as we seek to embed and advance the simplification that is already underway. 
I'm sure this year will also have its share of challenges as we emerge from the crisis. Our team has demonstrated our ability to manage through these near-term headwinds while continuing our transformation. Our high-quality portfolio, coupled with our financial flexibility and structural improvements will enable us to emerge leaner, stronger and well positioned to unleash our full potential.  
Thank you very much for listening. Karim and I will now address your questions. Back to you, operator."

So far, the discussion has been centered around businesses that have a negative impact on the company, whether it's margins, returns or the environmental footprint of the group. However, there are some assets in the portfolio, such as aeromechanical and surfactant for HPC that have been performing well recently and could attract high multiples well above the group. Given that they're not as core as other businesses, and they're not getting the valuation that they deserve, wouldn't it be a good time to think about selling these assets? 
So more generally, what's your thought process with regards to these assets? And my second question is around the use of cash and deleveraging. So based on my calculation, you should end up with a leverage ratio below 2x in 2021. And that's not even assuming additional disposal proceeds, which could potentially materially lower the ratio. I'm assuming that a large acquisition is not on the agenda currently. So would you consider buying back shares at some point in the interim period?

Well, listen, you may remember, Virginie, when I joined the company, and I think by now, you know me in 2019, I said that there is no sacred cow, right? And there will be no stone and churn. So I spent much quality time with the team, including crafting the growth strategy right around different distinct mandates by global business units and by segment to ensure that we differentiate the business mandate, the strategic mandates, and we ask each business to act accordingly and reach its full potential. So since then, you've seen that EUR 2 billion EV have been -- almost EUR 2 billion EV have been out. Obviously, there was the big chunk of Polyamide, which I inherited with, but it was not a done deal in 2019 because we were asked to find a second buyer, right? 
And we closed it successfully in January 2020. And then -- since then, obviously, we have been busy behind the curtain. And today, we have a total divestiture of 6, which represent EUR 300 million of sales, more or less EUR 50 million of EBITDA bottom line. And as I told you in my prepared remarks, we are going to close it in the first half of 2021 and some of them actually in the coming weeks, right? So we will continue to look for ways to simplify the portfolio. Obviously, on the M&A side, then we'll go to the use of cash. We entertain bolt-on acquisitions. Today, we've announced that we purchased a bolt-on seed coating technology, the natural extension to our portfolio and supports the bio-based sustainable agro businesses of Novecare, right? But again, this is a small bolt-on technology. 
On the use of cash, I think you've seen us already. I mean, cash is king. When I joined the company in 2019, I said it publicly, I was not happy with the generation of cash neither the total amount, but also the quality phasing of it. And I invite you to look since quarter 1, 2019, when we had a negative cash flow, we had the 7 consecutive positive free cash flow, including structurally improving it across the board in all GBUs, by the way, global business units. And we used our cash actually to deleverage the balance sheet, a total of EUR 1.8 billion, right, Karim between deleveraging the debt, but also, we funded EUR 6 million in pension, which has been historically a nail in the shoe of Solvay. And I'm very proud of the team and what they have been doing in '19 and '20, actually giving us more flexibility in decreasing the pension expenses. 
On acquisition, listen, we are really busy. I think there is much we can do. So prioritization is important. I give a high -- I mean, the allocation of resources is in the top of my agenda. And you may remember that one of the first things I've done is to change the allocation and resources from a fully decentralized to bring it to the hands of the Executive Committee members and I, right? Because I think this is why what we are paid for is to allocate the -- the limited -- not unlimited available resources to the best available opportunities creating shareholder value in the company. 
So we have hard talks. We look at business case, Solvay One Planet is part of those. And yes, we will continue as part of our corporate M&A to look at the value of bringing more bolt-on technologies and so on.

Listen, the civil aviation represent today, or 2020, 5% of our top line, right? The defense part is very resilient, as I told you many times during the earning calls and doing very well and source even for innovation. On the civil aviation, this is obviously the harder states, right, in -- across the portfolio with oil and gas. We acted decisively. You've seen us last year, we've already announced 20% headcount reduction right? And 2 closures of manufacturing assets, the least efficient in our industrial portfolio and footprint. 
We closed Manchester in July. Tulsa is underway and will be completed on time. And a week ago or a few weeks ago, we announced internally, but now it's public, the third asset in the U.S., obviously, moving the volumes, which are not lost to other plants. So you in us really -- and again, the least efficient plants out first, right? So the team has done really a good job in a very, very, very tough environment to really mitigate the top line decline and variabilize the cost as much as possible and actually use it as a way to improve the ROCE, the return on capital employed of this business. 
Now on the outlook, remember, there is a large parking lot, I would call it, of MAX planes. The Boeing likely to deliver 150 737 MAX this year, the rest they're phased over several years as we are hearing. But they are restarting the production. We will not really see the impact yet in 2021 as it will take time to deplete the inventory, right? Yet, you follow their numbers, assume domestic traffic back at 2019 levels only in 2023, which is likely to be a proxy for the single ail demand. And obviously, Wim, the vaccine rollout with also affect how quickly people will return to travel by air. 
So that nobody knows, and we shall see between now and the end of the year. So international traffic, in general, we believe doesn't recover until '23, '25 in the best case, which should translate into a weaker expectation. So we've done what we had to do, and we will continue, which is managing costs, right? The cash situation, et cetera.

We are starting it 1st of March, and obviously, it's something which is going to last at least a year. So we'll tell you more when we have eternalized the exercise. 
On PFAS, we know this is an issue for the entire industry. For us, actually, the PFAS story in the U.S. is actually one that showcase our innovation. And let me tell you how. I remind you probably the background that Solvay has never manufactured or participated to firefighting phones or manufactured PFA, PFA4-8, and we completely phased out the use of these chemicals in advance of any legal requirements. And then we obviously continue to look at non-fluorosurfactants or fluorosurfactants-free technologies. 
And since I joined the company, I challenged our teams really to look at how we can move away from fluorosurfactant-containing products. Since the PFNA, PFOA exits in 2013, we were using a limited number of compounds as a replacement. And as we speak, we have innovated with fluorosurfactants-free technologies, which we sampled to our customers in January last year already, and they have been testing them, qualifying them. And this was one of my top priorities since joining the company to ensure we develop these technologies, and we are ahead of the curve. And this non-fluorosurfactant technologies will be in full production at our West Deptford facility by mid-2021. And we are in discussion with the authorities in actually 2 or 3 weeks to accelerate the change to these innovations."

And then two, I mean, you were so kind to share 2021 CapEx guidance with us. Could you share some more details on sort of midterm CapEx spend, where -- in which levels do you see that? And where that gross CapEx element will be directed towards?"

So the first question is, how do you look at the EUR 157 million? An easy way to do it is you take the EUR 1,945 million and deduct that EUR 157 million, that is absolutely by definition, temporary. But it doesn't mea",204,"Lisa, I'll start with both questions. So the first question is, how do you look at the EUR 157 million? An easy way to do it is you take the EUR 1,945 million and deduct that EUR 157 million, that is absolutely by definition, temporary. But it doesn't mean that we're getting our foot off the pedal, absolutely not, which is why we've also clarified that we'll be committing to delivering another EUR 150 million this year over and above the EUR 175 million structural delivered in 2020. Now if you take the combination of both, it comes to EUR 325 million, simple math. It's more than what we announced when we delivered, the EUR 300 million in November 2019, and it's over 60% of the new higher EUR 500 million target. So that's really what we are looking at. 
Now clearly, if we can do better because people are traveling less with teleworking, yes, we'll find a few more. But fundamentally, we're really -- I said battened down, really nail things down in our internal plans and ways of working. So that's the best thing I can -- so that's probably the most helpful way to describe it. 
Your second question related to..."
377837,702592120,2221658,"Solvay SA, 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 24, 2021",2021-02-24,"Earnings Calls","Solvay SA","Executives","Was on CapEx. I can take it. So here, in 2021, Lisa, we are planning, as you said, EUR 700 million to EUR 750 million of CapEx. And we are redirecting the CapEx towards growth platforms. You may remember, in 2019, when we launched our growth strategy. We'",600,"Was on CapEx. I can take it. So here, in 2021, Lisa, we are planning, as you said, EUR 700 million to EUR 750 million of CapEx. And we are redirecting the CapEx towards growth platforms. You may remember, in 2019, when we launched our growth strategy. We've been very, very bold, and we told you that we are going to redirect not only CapEx, but also resources including human capital right towards growth initiatives, be it in the materials segment or other growth initiatives. 
And you've seen us, since then, launching 3 platforms, namely the EV batteries, the thermoplastic composites and the new one, the hydrogen. So there is much we need to reinvest in those growth platforms. And we are using digitalization, by the way, to improve the efficiency. We hired recently Chief Digital Officer. We are investing in digital in Industry 4.0. So what's in there for CapEx is that sometimes and often, actually, when we do digitalization, we can debottleneck and increase capacity in our assets with very, very low CapEx, ultimately, I want 0 CapEx and squeeze the lemon and extract any pond of product right with the digitalization and better efficiency. 
On the look forward, you were asking beyond 2021. Too early to tell you, but -- yes, we'll give it to you at one point of time. But listen, we are working on what I call the zero-based budget on maintenance, right? I mean, we're an industrial company. We have a large industrial footprint. It's legacies, right, from the different businesses. And there are 2 things you have to do. First of all, ensure that what's concerned in maintenance and half of our CapEx can go to maintenance is zero-based budget and that you leverage the scale of Solvay as a company in procurement of services of spare part of everything and doing more with less. So that's number one. And this is very important, and we believe we can save a lot of money there and reinvest it in actually building capacity and debottlenecking. 
And the second is really improving our industrial footprint, Lisa. We've seen us closing 3 manufacturing assets in less than a year in Composite Materials. Obviously, we couldn't defy gravity and the crisis in aerospace has been accelerating our plan. But frankly, we would have done it, right? Just probably over time longer if the crisis was not there. And then obviously, we want to expand for growth projects. And without saying it publicly, but by now, you know it, we've been investing in our PVDF membrane technologies last year, during the crisis, and we are so happy actually because there is a new line in Tavaux in France, which started in January 2020, just 2021, just a month ago. 
And we are, as we speak, investing in China, and the new line will come on stream in Q1 2022. And in less than 2 years, we will be doubling our global capacity in PVDF. Karim said is on Aroma. We doubled the capacity for the second time. And we will be sold out soon. So we are industrializing our Aquivion hydrogen membrane technology for few sales. Our customers have already validated and qualified this membrane. So now we are building a semi-commercial pilot, et cetera. So I think it's a nice exercise for an industrial company with our agent complexity to really look at the allocation of resources inside your CapEx portfolio, do more with less, challenge and restructure the industrial footprint and remove the low ROCE assets and then invest for growth and double down there."

Laurent, listen, I mean we ended up quarter 4, right, with a stronger order book. And I mean, you've seen the improvement sequentially.

I spare your time on some logistics problems here and there and surcharges which we are pushing with our customers and will defend our margins, plus the weather storm in the U.S. with some true force majeure, et cetera. But we have given you a guidance, and we feel very comfortable with our quarter 1 bottom line. 
Now on the rare earth, it's probably a different story. And there is a lot of geopolitical potential issues, which can likely impact our business right? First of all, we don't operate in magnets, right? There are different rare earth. There is the light and the heavy one. Our main business, and you remember it well is mixed oxide rare earth so primarily for automotive catalysts and to the semiconductor industry. This is a sort of chemical mechanical polishing, right? We have separation capabilities only in France, La Rochelle, which we use as a base for our most downstream, I would say, products. We don't have upstream integration, meaning that our separation units relies on concentrated third parties.
And as of today, we are not active in the business of rare earth magnets, as I said, so we would need to develop or acquire capabilities to move in this direction, and this is not in the agenda. So all in all, we buy in China for Chinese, right? In China for China, and for European and the French separation units, we buy from Australia. So this is not impacting us. Does it answer your question, Laurent?"

I'll begin my remarks today with a health and safety overview shown on Slide 3. Today, we have 124 colleagues who are infected with COVID-19, which is a similar level versus last month and 121 employees in quarantine.",1501,"Thank you, Jodi, and hello, everyone. I'll begin my remarks today with a health and safety overview shown on Slide 3. Today, we have 124 colleagues who are infected with COVID-19, which is a similar level versus last month and 121 employees in quarantine. We wish them all a quick recovery. At this time, we continue to follow our remote working routine globally to ensure high levels of safety. We are also utilizing our Solvay Solidarity Fund to show our support in the communities in which we operate, especially in India and in Brazil, and we sincerely hope that the critical situation starts to improve anytime soon. 
Moving to results on Slide 4. As you -- as most of you know, chemical industry is, in fact, a good barometer for economic activity. And it is logical that our Q1 performance clearly reflects the recovery in many of the markets we serve. For Solvay, it's in fact about some RRRs here, resilience recovery and now reinvestments to prepare for the rebound in 2022. The more resilient markets that weathered the storm well in 2020 continue to deliver good volume growth in Q1. These markets include Home & Personal Care, Coatings, Agro and Food Industries and Health Care. Second, other markets that began to recover in the fourth quarter, such as automotive, electronics and building industries showed an accelerated growth from quarter 4 into quarter 1 delivering double-digit growth. Three, we are also highly encouraged by the beginning of the recovery in other markets, including the mining industry as well as some of our commodities going into industrial markets. 
So altogether, this improvement in activity levels support us year-on-year top line growth in almost 90% of our portfolio, and you won't be surprised that our civil aero, oil and gas, and to a lesser extent, a portion of our soda ash business continued to face challenges. However, it's important to know that even these challenged areas began to show improvement in quarter 1 sequentially versus quarter 4. 
Now moving to Slide 5. In fact, our group sales, excluding composites and oil and gas, grew by 8.6% organically year-on-year and grew by 7% sequentially versus quarter 4. And this was despite the Texas winter storm conditions that impacted the raw materials availability and logistics, resulting in force measures across the industry. We estimate the total impact for these storms at about EUR 25 million of sales in the quarter, and indeed, enough care was most affected. Notwithstanding the improved momentum, which saw sales progress to nearly 2% relative to quarter 1 2020, they were still around 2% below Q1 2019 levels organically. 
Now originally, we saw double-digit sales growth in Asia Pacific and Latin America, with China domestic sales growing by 30% year-on-year and in superior growth relative to the general economy. The U.S. is still down by double digits versus last year, as you can imagine, mainly due to higher exposure to civil aero and oil and gas industries for our businesses. But it's up by 4% sequentially. Europe is roughly flat versus Q1 last year, but up 8% sequentially. But in fact, the recovery is only part of the delivery. The broader range of measures, tackling costs and cash that we initiated back in 2019, remember, when we launched our growth strategy, were deepened and accelerated during the crisis in 2020, and this is enabling us to deliver strong bottom line results reflected in the improved quality of earnings. 
Our cost actions remain on track, and we delivered an additional EUR 80 million of structural cost savings in the first quarter as we continue to accelerate momentum and this delivery compares to EUR 45 million of structural savings in quarter 4. These structural cost actions, combined with the recovery in certain markets supported our delivery of 10% organic EBITDA growth and the new record EBITDA margin of 24.6%. This is 1.6 percentage points higher than Q1 2020 and 2.4 percentage points higher than Q1 2019. 
Moving to cash. The organization has continued its disciplined approach, and we again achieved solid results in quarter 1, delivering EUR 282 million of free cash flow. This is 40% higher than Q1 last year and is a clear evidence of our progress towards improved and sustainable cash generation. 
Moving to Slide 6. We are focused on the rebound, and we have taken decisive actions to reinvest in several projects, key projects, whilst maintaining strong rigor and discipline. Many of these reinvestments are not new to you. And they are related to customer partnerships where we have established full commitment to supply future growth. These investments are directly aligned with our growth strategy and growth platforms and will be key contributors to our organic growth in the years ahead. These include investments in capacity expansions and in research and innovation. 
Let me share with you some of these investments. First, we are again investing in PVDF for EV batteries. By 2022, we will have more than doubled our capacity in France and China. Second, we are expanding our techno fuel elastomers production in Italy by more than 25% and 15% in China. This technology is in strong demand in the automotive and electronic markets. Third, we have various high technological polymers like PVDC and Sulfone polymers that are used in health care, which was proven resilient during the crisis and remain a growth area for us. In France, we are expanding by more than 30% and in India by 5%. We are again expanding our high-purity H2O2 peroxide grade for electronics in China by about 35%, so basically doubling since 2 years ago. Last, we are investing in our bio-based ingredients, using hair and skin care products, in France by more than 15%, and we have more than doubled our capacity of bio-based products in Brazil for consumer and food industries. 
Another type of investment is our investments in Solvay One Planet. And today is a big day for us and for soda ash team. We are announcing the full phaseout of coal at our Reinberg plants in Germany, which will be the first soda ash plant in the world to be powered primarily by renewable energy, using biomass of scrap waste wood chips. This will reduce Solvay's greenhouse gas emissions by 4% and will establish a new reference at the lowest emitting soda ash plant in the world. It is also an important moment to celebrate today. Three of our businesses, namely specialty polymers, North Care, and Aroma businesses are now 100% sourced by solar electricity in the United States of America. 
Let me now move to innovations. Today, we are also celebrating the official launch of our non Fluro Surfactant technologies, which will be in full production at our West Deptford, New Jersey site by June. At that point, Solvay will no longer use Fluro Surfactant process aid in West Deptford or anywhere in the U.S. I'm very proud of our research team, who first tracked this important innovation. I'm also very proud of our sales team for collaborating closely with our customers to qualify the new products in a record time. It's a powerful example of our innovation at work and aligned with our sustainability drivers. 
I'll share one more example of innovation. This one related to the composite material business. I like this one very much because this business has faced significant headwinds in the civil markets, as everyone knows, yet the defense and space markets have remained resilient and a source of innovations for us. Two examples of this are the Vega rocket and the Vulkan launcher, which both utilize critical composite materials from Solvay. In fact, we don't often speak about the space industry, but it's part of our rich history, and I bet you may know or we didn't know that Solvay materials were on board in the Apollo 11 mission that sent humans to the moon for the first time in '69. And we continue to provide innovative solutions to solve the future needs of the space exploration. 
But let me tell you, the most important is our investments, which go beyond capacity and innovation, they are also about our best assets, our people. Of course, these investments are not nearly the same magnitude, but they are included in our plan. Our frontline sales force, global account managers are developing winning strategies. We ask them to increase share of wallet to value price our solutions and drive innovations that make our customers win and make us win with them. And we have changed our sales incentive plan to align with this principle. 
Finally, we are also investing in more digitizing in Solvay. I believe digitalization will transform the industry and certainly our company. This is going from customer data mining, to manufacturing, to research and innovation, to back office automation using AI and robotization or in cybersecurity, of course, making our operations safe and resilient. 
And now Karim will review in more detail the group's segments and financial performance."

Before I dive into the segments, I'd like to remind you that we indicated in February, a full year EBITDA impact of scope and currency that we estimated at EUR 120 million. And you can see today t",2454,"Thank you, Ilham. Good morning, good afternoon, everybody. Before I dive into the segments, I'd like to remind you that we indicated in February, a full year EBITDA impact of scope and currency that we estimated at EUR 120 million. And you can see today that Q1 includes EUR 41 million of impact, mainly from currencies, and to a lesser extent, scope impact as 5 businesses were divested during the course of the first quarter. And the last one, in fact, just closed at the end of April. 
Now I will refer you to slide #7, which provides a view of our market exposures by the group and each of the segments, and this may help you to better appreciate the significance of some of the commentary. In addition, we've disclosed for the first time the regional sales for each business segment, which I'm really hoping gives you more insights, helpful insights, into our global businesses. 
Now I'll start with an overview of the 3 business segments, and I will refer to all figures on an organic basis, by which I mean constant scope and currency. Starting with materials on Slide 8. Net sales in the quarter, in the first quarter, were down only 7.5% organically versus last year, which is actually quite remarkable given the fact that demand in civil area was still strong in Q1 2020. The overall achievement reflects strong performance in our Specialty Polymers business with robust demand across various markets, driving 10% organic sales growth in polymers. Now this was driven by 19% organic growth in automotive, once again outperforming the market. As you heard Ilham say, we are investing again in this important platform to support rapidly growing demand. As a reminder, you can find Solvay polymers in many aerial vehicle in demanding really challenging under-the-hood applications and in many applications within and surrounding electric vehicle batteries. 
Our leadership position supplying PVDF to batteries continues to forge ahead, sales growth of 80%, 8-0 in the first quarter year-on-year. As a reminder, our polymer solutions for electric vehicles are agnostic to the type of battery. The combination of our global infrastructure and local geographic positions is particularly valued by our customers, and we continue to win new business. 
The electronics market also gained momentum following a strong fourth quarter, with polymer sales growth in electronics of 14%, driven by semiconductor and small device applications. The team continues to win new customers, a recent example being Atlas Copco, where we just won a multimillion euro contract in semicon fabs. And we have more examples of new business wins where we are replacing metal with our polymer solutions to address the most demanding performance requirements. 
The composites team continues to do a great job in our view, mitigating the headwinds in the civil aero market. As I indicated, sales in this business were down 42% from last year. But more importantly, and for the first time since the second quarter last year, the business delivered sequential sales growth of 8.6% versus Q4. The signs of modest improvements in single-aisle aircraft are there, yet the road to full recovery, as we know, will be a long one. I will also remind you that composites delivered record EBITDA levels in Q1 2020, as its cost reduction programs overcame at that point, volume reductions related to the 737 MAX. 
As you know, our swift cost reduction actions helped to improve operating leverage and resulted in a strong sequential profit increase, which is evident when you compare our results with others in that market. I will also highlight one other achievement and that the Composites business has, in the meantime, also successfully implemented SAP continuing to serve customers without fail. Now these projects are complex. They should never be taken for granted, and we're really proud that our team managed to carry this project out on time and on budget, with everything else that they have to contend with. 
To wrap up materials. Segment EBITDA in the first quarter was contained to only a 4.7% decline year-on-year despite a 7.5% decline in sales, and it increased sequentially by 35%, thanks to higher volumes, sustained pricing, and of course, deep cost reductions, especially in the Composites business. 
Moving to chemicals. On Slide #9, you see that first quarter sales in the segment are up 6.1% organically. Now soda ash continued to improve sequentially, up 2.2% in the quarter driven by volumes, but they remain 3% lower than Q1 2020 due to lower contract prices, which we had all expected. We see continuing recovery in building and construction, which supported growth in flat glass, whereas demand for container glass, which is used in hospitality, restaurant catering industry remained weak, of course, due to the continued lockdowns in many countries. We are also encouraged by the recent export price increase announcements in the market which will help to restore a more sustainable price level as we capture new volume opportunities. Sales increased 8% in our bicarbonate product line, which incidentally represents about 25% of the soda ash sales. The growth was driven mainly by our Solvay technology, which is used as flu gas treatment for cleaner air. This product reduces emissions of gases, caused by highly polluting facilities such as power plants, waste incinerators and indeed even ships. 
In fact, we're making a small investment with attractive economic returns due to continuing strong demand in our leadership positions. 
Peroxide sales were down 4.7% organically compared to Q1 2020, reflecting lower volumes in the pulp and paper market in North America, in Europe, which are down about 20% and due to the declining graphic paper market. Market conditions remained strong in HBPO, this is used to produce polyurethane firms for industries, including automotive and building. And this part of the business delivered continued strong growth. 
Turning to silica. Sales were again strong, up about 8%, thanks to the continued recovery in the automotive segment and market share gain, including with key customers, driven by interest in our recently launched innovations. Our recent partnership with Bridgestone and Arlanxeo is drawing a lot of attention as demand for more sustainable solutions is increasing rapidly from tire manufacturers. And these wins and strengthen partnerships are helping us to outperform and to further reinforce our silica's business leading position as a sustainable innovator in the tire industry.  had a record quarter, with sales up 55% due to strong volume growth and significant progression in prices clearly in favorable market conditions. Volume increase includes both winning new customers and achieving share gains at existing customers. Over the past year, this business has taken strong action to optimize its cost structure in line with the strategy. And it's a good example of how has this has helped to support the improved margins. Coatis is expected to continue to perform well, but we're mindful about also the recent resurgence of COVID cases in Brazil. Just want to watch. 
Overall, the EBITDA of the Chemicals segment was up 8.7% compared to Q1 2020 and increased sequentially by 15%, and mainly driven by strong results in Coatis and Silica as well as our Russian rusling new joint venture driven by strong demand and high prices of PVC. The combined performance resulted in an underlying EBITDA margin of 30.4% for the segment in Q1. 
Next, I turn to Slide 10, where you can see that the Solutions segment delivered volume growth, sales growth of 6.4%, beginning with . Sales, excluding the oil and gas market increased by 13.3% versus Q1 2020, with continued growth in coatings, in Home & Personal Care and Agro markets. Actually, Novecare results would have been even higher, had it not been to the loss of around EUR 20 million in sales related to the winter storms in the U.S. and the subsequent disruption had on supply chains and on the availability of raw material. We continue to see high demand in the hygiene market with natural and sustainable ingredients being clear drivers of long-term growth. And we are well positioned. 
We've also seen activity levels improve in the oil and gas sector, which grew 11% against the fourth quarter of last year, yet sales were still down 21% year-on-year. Special Chem had another good quarter with sales up 8.6% against last year, both the automotive and electronic sectors, which today represents about 60% of the sales, at PetCem were very, very strong in Q1. Now while demand from the semiconductor market is expected to stay strong in the upcoming quarters, we started to see an adverse impact related to the chip quarter end, and this could result in a temporary dampening of sales in the auto markets in the second quarter. 
In Technology Solutions, Q1 marked a strong rebound in the mining industry, with sales up 14.5% in the quarter. Growth was driven by mine reopenings, particularly in copper, as COVID disruptions will overcome and these were supported also by higher copper prices, leading to robust demand for our specialty extraction solutions. The business also enjoyed share gains in Latin America. 
In aroma, sales were down slightly by 1.6% in the quarter after a number of quarters of sustained strong growth. The core business, which led to hydroquinone inhibitors in vanillin is resilient while we are developing further on natural vanillin activity. 
Wrapping up solutions, the segment enjoyed EBITDA growth of 21% against Q1 2020, reflecting the strong and continued recovery across most of the markets we serve. Focused cost reduction measures also supported the EBITDA margin expansion, up to 19.4% against, you remember, 17% just 2 years ago. This improvement reflects a combination of volume growth and disciplined cost reduction, consistent actually with the optimization mandates that we announced to you with our growth strategy back in November 2019. 
Moving to costs, shown on Slide 11. We continue to make excellent progress towards our targets, and we achieved EUR 80 million of new structural savings in the first quarter, nearly doubling the EUR 45 million achieved in Q4. Now the main areas of delivery included restructuring, reduction in labor costs contributed EUR 32 million. EUR 20 million of which in general and administrative functions and EUR 12 million in industrial functions. About half of these restructuring savings were driven primarily in the Composites business. Indirect cost reductions of EUR 40 million were delivered as a transversal programs build momentum and bear fruit. 
Productivity efficiencies continue to deliver on our sites, and they totaled EUR 9 million in the quarter, and these impacts are variable costs. The EUR 80 million compares with the full year indication of EUR 150 million that you will recall, we announced at the beginning of the year. Now some of the delivery represents continued acceleration and is, therefore, more of a phasing nature. That said, I can advise that we now expect to deliver around EUR 200 million, not EUR 150 million in structural cost savings this year, which would bring the expected cost reduction delivery across both 2020 and 2021 to EUR 375 million once we get to the end of the year. 
The cost reductions that we achieved in Q1, together with the volume growth, supported EUR 583 million of EBITDA, a 10% increase versus Q1 2020. It's actually also worth noting that the EBITDA was around 7% stronger than in Q1 2019, and that's despite the fact that sales were down 3% on an organic basis over that same period. 
Next, I'll turn to Slide 12, and we'll talk about cash. Our performance again was strong, with free cash flow generation of EUR 282 million. As a reminder, Q1 last year benefited from EUR 65 million in one-off taxes -- cash taxes. Taking that into account, we essentially doubled our cash delivery from Q1 2020 to Q1 2021. Our strong EBITDA performance clearly supported that. But in addition, what we see is a EUR 63 million improvement in working capital. The evolution of working capital needs reflect the market conditions as they continue to improve. From an operational point of view, we are setting new internal records. For example, overdues, which were a record at the end of last year, progressed even further and now stand at 1.5%, a significant improvement on prior historic levels, which were in the mid- to high single digits. So really, really strong, 1.5%. 
Our working capital sales -- working capital to sales ratio stood at 12% at the end of the first quarter, and that compares to 16% in Q1 2020. And this reflects the structural improvements that we've been sharing with you as we drive, but also reflects the fact that inventory levels are very low. As we look forward, we will maintain the strong discipline, which is now fully embedded everywhere. But we will also not hesitate to invest wisely in inventories and working capital to serve our customers as they grow as well. We also benefited in Q1 from a EUR 63 million improvement simply from the timing, the phasing of our Capex, which were lower in Q1 this year, mainly to industry delays and disruptions related to the weather and logistics. 
Now projects have begun spend rates will increase this year as we invest to keep up with the growing demand in some key markets, as Ilham described to you earlier. The other drivers of free cash flow include our pension cashouts, and you can see the benefit from the actions we've been taken taking in the last 18 months, this quarter, EUR 14 million alone and a lower pension cash cost compared to Q1 2020, which again was lower than prior years. 
Just a few comments on our net debt. At the end of March, our net debt was slightly down compared to the end of 2020. Remember, we paid EUR 155 million of interim dividend in January. Take note of the fact that we made an additional voluntary pension contribution of EUR 102 million in our Belgian plans, which brings the cumulative voluntary contributions to pensions to a total of EUR 768 million. You'll recall, this time last year, that Moody's revised its credit rating outlook to negative about a year ago on Solvay and actually to a large number of companies as well as we were entering this period of uncertainty last year. So we were very appreciative of the fact that on the seventh of March 2021, Moody's recognized our progress with its announcement that stabilized our rating at BAA2, making us amongst the first companies to return to rating stability. After the wave of sector-wide negative rating actions taken last year. 
And with that, I'll hand you back to Ilham, who will provide our outlook for the remainder of the year."

As we emerge from the crisis, it is evidence that our results denotes resilience, which can be seen in our improved operating leverage, which, by the way, is in the top quartile of our peer group and by the continued strengthening of our balance sheet, evidenced by strongly reduced leverage levels. 
I now turn some comments on the outlook for the remainder of 2021 shown on Slide 13. As we look ahead, our outlook assumes the current conditions in our key markets will continue into the second quarter, where we already have good visibility into our order books. Top line trends have continued into April, so we estimate sales performance in Q2 could reach similar levels. Though profitability is likely to be impacted by an expected escalation of raw materials, energy and logistics costs. 
Our current estimates of additional cost is between EUR 150 million and EUR 200 million for the full year after hedging and pass-throughs. To put this in context, this represents about 3% to 5% of the total variable expenses. As you can expect, we have plans to mitigate these inflationary headwinds by raising prices and leveraging our procurement capability, and we have integrated these expectations into our outlook. 
Looking further ahead, I've highlighted that there is limited visibility and there is uncertainty, notwithstanding the encouraging progress in vaccine rollout in parts of the world. Given these factors, we estimate our full year EBITDA to be in the range of EUR 2 billion to EUR 2.2 billion, representing a 10% to 20% growth on an organic basis. 
To put that range into context, our EBITDA in 2019, on a comparable basis, including exchange rate and scope changes, amounts to EUR 2.1 billion. In fact, this implies that we have a good chance to be back to 2019 EBITDA levels by the end of this year, which would mean that our cumulative structural cost reduction actions will overcome the lag of 10% of our portfolio that will take longer to recover. 
We expect also our full year free cash flow to be around EUR 650 million at the top end of our prior range between EUR 600 million and EUR 650 million, as this enables us to continue to invest with discipline in CapEx and working capital and fund a higher restructuring costs. You will also remember that the company pays employee bonuses and financial charges in the second quarter, and so you can expect the second quarter cash generation to be seasonally impacted. 
To finish with, I'm very proud of Solvay people achievements, from the mobilization of our teams to the spirit of solidarity throughout the organization, also, I know that the 6,500 people who were helped by the Solvay Solidarity foundation who would join me in expressing their appreciation and deep gratitude for the generosity of our shareholders and directors and for Solvay's top leaders who donated 15% of their salaries last year. 
And our results clearly demonstrate that our strategy is also having a real impact, not only culturally but also on the bottom line. I firmly believe that we are emerging stronger. We are reinvesting in some exciting areas, which will fuel our growth for the years ahead and we will continue our transformation to a simpler, leaner, more specialized organization. 
Thank you very much. And with that, Karim and I will now take your questions."

So I'm just going to take you through a bit of a reminder. We delivered EUR 963 million last year. And as a reference, one needs to make a few adjustments, we highlighted non repeats in relation to working capital and tax, but also recognize that scope and foreign exchange also have their impact. The combination of those 2, and we said that in February, in fact, was that the reference point against which to look forward at 2021 is EUR 650 million last year. 
Now we mentioned a few things that I'm going to take you through the key building blocks. We also said that we're going to be increasing our restructuring costs, our cash spend. Last year, we spent EUR 90 million. And as we accelerate the momentum we said, we're going to increase that EUR 150 million, that's a EUR 60 million increase. We also said that we're going to reinvest for growth and with the guidance we gave of EUR 700 million, EUR 750 million, which is not changing, means an additional investment of EUR 90 million to EUR 140 million compared to 2020. Now against that, we will absolutely benefit from all the actions on deleveraging, and that's worth of EUR 90 million on the other side. 
So if that was all that was happening, there's no other activity change, profits wherever, you can do the math now. Clearly, we are in growth mode, and you can see the first quarter results. The outlook gives you an indication of what that would look like. The higher profits will require an investment in working capital to support the growth of our customers. But as we've said, we will maintain the discipline. That is the key -- these are the key elements that we believe will absolutely get us to what we now believe is at the top end of the range we gave previously of $650 million. I wouldn't call it prudent, I would consider it to be realistic, given all the moving parts that I've highlighted."

The reason I'm asking is because you mentioned that the earnings level in Q2 would be probably on the same level as in Q1. But normally, there is a seasonality that Q2 should be better than Q1.

Well, listen, Martin, we may surprise you, in our case, and we elected to be very transparent with you in terms of our estimates. And this is all estimates, right? In our case, we didn't see much of raw material nitration in Q1. They were in the teens million, right? But we do expect because of our good contracts, et cetera. So that's good news. And we did expect, actually, we entered the year already expecting inflation, right, not at the level it is today. So we expect increases to be relevant in quarter 2, right? 
What will happen in H2? Frankly, I don't have a crystal ball. And I know that many people are looking at H2 to be less inflationary, other is more inflationary. I think you know me by now and you know us, we don't put a hope in plan. We plan for the worst, and we act on it. So we are, as we speak, driving price initiatives, right, to meet [Audio Gap] the strong demand. Karim can give you a bit of details around the raw material, obviously, logistics and energy bills. 
And let me just tell you the mitigation, what we are doing about it is 3 things. First is pricing and pricing and pricing. You may know that more than half of our business is contracted with mechanical pass-through. So this has to happen. Although this year, we're going to review our formulas and our contracts for the next year. The rest is there to be negotiated. And we are increasing prices as we speak whenever we can. We have a good track record of price power, right, in the company. I would like us to become really a leader in pricing wherever we have unique specialized products and we can we bring value to our customers in the value chain. 
The second piece is our leveraging the procurements and the relationship with our suppliers. And you may remember in 2019, and I'm not sure it's resonated with all of you at that time, when we created the W of grow as winning a Solvay One, we created a global procurement group, right, which is now led by a new Chief Procurement Officer who joined us a year ago. And leveraging the procurement across Solvay is just an amazing opportunity for us to leverage our relationship with our customers. We are doing the auctions for the first time in our lives, turning it from anecdotes to really materially impacting the bottom line. 
And the last but not the least is innovation. You know that -- what I believe is that innovations are either cannibalizing your existing products, and bringing higher-margin or at the minimum, the same, but also -- and more delivering new businesses at higher margin. Therefore, in the long run, we should not only defend today's margins but although extend them. Maybe, Karim, you can give to the audience some color on the spending."

Let me start by confirming that Q1, we only had something like just under EUR 15 million of inflationary spend on these variable costs. And again, rather than just talk in very general terms, if I look at logistics, not everything is going up, transportation, is going up, let's say, near 18%. If you look at current freight rates today, but rate and road on nearer 2 and 5. If I look at some of the minerals that we purchased for our products, palladium, silica, we're looking at 5% 10%, type of cost increases. A number of the commodities derived from , ethane oxide, phenol, all of these are important to us. We're seeing double-digit growth there. So fundamentally, what we are doing exactly as Ilham said, is mitigating on 2 fronts: pricing and cost mitigation. So there's a lot of effort going into doing that. 
Now the question on phasing is really, really important. Even where we have contractual arrangements that enable us to pass-through cost increases, there is a time lag. And it really is almost contract by contract. Minimum, you can expect a month to 2 months, but it can take 4, 5 months as well. So it is absolutely reasonable to assume there will be some margin compression and some businesses, to some extent, only to the extent we can't compensate. So we can't really give you more color beyond that other than to say that this is what we see today. The environment clearly changes quite fast. It's an inflation environment that everybody is impacted by no doubt you're hearing from others and other industries as well incidentally. And what we intend to do is to overcome."

We are, by far, a leader, not only in peroxide but actually downstream into highly purified, and we do it with agility and we can localize and customize it. So our customers and more to come in the future. 
On the auto, obviously, indeed, auto has been very strong, right, quarter 4, quarter 1, and we grew about 20% versus Q1 last year. It's a recovery, but as you can read the press and hear the OEMs, it's impacted by the semiconductor shortages here and there. And you've seen many operations and many OEMs assembly plants closing down because of the semiconductors. So LMC didn't change their forecast so far. Maybe that is not going to hit the double-digit growth. I think we all believe, including researchers who deviate from LMC that Q2 will be still strong, right? 
In terms of, yes, filling the value chain, which was much depleted which is the case for our products in summer last time, now the H2 next year, I can also see that some people forecast a slower maybe growth rate in the auto industry, right, due to the semiconductor shortages. Okay. But all in all, I think we -- our order book in April is a high records all time, right? So it has been still extremely strong for the next 3 months. We have 3 months visibility beyond that. It's a bit of far away, but we are discussing with our customers. We are close to all our OEMs more than ever because they are all switching to EV, and most of them have announced 100% even EV vehicles, hybrid or pure electric by 2035. So very, very connected with our customers to discuss future investments in batteries and PVDF. And we take -- I take the opportunity firstly at our presidents in specialty polymers as well to discuss about how they see the year and getting more clarity on their order book to ensure that we plan accordingly. 
And the last point for specialty polymers, which you've seen, has done a great job and double-digit growth, and I'm so excited to see specialty polymer for 2 quarters in a row growing and really excited about that. That's crown jewel is going to continue delivering. And we also lighten in a car. So we penetrate in an automobile. We don't just sell what exists but on the core competency of our business is to replace metal at lower total cost of ownership, you consume less fuel, you emit CO2, it means cleaner mobility.

And obviously, you've seen, since 2019, we launched the EV battery, and I always believe that this is strategic for Solvay and for materials, not only because of the batteries, I mean our -- I always ask a business, what is your core competency. And our competency, like I mentioned, that we replaced met cell for Light WAN we also separate in general, that's our -- yes, core competency, technical competency, and we do it in material, in mining, et cetera. 
So PVDF is a membrane you find it in several applications. It goes to, obviously automotive, as you know, but also to reversal small this year in water, which was one of my previous roles in life and other applications to -- it's another technology to hemodialysis in health care. 
So yes, we are doubling down in. We believe that the market CAGR till 2030 will be around 30% minimum. We've seen a major growth in the past years and what has been a bit of a hype and a question mark, it's now confirmed, right, that this growth is sticky. Talking to OEM just early this week because of the shortages, obviously, of PVDF as well have actually supported my conviction that is the right thing to do. 
On margins, this is higher margins than other products we have. And to give you an example, Chetan in this very tight supply demand, because we are almost sold out in this, we have to prune the portfolio, which we did. So everything below 75% contribution margin in that line is out. So we had to cut it right with long-term commitments on businesses, yes? 
And I know that you know this value chain, basically, and obviously, the question is where is the money. And obviously, we are not assembling batteries, and we are not playing in the cut rods in the anodes, et cetera. We are really circling the batteries from the ingredient perspective and extracting the right value for our business with the right economics. 
The other thing I would like to mention here is that we are agnostic to technology as much as it can appear a bit surprising. So whatever you talk about including LFP, and there have been a lot of press and news about the lithium iron phosphate is when non material used primarily in China for vessels and in stationary, and it has advantages and disadvantages, advantages being cost and safety and disadvantages lower energy density it has been declining option maybe even 2 years ago when I joined the company, and now it's surging again as a viable option to produce maybe low-cost cars and facilitate customer acceptance. 
So we are not impacted like cathode manufacturers at all. At Solvay, we develop maidens for all type of cathodes. Moreover, actually, the good news is that the consumption of binders for LFP is higher than for competing cathode chemistry, like manganese, the nickel, manganese. 
So it's just good news. We didn't disclose, Chetan, the numbers, obviously, for competitive reason, but yes, it's growing extremely fast. We doubled our capacity since 2019. Last year, we did a line for Taba in France, which started January this year. The second line is Chang Su, which will start in quarter 1 2022. And we are studying the business case location to be confirmed and determined in Europe, and more soon. Back to you."

Thank you. Great question. Yes, on soda ash I'll take it, Karim. You will remember that big parts of our business is contracted, obviously at soda ash at the fall for the year after. You will remember that good public proxies, the IHS price index, right, this is an average of the prices available in the market. But you can imagine, and you probably know that Solvay is usually on the high end of this index and far better than average. 
For most regions, IHS publishes yearly indexes. And those have not changes, there really changes, and display significant price decrease in '21 versus '20, and this is how we entered the year, right? I mean, by memory, minus EUR 11, EU minus $35 in Latam, $13 Asia and $5 in the U.S. again, we don't expect those indexes to change. On average, we aim at better than IHS prices in Europe and NAFTA. Most of our prices, not all of them are locked for the year by contract. We have quarterly or semesterly prices only in APAC, LATAM Limited in other regions. 
Obviously, you talked about NSAC, and we read the same thing. They announced in March USD 25, I believe, per ton price or 10% increase on their open volume. Note as well that the sea freight cost increase is mostly in the EU outbound flows. And ANSAC is probably less less impacted because they operate their own vessel fleet. So we are encouraged by those pricing announcements. Our business will continue to strive for better performance. And you know that we have a great track record of outperforming the industry. 
Obviously, the price decreased year-on-year has impacted the bottom line of soda ash. But at the same time, soda ash is a great -- it's a great business run by top-notch leaders who know how to manage commodities and supply demand. And you've seen it in probably when the Turkish capacity came on stream before my time, and I saw it first-hand since 2 years. And we have -- we started the year already with our cost-saving program, which is well underway, and they are doing what it takes. And thanks to those prices increase and us, like we did last year, we applied the same strategy. There are some volumes we didn't take. We did it in 2020. And I think I was very public about that. We took the same stance. 
We have obviously our key customer strategic, et cetera. But we have some volumes very open, which now we are negotiating at higher prices. Those are the open volumes, and we are very picky but we continue driving and striving for excellence in cost and productivity. And obviously, you see it in energy transition, not only cutting the CO2, but being competitive because the thing I didn't -- but you will see it in the PR is that Erin Bert, not only is the lowest CO2 emitter in the world, and it's building precedent and global benchmark, including versus natural, but it will be competitive versus landed natural in Europe. So that I call it our old jargon, Lagunitas of Scientific in Europe, and it's something we -- I'm very proud of the team who works very hard on this. 
So yes, we have the same observations. And we are working on that on managing our pricing and pushing them. Back to you."

It's part of our customers, they produce the membrane, but you -- we -- it's part of the material segment, part of Specialty Polymer. 
Where we produce? This is a great news, we produce in all continents, right? We are capable of producing in Europe, in the U.S. and in China for Asia, right? So -- and this is extremely key for our customers, right? It's extremely -- and you know that Europe is putting a lot of money and stimulus into building the value chain after it's -- in the areas of batteries, right, and they are keen to have the value chain. And more than just having the batteries, right, assembly. 
So we are working with all the battery players. I mean our -- these are traditional customers, you know them, from LG, Samsung, the Chinese Catlyn and Panasonic, can you name them, but also the emerging European rights from the Nordics to the French, to the German, et cetera. And we've seen the Koreans investing in Eastern Europe heavily. Germany as well. It's a big investment. France went for a national alliance called Saas, and we are working with them. 
So all of this, it's real obviously, if you look at quarter 1, Sebastian, you will see that if you look at hybrids, and even electric, you see that China production is leading the world production followed by Western Europe and the last one is the U.S. approaching 100% quarter-to-quarter. So we are at debt, right? We are really following the market and even outperforming as we can bundle several technologies and sell it together to the same OEM for lightweight and electrification. And by the way, both go together because if you may remember, a few years back,  half of the cost, which is more than a few years, probably 6, 7 years, half of the cost of EV car was battery. Now it's probably 30%, 20%. And talking to the OEM, they want it smaller, safer, cheaper, right, and better technologies. 
So this is our generation too, which we produce all over the world. We're working on generation 3 to 5, 5 being the solid. Now the solid is 2025 plus. So -- but the solid will be a fabulous technology breakthrough because it's pure, safety and the most condensed battery you can imagine technologically-wise. So we are working on all of those. And our hub -- we have now 3 hubs in the world. The Biden administration is investing in charging station, which is extremely important because that's often the problem. It's not technology, OEMs willingness is that there are not enough charging station along the roads. And bides has announced bill or plan to do so. So we expect that there will be also probably lesser than in Europe or China, an increase in EV also in the United States."

No, fundamentally, what we're saying is this, we delivered EUR 175 million last year, and you can see the buildup of that momentum coming in EUR 45 million delivered last year. And all I really said is we got about temporary cost savings, et cetera, which I'll get to in a minute. But what we really said is this, we've delivered structural incremental additional cost savings of EUR 80 million. 
Now if I compare it to what we were expecting in our budgets, it is higher. There's an element of acceleration, and that's why I referred to the phasing component. But it's also deeper than what we were expecting, which is one of the reasons we said, you know what, we can do more, we will repeat let's raise the bar and go from EUR 150 million to EUR 200 million. Now if I take your question differently and just look at 2021, clearly, we're battling against inflation, and that is there to to erode some of the savings, but that's tiny in relation to the EUR 80 million delivered, looking at nearly EUR 10 million to EUR 15 million of inflationary cost for impact, fixed cost impact at this point. 
Last year, we are absolutely correct. Is that we had just over EUR 150 million of temporary cost savings, which we're not going to see repeated. And in fact, the philosophy is also changing because what we're saying is every single thing that's being delivered will be continued, will be sustained. And that's almost like the step changing gear that is happening right now on the cost agenda. But what I did say is you can't just extrapolate to multiply by 4 the figure of EUR 80 million, precisely for the reasons I've expected. 
And also, to your point, the comps will get tougher because clearly, the programs have built momentum during the course of last year, and you can't maintain the same rate of momentum growth as you go forward as you'd expect."

And they did really a great job. I'm really proud of them. They leverage on short market opportunities. As other competitors were on force majeure, basically, including the Texas weather challenges. Meanwhile, the raw material costs were still low in fixed cost under control. 
By the way, Coatis since last year, we completely turn it around in terms of cost structure. This is behind us. It's not part of the new program. And I think our President, Daniela, did a great job with her team. So we had very positive -- first of all, very positive dynamic, a tailwind from Texas freeze. Ports still need to resume operation, raw material shortages, low inventories, they faced high freight impacted past directly on our customers. I think the freight cost between China and Brazil was just insane. So we just played what a good business men and women can do -- a women, by the way, in this case, but also strong performance beyond the good market dynamics and the team had a good ability to respond promptly to demand while leveraging the price power. 
And the last -- before I answer the sustainability of it is the innovation and the strength of it because we have biosource ingredients. This is our line called Ogio products, which is sold out, by the way. We are, as I mentioned in my speaking notes that we are investing and doubling down in because it goes to consumer goods and food applications, and it's coming from glycerine so it's highly wanted by our customers. 
Listen, the situation is still tight so far. So we'll continue enjoying what we'll enjoy. Meanwhile, we are not really sleeping on our laurels. I think the team not only sweating the assets but also improving the cost position. And wherever we can, we also negotiate longer-term contracts, right, in this favorable environment. So we will share with you in the coming quarter, right, how things evolve for Coatis. Very proud of them and happy that they are under the -- yes, the light during this quarter. So I think Jodi, maybe the right to close the call, if there are no more questions here.

I'll begin my remarks today with a health and safety overview shown on Slide 3. Today, we have 124 colleagues who are infected with COVID-19, which is a similar level versus last month and 121 employees in quarantine.",1495,"Thank you, Jodi, and hello, everyone. I'll begin my remarks today with a health and safety overview shown on Slide 3. Today, we have 124 colleagues who are infected with COVID-19, which is a similar level versus last month and 121 employees in quarantine. We wish them all a quick recovery. At this time, we continue to follow our remote working routine globally to ensure high levels of safety. We're also utilizing our Solvay Solidarity Fund to show our support in the communities in which we operate, especially in India and in Brazil, and we sincerely hope that the critical situation starts to improve anytime soon. 
Moving to results on Slide 4. As you -- as most of you know, chemical industry is, in fact, a good barometer for economic activity. And it is logical that our Q1 performance clearly reflects the recovery in many of the markets we serve. For Solvay, it's in fact about some RRRs here, resilience, recovery and now reinvestments to prepare for the rebound in 2022. The more resilient markets that weathered the storm well in 2020 continue to deliver good volume growth in Q1. These markets include home and personal care, coatings, agro and food Industries and health care. Second, other markets that began to recover in the fourth quarter, such as automotive, electronics and building industries showed an accelerated growth from quarter 4 into quarter 1 delivering double-digit growth. Three, we are also highly encouraged by the beginning of the recovery in other markets, including the mining industry as well as some of our commodities going into industrial markets. 
So altogether, this improvement in activity levels supported year-on-year top line growth in almost 90% of our portfolio. And you won't be surprised that our civil aero, oil and gas, and to a lesser extent, a portion of our soda ash business continued to face challenges. However, it's important to know that even these challenged areas began to show improvement in quarter 1 sequentially versus quarter 4. 
Now moving to Slide 5. In fact, our group sales, excluding composites and oil and gas, grew by 8.6% organically year-on-year and grew by 7% sequentially versus quarter 4. And this was despite the Texas winter storm conditions that impacted the raw materials availability and logistics, resulting in force measures across the industry. We estimate the total impact for these storms at about EUR 25 million of sales in the quarter, and indeed, Novecare was most affected. Notwithstanding the improved momentum, which saw sales progress to nearly 2% relative to quarter 1 2020, they were still around 2% below Q1 2019 levels organically. 
Now regionally, we saw double-digit sales growth in Asia Pacific and Latin America, with China domestic sales growing by 30% year-on-year and superior growth relative to the general economy. The U.S. is still down by double digits versus last year, as you can imagine, mainly due to higher exposure to civil aero and oil and gas industries for our businesses. 
But it's up by 4% sequentially. Europe is roughly flat versus Q1 last year, but up 8% sequentially. But in fact, the recovery is only part of the delivery. The broader range of measures, tackling costs and cash that we initiated back in 2019, remember, when we launched our growth strategy, were deepened and accelerated during the crisis in 2020, and this is enabling us to deliver strong bottom line results reflected in the improved quality of earnings. 
Our cost actions remain on track, and we delivered an additional EUR 80 million of structural cost savings in the first quarter as we continue to accelerate momentum and this delivery compares to EUR 45 million of structural savings in quarter 4. These structural cost actions, combined with the recovery in certain markets supported our delivery of 10% organic EBITDA growth and the new record EBITDA margin of 24.6%. This is 1.6 percentage points higher than Q1 2020 and 2.4 percentage points higher than Q1 2019. 
Moving to cash. The organization has continued its disciplined approach, and we again achieved solid results in quarter 1, delivering EUR 282 million of free cash flow. This is 40% higher than Q1 last year and is a clear evidence of our progress towards improved and sustainable cash generation. 
Moving to Slide 6. We are focused on the rebound, and we have taken decisive actions to reinvest in several projects, key projects, whilst maintaining strong rigor and discipline. Many of these reinvestments are not new to you. And they are related to customer partnerships where we have established full commitment to supply future growth. These investments are directly aligned with our growth strategy and growth platforms and will be key contributors to our organic growth in the years ahead. These include investments in capacity expansions and in research and innovation. 
Let me share with you some of these investments. First, we are again investing in PVDF for EV batteries. By 2022, we will have more than doubled our capacity in France and China. Second, we are expanding our Tecnoflon fluoroelastomers production in Italy by more than 25% and 15% in China. This technology is in strong demand in the automotive and electronic markets. Third, we have various high technological polymers like PVDC and sulfone polymers that are used in health care, which was proven resilient during the crisis and remain a growth area for us. In France, we are expanding by more than 30% and indeed in India by 5%. We are again expanding our high-purity H2O2 peroxide grade for electronics in China by about 35%, so basically doubling since 2 years ago. Last, we are investing in our bio-based ingredients, used in hair and skin care products, in France by more than 15%, and we have more than doubled our capacity of bio-based products in Brazil for consumer and food industries. 
Another type of investment is our investments in Solvay One Planet. And today is a big day for us and for soda ash team. We are announcing the full phaseout of coal at our Reinberg plants in Germany, which will be the first soda ash plant in the world to be powered primarily by renewable energy, using biomass or scrap waste wood chips. This will reduce Solvay's greenhouse gas emissions by 4%, and will establish a new reference at the lowest emitting soda ash plant in the world. It is also an important moment to celebrate today. Three of our businesses, namely Specialty Polymers, Novecare, and Aroma businesses are now 100% sourced by solar electricity in the United States of America. 
Let me now move to innovations. Today, we are also celebrating the official launch of our non-fluorosurfactant technologies, which will be in full production at our West Deptford, New Jersey site by June. At that point, Solvay will no longer use fluorosurfactant process aid in West Deptford or anywhere in the U.S. I'm very proud of our research team, who first tracked this important innovation. I'm also very proud of our sales team for collaborating closely with our customers to qualify the new products in a record time. It's a powerful example of our innovation at work and aligned with our sustainability drivers. 
I'll share one more example of innovation. This one related to the composite material business. I like this one very much because this business has faced significant headwinds in the civil markets, as everyone knows, yet the defense and space markets have remained resilient and a source of innovations for us. Two examples of this are the Vega rocket and the Vulkan launcher, which both utilize critical composite materials from Solvay. In fact, we don't often speak about the space industry, but it's part of our rich history, and I bet you may know or we didn't know that Solvay materials were on board in the Apollo 11 mission that sent humans to the moon for the first time in '69. And we continue to provide innovative solutions to solve the future needs of the space exploration. 
But let me tell you, the most important is our investments, which go beyond capacity and innovation, they are also about our best assets, our people. Of course, these investments are not nearly the same magnitude, but they are included in our plan. Our frontline sales force, global key account managers are developing winning strategies. We ask them to increase share of wallet to value price our solutions and drive innovations that make our customers win and make us win with them. And we have changed our sales incentive plan to align with this principle. 
Finally, we are also investing in more digitizing in Solvay. I believe digitalization will transform the industry and certainly our company. This is going from customer data mining, to manufacturing, to research and innovation, to back office automation using AI and robotization or in cybersecurity, of course, making our operations safe and resilient. 
And now Karim will review in more detail the group's segments and financial performance."

The overall achievement reflects strong performance in our Specialty Polymers business with robust demand across various markets, driving 10% organic sales growth in polymers. Now this was driven by 19% organic growth in automotive, once again outperforming the market. As you heard Ilham say, we are investing again in this important platform to support rapidly growing demand. As a reminder, you can find Solvay polymers in many area of a vehicle in demanding really challenging under-the-hood applications and in many applications within and surrounding electric vehicle batteries. 
Our leadership position supplying PVDF to batteries continues to forge ahead, sales growth of 80%, 8-0 in the first quarter year-on-year. As a reminder, our polymer solutions for electric vehicles are agnostic to the type of battery. The combination of our global infrastructure and local geographic positions is particularly valued by our customers, and we continue to win new business. 
The electronics market also gained momentum following a strong fourth quarter, with polymer sales growth in electronics of 14%, driven by semiconductor and small device applications. The team continues to win new customers, a recent example being Atlas Copco, where we just won a multimillion-euro contract in semicon fabs. And we have more examples of new business wins where we are replacing metal with our polymer solutions to address the most demanding performance requirements. 
The composites team continues to do a great job in our view, mitigating the headwinds in the civil aero market. As I indicated, sales in this business were down 42% from last year. But more importantly, and for the first time since the second quarter last year, the business delivered sequential sales growth of 8.6% versus Q4. The signs of modest improvements in single-aisle aircraft are there, yet the road to full recovery, as we know, will be a long one. I will also remind you that composites delivered record EBITDA levels in Q1 2020, as its cost reduction programs overcame at that point, volume reductions related to the 737 MAX. 
As you know, our swift cost reduction actions helped to improve operating leverage and resulted in a strong sequential profit increase, which is evident when you compare our results with others in that market. I will also highlight one other achievement and that the composites business has, in the meantime, also successfully implemented SAP continuing to serve customers without fail. Now these projects are complex. They should never be taken for granted, and we're really proud that our team managed to carry this project out on time and on budget, with everything else that they have to contend with. 
To wrap up materials. Segment EBITDA in the first quarter was contained to only a 4.7% decline year-on-year despite a 7.5% decline in sales, and it increased sequentially by 35%, thanks to higher volumes, sustained pricing, and of course, deep cost reductions, especially in the composites business. 
Moving to chemicals. On Slide #9, you see that first quarter sales in the segment are up 6.1% organically. Now soda ash continued to improve sequentially, up 2.2% in the quarter driven by volumes, but they remain 3% lower than Q1 2020 due to lower contract prices, which we had all expected. We see continuing recovery in building and construction, which supported growth in flat glass, whereas demand for container glass, which is used in hospitality, restaurant and catering industry remained weak, of course, due to the continued lockdowns in many countries. We are also encouraged by the recent export price increase announcements in the market, which will help to restore a more sustainable price level as we capture new volume opportunities. Sales increased 8% in our bicarbonate product line, which incidentally represents about 25% of the soda ash sales. The growth was driven mainly by our Solvay technology, which is used as flue gas treatment for cleaner air. This product reduces emissions of gases, caused by highly polluting facilities such as power plants, waste incinerators and indeed even ships. 
In fact, we're making a small investment with attractive economic returns due to continuing strong demand in our leadership positions. Peroxide sales were down 4.7% organically compared to Q1 2020, reflecting lower volumes in the pulp and paper market in North America, in Europe, which are down about 20% and due to the declining graphic paper market. Market conditions remained strong in HBPO, this is used to produce polyurethane firms for industries, including automotive and building. And this part of the business delivered continued strong growth. 
Turning to silica. Sales were again strong, up about 8%, thanks to the continued recovery in the automotive segment and market share gain, including with key customers, driven by interest in our recently launched innovations. Our recent partnership with Bridgestone and ARLANXEO is drawing a lot of attention, as demand for more sustainable solutions is increasing rapidly from tire manufacturers. And these wins and strengthen partnerships are helping us to outperform and to further reinforce our silica's business leading position as a sustainable innovator in the tire industry. Coatis had a record quarter, with sales up 55% due to strong volume growth and significant progression in prices clearly in favorable market conditions. Volume increase includes both winning new customers and achieving share gains at existing customers. Over the past year, this business has taken strong action to optimize its cost structure in line with the strategy. And it's a good example of how has this has helped to support the improved margins. Coatis is expected to continue to perform well, but we're mindful about also the recent resurgence of COVID cases in Brazil. Just want to watch. 
Overall, the EBITDA of the chemicals segment was up 8.7% compared to Q1 2020 and increased sequentially by 15%, mainly driven by strong results in Coatis and Silica as well as our Russian recently new joint venture driven by strong demand and high prices of PVC. The combined performance resulted in an underlying EBITDA margin of 30.4% for the segment in Q1. 
Next, I turn to Slide 10, where you can see that the solutions segment delivered volume growth, sales growth of 6.4%, beginning with Novecare. Sales, excluding the oil and gas market increased by 13%, versus Q1 2020, with continued growth in coatings, in home and personal care and in agro markets. Actually, Novecare results would have been even higher, had it not been to the loss of around EUR 20 million in sales related to the winter storms in the U.S. and the subsequent disruption it had on supply chains and on the availability of raw material. We continue to see high demand in the hygiene market with natural and sustainable ingredients being clear drivers of long-term growth. And we are well positioned. 
We've also seen activity levels improve in the oil and gas sector, which grew 11% against the fourth quarter of last year, yet sales were still down 21% year-on-year. Special Chem had another good quarter with sales up 8.6% against last year, both the automotive and electronic sectors, which today represents about 60% of the sales, at pet chem were very, very strong in Q1. Now while demand from the semiconductor market is expected to stay strong in the upcoming quarters, we started to see an adverse impact related to the chip shortages around quarter end. And this could result in a temporary dampening of sales in the auto markets in the second quarter. 
In Technology Solutions, Q1 marked a strong rebound in the mining industry, with sales up 14.5% in the quarter. Growth was driven by mine reopenings, particularly in copper, as COVID disruptions were overcome and these were supported also by a higher copper prices, leading to robust demand for our specialty extraction solutions. The business also enjoyed share gains in Latin America. 
In Aroma, sales were down slightly by 1.6% in the quarter after a number of quarters of sustained strong growth. The core business, which led to hydroquinone inhibitors in vanillin is resilient while we are developing further on natural vanillin activity. 
Wrapping up solutions, the segment enjoyed EBITDA growth of 21% against Q1 2020, reflecting the strong and continued recovery across most of the markets we serve. Focused cost reduction measures also supported the EBITDA margin expansion, up to 19.4% against, you remember, 17% just 2 years ago. This improvement reflects a combination of volume growth and disciplined cost reduction, consistent actually with the optimization mandates that we announced to you with our growth strategy back in November 2019. 
Moving to costs, shown on Slide 11. We continue to make excellent progress towards our targets, and we achieved EUR 80 million of new structural savings in the first quarter, nearly doubling the EUR 45 million achieved in Q4. Now the main areas of delivery included restructuring, reduction in labor costs contributed EUR 32 million. EUR 20 million of which in general and administrative functions and EUR 12 million in industrial functions. About half of these restructuring savings were driven primarily in the composites business. Indirect cost reductions of EUR 40 million were delivered as a transversal programs build momentum and bear fruit. 
Productivity efficiencies continue to deliver on our sites, and they totaled EUR 9 million in the quarter, and these impacts are variable costs. And the EUR 80 million compares with the full year indication of EUR 150 million that you will recall, we announced at the beginning of the year. Now some of the delivery represents continued acceleration and is, therefore, more of a phasing nature. That said, I can advise that we now expect to deliver around EUR 200 million, not EUR 150 million in structural cost savings this year, which would bring the expected cost reduction delivery across both 2020 and 2021 to EUR 375 million once we get to the end of the year. 
The cost reductions that we achieved in Q1, together with the volume growth, supported EUR 583 million of EBITDA, a 10% increase versus Q1 2020. It's actually also worth noting that the EBITDA was around 7% stronger than in Q1 2019, and that's despite the fact that sales were down 3% on an organic basis over that same period. 
Next, I'll turn to Slide 12, and we'll talk about cash. Our performance again was strong, with free cash flow generation of EUR 282 million. As a reminder, Q1 last year benefited from EUR 65 million in one-off taxes -- cash taxes. Taking that into account, we essentially doubled our cash delivery from Q1 2020 to Q1 2021. Our strong EBITDA performance clearly supported that. But in addition, what we see is a EUR 63 million improvement in working capital. The evolution of working capital needs reflect the market conditions as they continue to improve. From an operational point of view, we are setting new internal records. For example, overdues, which were a record at the end of last year, progressed even further and now stand at 1.5%, a significant improvement on prior historic levels, which were in the mid- to high single digits. So really, really strong, 1.5%. 
Our working capital sales -- working capital to sales ratio stood at 12% at the end of the first quarter, and that compares to 16% in Q1 2020. And this reflects the structural improvements that we've been sharing with you as we drive, but also reflects the fact that inventory levels are very low. As we look forward, we will maintain the strong discipline, which is now fully embedded everywhere. 
But we will also not hesitate to invest wisely in inventories and working capital to serve our customers as they grow as well. We also benefited in Q1 from a EUR 63 million improvement simply from the timing, the phasing of our Capex, which were lower in Q1 this year, mainly to industry delays and disruptions related to the weather and logistics. 
Now projects have begun, spend rates will increase this year as we invest to keep up with the growing demand in some key markets, as Ilham described to you earlier. The other drivers of free cash flow include our pension cash outs, and you can see the benefit from the actions we've been taken -- taking in the last 18 months, this quarter, EUR 14 million alone and a lower pension cash cost compared to Q1 2020, which again was lower than prior years. 
Just a few comments on our net debt. At the end of March, our net debt was slightly down compared to the end of 2020. Remember, we paid EUR 155 million of interim dividend in January. Take note of the fact that we made an additional voluntary pension contribution of EUR 102 million in our Belgian plans, which brings the cumulative voluntary contributions to pensions to a total of EUR 768 million. You'll recall, this time last year, that Moody's revised its credit rating outlook to negative about a year ago on Solvay. And actually to a large number of companies as well as we were entering this period of uncertainty last year. So we were very appreciative of the fact that on the seventh of March 2021, Moody's recognized our progress with its announcement that stabilized our rating at BAA2, making us amongst the first companies to return to rating stability. After the wave of sector-wide negative rating actions taken last year. 
And with that, I'll hand you back to Ilham, who will provide our outlook for the remainder of the year."
377837,713094931,2270940,"Solvay SA, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 05, 2021",2021-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Solvay SA","Executives","Thank you, Karim.

As we emerge from the crisis, it is evidence that our results denotes resilience, which can be seen in our improved operating leverage, which, by the way, is in the top quartile of our peer group and by the continued strengthening of our balance sheet, evidenced by strongly reduced leverage levels. 
I now turn some comments on the outlook for the remainder of 2021 shown on Slide 13. As we look ahead, our outlook assumes the current conditions in our key markets will continue into the second quarter, where we already have good visibility into our order books. Top line trends have continued into April, so we estimate sales performance in Q2 could reach similar levels. Though profitability is likely to be impacted by an expected escalation of raw materials, energy and logistics costs. 
Our current estimates of additional cost is between EUR 150 million and EUR 200 million for the full year after hedging and pass-throughs. To put this in context, this represents about 3% to 5% of the total variable expenses. As you can expect, we have plans to mitigate these inflationary headwinds by raising prices and leveraging our procurement capability, and we have integrated these expectations into our outlook. 
Looking further ahead, I've highlighted that there is limited visibility and there is uncertainty, notwithstanding the encouraging progress in vaccine rollout in parts of the world. Given these factors, we estimate our full year EBITDA to be in the range of EUR 2 billion to EUR 2.2 billion, representing a 10% to 20% growth on an organic basis. 
To put that range into context, our EBITDA in 2019, on a comparable basis, including exchange rate and scope changes, amounts to EUR 2.1 billion. In fact, this implies that we have a good chance to be back to 2019 EBITDA levels by the end of this year, which would mean that our cumulative structural cost reduction actions will overcome the lag of 10% of our portfolio that will take longer to recover. 
We expect also our full year free cash flow to be around EUR 650 million at the top end of our prior range between EUR 600 million and EUR 650 million, as this enables us to continue to invest with discipline in CapEx and working capital and fund a higher restructuring costs. You will also remember that the company pays employee bonuses and financial charges in the second quarter, and so you can expect the second quarter cash generation to be seasonally impacted. 
To finish with, I'm very proud of Solvay people achievements, from the mobilization of our teams to the spirit of solidarity throughout the organization. Also, I know that the 6,500 people who were helped by the Solvay Solidarity foundation who would join me in expressing their appreciation and deep gratitude for the generosity of our shareholders and directors and for Solvay's top leaders who donated 15% of their salaries last year. 
And our results clearly demonstrate that our strategy is also having a real impact, not only culturally but also on the bottom line. I firmly believe that we are emerging stronger. We are reinvesting in some exciting areas, which will fuel our growth for the years ahead and we will continue our transformation to a simpler, leaner, more specialized organization. 
Thank you very much. And with that, Karim and I will now take your questions."

So I'm just going to take you through a bit of a reminder. We delivered EUR 963 million last year. And as a reference, one needs to make a few adjustments, we highlighted non repeats in relation to working capital and tax, but also recognize that scope and foreign exchange also have their impact. The combination of those 2, and we said that in February, in fact, was that the reference point against which to look forward at 2021 is EUR 650 million last year. 
Now we mentioned a few things that I'm going to take you through the key building blocks. We also said that we're going to be increasing our restructuring costs, our cash spend. Last year, we spent EUR 90 million. And as we accelerate, the momentum we said, we're going to increase that EUR 150 million, that's a EUR 60 million increase. 
We also said that we're going to reinvest for growth and with the guidance we gave of EUR 700 million, EUR 750 million, which is not changing, means an additional investment of EUR 90 million to EUR 140 million in 2021 compared to 2020. Now against that, we will absolutely benefit from all the actions on deleveraging, and that's worth of EUR 90 million on the other side. 
So if that was all that was happening, there's no other activity change, profits wherever, you can do the math now. Clearly, we are in growth mode, and you can see the first quarter results. The outlook gives you an indication of what that would look like. Now higher profits will require an investment in working capital to support the growth of our customers. But as we've said, we will maintain the discipline. That is the key -- these are the key elements that we believe will absolutely get us to what we now believe is at the top end of the range we gave previously of $650 million. I wouldn't call it prudent, I would consider it to be realistic, given all the moving parts that I've highlighted."

The reason I'm asking is because you mentioned that the earnings level in Q2 would be probably on the same level as in Q1. But normally, there is a seasonality and that Q2 should be better than Q1. So is it right to understand that margin squeeze from raw materials will be the highest in Q2 and then ease then in the quarters to come because then you do the actions and you raise selling price and things like that?"

Well, listen, Martin, we may surprise you, in our case, and we elected to be very transparent with you in terms of our estimates. And this is all estimates, right? In our case, we didn't see much of raw material inflation in Q1. They were in the teens million, right? But we do expect because of our good contracts, et cetera. So that's good news. And we did expect, actually, we entered the year already expecting inflation, right, not at the level it is today. So we expect increases to be relevant in quarter 2, right? 
What will happen in H2? Frankly, I don't have a crystal ball. And I know that many people are looking at H2 to be less inflationary, other is more inflationary. I think you know me by now and you know us, we don't put a hope in plan. We plan for the worst, and we act on it. So we are, as we speak, driving price initiatives, right, to meet [indiscernible] the strong demand. Karim can give you a bit of details around the raw material, obviously, logistics and energy bills. 
And let me just tell you the mitigation, what we are doing about it is 3 things. First is pricing and pricing and pricing. You may know that more than half of our business is contracted with mechanical pass-through, so this has to happen. Although this year, we're going to review our formulas and our contracts for the next year. The rest is there to be negotiated. And we are increasing prices as we speak whenever we can. We have a good track record of price power, right, in the company. I would like us to become really a leader in pricing wherever we have unique specialized products and we can -- we bring value to our customers in the value chain. 
The second piece is our leveraging the procurements and the relationship with our suppliers. And you may remember in 2019, and I'm not sure it's resonated with all of you at that time, when we created the W of grow, winning a Solvay ONE, we created a global procurements group, right, which is now led by a new Chief Procurement Officer who joined us a year ago. And leveraging the procurement across Solvay is just an amazing opportunity for us to leverage our relationship with our customers. We are doing the auctions for the first time in our lives, turning it from anecdotes to really materially impacting the bottom line. 
And the last but not the least is innovation. You know that -- what I believe is that innovations are either cannibalizing your existing products, and bringing higher-margin or at the minimum, the same, but also -- and more delivering new businesses at higher margin. Therefore, in the long run, we should not only defend today's margins but although extend them. Maybe, Karim, you can give to the audience some color on the spending."
377837,713094931,2270940,"Solvay SA, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 05, 2021",2021-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Solvay SA","Executives","Sure. Let me start by confirming that Q1, we only had something like just under EUR 15 million of inflationary spend on these variable costs. And again, rather than just talk in very general terms, if I look at logistics, not everything is going up, sea t",288,"Sure. Let me start by confirming that Q1, we only had something like just under EUR 15 million of inflationary spend on these variable costs. And again, rather than just talk in very general terms, if I look at logistics, not everything is going up, sea transportation, is -- there's an uplift in there, near 18%. If you look at current freight rates today, but rail and road on nearer 2% and 5%. If I look at some of the minerals that we purchased for our products, palladium, silica, we're looking at 5%, 10%, type of cost increases. 
A number of the commodities derived from crobi -- cumene, ethane oxide, phenol, all of these are important to us. We're seeing double-digit growth there. So fundamentally, what we are doing exactly as Ilham said, is mitigating on 2 fronts: pricing and cost mitigation. So there's a lot of effort going into doing that. 
Now the question on phasing is really, really important. Even where we have contractual arrangements that enable us to pass-through cost increases, there is a time lag. And it really is almost contract by contract. Minimum, you can expect a month to 2 months, but it can take 4, 5 months as well. So it is absolutely reasonable to assume there will be some margin compression in some businesses, to some extent, only to the extent we can't compensate. 
So we can't really give you more color beyond that other than to say that this is what we see today. The environment clearly changes quite fast. It's an inflation environment that everybody is impacted by no doubt you're hearing from others and other industries as well incidentally. And what we intend to do is to overcome."

We are, by far, a leader, not only in peroxide but actually downstream into highly purified, and we do it with agility and we can localize and customize it. So our customers and more to come in the future. 
On the auto, obviously, indeed, auto has been very strong, right, quarter 4, quarter 1, and we grew about 20% versus Q1 last year. It's a recovery, but as you can read the press and hear the OEMs, it's impacted by the semiconductor shortages here and there. And you've seen many operations and many OEMs assembly plants closing down because of the semiconductors. So LMC didn't change their forecast so far. Maybe that is not going to hit the double-digit growth. I think we all believe, including researchers who deviate from LMC that Q2 will be still strong, right? 
In terms of, yes, filling the value chain, which was much depleted which is the case for our products in summer last time. Now the H2 next year, I can also see that some people forecast a slower maybe growth rate in the auto industry, right, due to the semiconductor shortages. Okay. But all in all, I think we -- our order book in April is a high records all time, right? So it has been still extremely strong for the next 3 months. We have 3 months visibility beyond that. 
It's a bit of far away, but we are discussing with our customers. We are close to all our OEMs more than ever because they are all switching PV to EV, and most of them have announced 100% even EV vehicles, hybrid or pure electric by 2035. So very, very connected with our customers to discuss future investments in batteries and PVDF. And we take -- I take the opportunity personally at our presidents in Specialty Polymers as well to discuss about how they see the year and getting more clarity on their order book to ensure that we plan accordingly. 
And the last point for Specialty Polymers, which you've seen, has done a great job and double-digit growth, and I'm so excited to see Specialty Polymer for 2 quarters in a row growing and really excited about that. That's crown jewel is going to continue delivering. And we also lighten the cart.  so's penetrate in an automobile.

Obviously, you've seen, since 2019, we launched the EV battery, and I always believe that this is strategic for Solvay and for materials, not only because of the batteries, I mean our -- I always ask a business, what is your core competency. And our competency, like I mentioned, that we replaced metal for light weight, we also separate in general, that's our -- yes, core competency, technical competency, and we do it in material, in mining, et cetera. 
So PVDF is a membrane you find it in several applications. It goes to, obviously automotive, as you know, but also to reversal small this year in water, which was one of my previous roles in life and other applications to -- it's another technology to hemodialysis in health care. 
So yes, we are doubling down in. We believe that the market CAGR till 2030 will be around 30% minimum. We've seen a major growth in the past years and what has been a bit of a hype and a question mark, it's now confirmed, right, that this growth is sticky. Talking to OEM just early this week because of the shortages, obviously, of PVDF as well have actually supported my conviction that is the right thing to do. 
On margins, this is higher margins than other products we have. And to give you an example, Chetan in this very tight supply demand, because we are almost sold out in this. We have to prune the portfolio, which we did. So everything below 75% contribution margin in that line is out. So we had to cut it, right with long-term commitments on businesses, yes? 
On -- and I know that you know this value chain, basically, and obviously, the question is where is the money? And obviously, we are not assembling batteries, and we are not playing in the cathodes and the anodes, et cetera. We are really circling the batteries from the ingredient perspective and extracting the right value for our business with the right economics. 
The other thing I would like to mention here is that we are agnostic to technology, as much as it can appear a bit surprising. So whatever you talk about including LFP, and there have been a lot of press and news about the lithium iron phosphate is when non material used primarily in China for vessels and in stationary. And it has advantages and disadvantages. Advantages being cost and safety and disadvantages lower energy density. It has been declining option maybe even 2 years ago when I joined the company, and now it's surging again as a viable option to produce maybe low-cost cars and facilitate customer acceptance. 
So we're not impacted like cathode manufacturers at all. At Solvay, we develop guidance for all type of cathodes. Moreover, actually, the good news is that the consumption of binders for LFP is higher than for competing cathode chemistry, like NMC, the nickel manganese cobalt.
So it's just good news. We didn't disclose, Chetan, the numbers, obviously, for competitive reason, but yes, it's growing extremely fast. We doubled our capacity since 2019. Last year, we did a line for [indiscernible] in France, which started January this year. The second line is Chang Shu, which will start in quarter 1, 2022. And we are studying the business case location to be confirmed and determined in Europe, and more soon. Back to you."

Thank you. Great question. Yes, on soda ash I'll take it, Karim. You will remember that big parts of our business is contracted, obviously at soda ash at the fall for the year after. You will remember that good public proxies, the IHS price index, right, this is an average of the prices available in the market. But you can imagine, and you probably know that Solvay is usually on the high end of this index and far better than average. 
For most regions, IHS publishes yearly indexes. And those have no changes -- they rarely change it, and display significant price decrease in '21 versus '20, and this is how we entered the year, right? I mean, by memory, minus EUR 11 in EU and minus $35 in Latam, EUR 13 Asia and EUR 5 in the U.S.. Again, we don't expect those indexes to change. On average, we aim at better than IHS prices in Europe and NAFTA. Most of our prices, not all of them are locked for the year by contract. We have quarterly or semesterly prices only in APAC, LATAM, limited in other regions. 
Obviously, you talked about NSAC, and we read the same thing. They announced in March USD 25, I believe, per ton price or 10% increase on their open volume. Note as well that the sea freight cost increases are mostly in the EU outbound flows. And NSAC is probably less impacted because they operate their own vessel fleet. So we are encouraged by those pricing announcements. Our business will continue to strive for better performance. And you know that we have a great track record of outperforming the industry. 
Obviously, the price decreased year-on-year has impacted the bottom line of soda ash. But at the same time, soda ash is a great -- it's a great business run by top-notch leaders who know how to manage commodities and supply demand. And you've seen it in probably when the Turkish capacity came on stream before my time, and I saw it first-hand since 2 years. And we have -- we started the year already with our cost-saving program, which is well underway, and they are doing what it takes. And thanks to those prices increase and us, like we did last year, we applied the same strategy. There are some volumes we didn't take. We did it in 2020. And I think I was very public about that. We took the same stance. 
We have obviously our key customer strategic, et cetera. But we have some volumes very open, which now we are negotiating at higher prices. Those are the open volumes, and we are very picky, but we continue driving and striving for excellence in cost and productivity. And obviously, you see it in energy transition, not only cutting the CO2, but being competitive because the thing I didn't -- but you will see it in the PR is that Rheinberg, not only the lowest CO2 emitter in the world. 
And it's building a precedent and global benchmark, including versus natural, but it will be competitive versus landed natural in Europe. So that I call it in our old jargon, [Lagunitas] for Scientific in Europe. And it's something we -- I'm very proud of the team who works very hard on this. So yes, we have the same observations.

It's part of our customers, they produce the membrane, but you -- we -- it's part of the material segment, part of Specialty Polymer. 
Where we produce? This is a great news, we produce in all continents, right? We're capable of producing in Europe, in the U.S. and in China for Asia, right? So -- and this is extremely key for our customers, right? It's extremely key. And you know that Europe is putting a lot of money and stimulus into building the value chain after it's -- the areas of batteries, right, and they are keen to have the value chain. And more than just having the batteries, right, assembly. 
So we are working with all the battery players. I mean our -- these are traditional customers, you know them, from LG Chem, Samsung, the Chinese Caitlyn and Panasonic, and you name them, but also the emerging European rights from the Nordics to the French, to the German, et cetera. And we've seen the Koreans investing in Eastern Europe heavily. Germany as well. It's a big investment. France went for a  national alliance called S.A.S. and we are working with them. 
So all of this, it's real. Obviously, if you look at quarter 1, Sebastian, you will see that if you look at hybrids, and even electric, you see that China production is leading the world production followed by Western Europe and the last one is the U.S. approaching 100% quarter-to-quarter. So we are at that, right? 
We are really following the market and even outperforming as we can bundle several technologies and sell it together to the same OEM for lightweight and electrification. And by the way, both go together because if you may remember, a few years back, half of the cost, which more than a few years, probably 6, 7 years, half of the cost of EV car was battery. Now it's probably 30%, 20%. And talking to the OEM, they want it smaller, safer, cheaper, right, and better technologies. 
So this is our generation 2, which we produce all over the world. We're working on generation 3 to 5, 5 being the solid. Now the solid is 2025 plus. So -- but the solid will be a fabulous technology breakthrough because it's pure safety and the most condensed battery you can imagine technologically-wise. 
So we are working on all of those. And our hub -- we have now 3 hubs in the world. The Biden administration is investing in charging station, which is extremely important because that's often the problem. It's not technology, OEMs willingness is that there are not enough charging station along the roads. And Biden has announced bill or plan to do so. So we expect that there will be also probably lesser than in Europe or China, an increase in EV also in the United States."

It's a competitive advantage. There is much capacity being discussed. It's really unique and differentiating because it's not only about making PVDF, by the way, it's the vertical integration on raw material to produce PVDF. 
So that's something which is also very unique to Solvay. And yes, we are very excited about this, but our ability to innovate, again, with lower cost technology to lower total cost of ownership an agnostic technology to the type of batteries, which I think is a remarkable way of innovating in these segments?"

Karim, I'm going back to your comments on cost savings on permanent cost savings of EUR 80 million in Q1. Given the run rate over the quarters last year, it doesn't seem that the comps are getting tougher for that number. So I'm a bit surprised that from EUR 80 million you would assume that we come down to EUR 200 million. So are we -- are you factoring in the reversal of the temporary savings? Or should we assume that there are more costs coming in, including on resources, R&D, et cetera?"

No, fundamentally, what we're saying is this, we delivered EUR 175 million last year, and you can see the buildup of that momentum coming in EUR 45 million delivered last year. And all I really said is we got",343,"No, it's an interesting comment that you make. No, fundamentally, what we're saying is this, we delivered EUR 175 million last year, and you can see the buildup of that momentum coming in EUR 45 million delivered last year. And all I really said is we got about temporary cost savings, et cetera, which I'll get to in a minute. But what we really said is this, we've delivered structural incremental additional cost savings of EUR 80 million. 
Now if I compare it to what we were expecting in our budgets, it is higher. There's an element of acceleration, and that's why I referred to the phasing component. But it's also deeper than what we were expecting, which is one of the reasons we said, you know what, we can do more, we will repeat, let's raise the bar and go from EUR 150 million to EUR 200 million. 
Now if I take your question differently and just look at 2021, clearly, we're battling against inflation, and that is there to erode some of the savings, but that's tiny in relation to the EUR 80 million delivered, looking at nearly EUR 10 million to EUR 15 million of inflationary cost impact, fixed cost impact at this point. 
Last year, where you're absolutely correct. Is that we had just over EUR 150 million of temporary cost savings, which we're not going to see repeated. And in fact, the philosophy is also changing because what we're saying is every single thing that's being delivered will be continued, will be sustained. And that's almost like the step changing gear that was -- is happening right now on the cost agenda. But what I did say is you can't just extrapolate to multiply by 4 the figure of EUR 80 million, precisely for the reasons I've expected. 
And also, to your point, the comps will get tougher because clearly, the programs have built momentum during the course of last year, and you can't maintain the same rate of momentum growth as you go forward as you'd expect."

Well, listen, the call action -- option, sorry, exercised by the European bank for reconstruction and development called EBRD, you saw it in Q1, is related to 52%, right, Karim? 50% -- 52%, what, capital investment with Solvay in the JV, this happened in 2011. We also had in place put on call option arrangements with EBRD, and as a consequence, the contribution to the capital was accounted for as a debt in the group's accounts. And this is in line with IFRS, obviously, rather than equity or minority interest. 
So first of all, at the end of the day, the rationale for doing it now that your question 1 is the option value is close to the floor now and is expected to increase in the future with deleveraging of RusVinyl. And we like -- I mean, we like it, right? I mean, financially, you've seen that, frankly, we didn't extract much dividends from this for many, many years. And I was lucky when I joined the company, we started really getting -- collecting some fruit. 
The second is that the EBRD, and you know their mission, supports and influence in Russia is not considered as assertion anymore. So that's it. I think that's the only reason why we did it now. It makes sense economically."

We've done plus 65% right in quarter 1, and it's mainly driven by, obviously, volumes and pricing, right? And they did really a great job. I'm really proud of them. They leverage on short market opportunities. As other competitors were on force majeure, basically, including the Texas weather challenges. Meanwhile, the raw material costs were still low in fixed cost under control. 
By the way, coatis since last year, we completely turn it around in terms of cost structure. This is behind us. It's not part of the new program. And I think our President, Daniela, did a great job with her team. So we had very positive -- first of all, very positive dynamic, a tailwind from Texas freeze. Ports still need to resume operation, raw material shortages, low inventories, they faced high freight impacted past directly on our customers. I think the freight cost between China and Brazil was just insane. So we just played what a good business men and women can do -- a women, by the way, in this case, but also strong performance beyond the good market dynamics and the team had a good ability to respond promptly to demand while leveraging the price power. 
And the last -- before I answer the sustainability of it is the innovation and the strength of it because we have biosource ingredients. This is our line called OGIO products, which is sold out, by the way. We are -- as I mentioned in my speaking notes that we are investing and doubling downing because it goes to consumer goods and food applications, and it's coming from glycerin. So it's highly wanted by our customers. 
Listen, the situation is still tight so far. So we'll continue enjoying what we'll enjoy. Meanwhile, we are not really sleeping on our laurels. I think the team not only sweating the assets, but also improving the cost position. And wherever we can, we also negotiate longer-term contracts, right, in this favorable environment. So we will share with you in the coming quarter, right, how things evolve for coatis. Very proud of them and happy that they are under the -- yes, the light during this quarter. So I think Jodi, maybe the right to close the call, if there are no more questions here.  
Well, listen, very much. I think I say this probably [indiscernible] we would like you to remember from us is the resilience and we've proven it last year, and we still continue, right?

I'll begin my remarks today with a health and safety overview shown on Slide 3. Today, we have 124 colleagues who are infected with COVID-19, which is a similar level versus last month and 121 employees in quarantine.",1497,"Thank you, Jodi, and hello, everyone. I'll begin my remarks today with a health and safety overview shown on Slide 3. Today, we have 124 colleagues who are infected with COVID-19, which is a similar level versus last month and 121 employees in quarantine. We wish them all a quick recovery. At this time, we continue to follow our remote working routine globally to ensure high levels of safety. We're also utilizing our Solvay Solidarity Fund to show our support in the communities in which we operate, especially in India and in Brazil, and we sincerely hope that the critical situation starts to improve anytime soon. 
Moving to results on Slide 4. As you -- as most of you know, the chemical industry is, in fact, a good barometer for economic activity. And it is logical that our Q1 performance clearly reflects the recovery in many of the markets we serve. For Solvay, it's in fact about some triple Rs here, resilience, recovery and now reinvestments to prepare for the rebound in 2022. The more resilient markets that weathered the storm well in 2020 continue to deliver good volume growth in Q1. 
These markets include home and personal care, coatings, agro and food industries and health care. Second, other markets that began to recover in the fourth quarter, such as automotive, electronics and building industries showed an accelerated growth from quarter 4 into quarter 1 delivering double-digit growth. Three, we are also highly encouraged by the beginning of the recovery in other markets, including the mining industry as well as some of our commodities going into industrial markets. 
So altogether, this improvement in activity levels supported year-on-year top line growth in almost 90% of our portfolio. And you won't be surprised that our civil aero, oil and gas, and to a lesser extent, a portion of our soda ash business continued to face challenges. However, it's important to know that even these challenged areas began to show improvement in quarter 1 sequentially versus quarter 4. 
Now moving to Slide 5. In fact, our group sales, excluding composites and oil and gas, grew by 8.6% organically year-on-year and grew by 7% sequentially versus quarter 4. And this was despite the Texas winter storm conditions that impacted the raw materials availability and logistics, resulting in force measures across the industry. We estimate the total impact for these storms at about EUR 25 million of sales in the quarter, and indeed, Novecare was most affected. Notwithstanding the improved momentum, which saw sales progress to nearly 2% relative to quarter 1 2020, they were still around 2% below Q1 2019 levels organically. 
Now regionally, we saw double-digit sales growth in Asia Pacific and Latin America, with China domestic sales growing by 30% year-on-year and [indiscernible] superior growth relative to the general economy. The U.S. is still down by double digits versus last year, as you can imagine, mainly due to higher exposure to civil aero and oil and gas industries for our businesses. 
But it's up by 4% sequentially. Europe is roughly flat versus Q1 last year, but up 8% sequentially. But in fact, the recovery is only part of the delivery. The broader range of measures, tackling costs and cash that we initiated back in 2019, remember, when we launched our growth strategy, were deepened and accelerated during the crisis in 2020, and this is enabling us to deliver strong bottom line results reflected in the improved quality of earnings. 
Our cost actions remain on track, and we delivered an additional EUR 80 million of structural cost savings in the first quarter as we continued to accelerate momentum and this delivery compares to EUR 45 million of structural savings in quarter 4. These structural cost actions, combined with the recovery in certain markets supported our delivery of 10% organic EBITDA growth and the new record EBITDA margin of 24.6%. This is 1.6 percentage points higher than Q1 2020 and 2.4 percentage points higher than Q1 2019. 
Moving to cash. The organization has continued its disciplined approach, and we again achieved solid results in quarter 1, delivering EUR 282 million of free cash flow. This is 40% higher than Q1 last year and is a clear evidence of our progress towards improved and sustainable cash generation. 
Moving to Slide 6. We are focused on the rebound, and we have taken decisive actions to reinvest in several projects, key projects, whilst maintaining strong rigor and discipline. Many of these reinvestments are not new to you. And they are related to customer partnerships where we have established full commitment to supply future growth. These investments are directly aligned with our growth strategy and growth platforms and will be key contributors to our organic growth in the years ahead. These include investments in capacity expansions and in research and innovation. 
Let me share with you some of these investments. First, we are again investing in PVDF for EV batteries. By 2022, we will have more than doubled our capacity in France and China. Second, we are expanding our Tecnoflon fluoroelastomers production in Italy by more than 25% and 15% in China. This technology is in strong demand in the automotive and electronic markets. Third, we have various high technological polymers like PVDC and sulfone polymers that are used in health care, which was proven resilient during the crisis and remain a growth area for us. 
In France, we are expanding by more than 30% and indeed in India by 5%. We are again expanding our high-purity H2O2 peroxide grade for electronics in China by about 35%, so basically doubling since 2 years ago. Last, we are investing in our bio-based ingredients, used in hair and skin care products, in France by more than 15%, and we have more than doubled our capacity of bio-based products in Brazil for consumer and food industries. 
Another type of investment is our investments in Solvay One Planet. And today is a big day for us and for soda ash team. We are announcing the full phaseout of coal at our Reinberg plant in Germany, which will be the first soda ash plant in the world to be powered primarily by renewable energy, using biomass or scrap waste wood chips. This will reduce Solvay's greenhouse gas emissions by 4%, and will establish a new reference as the lowest emitting soda ash plant in the world. It is also an important moment to celebrate today. Three of our businesses, namely Specialty Polymers, Novecare, and Aroma businesses are now 100% sourced by solar electricity in the United States of America. 
Let me now move to innovations. Today, we are also celebrating the official launch of our non-fluorosurfactant technologies, which will be in full production at our West Deptford, New Jersey site by June. At that point, Solvay will no longer use fluorosurfactant process aid in West Deptford or anywhere in the U.S. I'm very proud of our research team, who first tracked this important innovation. I'm also very proud of our sales team for collaborating closely with our customers to qualify the new products in a record time. It's a powerful example of our innovation at work and aligned with our sustainability drivers. 
I'll share one more example of innovation. This one related to the composite material business. I like this one very much because this business has faced significant headwinds in the civil markets, as everyone knows, yet the defense and space markets have remained resilient and a source of innovations for us. Two examples of this are the Vega Rocket and the Vulcan Launcher, which both utilize critical composite materials from Solvay. 
In fact, we don't often speak about the space industry, but it's part of our rich history, and I bet you may know or you didn't know that Solvay materials were on board the Apollo 11 mission that sent humans to the moon for the first time in '69. And we continue to provide innovative solutions to solve the future needs of the space exploration. 
But let me tell you, the most important is our investments, which go beyond capacity and innovation, they are also about our best assets, our people. Of course, these investments are not nearly the same magnitude, but they are included in our plan. Our frontline sales force, global key account managers are developing winning strategies. We ask them to increase share of wallet to value price our solutions and drive innovations that make our customers win and make us win with them. And we have changed our sales incentive plan to align with this principle. 
Finally, we are also investing in more digitizing in Solvay. I believe digitalization will transform the industry and certainly our company. This is going from customer data mining, to manufacturing, to research and innovation, to back office automation using AI and robotization or in cybersecurity, of course, making our operations safe and resilient. 
And now Karim will review in more detail the group's segments and financial performance."

Before I dive into the segments, I'd like to remind you that we indicated in February, a full year EBITDA impact of scope and currency that we estimated at EUR 120 million. And you can see today that Q1 includes EUR 41 million of impact, mainly from currencies, and to a lesser extent, scope impact as 5 businesses were divested during the course of the first quarter. And the last one, in fact, just closed at the end of April. 
Now I will refer you to Slide #7, which provides a view of our market exposures by the group and each of the segments, and this may help you to better appreciate the significance of some of the commentary. In addition, we've disclosed for the first time the regional sales for each business segment, which I'm really hoping gives you more insights, helpful insights, into our global businesses. 
Now I'll start with an overview of the 3 business segments, and I will refer to all figures on an organic basis, by which I mean constant scope and currency. Starting with materials on Slide 8. Net sales in the quarter -- in the first quarter, were down only 7.5% organically versus last year, which is actually quite remarkable given the fact that demand in civil aero was still strong in Q1 2020. The overall achievement reflects strong performance in our Specialty Polymers business with robust demand across various markets, driving 10% organic sales growth in polymers. 
Now this was driven by 19% organic growth in automotive, once again outperforming the market. As you heard Ilham say, we are investing again in this important platform to support rapidly growing demand. As a reminder, you can find Solvay polymers in many area of a vehicle in demanding really challenging under-the-hood applications and in many applications within and surrounding electric vehicle batteries. 
Our leadership position supplying PVDF to batteries continues to forge ahead, sales growth of 80%, 8-0 in the first quarter year-on-year. As a reminder, our polymer solutions for electric vehicles are agnostic to the type of battery. The combination of our global infrastructure and local geographic positions is particularly valued by our customers, and we continue to win new business. 
The electronics market also gained momentum following a strong fourth quarter, with polymer sales growth in electronics of 14%, driven by semiconductor and small device applications. The team continues to win new customers, a recent example being Atlas Copco, where we just won a multimillion-euro contract in semicon fabs. And we have more examples of new business wins where we are replacing metal with our polymer solutions to address the most demanding performance requirements. 
The composites team continues to do a great job in our view, mitigating the headwinds in the civil aero market. As I indicated, sales in this business were down 42% from last year. But more importantly, and for the first time since the second quarter last year, the business delivered sequential sales growth of 8.6% versus Q4. The signs of modest improvements in single-aisle aircraft are there, yet the road to full recovery, as we know, will be a long one. I will also remind you that composites delivered record EBITDA levels in Q1 2020, as its cost reduction programs overcame at that point, volume reductions related to the 737 MAX. 
As you know, our swift cost reduction actions helped to improve operating leverage and resulted in a strong sequential profit increase, which is evident when you compare our results with others in that market. I will also highlight one other achievement and that the composites business has, in the meantime, also successfully implemented SAP continuing to serve customers without fail. Now these projects are complex. They should never be taken for granted, and we're really proud that our team managed to carry this project out on time and on budget, with everything else that they had to contend with. 
To wrap up materials. Segment EBITDA in the first quarter was contained to only a 4.7% decline year-on-year despite a 7.5% decline in sales, and it increased sequentially by 35%, thanks to higher volumes, sustained pricing, and of course, deep cost reductions, especially in the composites business. 
Moving to chemicals. On Slide #9, you see that first quarter sales in the segment are up 6.1% organically. Now soda ash continued to improve sequentially, up 2.2% in the quarter driven by volumes, but they remain 3% lower than Q1 2020 due to lower contract prices, which we had all expected. We see continuing recovery in building and construction, which supported growth in flat glass, whereas demand for container glass, which is used in hospitality, restaurant catering industry remained weak, of course, due to the continued lockdowns in many countries. 
We are also encouraged by the recent export price increase announcements in the market, which will help to restore a more sustainable price level as we capture new volume opportunities. Sales increased 8% in our bicarbonate product line, which incidentally represents about 25% of the soda ash sales. The growth was driven mainly by our Solvay technology, which is used as flue gas treatment for cleaner air. This product reduces emissions of gases, caused by highly polluting facilities such as power plants, waste incinerators and indeed even ships. 
In fact, we're making a small investment with attractive economic returns due to continuing strong demand in our leadership positions. Peroxide sales were down 4.7% organically compared to Q1 2020, reflecting lower volumes in the pulp and paper market in North America, in Europe, which are down about 20% due to the declining graphic paper market. Market conditions remained strong in HBPO, this is used to produce polyurethane firms for industries, including automotive and building. And this part of the business delivered continued strong growth. 
Turning to silica. Sales were again strong, up about 8%, thanks to the continued recovery in the automotive segment and market share gain, including with key customers, driven by interest in our recently launched innovations. Our recent partnership with Bridgestone and ARLANXEO is drawing a lot of attention, as demand for more sustainable solutions is increasing rapidly from tire manufacturers. And these wins and strength in partnerships are helping us to outperform and to further reinforce our silica's business leading position as a sustainable innovator in the tire industry. 
Coatis had a record quarter, with sales up 55% due to strong volume growth and significant progression in prices clearly in favorable market conditions. Volume increase includes both winning new customers and achieving share gains at existing customers. Over the past year, this business has taken strong action to optimize its cost structure in line with the strategy. And it's a good example of how has this has helped to support the improved margins. Coatis is expected to continue to perform well, but we're mindful about also the recent resurgence of COVID cases in Brazil. Just one to watch. 
Overall, the EBITDA of the chemicals segment was up 8.7% compared to Q1 2020 and increased sequentially by 15%, mainly driven by strong results in Coatis and in Silica as well as our Russian recently new joint venture driven by strong demand and high prices of PVC. The combined performance resulted in an underlying EBITDA margin of 30.4% for the segment in Q1. 
Next, I turn to Slide 10, where you can see that the Solutions segment delivered volume growth, sales growth of 6.4%.  Beginning with Novecare, sales, excluding the oil and gas market increased by 13% 1-3, versus Q1 2020, with continued growth in coatings, in home and personal care and in agro markets. Actually, Novecare results would have been even higher, had it not been for the loss of around EUR 20 million in sales related to the winter storms in the U.S. and the subsequent disruption it had on supply chains and on the availability of raw material. We continue to see high demand in the hygiene market with natural and sustainable ingredients being clear drivers of long-term growth. And we are well positioned. 
We've also seen activity levels improve in the oil and gas sector, which grew 11% against the fourth quarter of last year, yet sales were still down [ 21% ] year-on-year. Special Chem had another good quarter with sales up 8.6% against last year, both the automotive and electronic sectors, which today represents about 60% of the sales, at pet chem we were very, very strong in Q1. Now while demand from the semiconductor market is expected to stay strong in the upcoming quarters, we started to see an adverse impact related to the chip shortages around quarter end. And this could result in a temporary dampening of sales in the auto markets in the second quarter. 
In Technology Solutions, Q1 marked a strong rebound in the mining industry, with sales up 14.5% in the quarter. Growth was driven by mine reopenings, particularly in copper, as COVID disruptions were overcome and these were supported also by a higher copper prices, leading to robust demand for our specialty extraction solutions. The business also enjoyed share gains in Latin America. 
In Aroma, sales were down slightly by 1.6% in the quarter after a number of quarters of sustained strong growth. The core business, which led to hydroquinone inhibitors in vanillin is resilient while we are developing further on natural vanillin activity. 
Wrapping up Solutions, the segment enjoyed EBITDA growth of 21% against Q1 2020, reflecting the strong and continued recovery across most of the markets we serve. Focused cost reduction measures also supported the EBITDA margin expansion, up to 19.4% against, you remember, 17% just 2 years ago. This improvement reflects a combination of volume growth and disciplined cost reduction, consistent actually with the optimization mandates that we announced to you with our growth strategy back in November 2019. 
Moving to costs, shown on Slide 11. We continue to make excellent progress towards our targets, and we achieved EUR 80 million of new structural savings in the first quarter, nearly doubling the EUR 45 million achieved in Q4. Now the main areas of delivery included restructuring, reduction in labor costs contributed EUR 32 million. EUR 20 million of which in general and administrative functions and EUR 12 million in industrial functions. About half of these restructuring savings were driven primarily in the composites business. Indirect cost reductions of EUR 40 million were delivered as a transversal programs build momentum and bear fruit. 
Productivity efficiencies continue to deliver on our sites, and they totaled EUR 9 million in the quarter, and these impacts are variable costs. And the EUR 80 million compares with the full year indication of EUR 150 million that you will recall, we announced at the beginning of the year. Now some of the delivery represents continued acceleration and is, therefore, more of a phasing nature. That said, I can advise that we now expect to deliver around EUR 200 million, not EUR 150 million in structural cost savings this year, which would bring the expected cost reduction delivery across both 2020 and 2021 to EUR 375 million once we get to the end of the year. 
The cost reductions that we achieved in Q1, together with the volume growth, supported EUR 583 million of EBITDA, a 10% increase versus Q1 2020. It's actually also worth noting that the EBITDA was around 7% stronger than in Q1 2019, and that's despite the fact that sales were down 3% on an organic basis over that same period. 
Next, I'll turn to Slide 12, and we'll talk about cash. Our performance again was strong, with free cash flow generation of EUR 282 million. As a reminder, Q1 last year benefited from EUR 65 million in one-off taxes -- cash taxes. Taking that into account, we essentially doubled our cash delivery from Q1 2020 to Q1 2021. Our strong EBITDA performance clearly supported that. But in addition, what we see is a EUR 63 million improvement in working capital. 
The evolution of working capital needs reflect the market conditions as they continue to improve. From an operational point of view, we are setting new internal records. For example, overdues, which were a record at the end of last year, progressed even further and now stand at 1.5%, a significant improvement on prior historic levels, which were in the mid- to high single digits. So really, really strong, 1.5%. 
Our working capital sales -- working capital to sales ratio stood at 12% at the end of the first quarter, and that compares to 16% in Q1 2020. And this reflects the structural improvements that we've been sharing with you as we drive, but also it reflects the fact that inventory levels are very low. As we look forward, we will maintain the strong discipline, which is now fully embedded everywhere. 
But we will also not hesitate to invest wisely in inventories and working capital to serve our customers as they grow as well. We also benefited in Q1 from a EUR 63 million improvement simply from the timing, the phasing of our Capex, which were lower in Q1 this year, mainly to industry delays and disruptions related to the weather and logistics. 
Now projects have begun, spend rates will increase this year as we invest to keep up with the growing demand in some key markets, as Ilham described to you earlier. The other drivers of free cash flow include our pension cash outs, and you can see the benefit from the actions we've been taken -- taking in the last 18 months, this quarter, EUR 14 million alone and a lower pension cash cost compared to Q1 2020, which again was lower than prior years. 
Just a few comments on our net debt. At the end of March, our net debt was slightly down compared to the end of 2020. Remember, we paid EUR 155 million of interim dividend in January. Take note of the fact that we made an additional voluntary pension contribution of EUR 102 million in our Belgian plans, which brings the cumulative voluntary contributions to pensions to a total of EUR 768 million. You'll recall, this time last year, that Moody's revised its credit rating outlook to negative about a year ago on Solvay. 
And actually to a large number of companies as well as we were entering this period of uncertainty last year. So we were very appreciative of the fact that on the seventh of March 2021, Moody's recognized our progress with its announcement that stabilized our rating at BAA2, making us amongst the first companies to return to rating stability. After the wave of sector-wide negative rating actions taken last year. 
And with that, I'll hand you back to Ilham, who will provide our outlook for the remainder of the year."

As we emerge from the crisis, it is evidence that our results denotes resilience, which can be seen in our improved operating leverage, which, by the way, is in the top quartile of our peer group and by the continued strengthening of our balance sheet, evidenced by strongly reduced leverage levels. 
I now turn some comments on the outlook for the remainder of 2021 shown on Slide 13. As we look ahead, our outlook assumes the current conditions in our key markets will continue into the second quarter, where we already have good visibility into our order books. Top line trends have continued into April, so we estimate sales performance in Q2 could reach similar levels. Though profitability is likely to be impacted by an expected escalation of raw materials, energy and logistics costs. 
Our current estimates of additional cost is between EUR 150 million and EUR 200 million for the full year after hedging and pass-throughs. To put this in context, this represents about 3% to 5% of the total variable expenses. As you can expect, we have plans to mitigate these inflationary headwinds by raising prices and leveraging our procurement capability, and we have integrated these expectations into our outlook. 
Looking further ahead, I've highlighted that there is limited visibility and there is uncertainty, notwithstanding the encouraging progress in vaccine rollout in parts of the world. Given these factors, we estimate our full year EBITDA to be in the range of EUR 2 billion to EUR 2.2 billion, representing a 10% to 20% growth on an organic basis. 
To put that range into context, our EBITDA in 2019, on a comparable basis, including exchange rate and scope changes, amounts to EUR 2.1 billion. In fact, this implies that we have a good chance to be back to 2019 EBITDA levels by the end of this year, which would mean that our cumulative structural cost reduction actions will overcome the lag of 10% of our portfolio that will take longer to recover. 
We expect also our full year free cash flow to be around EUR 650 million at the top end of our prior range between EUR 600 million and EUR 650 million, as this enables us to continue to invest with discipline in CapEx and working capital and fund higher restructuring costs. You will also remember that the company pays employee bonuses and financial charges in the second quarter, and so you can expect the second quarter cash generation to be seasonally impacted. 
To finish with, I'm very proud of Solvay people achievements, from the mobilization of our teams to the spirit of solidarity throughout the organization. Also, I know that the 6,500 people who were helped by the Solvay Solidarity foundation would join me in expressing their appreciation and deep gratitude for the generosity of our shareholders and directors and for Solvay's top leaders who donated 15% of their salaries last year. 
And our results clearly demonstrate that our strategy is also having a real impact, not only culturally but also on the bottom line. I firmly believe that we are emerging stronger. We are reinvesting in some exciting areas, which will fuel our growth for the years ahead and we will continue our transformation to a simpler, leaner, more specialized organization. 
Thank you very much. And with that, Karim and I will now take your questions."

So I'm just going to take you through a bit of a reminder. We delivered EUR 963 million last year. And as a reference, one needs to make a few adjustments, we highlighted non repeats in relation to working capital and tax, but also recognize that scope and foreign exchange also have their impact. The combination of those 2, and we said that in February, in fact, was that the reference point against which to look forward at 2021 is EUR 650 million last year. 
Now we mentioned a few things that I'm going to take you through the key building blocks. We also said that we're going to be increasing our restructuring costs, our cash spend. Last year, we spent EUR 90 million. And as we accelerate, the momentum we said, we're going to increase that to EUR 150 million, that's a EUR 60 million increase. 
We also said that we're going to reinvest for growth and with the guidance we gave of EUR 700 million, EUR 750 million, which is not changing, means an additional investment of EUR 90 million to EUR 140 million in 2021 compared to 2020. Now against that, we will absolutely benefit from all the actions on deleveraging, and that's worth of EUR 90 million on the other side. 
So if that was all that was happening, there's no other activity change, profits whatever, you can do the math now. Clearly, we are in growth mode, and you can see the first quarter results. The outlook gives you an indication of what that would look like. Now higher profits will require an investment in working capital to support the growth of our customers. But as we've said, we will maintain the discipline. That is the key -- these are the key elements that we believe will absolutely get us to what we now believe is at the top end of the range we gave previously of $650 million. I wouldn't call it prudent, I would consider it to be realistic, given all the moving parts that I've highlighted."

The reason I'm asking is because you mentioned that the earnings level in Q2 would be probably on the same level as in Q1. But normally, there is a seasonality and that Q2 should be better than Q1. So is it right to understand that margin squeeze from raw materials will be the highest in Q2 and then ease then in the quarters to come because then you do the actions and you raise selling price and things like that?"

Well, listen, Martin, we may surprise you, in our case, and we elected to be very transparent with you in terms of our estimates. And this is all estimates, right? In our case, we didn't see much of raw material inflation in Q1. They were in the teens million, right? But we do expect because of our good contracts, et cetera. So that's good news. And we did expect, actually, we entered the year already expecting inflation, right, not at the level it is today. So we expect increases to be relevant in quarter 2, right? 
What will happen in H2? Frankly, I don't have a crystal ball. And I know that many people are looking at H2 to be less inflationary, others more inflationary. I think you know me by now and you know us, we don't put hope in plan. We plan for the worst, and we act on it. So we are, as we speak, driving price initiatives, right, to meet [Audio Gap]  strong demand. Karim can give you a bit of details around the raw material, obviously, logistics and energy bills. 
And let me just tell you the mitigation, what we are doing about it is 3 things. First is pricing and pricing and pricing. You may know that more than half of our business is contracted with mechanical pass-through, so this has to happen. Although this year, we're going to review our formulas and our contracts for the next year. The rest is there to be negotiated. And we are increasing prices as we speak whenever we can. We have a good track record of price power, right, in the company. I would like us to become really a leader in pricing wherever we have unique specialized products and we can -- we bring value to our customers in the value chain. 
The second piece is our leveraging the procurements and the relationship with our suppliers. And you may remember in 2019, and I'm not sure it's resonated with all of you at that time, when we created the W of grow was winning at Solvay ONE, we created a global procurements group, right, which is now led by a new Chief Procurement Officer who joined us a year ago. And leveraging the procurement across Solvay is just an amazing opportunity for us to leverage our relationship with our customers. We are doing the auctions for the first time in our lives, turning it from anecdotes to really materially impacting the bottom line. 
And the last but not the least is innovation. You know that -- what I believe is that innovations are either cannibalizing your existing products, and bringing higher-margin or at the minimum, the same, but also -- and more delivering new businesses at higher margin. Therefore, in the long run, we should not only defend today's margins but although extend them. Maybe, Karim, you can give to the audience some color on the spending."
377837,713094931,2311657,"Solvay SA, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 05, 2021",2021-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Solvay SA","Executives","Sure. Let me start by confirming that Q1, we only had something like just under EUR 15 million of inflationary spend on these variable costs. And again, rather than just talk in very general terms, if I look at logistics, not everything is going up, sea t",290,"Sure. Let me start by confirming that Q1, we only had something like just under EUR 15 million of inflationary spend on these variable costs. And again, rather than just talk in very general terms, if I look at logistics, not everything is going up, sea transportation, is -- there's an uplift in there, near 18%. If you look at current freight rates today, but rail and road are nearer 2% and 5%. If I look at some of the minerals that we purchased for our products, palladium, silica, we're looking at 5%, 10%, type of cost increases. 
A number of the commodities derived from [ crobi ] -- cumene, ethylene oxide, phenol, all of these are important to us. We're seeing double-digit growth there. So fundamentally, what we are doing exactly as Ilham said, is mitigating on 2 fronts: pricing and cost mitigation. There's a lot of effort going into doing that. 
Now the question on phasing is really, really important. Even where we have contractual arrangements that enable us to pass through cost increases, there is a time lag. And it really is almost contract by contract. Minimum, you can expect 1 month to 2 months, but it can take 4, 5 months as well. So it is absolutely reasonable to assume there will be some margin compression in some businesses, to some extent, only to the extent we can't compensate. 
So we can't really give you more color beyond that other than to say that this is what we see today. The environment clearly changes quite fast. It's an inflation environment that everybody is impacted by no doubt you're hearing from others and other industries as well incidentally. And what we intend to do is to overcome."

And I think I mentioned when investments are highly purified issue too, which goes exactly to the electronics segments. And frankly, I'm very excited about that. We have unique technology. We are, by far, a leader, not only in peroxide but actually downstream into highly purified, and we do it with agility and we can localize and customize it. So our customers and more to come in the future. 
On the auto, obviously, indeed, auto has been very strong, right, quarter 4, quarter 1, and we grew about 20% versus Q1 last year. It's a recovery, but as you can read the press and hear the OEMs, it's impacted by the semiconductor shortages here and there. And you've seen many operations and many OEMs' assembly plants closing down because of the semiconductors. So LMC didn't change their forecast so far. Maybe that is not going to hit the double-digit growth. I think we all believe, including researchers who deviate from LMC that Q2 will be still strong, right? 
In terms of, yes, filling the value chain, which was much depleted which is the case for our products in summer last time. Now the H2 next year, I can also see that some people forecast a slower maybe growth rate in the auto industry, right, due to the semiconductor shortages. Okay. But all in all, I think we -- our order book in April is a high records all time, right? So it has been still extremely strong for the next 3 months. We have 3 months visibility beyond that. 
It's a bit of far away, but we are discussing with our customers. We are close to all our OEMs more than ever because they are all switching PV to EV, and most of them have announced 100% even EV vehicles, hybrid or pure electric by 2035. So very, very connected with our customers to discuss future investments in batteries and PVDF. And we take -- I take the opportunity personally at our presidents in Specialty Polymers as well to discuss about how they see the year and getting more clarity on their order book to ensure that we plan accordingly. 
And the last point for Specialty Polymers, which you've seen, has done a great job and double-digit growth, and I'm so excited to see Specialty Polymer for 2 quarters in a row growing and really excited about that. That crown jewel is going to continue delivering. And we also lighten a car.  So we penetrate in an automobile. We don't just sell what exists but one -- the core competency of our business is to replace metal at lower total cost of ownership, you consume less fuel, you emit less CO2, it means cleaner mobility.

Obviously, you've seen, since 2019, we launched the EV battery, and I always believe that this is strategic for Solvay and for materials, not only because of the batteries, I mean our -- I always ask a business, what is your core competency. And our competency, like I mentioned, that we replaced metal for light weight, we also separate in general, that's our -- yes, core competency, technical competency, and we do it in material, in mining, et cetera. 
So PVDF is a membrane. You find it in several applications. It goes to, obviously automotive, as you know, but also to [ reversal ] small vessels in water, which was one of my previous roles in life and other applications too -- it's another technology to hemodialysis in health care. 
So yes, we are doubling down in. We believe that the market CAGR till 2030 will be around 30% minimum. We've seen a major growth in the past years and what has been a bit of a hype and a question mark, it's now confirmed, right, that this growth is sticky. Talking to OEM just early this week because of the shortages, obviously, of PVDF as well have actually supported my conviction that is the right thing to do. 
On margins, this is higher margins than other products we have. And to give you an example, Chetan in this very tight supply demand, because we are almost sold out in this. We have to prune the portfolio, which we did. So everything below 75% contribution margin in that line is out. So we had to cut it, right with long-term commitments on businesses, yes? 
On -- and I know that you know this value chain, basically, and obviously, the question is where is the money? And obviously, we are not assembling batteries, and we are not playing in the cathodes and the anodes, et cetera. We are really circling the batteries from the ingredient perspective and extracting the right value for our business with the right economics. 
The other thing I would like to mention here is that we are agnostic to technology, as much as it can appear a bit surprising. So whatever you talk about including LFP, and there have been a lot of press and news about the lithium iron phosphate is when non-[indiscernible]  material used primarily in China for vessels and in stationary. And it has advantages and disadvantages. Advantages being cost and safety and disadvantages lower energy density. It has been declining option maybe even 2 years ago when I joined the company, and now it's surging again as a viable option to produce maybe low-cost cars and facilitate customer acceptance. 
So we're not impacted like cathode manufacturers at all. At Solvay, we develop guidance for all type of cathodes. Moreover, actually, the good news is that the consumption of binders for LFP is higher than for competing cathode chemistry, like NMC, the nickel manganese cobalt.
So it's just good news. We didn't disclose, Chetan, the numbers, obviously, for competitive reason, but yes, it's growing extremely fast. We doubled our capacity since 2019. Last year, we did a line for [indiscernible] in France, which started January this year. The second line is Chang Shu, which will start in quarter 1, 2022. And we are studying the business case location to be confirmed and determined in Europe, and more soon. Back to you."

Thank you. Great question. Yes, on soda ash I'll take it, Karim. You will remember that big parts of our business is contracted, obviously at soda ash at the fall for the year after. You will remember that good public proxies, the IHS price index, right, this is an average of the prices available in the market. But you can imagine, and you probably know that Solvay is usually on the high end of this index and far better than average. 
For most regions, IHS publishes yearly indexes. And those have no changes -- they rarely change it, and display significant price decrease in '21 versus '20, and this is how we entered the year, right? I mean, by memory, minus EUR 11 in EU and minus $35 in Latam, EUR 13 Asia and EUR 5 in the U.S.. Again, we don't expect those indexes to change. On average, we aim at better than IHS prices in Europe and NAFTA. Most of our prices, not all of them are locked for the year by contract. We have quarterly or semesterly prices only in APAC, LATAM, limited in other regions. 
Obviously, you talked about NSAC, and we read the same thing. They announced in March USD 25, I believe, per ton price or 10% increase on their open volume. Note as well that the sea freight cost increases are mostly in the EU outbound flows. And NSAC is probably less impacted because they operate their own vessel fleet. So we are encouraged by those pricing announcements. Our business will continue to strive for better performance. And you know that we have a great track record of outperforming the industry. 
Obviously, the price decreased year-on-year has impacted the bottom line of soda ash. But at the same time, soda ash is a great -- it's a great business run by top-notch leaders who know how to manage commodities and supply demand. And you've seen it in probably when the Turkish capacity came on stream before my time, and I saw it first-hand since 2 years. And we have -- we started the year already with our cost-saving program, which is well underway, and they are doing what it takes. And thanks to those prices increase and us, like we did last year, we applied the same strategy. There are some volumes we didn't take. We did it in 2020. And I think I was very public about that. We took the same stance. 
We have obviously our key customer strategic, et cetera. But we have some volumes very open, which now we are negotiating at higher prices. Those are the open volumes, and we are very picky, but we continue driving and striving for excellence in cost and productivity. And obviously, you see it in energy transition, not only cutting the CO2, but being competitive because the thing I didn't -- but you will see it in the PR is that Rheinberg, not only the lowest CO2 emitter in the world. 
And it's building a precedent and global benchmark, including versus natural, but it will be competitive versus landed natural in Europe. So that I call it in our old jargon, [ Lagunitas ] for Scientific in Europe. And it's something we -- I'm very proud of the team who works very hard on this. So yes, we have the same observations.

Special Chem is more on the catalysis part of -- and on the ice by the way, until our convention engine and in rare-Earth, right, type of separation. It's a membrane. It's part of our customers, they produce the membrane, but you -- we -- it's part of the material segment, part of Specialty Polymer. 
Where we produce? This is a great news, we produce in all continents, right? We're capable of producing in Europe, in the U.S. and in China for Asia, right? So -- and this is extremely key for our customers, right? It's extremely key. And you know that Europe is putting a lot of money and stimulus into building the value chain after it's -- the areas of batteries, right, and they are keen to have the value chain. And more than just having the batteries, right, assembly. 
So we are working with all the battery players. I mean our -- these are traditional customers, you know them, from LG Chem, Samsung, the Chinese Caitlyn and Panasonic, and you name them, but also the emerging European rights from the Nordics to the French, to the German, et cetera. And we've seen the Koreans investing in Eastern Europe heavily. Germany as well. It's a big investment. France went for a  national alliance called S.A.S. and we are working with them. 
So all of this, it's real. Obviously, if you look at quarter 1, Stephan (sic)[Sebastian], you will see that if you look at hybrids, and even electric, you see that China production is leading the world production followed by Western Europe and the last one is the U.S. approaching 100% quarter-to-quarter. So we are at that, right? 
We are really following the market and even outperforming as we can bundle several technologies and sell it together to the same OEM for lightweight and electrification. And by the way, both go together because if you may remember, a few years back, half of the cost, which more than a few years, probably 6, 7 years, half of the cost of EV car was battery. Now it's probably 30%, 20%. And talking to the OEM, they want it smaller, safer, cheaper, right, and better technologies. 
So this is our generation 2, which we produce all over the world. We're working on generation 3 to 5, 5 being the solid. Now the solid is 2025 plus. So -- but the solid will be a fabulous technology breakthrough because it's pure safety and the most condensed battery you can imagine technologically-wise. 
So we are working on all of those. And our hub -- we have now 3 hubs in the world. The Biden administration is investing in charging station, which is extremely important because that's often the problem. It's not technology, OEMs willingness is that there are not enough charging station along the roads. And Biden has announced a bill or a plan to do so. So we expect that there will be also probably lesser than in Europe or China, an increase in EV also in the United States."

Given the run rate over the quarters last year, it doesn't seem that the comps are getting tougher for that number. So I'm a bit surprised that",93,"Yes. Karim, I'm going back to your comments on cost savings on permanent cost savings of EUR 80 million in Q1. Given the run rate over the quarters last year, it doesn't seem that the comps are getting tougher for that number. So I'm a bit surprised that from EUR 80 million you would assume that we come down to EUR 200 million. Are we -- are you factoring in the reversal of the temporary savings? Or should we assume that there are more costs coming in, including on resources, R&D, et cetera?"

No, fundamentally, what we're saying is this, we delivered EUR 175 million last year, and you can see the buildup of that momentum coming in EUR 45 million delivered last year. And all I really said is we got",343,"No, it's an interesting comment that you make. No, fundamentally, what we're saying is this, we delivered EUR 175 million last year, and you can see the buildup of that momentum coming in EUR 45 million delivered last year. And all I really said is we got about temporary cost savings, et cetera, which I'll get to in a minute. But what we really said is this, we've delivered structural incremental additional cost savings of EUR 80 million. 
Now if I compare it to what we were expecting in our budgets, it is higher. There's an element of acceleration, and that's why I referred to the phasing component. But it's also deeper than what we were expecting, which is one of the reasons we said, you know what, we can do more, we will repeat, let's raise the bar and go from EUR 150 million to EUR 200 million. 
Now if I take your question differently and just look at 2021, clearly, we're battling against inflation, and that is there to erode some of the savings, but that's tiny in relation to the EUR 80 million delivered, looking at nearly EUR 10 million to EUR 15 million of inflationary cost impact, fixed cost impact at this point. 
Last year, where you're absolutely correct. Is that we had just over EUR 150 million of temporary cost savings, which we're not going to see repeated. And in fact, the philosophy is also changing because what we're saying is every single thing that's being delivered will be continued, will be sustained. And that's almost like the step changing gear that was -- is happening right now on the cost agenda. But what I did say is you can't just extrapolate to multiply by 4 the figure of EUR 80 million, precisely for the reasons I've expected. 
And also, to your point, the comps will get tougher because clearly, the programs have built momentum during the course of last year, and you can't maintain the same rate of momentum growth as you go forward as you'd expect."

Well, listen, the call action -- option, sorry, exercised by the European bank for reconstruction and development called EBRD, you saw it in Q1, is related to 52%, right, Karim? 50% -- 52%, what, capital investment with Solvay in the JV, this happened in 2011. We also had in place put on call option arrangements with EBRD, and as a consequence, the contribution to the capital was accounted for as a debt in the group's accounts. And this is in line with IFRS, obviously, rather than equity or minority interest. 
So first of all, at the end of the day, the rationale for doing it now that your question 1 is the option value is close to the floor now and is expected to increase in the future with deleveraging of RusVinyl. And we like -- I mean, we like it, right? I mean, financially, you've seen that, frankly, we didn't extract much dividends from this for many, many years. And I was lucky when I joined the company, we started really getting -- collecting some fruit. 
The second is that the EBRD, and you know their mission, support and influence in Russia is not considered as a dissention anymore. So that's it. I think that's the only reason why we did it now. It makes sense economically."

We've done plus 55% right in quarter 1, and it's mainly driven by, obviously, volumes and pricing, right? And they did really a great job. I'm really proud of them. They leverage on short market opportunities. As other competitors were on force majeure, basically, including the Texas weather challenges. Meanwhile, the raw material costs were still low and fixed cost under control. 
By the way, Coatis since last year, we completely turn it around in terms of cost structure. This is behind us. It's not part of the new program. And I think our President, Daniela did a great job with her team. So we had very positive -- first of all, very positive dynamic, a tailwind from Texas freeze. Ports still need to resume operation, raw material shortages, low inventories, they faced high freight impacted passed directly on our customers. I think the freight cost between China and Brazil was just insane. So we just played what a good business men and woman can do -- a woman, by the way, in this case, but also strong performance beyond the good market dynamics and the team had a good ability to respond promptly to demand while leveraging the price power. 
And the last -- before I answer the sustainability of it is the innovation and the strength of it because we have biosource ingredients. This is our line called OGIO products, which is sold out, by the way. We are -- as I mentioned in my speaking notes that we are investing and doubling downing because it goes to consumer goods and food applications, and it's coming from glycerin. So it's highly wanted by our customers. 
Listen, the situation is still tight so far. So we'll continue enjoying what we'll enjoy. Meanwhile, we are not really sleeping on our laurels. I think the team not only sweating the assets, but also improving the cost position. And wherever we can, we also negotiate longer-term contracts, right, in this favorable environment. So we will share with you in the coming quarter, right, how things evolve for Coatis. Very proud of them and happy that they are under the -- yes, the light during this quarter. So I think Jodi, maybe the right to close the call, if there are no more questions here.  
Well, listen, thank you very much. I think I say this probably [indiscernible] we would like you to remember from us is the resilience and we've proven it last year, and we still continue, right? And we are at the rendezvous of the recovery. And we are just [Audio Gap]  focused and obsessed by customers. And one eye on the telescope, and we are reinvesting as we prepare the rebound for 2022, and that's what we are doing. And thank you for your attention and questions. Thank you. Have a good evening.

Today, we have 32 colleagues who are infected with COVID-19 down from 124 since our last call. Yet we remain very vigilant, given the pickup in infection rates with the delta variant. 
At this time, we continue to maintain our remote working routine globally to ensure high levels of safety, though we are also slowly reopening some of our administrative sites in certain countries with appropriate safety measures in place. Our sole solidarity fund that many generalist investors, along with the management team helped to co-fund has stepped in to support hundreds of families in the past month. We supported hospitals in the communities in which we operate in India, in Bulgaria, Italy, a few examples following the recent COVID outbreaks. 
The fund earlier in the week announced EUR 2 million to support our communities in Europe and in China, who have been touched by the dramatic floods earlier in the month. We are making sure they have what they need and are pleased to have the ability to support our communities in tough times. 
Moving to results. You may recall in our last results call, I talked about the 3Rs, which are representing Solvay, One R for resilience, one R for recovery and one R for reinvestment. We learned through the crisis about the resilience of our businesses and it has been a stress test, as you know, through the COVID-19 crisis, and we see now during this recovery period, the resilience of our people. 
I'm truly proud of them. And I'm truly proud of the team, they do an extraordinary job every day, and Solvay is becoming an even better company and even a stronger company, thanks to their efforts. Our team fully mobilized to take advantage of the recovery that is clearly underway. It is now visible in about 90% to 95% of our portfolio, as you can see in our slide here and as demonstrated by the strong demand environment and supplying growth across most businesses. No surprise, only civil aero, parts of oil and gas and a portion of soda ash remain challenged. 
Moving to Slide 5. Sales in Q2 were up 20% organically. In fact, June sales volume surpassed 2019 level. The surge in demand is particularly strong for our specialty products using automotive, electronics and building markets. For example, sales grew 59% in automotive. This includes all businesses that sell to auto across company, including specialty polymers, special chem, silica and few others. And indeed, I'm very excited to tell you today that specialty polymer sales were at an all-time high this quarter. Another example sales grew 23% in Building & Construction or sales grew 15% in electronics. 
From a geographic view, all regions contributed to the sales growth in the quarter, with Europe up by 23%, North America up by 17%, Latin America up 54% and Asia Pacific up by 12%. Yes, as you are all aware, many industries, including ours, are impacted by the ongoing logistics constraints. For Solvay we estimate about EUR 40 million of missed sales or 1.5% in sales constraint directly related to these issues. And you can imagine we would have had an even stronger quarter, had it not been for these constraints. Cost inflation headwinds in quarter 2 amounted to EUR 50 million compared to EUR 15 million in quarter 1. As expected and it's clear to us now that the majority of the impact will be in the second half and more to come on that later. 
Our teams are working hard to offset the rising costs with price this quarter. As you know, there is a lag between cost and pricing. By the way, we are using this as an opportunity to build a much stronger pricing culture in the company. Our pricing actions continue to be positive, and I can assure you the businesses are highly focused on securing more. Moving to profits. We continue to deliver on our promises. Structural cost savings of EUR 51 million were achieved in quarter 2, totaling EUR 131 million for the first half 2021. We remain on track to meet our EUR 200 million target for the year. 
So all these actions on pricing, on structural costs and obviously the volume growth all translated into an EBITDA of EUR 602 million in the quarter, supported our delivery of 47% EBITDA growth and improved our leading margin actually sustained our quarter 1 EBITDA margin of 24.5%, which is a record. 
Moving to cash. This quarter marks the ninth consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow. We generated EUR 135 million in quarter 2. And in the first half, we are 25% ahead of last year. I'm truly pleased that the focus and discipline we brought to cash management since 2019 is clearly paying dividends and having an impact, and we are therefore raising our guidance more on this later in the call. 
Finally, on Slide 6, our focus continues to shift to reinvesting for the rebound to support future opportunities, and we continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation at the group level, which aligns directly with our growth strategy. We also continue to win new business and form new partnerships that will drive and accelerate future profitable growth in many of our core specialty markets. As you are all aware, it's estimated that 30% of auto production will be electric or hybrid vehicles by 2030. As a reminder, we set up a battery platform in the fall of 2019 as part of our growth strategy, which has been growing exponentially for several quarters, even during the peak of the crisis last year. 
Since then, we have been building partnerships with key manufacturers, with our clients and partners as we position ourselves as a total solutions provider. Our solutions focus on performance, safety, increasing power density and range. As you may recall, sales to batteries have almost doubled since '19, and our sales into batteries in quarter 2 grew by 82% year-on-year. Market growth rate and our leadership position makes this a clear core growth area for Solvay. And many of you have been asking us during the road shows, what gives us our competitive advantage? So let me summarize for you the key elements. 
First, we have a manufacturing presence on 3 continents, which is highly valued by our partners. Second, we are leveraging our broad portfolio of battery solutions that is unmatched in the industry and meet key performance and safety criteria. Most of you, of course, know about our leading position in PVDF, which is used inside the cells, but this is not the only thing we gave or we provide in the batteries. We also supply other polymers like electrolyte materials within the battery. This includes lithium salt and other specialty additives within the special cam business, for example. We also provide thermoplastic polymers, which are used in battery cases that literally circle the battery, and we are even commercializing other technologies in our portfolio to add to our suite of battery offerings. 
And customers are choosing us for all these reasons. And this is in addition to all other solutions we supply to the automotive industry at the service of light weighing along with electrification. Last quarter, I shared with you that we continue to invest in additional capacity. By quarter 1 2022, we will have doubled our PVDF capacity in France and China, and we have even more significant expansion plans coming up, so stay tuned. In addition to our own generation 5 solid batteries development, and I remind you, we are commercializing now generation too but also investors in startups like a company called Solid Power, which recently announced its plan to be listed on NASDAQ. 
We were amongst the founding investors and recently OEMs, including BMW, Ford, have joined us in what we think is an exciting opportunity. Solvay has been collaborating with this entity for several years, and this investment aligns very well with our innovation strategy. And as I mentioned, our value proposition goes beyond batteries and automotive is 1 of the largest markets for Solvay. As we shared in our growth strategy, Light Wan is the other key driver in auto, replacing metal with various polymers and therefore, consuming less fuel, less CO2 or greenhouse emission and enabling clean mobility. And we see this in our increased penetration of specialty polymers in under the hood applications. Some examples that include coolant lines, water pumps and various connectors, all of which require a high degree of performance, thermal properties at lower total cost of ownership, and we have a number of new wins in the second quarter as we turn our sales culture into a handing culture. 
For example, I cannot share customer names, but I will share that in quarter 2 we secured considerable new business Therefore, and to support continued growth, we are, as I said, extending not only PVDF capacity but also our elastomers and sulphone polymers and PVDF capacity. Let me now move to electronics market, which is another exciting market. Sales to these markets grew by 15% in the quarter, marking the second consecutive quarter of double-digit sales in electronics. Demand strength in semiconductors used in fab equipment, which is boosted by 5G and display markets where various polymer materials are widely used propelled us in recent months. We are also continuing to expand our production of electronic grade H2O2. I'm sure you have read about the amount of investments happening with fab manufacturers around $50 billion has already been announced by companies like Intel, Samsung and TSMC. 
All of these are underway already. And this presents a significant growth opportunity for Solvay because we manufacture some of the [ coolest ] hydrogen peroxide available in the world. It's a critical specialty in the production of semiconductor chip as the complexity of computer chips and the miniaturization of the circuit and then increases the demand for high-purity H202 growth. 
Last quarter, I told you about our H2O2 expansion underway in China Today, I'm pleased to share with you that we are also expanding our production in Taiwan with a new joint venture that aims to serve the booming semiconductor industry in that country and region. We are finalizing the agreement in the coming weeks and production will begin in 2023. And as we speak, we are also planning investments in both the U.S. and EU, and we are finalizing those contracts now, and we look forward to sharing more in the coming months on each of these investments. 
So listen, this is -- these are just a few examples of new businesses that address some of our core technologies, areas of investments, and it's clear that we are expanding our share of wallet will continue doing so, and we are winning. 
So now with that, Karim will review with you in more detail, the group segment and financial performance. Karim?"
377837,1674120827,2353916,"Solvay SA, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Solvay SA","Executives","Thank you, Ilham. Good morning, good afternoon, everybody. Before I dive into the segments, you'll remember that we indicated last quarter that a full year EBITDA impact of scope and currency was estimated at EUR 120 million for the year. And you can see",2278,"Thank you, Ilham. Good morning, good afternoon, everybody. Before I dive into the segments, you'll remember that we indicated last quarter that a full year EBITDA impact of scope and currency was estimated at EUR 120 million for the year. And you can see today that Q2 includes a EUR 31 million impact mainly from currencies and to scope, reflecting the 6 business lines that were divested late in Q1. 
I I'll now start with an overview of the 3 business segments, and as usual, we'll refer to figures on an organic basis, namely at constant scope and currency, which obviously eases comparisons. Starting with materials on Slide #8. Sales in the second quarter were up 12% versus the quarter last year, Q2 last year. Sequentially, they were up 3% against the first quarter driven by very strong performance in the Specialty Polymers business. As you heard from Ilham, sales in Specialty Polymers were up 20% and in the second quarter reaching EUR 536 million, a historic record, and this reflects increased demand in multiple markets, including automotive, electronics, consumer goods, and medical equipment. 
By far, the greatest driver was automotive, where we saw polymer sales increased 52%, and that excludes batteries that Ilham already shared with you. Moving to Composites. Sales were only down 8% organically, though you will recall that in second quarter last year, we were only at the beginning of the steep decline that became very evident in the third quarter last year in particular. On a sequential basis, the good news is that sales are improving, albeit modestly, taking 4% against Q1 last year. And that follows a 13% sequential improvement in Q1 relative to Q4 2020. We're really encouraged, and we welcome the recent increases in aircraft order books and the customer news on future rate increases on single-aisle aircraft. 
In the meantime, the footprint optimization and the restructuring programs that we're very quickly put into place last year with 3 site closures, 1 in the U.K., 2 in the U.S. These programs are all on track and that will support a rapid growth in profitability as demand picks up. To [indiscernible] Materials, segment EBITDA increased 35% year-on-year. EBITDA margins improved 600 basis points, primarily due to the higher volumes that I've described in Specialty Polymers, also to sustain pricing as well obviously as significant cost reductions, especially in the composites business. 
Turning to Chemicals on Slide 9. Second quarter sales in the segment were 31% with all businesses, all businesses contributing to that growth. Totaash continued to improve, sales up 10% in the quarter, driven by higher volumes, slightly offset by lower prices. As a reminder, last year, Solvay chose to preserve pricing. At the expense of some volumes, and that strategy has proved its worth over time, it creates value. Now the business is starting to capture that volume again. We see continuing recovery in building and in automotive markets, which support growth in Flat blast, whereas demand for container glass, which is used in hospitality, restaurant catering industry remained soft, which clearly is understandable in the circumstances. 
Sales in the bicarbonate product line, and remember that's about 1/4 of the soda ash business, they were up 4%, and they reached record levels due to strong demand for our Solvay technology, which is used in flu gas treatments in the U.S. to clean air. Peroxide sales were up 17% with a recovery across all regions. Market conditions remained strong in HBPO and that drove top line growth. If you recall, this is used to produce polyurethane films for industries, including automotive and building. So this progress reflects the clear rebound we're seeing in those markets. Strength in this market overcame the continued softness in Pulp and Paper, which is associated with the decline in graphic paper market. 
Our silica business had yet another strong quarter with sales growth of 70%, yes 70%, thanks to strong demand for replacement tires and to the benefits of market share gains that we've announced in our past as well. The penetration of our new sustainable mobility solutions are driving increasing demand and is further reinforcing our position as the innovative marketer. The Coatis business in Latin America is continuing its record run with sales almost double Q2 last year, and that showcases how our leading regional position benefits us and favorable market conditions. We also benefited from strong performance in the Rubena joint venture, thanks to continued strong demand in the face of tight local supply, which is boosting pricing for PVC. 
Looking ahead, however, we remain cautious, and we do expect market conditions to rebalance and therefore, for performance to moderate somewhat for both Aquatis and RusVinyl businesses. Overall, the EBITDA of the Chemical segment was up 49%, thanks to the growth in each business. EBITDA margins were 30.4%, that's 510 basis points higher than Q2 last year. 
Moving to Slide 10. I'll review the Solutions segment and a segment that delivered sales growth of 19% organically in the quarter. Beginning with North Care, sales were up 21%, driven by double-digit growth in Coatings and Industrial products, which, as you're aware, are used in auto and in building as well as construction markets. Permanent Personal Care and agro were slightly down versus last year, mainly because of supply chain and logistic challenges, whereas oil and gas remains stable. In agro, in particular, we formed a new partnership to supply our specialty ingredients for a new sustainable product line that will be launched at this quarter. 
The special chem business delivered sales growth of 33% and reflecting the rebound in the automotive and electronic sector -- sectors I should say, sorry. That said, although demand in auto remained strong in the quarter, we are starting to see some impact from the chip shortages. As Ilham mentioned, growth continues in electronics, driven mainly by semiconductors and by capacitors. Technology Solutions. Technology Solutions sales grew 17% in the quarter. That growth continues to be supported by high demand for copper, also propelled by the electrification trend. We are gaining market share with existing customers, we're also gaining a high share of new mine openings, other product lines, which include phosphorus specialties and additives are also supporting the growth. 
In Aroma, sales were down 5% in the quarter relative to the record levels that we recorded in Q2 2020.  The vanillin business using food, flavors and fragrances remains strong. Wrapping up Solutions. The segment delivered EBITDA organic growth of 42%, against Q2 2020, and that reflects the strong, the continued recovery across most markets. Focused cost reduction measures have also supported EBITDA margins, which amount to 18.5% that's a 250 basis point improvement over Q2 last year. 
Now I'll provide you with an overview of the structural cost savings, which you can see on Slide 11. Progress continued with structural cost savings in the second quarter of EUR 51 million, bringing the half year total to EUR 131 million. There are 3 main areas of delivery in the second quarter. One, restructuring. Reductions in labor costs contributed EUR 22 million in the quarter. Indirect cost reductions were EUR 24 million. And indirect cost reductions, I'll remind you, really begins -- really shows the results from the zero-based budgeting, approach has been in place for a while now, and they're really delivering very, very strong results. That's really encouraging. Productivity efficiencies at our sites continue to yield good results with EUR 5 million in the quarter. Now as a reminder, we previously raised our full year structural cost reduction expectations from EUR 150 million to EUR 200 million. Our performance in Q2 is on track for the EUR 200 million that we've indicated. 
Indeed, we're also taking steps to reinvest with these cost savings in order to accelerate -- further accelerate the group's transformation and matters such as digital, for example. Cumulative cost reductions, we take a step back and look at it over 2020 and 2021 are expected to be around EUR 375 million, which is around EUR 200 million more of -- sorry, EUR 200 million net of all fixed cost inflation, and that further sustains our leading EBITDA margins. In overall terms, strong top line growth, combined with continued cost reduction delivery, and that supported an EBITDA achievement of EUR 602 million, which is a 47% organic increase against Q2 2020. It's also worth noting that EBITDA for the first half of the year was around 5% stronger than in 2019, and that's despite the fact that sales were down 2% over that same period. 
Furthermore, EBITDA margins of 24.5% in the first half of 2021, which is cost leaving that is 280 basis points higher than in the first half of 2019. Now I'm going to turn to cash and invite you to turn to Slide #12. We continue to focus on further improving our cash management. Free cash flow of EUR 135 million in Q2 and EUR 417 million in the first half of the year. Now as Ilham mentioned, this is 25% higher than the first half of 2020 on an equivalent basis, by which I mean you exclude scope, currency and onetime elements. By onetime elements attack particularly the EUR 78 million in one-off tax impacts in Q1 last year. What drove the 25% improvement in cash flow? 
Well, firstly, from a pure operational standpoint, what do we see? We see top line growth, which funded an increase in working capital. Now what I'll highlight is working capital would have increased by around EUR 0.25 billion had we not made further structural improvements. But we have made these improvements, and you can see that evidence when you look at our working capital to sales intensity, which went from 16.3% in in Q2 2020 -- sorry, in both Q2 2020 and in Q2 2019, it was flat at 16.3%. And today, we're were 13.7%. That's a very clear indicator of the improvement. Where does it come from? Well, we've given you examples in the past. I'm going to update you receivables, 8,000 customers, always over EUR 1 billion, overdues are key. They improved from around 6% in Q2 2019 to around 2% today. And in fact, it's systematically around the level of 2%, which is really good. We've also continued to make progress, renegotiating credit with key suppliers and that has improved our average DPOs, days paper outstanding to 52 days, and that compares to 50 days this time last year, and in fact, it compares to 44 days in 2019. So all the programs we launched when we announced the growth strategy are delivering and you can see on the bottom line. If I turn to CapEx, we are a bit behind. We expected to spend about EUR 25 million to EUR 30 million more than we did. Now as you know, we have a target for the year of around EUR 700 million to EUR 750 million. So what happened? Very simply, as we experienced some delays in the first half due to a variety of challenges, including raw material shortages, for example, steel, some COVID restrictions. You remember the the weather conditions in the U.S. had a bit of an impact, but mostly supply chain and logistic issues also had an impact on our key suppliers of equipment, for example. 
Now we clearly expect a spending acceleration in the second half as we have many exciting and important projects on the horizon. Several of them were mentioned by Ilham earlier, and there will be more announcements to come. The benefits from our continued deleveraging of the balance sheet also supports the significant improvement in our cash generation. Indeed, pension and financial charges were EUR 34 million lower than in the first half of 2020, and that reflects these efforts. Against that, you've seen that we're delivering strong cost reductions in relation to restructuring actions, while restructuring costs the cash out has increased by EUR 22 million in the first half this year compared to the first half of 2020. 
And you know that the paybacks are really attractive because they are at around 2 years or less. Another clear indicator is a significant improvement in our free cash flow conversion, which I'll remind you was 26% at the beginning of 2019, and we're now trending towards 32% based on our upgraded guidance for 2021. Finally, a word on our net debt. Globally, the level of debt at the end of June is stable compared to the level of debt at the end of 202. So the strong cash flow that I've described in the first half and the inflows that relate to the 6 divestments I've described, funded both the dividend payments of EUR 388 million, and it funded to EUR 102 million voluntary contribution to our pension obligations in the first quarter of the year. 
Talking of pensions or voluntary contributions since the fourth quarter of 2019 totaled EUR 768 million. As of the end of Q2 2021, pension liabilities amounted to EUR 1.7 billion. That's EUR 1 billion below the level at the beginning of 2019. And there's more, we're actually planning another EUR 300 million in additional contributions to pension schemes in the next 12 months. To say differently, the quality of our portfolio, our class-leading profitability is coinciding with sustained focus on cash generation, on deleveraging and also on optimizing our liability management. And these together are supporting our strong credit ratings, which are stable at BBB and BAA2 at S&P and Moody's, respectively. 
And with that, I'll hand you back to Ilham who will provide our outlook for the render of the year. Ilan?"

I'll now comment on our outlook for the full year shown on Slide 13. Based on our stronger-than-expected results for the second quarter and our continued trends in order books heading into the third quarter, we see solid demand continuing. What has become clearer, however, is that the increase in variable costs related to raw materials and logistics, we play more of a factor in the second half as they may materialize before the full benefit of our pricing actions become visible. So our prior estimates for annual inflationary cost was between EUR 150 million and EUR 200 million, if you may remember. We now see that escalating to between EUR 200 million to EUR 250 million for the full year. To date, we have absorbed about EUR 65 million in the first half, so headwinds here will increase. Our businesses have done a good job mitigating the headwind, and we continue to raise prices in the market to offset as much as possible. As you know, they are often lags which average about 3 to 5 months, and this is what we will be experiencing in the second half. 
On supply chain and logistic bottlenecks, they are likely to continue, and we have mobilized by establishing a dedicated multifunctional team to address these matters on a case-by-case basis and support our businesses, our customers and engage actively with our suppliers. In addition, there is still a degree of uncertainty, as you know, with the COVID variance and its effect on parts of the world as we emerge from the crisis. Now taking all these factors into consideration, we remain confident in our ability to continue to drive organic growth through new business and make more progress on pricing. 
Our upgraded full year EBITDA guidance is now in a range between EUR 2.2 billion and EUR 2.3 billion, representing 20% to 25% growth on an organic basis against 2020 and around 4% against 2019. We also expect to continue to deliver on free cash flow. And now we estimate generating around EUR 750 million for the full year. This is EUR 100 million more than we guided last quarter and 40% more than the equivalent figure in 2019, while continuing to invest in the exciting growth program we shared earlier. As Karim mentioned, this would represent a cash conversion of around 32%. This is higher than our strategic commitment. 
So now as seen in our bottom line results and in our margins, we are emerging stronger from the crisis, and we will continue to focus on transforming to a simpler leaner and more specialized organization focused on profitable top line growth. 
So with that, Karim and I will be happy to take your questions now."

And last year already, we practiced the same taxi, which is we like contracts. And obviously, at the fall, we do, as Karim say the 80-20 rule. So more than 90%. We had a bit less this year. And frankly, when we saw the pressure on pricing already in the fall last year and even before facing an infection environment, we let go some volume at low margins right to our competitors and we were waiting to see more favorable environment. And what happened this year is exactly what happened actually during the crisis is that the market started to be a bit tighter, more spot volume, obviously, were available, specifically the seaborne. And also the North American players started increasing prices. 
So we took back volume, right, at the higher prices and a higher margin than what we would have done or contracted last year. So all in all, our long strategic relationship with our customers, right, we do that, and we honor our pricing. And I think Sateesh is doing a great job, not only in their annual negotiation is taking advantage of favorable intra-region good flow. And obviously, even the Chinese player game plan, which have changed and and margins have been so squeezed that they needed to act on them. So all of this is favorable for us, and we are taking advantage from that as we speak."

Can you just elaborate a little bit across the business, where would you advisers that you might see the most acute margin squeeze in Q3 on that pricing lag? And maybe a bit more fundamentally, you're doing 30% margins in the materials business, a pretty low point in the composite cycle. I guess as part of that, it means that your polymers are probably more of the mix at the moment. But given the structural cost savings you've made, where do you think divisional margins are going to settle out for materials in 2 or 3 years' time once the composites are back at a more normalized level of revenue?"

And as you know, composite materials have gone through an interesting time, but they are exiting as a better business. Yes, you're right, and your observation is good. Actually, I'm happy with what I see specifically in the materials side. I told you guys that our segment materials is our crown jewel, and will bring it from good to great. Composite Material has an annual pricing and long-term deals because of the structure of the businesses with Aerospace. This is formula-based. So by the way, if the raw material increases like epoxy or carbon fiber, it takes it anywhere between 3 to 5 months, right, to apply the pricing. So this is part of the game, yet they are actually doing the right job, okay, for the H1, our pricing -- net pricing, if I take pricing minus the variable cost is more or less breakeven right for Specialty Polymers specifically. 
But okay, they can do better and they are doing better. We have a unique situation in many technologies in many businesses. And as we speak, they are executing the prices increase versus the raw material inflation we are seeing, and we're getting smart and smarter about the availability of raw material and not only raw material, by the way, the logistics as well are also increasing, and we are air freighting. 
We more than doubled our airfreight cost to our customers right to not set up down. So yes, I mean, outside pricing, and we always 1 on our pricing, we are having a conversation with our customers, and this is happening as we speak. And frankly, the question will be at the fall this year about preparing 2022, right? So in terms of raw material in general, just to give you an idea, the increases we've seen are coming from crude oil, right?  Followed by mineral and biochemicals and natural gas. So those are the big categories, right? And about 3/4 of our variable cost comes from energy and raw material, logistics and packaging is about 1/4. And as I mentioned in my speaking and written a remark or speaking remarks, in H1, we have seen EUR 65 million of that inflation. And obviously, we have raised the cost increase to 200, 250 for the year, implying that the H2 cost inflation will be anywhere around 135, 185. 
So yes, it is what it is. Everybody is facing that. And this increase in cost estimates is also making us to actively fight for our margin. Our margin, by the way, have never been that high, 24.5% for the whole group. You may remember in the old recent days, 22% margin was great margin for Solvay and historically, actually above our peers. We'll continue fighting for protecting our margins. And on margin expense and yes, it's about the value proposition and how unique it is. And as we speak, we are pushing a new pricing culture in the company. And do we think we've never done in the past in understanding the value creation for our customers. And I talk to the team wherever we create value, we need to share the value created with our customer and not leave it on the table. So you can count on us to just do that."

In essence, a EUR 130 million sustainable improvement annually. That's what we're targeting. 
Now will there be more beyond that? Honestly, no. I think then we may also have a few opportunistic but nothing of any significance. So which is why we're also focused in parallel on optimizing our liability management. So for example, replacing a hybrid last year that was cost high equipment of 5.1% with 2.5%. All of that is also paying dividends that we see it in the bottom line already. And that's part of the journey as we continue to delever."

To your first point, on that EUR 100 million. The math is not wrong, but it's not complete by which I mean there are certain arrangements in place where we have some deferred proceeds, deferred consideration contingent sets in delivery, and we're confident that we'll get those earnouts.
I'll I know I keep it simple turn out. So no, and the multiples are actually pretty attractive. And the other thing is we've also transferred about EUR 50 million because you're not looking at cash.

I mean, we are still -- I mean, obviously, we had a long historical relationship with Boeing, but  we are also present at Airbus, specifically in the narrow bodies and the single hale where we have highly penetrated. And as we speak, I'm really -- I'",507,"Yes. I mean, we are still -- I mean, obviously, we had a long historical relationship with Boeing, but  we are also present at Airbus, specifically in the narrow bodies and the single hale where we have highly penetrated. And as we speak, I'm really -- I'm excited but what would I see what I hear, we've done what we have to do in terms of turning around the business, exiting 3 sites, which were the lowest return on capital employed without losing the volume and we did it in the middle of our crisis. As you know as well, it takes a long time to gain new share in IO, but we have exciting innovations and not only in the thermoset composite traditional side tech innovation, but we are also now and that's the idea of having materials together, and I'm not sure I announced it publicly, but Specialty Polymers and composites are merging as those 2 businesses. So they have 1 president as we speak. This is new from first of April. And why I did that is to force and to accelerate those exciting innovation, either Specialty Polymer in aerospace, or thermoplastic composites, which I remind you, is the best combination of Specialty Polymers and thermoset composites and bringing recyclable circular polymers to the aerospace industry, which both Boeing and Airbus [indiscernible]. 
We're also growing in defense, right, which is really a great business for us and not only it's a good business, but it's a source of innovation. So all in all, I think really happy with what I'm hearing. We are more optimistic, although in our numbers, we see a recovery by yes, 2023 to the level back of 2019 in build rates, but you now very encouraged to see deliveries of 737 MAX, 105 delivered year-to-date. And there are some estimates out there of 240 deliveries in the year. So this is depleting the stock and the inventory, it's around 400. So it's going to probably accelerate the 737 MAX. And Boeing estimate now is reaching 31 per month production in early 2022, okay. This is what they are saying. And Airbus production were in A320 will increase from current level of 40 per month to 45 per month beginning in Q4 2021. It's also good for us and the A320 estimate is 64 per month by Q2. 
So all in all in all, very happy with all of this. It's going to take time. We did what we have to do with the decisiveness. I'm very proud of the composite teams. And frankly, those numbers to put it into perspective is even more remarkable. As you may remember, 2019 was the best composite year EBITDA composite year in that history. So when we compare our numbers now to 2019, and I was freshly lending in this company, you're right, the team delivered in 2019 in composite record years. So it gives all the dimension of the achievements and the record achievements we are announcing today. Thank you for the question."

And then when we think about sort of life of Solvay aside from soda ash, how do we see the deficit? And what sort of price are you guys planning the next 10 years forward? Because obviously, we are around the price that you guys have in annual report around 50 for the time being. So if you can give any color on that."

Well, listen, 60% of our emissions are more or less coming from Soda ash historic clear rights. You know that the rest is 40 from the other businesses. When I joined the company, and I did my due diligence on the different",709,"Yes. Thank you for the question. Well, listen, 60% of our emissions are more or less coming from Soda ash historic clear rights. You know that the rest is 40 from the other businesses. When I joined the company, and I did my due diligence on the different businesses prior to issuing with the team and sharing with you the the growth strategy, obviously, I looked at the carbon pricing. And you're completely right. I think it's the time of Rodaeven where there were mastering carbon and probably saved the company. 
Now we keep what is good, what works very well. And you're right, hedging on carbon, what we can hedge, we cannot hedge everything. We did that, and we are probably had a 100% of what is eligible to hedging between now and 2025, and we started hedging post-2025. The team is doing it extremely well, I must say, better than any mandate I had in my career, and that's what we've done. 
Number two, when I joined the company, I think it was 1 of my first policy changes in the company, first week or second week of March 2019 after the incentive on free cash flow, which has the internal carbon price into 50. And at that time, we were a bit accused, I mean we debated internally that we were a bit tougher because carbon prices were around 20-ish. But we could see the direction of travel, and we implied EUR 50 per ton internally, which, frankly, now looking back, it was 1 of the best decisions we've made in quarter 22019 because it helps us to make the hedging, protect our competitiveness and do what it takes, which is now a competitive advantage. 
So CO2 is a tangible part of soda ash cost structure to protect our contribution margin, which allow us to secure the long-term investments and continue to serve our customers anticipate as much as possible due to emission price movements and allocation over the coming years. And that's why hedging is there. Today, the 50 is probably going to be north. We are debating that in the company. By the way, we are stress testing the 50 -- 75 a tonne in our STM. So our sustainable portfolio management we stress test a 75. So the question is not 50 or not are we going to go to 75 and 100, and that's what we believe we should be doing. 
Now as you know, Europe is going to the green deal. That is the 55 fit policies published and the ETS and CBA policies going on. In all of this, at the end of the day, we have a clear strategy, sustainability strategy called Solvay One Planet. You remember that in February last year, we joined the Paris agreement in October, the SBTI. We told you that we are going to exit coal, and we have shown you by now that in Reinberg in Germany, we had the first case where we are exiting coal using biomass. So those are wood chips recycled and wasted at a high IRR, so it's higher than WACC. And with the support, obviously, of the authorities leading to the lowest greenhouse emission emitting plant in the world, including versus natural. 
I love this because it's not an anecdote anymore. And what I asked to the ash team is to build an energy transition program. By the way, they are part of the 28 projects we have for the company. Today, we have more or less 1.8 million tons of CO2 already in execution to be -- to exit, right? It's about 1 million cars off the road every year, which we cite, we price and we know how to do them, and we are still collecting more projects. So soda ashes of those, we are negotiating Domba as we speak. I started personally traveling again, and I stopped by [indiscernible] was my first visit after my lockdown on my second shot of vaccine, and they are preparing the switch and the exit of coal. And I know that Soda ash team and our President, is also negotiating in TerelaVega in Spain. So yes, it's just part of Solvay One Plan, and we are executing flawlessly."

I think you please all right. Yes. Well, listen, the missed sales, I mean, it's due mainly to logistic constraint, right, in quarter 2, everybody is struggling these days, and the situation is the following we've seen, frankly, is unprecedented in the career. We have port congestions, container shortages and low bill rates, as you know, for ships are closing a large capacity shortage and rapidly increasing spot prices, right? So what we call the FCL, the overseas container transport market is at its highest point in history. And key indicators, frankly, personally, I mean, I may be wrong, there will be no major breakthrough expected before 2022 on this tightness. So we need to live with that. 
Now how we do -- so the 50 million, yes, I mean, some of it is going to travel to quarter 2, but some of it as well may actually disappear and so what because customers may not be waiting and if a supplier has better access to non-congested port, they may actually pick up the goods and be it. So actually, the interesting question, Lisa, what we are doing about that? And I asked to put a war room in place. I was not to say war room. So it's taskforce in place to secure operation capacity in the market right? And this is my multifunctional team. We have logistics experts, we have our procurement team. We have our suppliers supporting us. And they can change arrival for they can go with the raw material from a country to another because it's easier to do.

Today, we have 32 colleagues who are infected with COVID-19 down from 124 since our last call. Yet we remain very vigilant, given the pickup in infection rates with the delta variant. 
At this time, we continue to maintain our remote working routine globally to ensure high levels of safety, though we are also slowly reopening some of our administrative sites in certain countries with appropriate safety measures in place. Our Solvay Solidarity Fund that many generous investors, along with the management team helped to co-fund has stepped in to support hundreds of families in the past month. We supported hospitals in the communities in which we operate in India, in Bulgaria, Italy, a few examples following the recent COVID outbreaks. 
The fund earlier in the week announced EUR 2 million to support our communities in Europe and in China, who have been touched by the dramatic floods earlier in the month. We are making sure they have what they need and are pleased to have the ability to support our communities in tough times. 
Moving to results. You may recall in our last results call, I talked about the 3Rs, which are representing Solvay. One R for resilience, one R for recovery and one R for reinvestment. We learned through the crisis about the resilience of our businesses and it has been a stress test, as you know, through the COVID-19 crisis, and we see now during this recovery period, the resilience of our people. 
I'm truly proud of them. And I'm truly proud of the team, they do an extraordinary job every day, and Solvay is becoming an even better company and even a stronger company, thanks to their efforts. Our team fully mobilized to take advantage of the recovery that is clearly underway. It is now visible in about 90% to 95% of our portfolio, as you can see in our slide here and as demonstrated by the strong demand environment and supplying growth across most businesses. No surprise, only Civil Aero, parts of Oil and Gas and a portion of Soda Ash remain challenged. 
Moving to Slide 5. Sales in Q2 were up 20% organically. In fact, June sales volume surpassed 2019 level. The surge in demand is particularly strong for our specialty products using automotive, electronics and building markets. For example, sales grew 59% in automotive. This includes all businesses that sell to auto across company, including specialty polymers, special chem, silica and few others. And indeed, I'm very excited to tell you today that specialty polymer sales were at an all-time high this quarter. Another example, sales grew 23% in Building & Construction or sales grew 15% in Electronics. 
From a geographic view, all regions contributed to the sales growth in the quarter, with Europe up by 23%, North America up by 17%, Latin America up 54% and Asia Pacific up by 12%. Yes, as you are all aware, many industries, including ours, are impacted by the ongoing logistics constraints. For Solvay we estimate about EUR 40 million of missed sales or 1.5% in sales constraint directly related to these issues. And you can imagine we would have had an even stronger quarter, had it not been for these constraints. Cost inflation headwinds in quarter 2 amounted to EUR 50 million compared to EUR 15 million in quarter 1. As expected and it's clear to us now that the majority of the impact will be in the second half and more to come on that later. 
Our teams are working hard to offset the rising costs with price this quarter. As you know, there is a lag between cost and pricing. By the way, we are using this as an opportunity to build a much stronger pricing culture in the company. Our pricing actions continue to be positive, and I can assure you the businesses are highly focused on securing more. Moving to profits. We continue to deliver on our promises. Structural cost savings of EUR 51 million were achieved in quarter 2, totaling EUR 131 million for the first half 2021. We remain on track to meet our EUR 200 million target for the year. 
So all these actions on pricing, on structural costs and obviously the volume growth all translated into an EBITDA of EUR 602 million in the quarter, supported our delivery of 47% EBITDA growth and improved our leading margin, actually sustained our quarter 1 EBITDA margin of 24.5%, which is a record. 
Moving to cash. This quarter marks the ninth consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow. We generated EUR 135 million in quarter 2. And in the first half, we are 25% ahead of last year. I'm truly pleased that the focus and discipline we brought to cash management since 2019 is clearly paying dividends and having an impact, and we are therefore raising our guidance more on this later in the call. 
Finally, on Slide 6, our focus continues to shift to reinvesting for the rebound to support future opportunities, and we continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation at the group level, which aligns directly with our growth strategy. We also continue to win new business and form new partnerships that will drive and accelerate future profitable growth in many of our core specialty markets. As you are all aware, it's estimated that 30% of auto production will be electric or hybrid vehicles by 2030. As a reminder, we set up a battery platform in the fall of 2019 as part of our growth strategy, which has been growing exponentially for several quarters, even during the peak of the crisis last year. 
Since then, we have been building partnerships with key manufacturers, with our clients and partners as we position ourselves as a total solutions provider. Our solutions focus on performance, safety, increasing power density and range. As you may recall, sales to batteries have almost doubled since '19, and our sales into batteries in quarter 2 grew by 82% year-on-year. Market growth rate and our leadership position makes this a clear core growth area for Solvay. And many of you have been asking us during the road shows, what gives us our competitive advantage? So let me summarize for you the key elements. 
First, we have a manufacturing presence on 3 continents, which is highly valued by our partners. Second, we are leveraging our broad portfolio of battery solutions that is unmatched in the industry and meets key performance and safety criteria. Most of you, of course, know about our leading position in PVDF, which is used inside the cells, but this is not the only thing we gave or we provide in the batteries. We also supply other polymers like electrolyte materials within the battery. This includes lithium salt and other specialty additives within the Special Chem business, for example. We also provide thermoplastic polymers, which are used in battery cases that literally circle the battery, and we are even commercializing other technologies in our portfolio to add to our suite of battery offerings. 
And customers are choosing us for all these reasons. And this is in addition to all other solutions we supply to the automotive industry at the service of light weighing along with electrification. Last quarter, I shared with you that we continued to invest in additional capacity. By quarter 1 2022, we will have doubled our PVDF capacity in France and China, and we have even more significant expansion plans coming up, so stay tuned. In addition to our own generation 5 solid batteries development, and I remind you, we are commercializing now generation too but also investors in startups like a company called Solid Power, which recently announced its plan to be listed on NASDAQ. 
We were amongst the founding investors and recently OEMs, including BMW, Ford, have joined us in what we think is an exciting opportunity. Solvay has been collaborating with this entity for several years, and this investment aligns very well with our innovation strategy. And as I mentioned, our value proposition goes beyond batteries and automotive is one of the largest markets for Solvay. As we shared in our growth strategy, Light Wayne is the other key driver in auto, replacing metal with various polymers and therefore, consuming less fuel, emitting less CO2 or greenhouse gas emission and enabling clean mobility. And we see this in our increased penetration of specialty polymers in under the hood applications. Some examples that include coolant lines, water pumps and various connectors, all of which require a high degree of performance, thermal properties at lower total cost of ownership, and we have a number of new wins in the second quarter as we turn our sales culture into a hunting culture. 
For example, I cannot share customer names, but I will share that in quarter 2 we secured considerable new business, therefore, and to support continued growth, we are, as I said, expanding not only PVDF capacity but also our elastomers and sulphone polymers and PVDC capacity. Let me now move to electronics market, which is another exciting market. Sales to these markets grew by 15% in the quarter, marking the second consecutive quarter of double-digit sales in electronics. Demand strength in semiconductors used in fab equipment, which is boosted by 5G and display markets where various polymer materials are widely used propelled us in recent months. We are also continuing to expand our production of electronic grade H2O2. I'm sure you have read about the amount of investments happening with fab manufacturers around $50 billion has already been announced by companies like Intel, Samsung and TSMC. 
All of these are underway already. And this presents a significant growth opportunity for Solvay because we manufacture some of the purest hydrogen peroxide available in the world. It's a critical specialty in the production of semiconductor chip as the complexity of computer chips and the miniaturization of the circuit in them increases the demand for high-purity H202 growth. 
Last quarter, I told you about our H2O2 expansion underway in China. Today, I'm pleased to share with you that we are also expanding our production in Taiwan with a new joint venture that aims to serve the booming semiconductor industry in that country and region. We are finalizing the agreement in the coming weeks and production will begin in 2023. And as we speak, we are also planning investments in both the U.S. and EU, and we are finalizing those contracts now, and we look forward to sharing more in the coming months on each of these investments. 
So listen, this is -- these are just a few examples of new businesses that address some of our core technologies, areas of investments, and it's clear that we are expanding our share of wallet will continue doing so, and we are winning. 
So now with that, Karim will review with you in more detail, the group segment and financial performance. Karim?"
377837,1674120827,2354423,"Solvay SA, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","Solvay SA","Executives","Thank you, Ilham. Good morning, good afternoon, everybody. Before I dive into the segments, you'll remember that we indicated last quarter that a full year EBITDA impact of scope and currency was estimated at EUR 120 million for the year. And you can see",2282,"Thank you, Ilham. Good morning, good afternoon, everybody. Before I dive into the segments, you'll remember that we indicated last quarter that a full year EBITDA impact of scope and currency was estimated at EUR 120 million for the year. And you can see today that Q2 includes a EUR 31 million impact mainly from currencies and to scope, reflecting the 6 business lines that were divested late in Q1. 
I'll now start with an overview of the 3 business segments, and as usual, we'll refer to figures on an organic basis, namely at constant scope and currency, which obviously eases comparisons. Starting with materials on Slide #8. Sales in the second quarter were up 12% versus the quarter last year, Q2 last year. Sequentially, they were up 3% against the first quarter driven by very strong performance in the Specialty Polymers business. As you heard from Ilham, sales in Specialty Polymers were up 20% and in the second quarter reaching EUR 536 million, a historic record, and this reflects increased demand in multiple markets, including automotive, electronics, consumer goods, and medical equipment. 
By far, the greatest driver was automotive, where we saw polymer sales increased 52%, and that excludes batteries that Ilham already shared with you. Moving to Composites. Sales were only down 8% organically, though you will recall that in second quarter last year, we were only at the beginning of the steep decline that became very evident in the third quarter last year in particular. On a sequential basis, the good news is that sales are improving, albeit modestly, talking 4% against Q1 last year. And that follows a 13% sequential improvement in Q1 relative to Q4 2020. We're really encouraged, and we welcome the recent increases in aircraft order books and the customer news on future rate increases on single-aisle aircraft. 
In the meantime, the footprint optimization and the restructuring programs that were very quickly put into place last year with 3 site closures, 1 in the U.K., 2 in the U.S. These programs are all on track and that will support a rapid growth in profitability as demand picks up. To wrap up Materials, segment EBITDA increased 35% year-on-year. EBITDA margins improved 600 basis points, primarily due to the higher volumes that I've described in Specialty Polymers, also to sustain pricing as well obviously as significant cost reductions, especially in the Composites business. 
Turning to Chemicals on Slide #9. Second quarter sales in the segment were up 31% with all businesses, all businesses contributing to that growth. Soda Ash continued to improve, sales up 10% in the quarter, driven by higher volumes, slightly offset by lower prices. As a reminder, last year, Solvay chose to preserve pricing. At the expense of some volumes, and that strategy has proved its worth over time, it creates value. Now the business is starting to capture that volume again. We see continuing recovery in building and in automotive markets, which support growth in flat glass, whereas demand for container glass, which is used in hospitality, restaurant catering industry remained soft, which clearly is understandable in the circumstances. 
Sales in the bicarbonate product line, and remember that's about 1/4 of the Soda Ash business, they were up 4%, and they reached record levels due to strong demand for our Solvay technology, which is used in flu gas treatments in the U.S. to clean air. Peroxide sales were up 17% with a recovery across all regions. Market conditions remained strong in HPPO and that drove top line growth. If you recall, this is used to produce polyurethane films for industries, including automotive and building. So this progress reflects the clear rebound we're seeing in those markets. Strength in this market overcame the continued softness in Pulp and Paper, which is associated with the decline in graphic paper market. 
Our Silica business had yet another strong quarter with sales growth of 70%, yes 70%, thanks to strong demand for replacement tires and to the benefits of market share gains that we've announced in our past as well. The penetration of our new sustainable mobility solutions are driving increasing demand and is further reinforcing our position as the innovative market leader. The Coatis business in Latin America is continuing its record run with sales almost double Q2 last year, and that showcases how our leading regional position benefits us in favorable market conditions. We also benefited from strong performance in the RusVinyl joint venture, thanks to continued strong demand in the face of tight local supply, which is boosting pricing for PVC. 
Looking ahead, however, we remain cautious, and we do expect market conditions to rebalance and therefore, for performance to moderate somewhat for both Coatis and RusVinyl businesses. Overall, the EBITDA of the Chemical segment was up 49%, thanks to the growth in each business. EBITDA margins were 30.4%, that's 510 basis points higher than Q2 last year. 
Moving to Slide 10. I'll review the Solutions segment and a segment that delivered sales growth of 19% organically in the quarter. Beginning with Novecare, sales were up 21%, driven by double-digit growth in coatings and industrial products, which, as you're aware, are used in auto and in building as well as construction markets. Permanent Personal Care and Agro were slightly down versus last year, mainly because of supply chain and logistic challenges, whereas Oil and Gas remains stable. In Agro, in particular, we formed a new partnership to supply our specialty ingredients for a new sustainable product line that will be launched at this quarter. 
The Special Chem business delivered sales growth of 33%, reflecting the rebound in the automotive and electronic sector -- sectors I should say, sorry. That said, although demand in auto remained strong in the quarter, we are starting to see some impact from the chip shortages. As Ilham mentioned, growth continues in electronics, driven mainly by semiconductors and by capacitors. Technology Solutions. Technology Solutions sales grew 17% in the quarter. That growth continues to be supported by high demand for copper, also propelled by the electrification trend. We are gaining market share with existing customers, we're also gaining a high share of new mine openings, other product lines, which include phosphorus, specialties and additives are also supporting the growth. 
In Aroma, sales were down 5% in the quarter relative to the record levels that we recorded in Q2 2020.  The vanillin business using food, flavors and fragrances remains strong. Wrapping up Solutions. The segment delivered EBITDA organic growth of 42%, against Q2 2020, and that reflects the strong, the continued recovery across most markets. Focused cost reduction measures have also supported EBITDA margins, which amount to 18.5% that's a 250 basis point improvement over Q2 last year. 
Now I'll provide you with an overview of the structural cost savings, which you can see on Slide 11. Progress continued with structural cost savings in the second quarter of EUR 51 million, bringing the half year total to EUR 131 million. There are 3 main areas of delivery in the second quarter. One, restructuring. Reductions in labor costs contributed to EUR 22 million in the quarter. Indirect cost reductions were EUR 24 million. And indirect cost reductions, I'll remind you, really begins -- really shows the results from the zero-based budgeting approach, has been in place for a while now, and they're really delivering very, very strong results. That's really encouraging. Productivity efficiencies at our sites continue to yield good results with EUR 5 million in the quarter. Now as a reminder, we previously raised our full year structural cost reduction expectations from EUR 150 million to EUR 200 million. Our performance in Q2 is on track for the EUR 200 million that we've indicated. 
Indeed, we're also taking steps to reinvest with these cost savings in order to accelerate -- further accelerate the group's transformation in matters such as digital, for example. Cumulative cost reductions, we take a step back and look at it over 2020 and 2021 are expected to be around EUR 375 million, which is around EUR 200 million more of -- sorry, EUR 200 million net of all fixed cost inflation, and that further sustains our leading EBITDA margins. In overall terms, strong top line growth, combined with continued cost reduction delivery, and that supported an EBITDA achievement of EUR 602 million, which is a 47% organic increase against Q2 2020. It's also worth noting that EBITDA for the first half of the year was around 5% stronger than in 2019, and that's despite the fact that sales were down 2% over that same period. 
Furthermore, EBITDA margins of 24.5% in the first half of 2021, which is cost leading that is 280 basis points higher than in the first half of 2019. Now I'm going to turn to cash and invite you to turn to Slide #12. We continue to focus on further improving our cash management. Free cash flow of EUR 135 million in Q2 and EUR 417 million in the first half of the year. Now as Ilham mentioned, this is 25% higher than the first half of 2020 on an equivalent basis, by which I mean you exclude scope, currency and onetime elements. By onetime elements, i tag particularly the EUR 78 million in one-off tax impacts in Q1 last year. What drove the 25% improvement in cash flow? 
Well, firstly, from a pure operational standpoint, what do we see? We see top line growth, which funded an increase in working capital. Now what I'll highlight is working capital would have increased by around EUR 0.25 billion had we not made further structural improvements. But we have made these improvements, and you can see that evidence when you look at our working capital to sales intensity, which went from 16.3% in Q2 2020 -- sorry, in both Q2 2020 and in Q2 2019, it was flat at 16.3%. And today, where are we? We're at 13.7%. That's a very clear indicator of the improvement. Where does it come from? Well, we've given you examples in the past. I'm going to update you. Receivables, 8,000 customers, always over EUR 1 billion, overdues are key. They improved from around 6% in Q2 2019 to around 2% today. And in fact, it's systematically around the level of 2%, which is really good. We've also continued to make progress, renegotiating credit with key suppliers and that has improved our average DPOs, days paper outstanding to 52 days, and that compares to 50 days this time last year, and in fact, it compares to 44 days in 2019. So all the programs we launched when we announced the growth strategy are delivering and you can see on the bottom line. If I turn to CapEx, we are a bit behind. We expected to spend about EUR 25 million to EUR 30 million more than we did. Now as you know, we have a target for the year of around EUR 700 million to EUR 750 million. So what happened? Very simply, as we experienced some delays in the first half due to a variety of challenges, including raw material shortages, for example, steel, some COVID restrictions. You remember the  weather conditions in the U.S. had a bit of an impact, but mostly supply chain and logistic issues also had an impact on our key suppliers of equipment, for example. 
Now we clearly expect a spending acceleration in the second half as we have many exciting and important projects on the horizon. Several of them were mentioned by Ilham earlier, and there will be more announcements to come. The benefits from our continued deleveraging of the balance sheet also supports the significant improvement in our cash generation indeed. Pension and financial charges were EUR 34 million lower than in the first half of 2020, and that reflects these efforts. Against that, you've seen that we're delivering strong cost reductions in relation to restructuring actions, while restructuring costs, the cash out has increased by EUR 22 million in the first half this year compared to the first half of 2020. 
And you know that the paybacks are really attractive because they are at around 2 years or less. Another clear indicator is a significant improvement in our free cash flow conversion, which I'll remind you was 26% at the beginning of 2019, and we're now trending towards 32% based on our upgraded guidance for 2021. Finally, a word on our net debt. Globally, the level of debt at the end of June is stable compared to the level of debt at the end of 2020. So the strong cash flow that I've described in the first half and the inflows that relate to the 6 divestments I've described, funded both the dividend payments of EUR 388 million, and it funded to EUR 102 million voluntary contribution to our pension obligations in the first quarter of the year. 
Talking of pensions, our voluntary contributions since the fourth quarter of 2019 totaled EUR 768 million. As of the end of Q2 2021, pension liabilities amounted to EUR 1.7 billion. That's EUR 1 billion below the level at the beginning of 2019. And there's more, we're actually planning another EUR 300 million in additional contributions to pension schemes in the next 12 months. To say differently, the quality of our portfolio, our class-leading profitability is coinciding with sustained focus on cash generation, on deleveraging and also on optimizing our liability management. And these together are supporting our strong credit ratings, which are stable at BBB and Baa2 at S&P and Moody's, respectively. 
And with that, I'll hand you back to Ilham who will provide our outlook for the remainder of the year. Ilham?"

I'll now comment on our outlook for the full year shown on Slide 13. Based on our stronger-than-expected results for the second quarter and our continued trends in order books heading into the third quarter, we see solid demand continuing. What has become clearer, however, is that the increase in variable costs related to raw materials and logistics, we play more of a factor in the second half as they may materialize before the full benefit of our pricing actions become visible. So our prior estimates for annual inflationary cost was between EUR 150 million and EUR 200 million if you may remember. We now see that escalating to between EUR 200 million to EUR 250 million for the full year. To date, we have absorbed about EUR 65 million in the first half, so headwinds here will increase. Our businesses have done a good job mitigating the headwind, and we continue to raise prices in the market to offset as much as possible. As you know, there are often lags which average about 3 to 5 months, and this is what we will be experiencing in the second half. 
On supply chain and logistic bottlenecks, they are likely to continue, and we have mobilized by establishing a dedicated multifunctional team to address these matters on a case-by-case basis and support our businesses, our customers and engage actively with our suppliers. In addition, there is still a degree of uncertainty, as you know, with the COVID variants and its effect on parts of the world as we emerge from the crisis. Now taking all these factors into consideration, we remain confident in our ability to continue to drive organic growth through new business and make more progress on pricing. 
Our upgraded full year EBITDA guidance is now in a range between EUR 2.2 billion and EUR 2.3 billion, representing 20% to 25% growth on an organic basis against 2020 and around 4% against 2019. We also expect to continue to deliver on free cash flow. And now we estimate generating around EUR 750 million for the full year. This is EUR 100 million more than we guided last quarter and 40% more than the equivalent figure in 2019, while continuing to invest in the exciting growth program we shared earlier. As Karim mentioned, this would represent a cash conversion of around 32%. This is higher than our strategic commitment. 
So now as seen in our bottom line results and in our margins, we are emerging stronger from the crisis, and we will continue to focus on transforming to a simpler, leaner and more specialized organization focused on profitable top line growth. 
So with that, Karim and I will be happy to take your questions now."

And last year already, we practiced the same tactic, which is we like contracts. And obviously, at the fall, we do, as Karim say the 80-20 rule. So more than 90%. We had a bit less this year. And frankly, when we saw the pressure on pricing already in the fall last year and even before facing an inflationary environment, we let go some volume at low margins right to our competitors and we were waiting to see more favorable environment. And what happened this year is exactly what happened actually during the crisis is that the market started to be a bit tighter, more spot volume, obviously, were available, specifically the seaborne. And also the North American players started increasing prices. 
So we took back volume, right, at the higher prices and a higher margin than what we would have done or contracted last year. So all in all, our long strategic relationship with our customers, right, we do that, and we honor our pricing. And I think Soda Ash is doing a great job, not only in their annual negotiation is taking advantage of favorable intra-region good flow. And obviously, even the Chinese player, game plan, we have changed and margins have been so squeezed that they needed to act on them. So all of this is favorable for us, and we are taking advantage from that as we speak."

Can you just elaborate a little bit across the business, where would you advise us that you might see the most acute margin squeeze in Q3 on that pricing lag? And maybe a bit more fundamentally, you're doing 30% margins in the Materials business, that's a pretty low point in the composite cycle. I guess as part of that, it means that your polymers are probably more of the mix at the moment. But given the structural cost savings you've made, where do you think divisional margins are going to settle out for Materials in 2 or 3 years' time once the Composites are back at a more normalized level of revenue?"

And as you know, Composite Materials have gone through an interesting time, but they are exiting as a better business. Yes, you're right, and your observation is good. Actually, I'm happy with what I see specifically in the Materials side. I told you guys that our segment Materials is our crown jewel, and will bring it from good to great. Composite Material has an annual pricing and long-term deals because of the structure of the businesses with Aerospace. This is formula-based. So by the way, if the raw material increases like epoxy or carbon fiber, it takes it anywhere between 3 to 5 months, right, to apply the pricing. So this is part of the game, yet they are actually doing the right job, okay, for the H1, our pricing -- net pricing, if I take pricing minus the variable cost is more or less breakeven, right, for Specialty Polymers specifically. 
But okay, they can do better and they are doing better. We have a unique situation in many technologies in many businesses. And as we speak, they are executing the prices increase versus the raw material inflation we are seeing, and we're getting smart and smarter about the availability of raw material and not only raw material, by the way, the logistics as well are also increasing, and we are air freighting. 
We more than doubled our airfreight cost to our customers, right, to not set that down. So yes, I mean, outside pricing, and we always own on our pricing, we are having a conversation with our customers, and this is happening as we speak. And frankly, the question will be at the fall this year about preparing 2022, right? So in terms of raw material in general, just to give you an idea, the increases we've seen are coming from crude oil, right? Followed by mineral and biochemicals and natural gas. So those are the big categories, right? And about 3/4 of our variable cost comes from energy and raw material, logistics and packaging is about 1/4. And as I mentioned in my speaking and written remark -- or speaking remarks, in H1, we have seen EUR 65 million of that inflation. And obviously, we have raised the cost increase to EUR 200 million, EUR 250 million for the year, implying that the H2 cost inflation will be anywhere around EUR 135 million, EUR 185 million.. 
So yes, it is what it is. Everybody is facing that. And this increase in cost estimates is also making us to actively fight for our margin. Our margin, by the way, have never been that high, 24.5% for the whole group. You may remember in the old recent days, 22% margin was great margin for Solvay and historically, actually above our peers. We'll continue fighting for protecting our margins. And on margin expense and yes, it's about the value proposition and how unique it is. And as we speak, we are pushing a new pricing culture in the company. And do we think we've never done in the past in understanding the value creation for our customers. And I talk to the team wherever we create value, we need to share the value created with our customer and not leave it on the table. So you can count on us to just do that."

The estimate going forward, rightly taking into account what we've done and what we're planning, we'll take that to an acumen of around EUR 80 million, plus or minus EUR 5 million to EUR 10 million, let's say, for the mid- to long term, at least as far as I can see this, 5 to 10 years from now, we're talking of around EUR 80 million. In essence, a EUR 130 million sustainable improvement annually. That's what we're targeting. 
Now will there be more beyond that? Honestly, no. I think then we may also have a few opportunistic but nothing of any significance. So which is why we're also focused in parallel on optimizing our liability management. So for example, replacing a hybrid last year that was cost high equipment of 5.1% with 2.5%. All of that is also paying dividends that we see it in the bottom line already. And that's part of the journey as we continue to delever."

Or is there -- are there any changes in any of the assumptions on free cash flow? Because I would have thought with higher earnings, maybe the working capital would have gone up more than was previously thought. So just any color on that would be useful."

One, it reflects the profit upgrade. Absolutely, that's the -- fundamentally the biggest driver. But the other thing also reflects the fact that our working capital management is really, really tight. I don't expect a lot more but we will continue with the level that we've achieved. That really is it, and there's nothing at all of any onetime or anything else. It's a very, very clean set of sustainable numbers that we're dragging here. 
To your first point, on that EUR 100 million. The math is not wrong, but it's not complete by which I mean there are certain arrangements in place where we have some deferred proceeds, deferred consideration contingent sets in delivery, and we're confident that we'll get those earnouts.
I'll -- I know, I'll keep it simple, ""turn outs"". So no, and the multiples are actually pretty attractive. And the other thing is we've also transferred about EUR 50 million because you're not looking at cash. You're looking at the enterprise value. So our provisions, pensions and environmental also go down by EUR 50 million. So if you look at multiples, you need to factor that in as well, of course."

Free cash flow is important to me in good times and in the bad times. And what happened last year is that frankly, whatever we told you at the full 2019 as part of the growth strategy has been accelerated, and we gained probably 2 years, thanks to COVID-19 crisis where we accelerated our reforms. And yes, Chetan, I will probably deviate from my principles and the first time I do it in my career, this is going to be sustainable above 30% going forward. 
Obviously, we had some very abnormal savings in the past years, et cetera. I challenged the team this year to turn the tamper into structure. They are doing a fabulous job, and we are accelerating our programs, including the way to structure our company to better serve our strategy. And obviously, we want to also invest in growth. And you've seen the list in -- although it's selective and we'll do it with discipline of capital -- on capital deployment, we have some very cool, exciting growth projects where we are investing in and we are, as we speak, negotiating the final terms of the contracts, and we'll come back to you in the coming months. 
So yes, the plan is to be sustainable in the north of 30% going forward."

And as we speak, I'm really -- I'm excited but what would I see, what I hear, we've done what we have to do in terms of turning around the business, exiting 3 sites, which were the lowest return on capital employed without losing the volume and we did it in the middle of our crisis. As you know as well, it takes a long time to gain new share in Aero, but we have exciting innovations and not only in the thermoset composite traditional side tech innovation, but we are also now, and that's the idea of having Materials together, and I'm not sure I announced it publicly, but Specialty Polymers and Composites are merging as those 2 businesses. So they have 1 president as we speak. This is new from first of April. And why I did that is to force and to accelerate those exciting innovation, either Specialty Polymer in aerospace, or thermoplastic composites, which I remind you, is the best combination of Specialty Polymers and thermoset composites and bringing recyclable circular polymers to the aerospace industry, which both Boeing and Airbus, [ they love ]. 
We're also growing in Defense, right, which is really a great business for us, and not only it's a good business, but it's a source of innovation. So all in all, I think really happy with what I'm hearing. We are more optimistic, although in our numbers, we see a recovery by yes, 2023 to the level back of 2019 in build rates, but very encouraged to see deliveries of 737 MAX, 105 delivered year-to-date. And there are some estimates out there of 240 deliveries in the year. So this is depleting the stock and the inventory, it's around 400. So it's going to probably accelerate the 737 MAX. And Boeing estimate now is reaching 31 per month production in early 2022, okay? This is what they are saying. And Airbus production were in A320 will increase from current level of 40 per month to 45 per month beginning in Q4 2021. It's also good for us and the A320 estimate is 64 per month by Q2. 
So all in all in all, very happy with all of this. It's going to take time. We did what we have to do with the decisiveness. I'm very proud of the Composite teams. And frankly, those numbers to put it into perspective is even more remarkable. As you may remember, 2019 was the best Composites year -- EBITDA Composites year in that history. So when we compare our numbers now to 2019, and I was freshly landing in this company, you're right, the team delivered in 2019 in Composite, record years. So it gives all the dimension of the achievements and the record achievements we are announcing today. Thank you for the question."

Well, listen, 60% of our emissions are more or less coming from Soda Ash historically, right? You know that the rest is 40% from the other businesses.

Well, listen, 60% of our emissions are more or less coming from Soda Ash historically, right? You know that the rest is 40% from the other businesses. When I joined the company, and I did my due diligence on the different businesses prior to issuing with the team and sharing with you the growth strategy, obviously, I looked at the carbon pricing. And you're completely right. I think it's the time of [ Soda ] even where there were mastering carbon and probably saved the company. 
Now we keep what is good, what works very well. And you're right, hedging on carbon, what we can hedge, we cannot hedge everything. We did that, and we are probably hedge a 100% of what is eligible to hedging between now and 2025, and we started hedging post-2025. The team is doing it extremely well, I must say, better than any mandate I had in my career, and that's what we've done. 
Number two, when I joined the company, I think it was 1 of my first policy changes in the company, first week or second week of March 2019 after the incentive on free cash flow, we changed the internal carbon price into 50. And at that time, we were a bit accused, I mean, we debated internally that we were a bit tougher because carbon prices were around 20-ish. But we could see the direction of travel, and we implied EUR 50 per ton internally, which, frankly, now looking back, it was one of the best decisions we've made in quarter 2 2019 because it helps us to make the hedging, protect our competitiveness and do what it takes, which is now a competitive advantage. 
So CO2 is a tangible part of Soda Ash cost structure to protect our contribution margin, which allow us to secure the long-term investments and continue to serve our customers, anticipate as much as possible due to emission price movements and allocation over the coming years. And that's why hedging is there. Today, the 50 is probably going to be north. We are debating that in the company. By the way, we are stress testing the 50 -- EUR 75 a ton in our SPM. So our sustainable portfolio management we stress test a 75. So the question is not 50 or not, are we going to go to 75 and a 100? And that's what we believe we should be doing. 
Now as you know, Europe is going to the green deal. There is the 55 fit policies published and the ETS and CBAM policies going on. In all of this, at the end of the day, we have a clear strategy, sustainability strategy called Solvay One Planet. You remember that in February last year, we joined the Paris agreement. In October, the SBTi. We told you that we are going to exit coal, and we have shown you by now that in Reinberg in Germany, we had the first case where we are exiting coal using biomass. So those are wood chips recycled and wasted at a high IRR, so it's higher than WACC. And with the support, obviously, of the authorities, leading to the lowest greenhouse emission emitting plant in the world, including versus natural. 
I love this because it's not an anecdote anymore. And what I asked Soda Ash team is to build an energy transition program. By the way, they are part of the 28 projects we have for the company. Today, we have more or less 1.8 million tons of CO2 already in execution to be -- to exit, right? It's about 1 million cars off the road every year, which we cite, we price and we know how to do them, and we are still collecting more projects. So Soda Ash is part of those, we are negotiating Dombasle as we speak. I started personally traveling again, and I stopped by Dombasle, was my first visit after my lockdown on my second shot of vaccine, and they are preparing the switch and the exit of coal. And I know that Soda Ash team and our President, is also negotiating in Torrelavega in Spain. So yes, it's just part of Solvay One Planet, and we are executing flawlessly."

The fact that spot yesterday was 52.85% doesn't matter. The fact that I look forward at the December '21 contracts, we see EUR 53.30 also doesn't matter why because we are well hedged.

Well, listen, the missed sales, I mean, it's due mainly to logistic constraint, right, in quarter 2, everybody is struggling these days, and the situation is the following we've seen, frankly, is unprecedented in my career. We have port congestions, container shortages and low [ bill ] rates, as you know, for ships are closing, a large capacity shortage and rapidly increasing spot prices, right? So what we call the FCL, the overseas container transport market is at its highest point in history. And key indicators, frankly, personally, I mean, I may be wrong, there will be no major breakthrough expected before 2022 on this tightness. So we need to live with that. 
Now how we do -- so the EUR 40 million, yes, I mean, some of it is going to travel to quarter 2, but some of it as well may actually disappear and so what because customers may not be waiting and if a supplier has better access to non-congested port, they may actually pick up the goods and be it. So actually, the interesting question, Lisa, is what we are doing about that? And I asked to put a war room in place. I was not to say war room. So it's task force in place to secure operation capacity in the market, right? And this is my multifunctional team. We have logistics experts, we have our procurement team. We have our suppliers supporting us. And they can change arrival for they can go with the raw material from a country to another because it's easier to do. They change, they find container, they change departure port. They find alternative. So they find solutions by finding, by helping the GBUs, and this is across the board there are now -- it's double digits, almost triple digits, people working hard to help the businesses. 
And frankly, I am personally engaging with the C-suite with my executive committee. I'm not talking only to customers and investors, obviously, we -- I'm talking, I'm picking the phone and talking to shipping companies and leaders to support us, and we are trying to build a strategic relationship because this may be structured in the future, including between regions.

We have to remain obviously vigilant, and we are gradually and carefully reopening our administrative sites with all the measures in place to protect our employees and ensure high levels of safety. And it is a return to work in hybrid mode. This is our new normal at Solvay. 
On the top of that, when necessary, as you know, we'll continue to use the Solvay Solidarity Fund to support people in need. Before we move to the results, I would like to highlight another announcement we made this morning. As we execute on our Solvay One Planet sustainability road map, we continue to look for areas to strengthen our commitments. One of these is within our climate pillar, and I'm really thrilled to share that Solvay is targeting today carbon neutrality before 2050. 
With the -- obviously, global warming set to reach or exceed 1.5 degree by 2040 and extreme weather events becoming increasingly common, it's an imperative that we take decisive actions. And since I joined Solvay, we reacted decisively to raise the bar setting realistic yet ambitious targets that we know we will reach. Our climate neutrality target represents a vital step forward in our journey towards net 0 emission after, obviously, we launched our Solvay One Planet, and we joined the Paris Agreement SBTI last year. 
Our road map and sales and investments up to EUR 1 billion by 2040 for all businesses other than soda ash. And for soda ash, we have identified investments of approximately EUR 1 billion by 2040. This will be partially funded by nonrecourse finance. And importantly, we fully expect these investments to also generate compelling economic returns. And we look forward to sharing more with you on this journey during the future ESG webcast being planned for December 1. 
We are also proud that our site in Brazil recently received the highest biodiversity rating from the Wildlife Habitat Council, respected international organization focused on biodiversity conservation practices in the private sector. Solvay is the first chemical company in Brazil to achieve such a rating. Finally, we are honored to have received an award from Cefic just this week for the restoration and ecological plan of our TorelaVega soda ash site in Spain is a great example of the typical remediation effort applied at our plants. 
Let me now move to our results. I am very proud of the strong performance we delivered in the third quarter despite the challenging environment facing the whole industry. In fact, our employees are doing an excellent job managing this environment of inflationary pressures. And I'd like to say to them, thank you. Thank you to our teams globally for their continued hard work. Your efforts are paying off and without you, we would never be in such a good position after such a crisis. 
As you know, sales in the quarter were up 25% on an organic basis and up by 6% versus 2019. I I'd like to highlight that most of our end markets are back at the level of 2019, and the demand continues to be very strong. I will take just the example of Specialty Polymers, hitting a new sales record in the quarter. As we told you previously, this was driven by continued strong demand for our high-performance polymers used to lightweight, various parts of the vehicle and automobile and also using electric vehicle batteries, both areas grew by similar amounts in the quarter, around 50% year-on-year. 
Other markets continued to the group's double-digit growth versus quarter 3 last year. In fact, markets growing between 25% to 30% included auto, electronics and building. Market growing between 15% and 20% included mining, consumer goods, agro and health care. And in fact, volumes were higher than 2019 levels in every business outside of composites. 
Now geographically, all regions delivered double-digit organic sales growth versus quarter 3 last year. Europe was up 20%, Asia Pacific by 22%, north America was up 24% and finally, Latin America was up 45%. Let's now discuss about the inflation, obviously. And inflation, given its significant impact. You may recall that we have been projecting these significant increases for several quarters, and the impact has sharply increased in the second half as anticipated. 
We are progressing well in securing price increases, and we will be unrelenting in protecting our margins in the face of the significant and ongoing industry-wide inflationary headwinds. Now navigating within such an inflationary market is, in fact, an everyday fight. But again, our customer intimacy our highly valued technologies, together with our good energy hedging and management, efficient procurement processes and the structural cost saving program initiated 2 years ago have allowed us to post another strong EBITDA performance. 
And we delivered on cash. And I'm happy with that. This is the tenth consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow generation. All in all, we are above last year levels on a like-to-like or for-like basis. And year-to-date, we have achieved double the cash flow versus 2019. 
Before I pass the floor to Karim, we would like to celebrate a couple of recent achievements and reinvestment for growth in line with our strategy. We are adding a new thermoplastic composite capacity in the United States of America with the completion of investments in Greenville in South Carolina. The new product line will have the ability to manufacture, unidirectional composite tape from a range of high-performance polymers, including PVDF, EPS and peak and help customers in energy, aero and auto markets by reducing weight and emission while being recyclable and circular. 
Second, we have also announced the creation of a new joint venture for the production of highly purified hydrogen peroxide for semiconductors. The JV is scheduled to begin operations in the first quarter of 2022, enabling penetration of these critical ingredients into a new market and will have an initial production capacity of 30,000 tons per year. 
You may remember, in July, we explained to you our strong leadership position in batteries and the potential it represents for Solvay. A couple of days ago, we announced that Solvay is advancing its innovation power in the electric and hybrid vehicle market to develop the next generation of solid-state electrolyte for batteries. On the ground, investments started with the opening earlier in the year of a dry room laboratory and research and development pilot lines in France. As you know, Solvay is leading the development of advanced inorganic material for solid electrolytes. This is a key component for solid-state batteries and well accelerating the scale-up of these materials. Full operation is anticipated for the second quarter of 2022. 
Also related to polymers, recycling is an important element. And Solvay together with scientists has conducted a proof-of-concept showing that PVDC has the potential to be recycled. As you may know, PVDC is used in food beverage and health care multilayer barrier packaging across the world. Now that this initial breakthrough has been achieved were biting fellow companies operating within the plastic industry to play their part and to set a global PVDC recycling stream across the globe. 
I also wish to highlight our recent innovation called Actizone, I'm really proud of as it started actually last year. We created a unique and long lasting disinfection technology and it's now commercialized by Reckitt a global market leader in their iconic brand, Lizol. The technology was just launched in France this month and it will launch in Germany in the coming weeks, followed by other European countries in 2022 and in the United States of America in 2023. 
Also our solar car bicarbonate technology has been successfully tested on one vessel of La Meridionale passenger ferry operator, you can see in the south of France and we will extend our solution to all the engines of the ferry. The partnerships will enable compliance with international maritime organization, IMO, regulations for the reduction of what we call in our jargon, SOX, it's sulfur oxide emissions and will facilitate the removal of 99.9% of particle matters. 
Finally, our soda ash is an essential material for the production of lithium carbonate by the Chilean chemical company Sociedad Quimica Mener Chile. And believe it or not, this is the biggest lithium producer in the world whose production is based on the natural brine resources from the Atacama desserts. We managed to close the multiyear agreements and expect to supply about 170,000 tons of soda ash next year and we will reach about 200,000 per annum from 2023 onwards. 
And this is a great example. And remember, I told you that Solvay is circling the battery. This is yet another one. We are going beyond the material businesses or special can businesses and leveraging our full portfolio. And now Karim will review in more detail the group segment and financial performance. Karim?"
377837,1686011419,2415821,"Solvay SA, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Solvay SA","Executives","Thank you, Ilham. Good morning. Good afternoon, everybody. I will start with an overview of the 3 business segments, and I'll refer as usual to figures on an organic basis, which means at constant portfolio scope and currency. Before going any further,",2578,"Thank you, Ilham. Good morning. Good afternoon, everybody. I will start with an overview of the 3 business segments, and I'll refer as usual to figures on an organic basis, which means at constant portfolio scope and currency. 
Before going any further, let me remind you that the 6 businesses we divested early this year, together with the currency fluctuations are expected to impact full year EBITDA by around EUR 120 million. At this stage, the impact is EUR 16 million for the third quarter, EUR 87 million for the 9 months thus far. 
Turning to the materials segment on Slide #7. You'll see that sales in the third quarter were up 26% against Q3 last year. Sequentially, up 6% versus second quarter of this year, driven by another record quarter, as Ilma mentioned, in the Specialty Polymers business. Sales in this business unit alone were up 33% in Q3, reaching EUR 570 million. And this reflects continued high demand across all its key markets. 
As Ilham referenced, growth was across all markets by the business, and we continue our penetration of materials into auto and in particular, electric vehicle batteries where our technologies can be found in binders and separators and enclosures as well as sealing and cooling applications. Altogether, these grew by almost 50%, 5-0 percent over last year. And that's not the only market growing double digits. Our polymer sales into electronics also grew around 50% in the quarter. This was boosted by semiconductors, electrical components as well as smart devices. 
Sales also grew 20% in health care, and that includes polymers that are used in medical devices and pharmaceutical packaging. Turning to composites. Sales are up 6% year-on-year as we start to see some signs of recovery. This quarter was the first with year-on-year volume increase since the beginning of the pandemic. It's also the third consecutive sequential improvement. That's important to note that our top line was again affected by supply chain, labor and manufacturing issues. 
The recovery that we're seeing is mainly visible in single-aisle craft, but do keep in mind the high level of inventories that are still there for the 737 MAX. And we need to see that reduced before we see a more pronounced acceleration of production rates expected by customers starting in 2022. Sales of the space and defense markets also grew in the quarter and have remained resilient. 
Turning to profitability. The EBITDA of materials in Q3 increased 52% and year-on-year, and EBITDA margins improved almost 600 basis points to 32.7%, primarily driven by the record sales in specialty polymers by sustained pricing and significant cost reductions especially in the competitive business. 
Turning to Chemicals on Slide 8. Third quarter sales in the segment, up 20%. All businesses experiencing organic growth year-on-year. Soda ash sales were up 8% in the quarter, and that's driven by higher volumes, slightly offset by lower prices. Demand trends in the third quarter were similar to what we saw in Q2 with sustained demand in the building market where flat glass is used, while the contained glass market that's used in hospitality, restaurant, catering [indiscernible] industry, slightly improved sequentially, although it still lags 2019 levels. 
Sales in the bicarbonate product line continue to be very strong. That's about 1/4 of our business there, the bicarbonate product line. It's very strong mainly in the U.S., driven by our solar technology that's used in flu gas treatments, which as -- I highlighted just a few moments ago, it represents alone about 10% of the business sales. 
Peroxide sales were up 11%, driven by volumes and prices. Market conditions remained strong in HBPO, which is used in automotive and building industries predominantly. Volume growth was further supported by customer wins in the electronic markets. Our silica business had another strong quarter. Sales growth of 17% with strong continued growth in the replacement tire market. 
The business also continues to benefit from market share gains, thanks to the penetration of its sustainable solutions, including our highly dispersible silica for tires that enable better rolling resistance and far better were. The [indiscernible] business in Latin America is going from strength to strength. It's continuing its record run. Sales up 70% against Q3 last year, reflecting continued strong demand, customer wins as well as pricing actions. 
Wrapping up, the EBITDA of chemicals segment increased 19% year-on-year, thanks to higher volumes in all businesses, high prices and also very strong contribution from our RusVinyl joint venture, which is in Russia and PVC. Taking all this together, it translated to an EBITDA margin of 27.3% in the quarter. 
I'm now going to turn to the solutions segment, which you can see outlined on page -- on Slide #9. This segment delivered sales growth of 28% this quarter. Beginning with Novecare, sales were up 25%, driven by double-digit growth across key markets, including coatings, industrial products used in Northern building and construction markets. We also saw more robust demand, more of our sustainable technologies, which supported the double-digit growth -- sales growth in agro as well as HPC, owned personal care markets. 
You may have noticed that we also have now provided separate sales figures for the oil and gas business, which today represents about EUR 100 million in sales in Q3, a sharp improvement over last year. We really hope that you welcome this additional disclosure, not least because it helps to also highlight the significant progress being achieved by Novecare in all its non-oil and gas markets. To be clear, most of oil and gas business resulted in the Novecare business units in the past. And we've added 1 product line from our Technology Solutions business because that also supports the oil and gas market. And now what we have is a distinctive business where all of our fracking activities reside. 
The Special Chem business delivered sales growth of 26% in Q3, again reflecting the continued strength in the electronics sector, particularly in semiconductors. Now although products used in the automotive sector showed modest growth against last year, the business is now feeling the impact. of the slowdown in production related to the chip shortage that I'm sure you're all aware of. 
In Technology Solutions, sales were up 27% in the quarter, driven by higher volumes and strong pricing across the mining sector. As we mentioned last quarter, we are gaining market share with existing customers, and we're winning new customers as well. Other product lines, including phosphor specialties and additives, are also progressing and are supporting the growth. 
In our Aroma business, sales were up 16% in the quarter, driven by strong demand in food and beverage as well as flavors and fragrance flavors and fragrance markets. Wrapping up solutions. The segment delivered 28% EBITDA growth versus Q3 last year. reflecting the strong and continued recovery across most markets, whereas the EBITDA margin was stable at 18.3%. 
Now I'll move to the group financials. And first and foremost, I would like to share some elements that are related to the inflationary cost increases that we experienced in the third quarter because they reached EUR 145 million versus Q3 last year and a sharp increase versus the second quarter. And please note that the impacts I'm highlighting are after our well-established hedging practices. 
To give you a bit more color, about 80%, 8-0, of this increase relates directly to raw materials and energy and the balanced logistics. Keep in mind that a significant part of the energy increase is related to the spike in natural gas in Europe, which manifested itself in the later part in the latter half of the third quarter. As 
a result of these developments, we now estimate that the full year cost inflation will be of the order of EUR 400 million -- at EUR 400 million rather than the EUR 250 million we indicated in July. That's the backdrop that has really motivated us to really drive and accelerate the increase in prices as the main lever that helps us to maintain our leading margins. 
Turning to cost savings on Slide 10. Once again, we've been able to generate new additional cost savings this time, EUR 41 million in the third quarter. There are 3 main areas for that delivery. First and foremost, restructuring, which came in at EUR 18 million, and that reflects the reductions in labor-related costs. And you know that we've launched different simplification and restructuring plans such as in composites, but really across the group will continue to delayer. These plants have thus far resulted in EUR 171 million of savings since the beginning of 2020. 
Indirect cost reductions came in at EUR 15 million, and that also reflects the benefit of programs such as the zero-based budgeting that we put in place last year. And then finally, productivity efficiencies at our sites came in with EUR 6 million in this quarter. This brings our year-to-date total total structural cost savings to EUR 172 million. Therefore, I can confirm that we are on track to achieve our full year guidance of EUR 200 million. 
Now you may also remember that our objective is to achieve $500 million structural cost reductions by 2024. We remain well on track. And indeed, at the end of 2021, the cumulative cost reductions over the 2-year period period should amount to EUR 375 million. That's EUR 200 million more than fixed cost inflation. These cost reductions, together with the strong top line performance that you've seen have allowed us to post another strong EBITDA performance coming in at EUR 599 million which represents a 31% organic increase against last year and nearly 7% against 2019 as well on a like-for-like basis. That's really encouraging. 
Now what I also want to do is to highlight that this EBITDA performance has been achieved in a very specific context. This beginning of the year, the impact from increasing raw materials, energy and logistics, particularly taking Q2 and Q3. Now that totaled EUR 210 million so far this year. Now that is unprecedented. Therefore, these new market conditions, these headwinds, they require new actions. They require a new way of facing off to these headwinds, and we'll be actively pursuing those price increases across our businesses to mitigate the significant headwind I can tell you that, for example, we've been engaged very deeply with customers as we seek to both meet their needs but also preserve our margins because everybody understands the necessity to maintain that balance, that important balance in our commercial relationships as we navigate together through these challenging times. 
And again, you can see, actually, there are strong margins show that we're making progress. That said, there is more to be done. We can never relent. And of course, I can tell you that the focus of the entire leadership in Solvay and for the entire commercial organization is very much around maintaining our leading positions in the market and driving pricing up. That is key. I would suggest to you that I have been our priority #1 for quite a few months this year. 
But there's more. Cash is where it matters as well. It's where the rubber hits the road, as we say. So if you can turn to Slide 11, you know it's important to us. We worked really hard for more than 2 years to drive sustainable and consistent improvement in cash generation. And I'm really pleased that we're continuing to deliver. For the tenth quarter in a row, we're delivering positive free cash flow this time, EUR 276 million in the quarter. Since the beginning of the year, the total is EUR 692 million slightly higher than the first 9 months of last year when we exclude scope, currency and the onetime elements that you recall we highlighted last year. 
Now I would like to highlight a few additional elements to give you some color on that free cash flow. And I'll start with working capital. The current top line growth is driving a natural increase in our inventories in our receivables, but we are managing it very, very carefully. And up to now, everything is completely under control. Just look at working capital to sales, you will see that and it speaks for itself. As of end of Q3, we're about 2% better than we were at the beginning of 2020, for example, stronger than in 2019 as well. That discipline is here to stay. 
Two, CapEx. You see that we spent in the first 9 months, which is broadly the same amount as last year. Now despite our best efforts to resume to ramp up our investment plans, we were impacted by raw material shortages and supply chain issues that again are very well-known for the whole industries, many industries. As a result of this, we now expect to finish the year with a total CapEx slightly below the EUR 700 million, slightly below EUR 700 million. And you know that we compare with EUR700 million to EUR 750 million we indicated to you at the very beginning of this year. 
Third point I'd like to add on free cash flow is, as you know, we're deepening, we're accelerating our restructuring programs. We spent EUR 39 million in cash to make that happen, which brings the 9-month total to EUR 92 million. That's the highest I've seen for many, many years. It's actually EUR 26 million more than last year. The payback is very compelling. 
Finally, not in sales, but second -- the least impact, but it's very important, is the continued deleveraging our balance sheet. The benefits of all the work is not on pensions and on our debt are paying off and are visible in the bottom line. with pension financial charges together being EUR 32 million below the first 9 months of last year. As a result of all these actions, our free cash flow conversion ratio is close to 40%, 4-0, for the last 12 months. 
Finally, before I turn back to Ilham, a word on our net debt. The level at the end of September 2021 is slightly below the end of 2020. The strong free cash flow and the inflows related to the divestments more than offset both the dividend payments of EUR 388 million and EUR 102 million voluntary contribution to our pensions that we made in Belgium, in fact, in the first quarter this year. 
And I remind you that we still have plans to make another EUR 300 million in additional contributions in the next 6 months, which will bring the cumulative additional pension contributions to about EUR 1.1 billion. Indeed -- and the question of debt and pensions, it's useful to take a step back sometimes and to really take note of the cumulative progress on our global indebtedness since 2019. 
And Ilham, I'm not sure you realize this, but since you became CEO, the fact is -- and this is a real factor, that our balance sheet has strengthened by EUR 2.5 billion in just 10 quarters with a fall in net debt from EUR 5.5 billion to EUR 4 billion now, a fall in pensions from EUR 2.7 billion to EUR 1 billion. I just wanted to make note of that because when you look at each quarter individually, we make sometimes miss the big picture. And with that, I'll hand you back to Ilham, who will provide our outlook for the render of the year."

I'll now comment on our outlook for the full year shown on Slide 12. We are very pleased to confirm today our full year EBITDA guidance for 2021 despite the key headwinds facing the whole industry today. The fourth quarter won't be easy to navigate, considering not only the strong demand in a lot of markets, the usual softness during the holiday season, the chip shortages impacting some auto businesses the raw material, logistics and supply chain disruptions or the potential power restriction in China as you all know. 
So some of our brands that are sold out 1 day and have to slow down or stop the day after because of these issues and discussions with clients on price increases or difficulty to deliver products, in fact, managing these uncertainties has become an integral part of the daily job of our teams. It's also somewhat difficult to anticipate the full impact of cost increases and disruptions given the very high volatility we see with some raw materials and with the energy prices in Europe. As Karim mentioned, our best estimate for the full year inflationary cost impact is now about EUR 400 million. So things are changing rapidly, and we are fully mobilized to respond effectively and we are ready. 
Notwithstanding these challenges, our focus on the top line gives the confidence to confirm our EUR 2.2 billion to EUR 2.3 billion EBITDA guidance for the full year. I remind you, this represents 20% to 25% growth on an organic basis against 2020 and around 4% against 2019. Even plus 13% excluding composites and oil and gas, which had a slower recovery. 
On cash, we are increasing, as Karim said, our free cash flow guidance and now estimate generating around EUR 800 million for the full year. This will represent a free cash flow conversion ratio between 35% and 40% higher than our strategic commitments and 3 years ahead of time. In short, we have not forgotten the lessons learned during the COVID crisis, and we are making good use of them today to make Solvay even stronger. This means we will continue to be innovative to think differently, to stay close to our customers, drive value and to go the extra mile. And we will continue to implement our growth strategy and look forward to the future that will be more sustainable for sure. So by now, Karim and I will be happy to take your questions. Back to you, Jodi."

So on the cash flow, you're talking about EUR 2 billion cumulative CapEx for decarbonization, but that's over the next 20 years. Is the simple way to think about this EUR 100 million a year spending? Or is it much more concentrated and front-end loaded than that? The operational question relates to soda ash. Obviously, energy prices are up a lot. I think IHS are talking about $40 to $80 a ton depending on feedstocks. I'm not sure if you agree with those numbers, but is there a way to think about the percentage price increase you need next year to pass this through? Is it around 20%? Or is that -- am I way off there?"

I may start with the second question and then follow up on the carbon neutrality. Yes, indeed, you've seen the IHS publication is EUR 40 ton, 20% more or less for Europe in 2022. There are also prices up in above USD 300",641,"Yes. I will and Karim, you follow. I may start with the second question and then follow up on the carbon neutrality. Yes, indeed, you've seen the IHS publication is EUR 40 ton, 20% more or less for Europe in 2022. There are also prices up in above USD 300, almost per ton as we speak, et cetera, and 350 at EMEA. You can take them as a proxy. You always know that we at Solvay we are in the higher range and above this. The way to look at it is that, obviously, this is a high energy intense business. Obviously, we have a policy of also energy hedging. We don't disclose the amount of it, but it's supporting us and helping us. And you've seen our numbers in terms of pricing in the sales bridge against the quarterly cost savings, although we don't disclose it on a business unit level. Believe it or not, this is the first time in our history where we have started renegotiating the prices on soda ash business right in a given year for contracted business because it's abnormal times. Our customers, they understand that. So we are discussing it with them. And obviously, as we are in quarter 4, we are also starting the discussion as traditionally we do for next year pricing. So more to come. As usual, and you've seen it through my tenure with the team, we will ensure that we protect our margin and continue ensuring that in each business, it deserved the prices it should deserve. On the neutrality, and maybe, Karim, you can give a bit of color how we are going to send this. 
Obviously, you've seen us announcing carbon neutrality and it's a big day for Solvay because we are part of the chemicals which is harder to a bad industry. We've been working on this since my arrival in the company in March 2019. Obviously, Solvay One Planet was the first step to declare a bigger ambition on sustainability. We joined the police agreement -- We joined the SBTI last year. We did 2 experts in 2019, 2020, so 4% structural decrease in emissions in 2019, 2020 and Paris 2%. And this shows, and we did it on high-value projects with good returns. On the soda, as you know that soda ash represents last year, I think 2020 was 64% of our emissions -- So there is a soda ash case and non-soda ash and that's why we are making the split. On the soda ash side, it's about exiting coal, and we have 7 assets in Europe, which are still using coal as primary energy. 
Since I joined the company, we are now announcing the second plant [indiscernible] in France we announced in Germany, we announced earlier in the year. exiting coal, which has approved -- has been approved by the Board of Directors yesterday. And we are doing it through recourse financing, obviously. So we deconsolidate, but the CapEx is turning to OpEx. And we asked the team to do it is very simple, is to show me and to show us and obviously, it's a competitive landscape that we can do it at lower landed costs, including vis-a-vis our natural imported competition. And that's what we are doing with those 2 investments. And moving away from coal or gas, you've seen it now with the spike in gas pricing. It actually supports our less cyclicality and dependency of highly cyclical energy, right? And that's what we are going to do with biomass based on wood chips in Reinberg. And here, we are using what we call RDF refuse-derived fuels, which is, by the way, just nonmetered waste, right? We burned the waste. And this is going to be good for the planet, but also profitable. Karim, anything to add on financing?"

I mean Matthew, I think I don't have a better indication than your average of EUR 100 million a year. I think it is a good proxy. But the reality is it's not going to be as linear as that. However, the important point, and I'll go back to what I",246,"No, sure. I mean Matthew, I think I don't have a better indication than your average of EUR 100 million a year. I think it is a good proxy. But the reality is it's not going to be as linear as that. However, the important point, and I'll go back to what Ilham said, is there will be a fair proportion of that, that will be nonrecourse financing. So yes, we use the strength of our balance sheet, but the cash will stay with us as well. More importantly, this will not get in the way of our growth plans and also want to undermine the capital discipline and the real focus we have on generating returns. And I say that because what really like about this from a pure financial standpoint is the returns are really compelling. This underpins the resilience and improve the competitiveness of all our businesses, without in any way disrupting our growth potential, and that's what I find particularly attractive. And clearly, maybe to give you an example, we announced you recall Reinberg, same thing we moved away from coal earlier in the year. So the ash, we've announced Dunbar both of them benefit also from project financing. 
Again, this is an example, let's say, being smart, using other people's money widely, let's say, putting in the equity we need and that helps us to move the agenda. As I said, the returns are very, very strong. I hope that helps."

The second question is a bit longer term. On capital allocation, with the strategic review of the soda ash division and the strong performance of materials business that you're seeing now, are you open to large ticket M&A? Or do you think the focus is still very much on cost containment and efficiency execution before you turn to thinking about big-ticket M&A. That would be helpful."

Thank you very much for the question. Well, listen, on pricing, frankly, although it's painful specifically the level of inflation we see now, and it's probably very unusual and first time in my career, I see such spike in such short period of time. Actually, side of me like it because it stresses our value proposition, and it's the best timing to go and and get pricing, not only for commodities, obviously, but also for specialties. So yes, I mean, we are discussing constructively with all our customers, right? 
Our sales team is working hard. You may remember actually, I told you after getting fit and working on our cost, and I think Karim has given you a color on how the infrastructure now is getting leaner, better, more efficient and productive at sort -- Now it's the time we are switching gears to the growth potential of Solvay. And I think, frankly, even before joining the company that was attracted me. We have -- we are the only 1 who has all these specialty polymers and the carbon fiber, the composite know-how in 1 home. And we are unique there. And you see it now when I told you back in 2019 at the growth strategy launched that the battery platform and the thermoplastic platform are going to be the emerging growth platform, I mean, frankly, even me, I couldn't believe that it's going to be so quickly increasing and growing after 1.5 years or 2 years. So we have a unique value proposition. You've seen that our sales, you can -- in our sales bridge, we've achieved EUR 139 million in price increases in the quarter. versus EUR 145 million cost impact. Those are the data and there is more to do given the headwinds, which remains and are clearly increasing in quarter 4. We expected it at the beginning of the year, but I told you 20250 million, now it's more of 400. And we are still continuing to increase prices. In the open volumes, we have energy surcharges. We are putting it. I told you that's the first time in our history where even contracted business like in soda ash, we are putting it on the table and customers they understand. I mean they look at the numbers and the data like you do and I do -- So that's extremely important. 
So -- and we are anticipating the '22 price negotiations they are underway just too early now to talk about it. And as you know, for contracts, there is a lag between cost increase and price increase in average at always 4 months, right? That's the example in Silica, for example, and in commodities like Coatis. We are the increase right away. And indeed, for the sustainability of it, I think what I like is it's just specifically the specialty portfolio. So now we are looking at our value proposition value pricing. And obviously, if we believe that we were not pricing enough and well our our product and solution, we will fix it through this period of renegotiations, including, by the way, the trends and conditions. Karim, you want to address the other question?"

So -- what's our view on M&A? We are clearly open. We're looking to upgrade our portfolio with discipline, absolutely with discipline. We won't overpay ever -- We will make sure we focus on returns. So we look -- and clearly, we have some dry powder, look at the cash on our balance sheet. So to my mind, of course, we're looking very selectively and where that's very strategically coherent, where we find opportunities, we don't hesitate. And you've seen us acquire Okay, it was small, a small business on agro because we saw that we're clearly a very good owner that can drive a lot of value. 
My only regret on that particular one, which was 10x bigger had been nice. So what I'd say is we are looking cash funding is not a constraint to our ambitions. It really around driving the agenda organically in the first instance, party #1, but also the portfolio lever is there and we'll take our time to find the right opportunity there."

Obviously, it's always a difficulty in a given year to go and renegotiate established contracts. I think -- but as I told you at Chetan and the team, I think I was frankly, during my career, inflation times are really good times to really challenge your pricing strategy, right? As we speak, we have people to help us externally even review thousands of contracts, terms and condition, the formula pricing inbound, outbound. 
Do we have the right formula in terms of energy. In? Terms of logistics, in terms of raw material and vulnerability here and there, wherever we have a full supplier, we arepppppppppppppppppp validating and qualifying more than one. We are having a discussion, as I told you, I give you the the extreme example of soda ash because it's historically in our history. And frankly, when I put it on the table with the team, obviously, it's never happened. But when you go, the customers understand that it's fair. -- it's very credible. They need winning suppliers. So we are doing this. So we are on pricing every day. costs are increasing. We don't see them decreasing. I don't have a crystal ball on energy and gas for next year. I'm here in different energy companies, and we have our Intel where it's going to go, but I am now counting with the team that costs are not going to ease up, if it does good news. It's going to be an upside. So therefore, we are keeping our pricing momentum and we're reviewing it every week with our team with the corporate team. So we are doing just that, and this is important. 
The question -- there was a question about batteries. Yes, I mean, again, very happy that we -- since 2019, we really played the batteries game as a platform, Manus. And as a platform, I'm not sure it's really struck you guys in 2019 was my first 9 months in the job I was struck by the power leading technology power position of Solvay. And when I say we circle the battery, I'm weighing my word. I mean batteries cater in the anode. We are in separators, 1 in electrolyte, we're in the Casing and now we have even sodalithium mining. And we are technology agnostic, and that's what you are alluding to, probably Chetan we are not making annotator separators material but developing binoculectrolyte. So battery technology, it means using those different cathode chemistries and the answer is we are present in all. So different generation of batteries with commercial generation 2, we are already qualifying Generation 3 and Generation 5, which is the solid we are working on this. 
Now on the technologies, it's beyond PVDF, that's what you asked for. We're not going to disclose which 1 is our preferred 1 because we have still competing technologies, but we are working on several ones. And the launch of this dry room lab and another line to assemble and already mimic what a solid battery of tomorrow can be? Is the testimony that we are progressing very fast with our customers. I think I -- that was the question on solid batteries"

Is that roughly where you think you can get to given the negotiations you've had so far with customers? 
And then second question, just sticking on the solid-state batteries. When you launch this product commercially, is it going to be for EVs? Or is it going to be for consumer electronics first? And when do you think the first revenue will come from?"

So we're $200 million to EUR 110 million of the way there. So that implies for the headwinds of the order of 190 to 200 in Q4. Within our guidance, what we said is we will give you -- we expect to deliver an EBITDA for the full year between 2.2 million, 2.3. So I'm not going to give you a precise answer. What I can tell you is we have factored in an expectation that we will mitigate now. Part of that will absolutely come from pricing. You saw what we did the run rate of what we saw in Q3 and that hasn't fully crystallized but also come through to the bottom line. So in terms of euros, I can tell you, but I don't want to give you a percentage of because I think it could be unhelpful in many, many respects. You were looking at. But I do expect us more than ever to, let's say, to really maintain our leading margins. If I said it differently, we really like the fact that our EBITDA margin now 9 months into the year is 24.1%. And if I can ignore 2020, look at 2019, that's 1.1% better than 2019. I'm not going to say that's going to reduce go up a bit. Yes, of course, there are always little seasonal impact, et cetera.

Next question from Subash Shamber from Berenberg Bank. 
It's on the special chem business. there is quite a lot of news flow coming out of China about some rather outrageous price increases for the earth at the moment. And then I add up the capacity that Solvay has at Lache and elsewhere, -- As a rough guess, I think it's about 20% to 25% of processing in this market. I remember back in 2010, 2011, there was a big spike and this had a quite positive impact on EBITDA. If this were to repeat would we be looking for, let's say, EUR 50 million, EUR 100 million of EBITDA uplift from this segment? And linked to that, -- How do you think about the demand for their on a 10- or 15-year view in terms of the erosion from auto catalyst business versus the use in EV electric motors. 
Thank you. 
Basin, I think it's an interesting question you're asking. I think the situation today is different from the part that you alluded to. I don't believe that we're in a bubble which is what we saw in the past. I wish I could say to you I see EUR 50 million to EUR 100 million. And now I wouldn't hesitate to tell you that if I really believed it. What I can tell you is that we are in niche markets I think some of the markets we're serving customers we're serving, especially we're in fading business or diesel, et cetera, over time, they're fading the stagnant or fading. But fundamentally, what we've described is very much within our expectations, let's say, we factored in within the EUR 400 million, for example, we factored in these expectations, but I really don't think we're in a bubble with a significant upside. -- at this point 
Thank you. Next question is from Laurent Farm Exari. 
It's a 2-part question on materials. The first question is around pricing and raw materials. You only had 1% pricing in Q3 for the division. So I'm assuming that there wasn't a lot of pricing, and there wasn't a lot of raw material inflation. I was wondering if you could talk about maybe the delay in inflation in composites because of the fiber contractual arrangements, but also what you're expecting in terms of the further innovation in specialty polymers -- And the second question on Specialty Polymers. On Silica, you talked about the decline in car production and the issue with shrinkages. I'm surprised that polymers have managed to have the highest sales on record in the history of Solvay when car production is about 20% below all-time highs. So I'm just wondering, is it that the non-auto parts of Specialty Polymers is doing phenomenally well. Or is there some results in the chain. 
Yes. I may start, Karim, and I'll start probably with specialty polymers, right? -- where you've seen the numbers, obviously, a very good quarter on specialty polymers, and we expected it to be this way. Let me start with the market situation because you hear a lot about auto and probably you are trying to compare us with other peers -- From an OEM perspective, there was no major slowdown yet in quarter 2, right? So from a specialty polymers perspective, upsold our demand has been extremely high since January, by the way, yet we did have some customers orders can sell here and there even in quarter 3. So we do expect to see some slowdown in quarter 4 and this is factored in our forecast. The story on our results, it's a bit in my mind, I try to make it in a simple way. Even with some softness in demand, we still have full plants, right? That's what I mean there's a lot of red in the capacity utilization here. There may be some inventory, but we don't think there is much yet on inventory buildup based on our intelligence directly with our customers. And here, I feel better than last year because last year, when the COVID-19 hit us, we didn't have a central order book, and we didn't waste a good crisis. So we built a central order book now where we have a pulse bit on what's going on, and we are in direct contact with our customers -- So some parts of the value chain had no inventory, so they try to rebuild, but it's getting consumed immediately, so no backlog. 
Therefore, our -- many of our customers believe it's on not still screaming for inventory in quarter 3, and that's what we know from our intelligence again. Intensive demand from consumers their people are still buying cars. Now OEMs are giving priority because of the chip shortages you've seen it, and that's what we hear to the high-end, high-margin vehicles. And both are either EV or luxury brands, high-performance vehicle is the sweet spot of specialty polymers. It allows, frankly, the OEM to sustain their margin specialty polymers are used in this type of vehicle. Therefore, we still saw a high demand in quarter 3, specifically on those areas. And we see a continued penetration of EV and hybrids, as you know, where we have more weight in this vehicle. 
You remember my 6 -- 12, 6 in ice, mining, electric and 12 in hybrid. So the OEMs favoring those models, it's better for us. So all in all, the forecast, market is probably getting softer. This will somewhat affected in quarter 4 is again in the forecast, and it's in there already. And please note, I mean we talk about auto and batteries and like that, but all other markets in specialty polymers outside auto are also performing very well and growing at high rates. So all of this together translated into superior performance in quarter 3 and a new record. You want to talk about the carbon abrasion do you want to that? Yes?"

As always, I'll begin my remarks with the health and safety overview shown on Slide 3. Today, we have 49 colleagues who are infected with COVID-19, unfortunately, up from 32 at the end of July when we last talked together. We have to remain obviously vigilant, and we are gradually and carefully reopening our administrative sites with all the measures in place to protect our employees and ensure high levels of safety. And it is a return to work in hybrid mode. This is our new normal at Solvay. On the top of that, when necessary, as you know, we'll continue to use the Solvay Solidarity Fund to support people in need. 
Before we move to the results, I would like to highlight another announcement we made this morning. As we execute on our Solvay One Planet sustainability road map, we continue to look for areas to strengthen our commitments. One of these is within our climate pillar, and I'm really thrilled to share that Solvay is targeting today carbon neutrality before 2050.
With the -- obviously, global warming set to reach or exceed 1.5 degree by 2040 and extreme weather events becoming increasingly common, it's an imperative that we take decisive actions. And since I joined Solvay, we acted decisively to raise the bar, setting realistic yet ambitious targets that we know we will reach. Our climate neutrality target represents a vital step forward in our journey towards net 0 emission after, obviously, we launched our Solvay One Planet, and we joined the Paris Agreement, SBTi last year.  
Our road map and sales and investments up to EUR 1 billion by 2040 for all businesses other than soda ash. And for soda ash, we have identified investments of approximately EUR 1 billion by 2040. This will be partially funded by nonrecourse finance. And importantly, we fully expect this investment to also generate compelling economic returns. And we look forward to sharing more with you on this journey during the future ESG webcast being planned for December 1.
We are also proud that our site in Brazil recently received the highest biodiversity rating from the Wildlife Habitat Council, a respected international organization focused on biodiversity conservation practices in the private sector. Solvay is the first chemical company in Brazil to achieve such a rating. Finally, we are honored to have received an award from Cefic just this week for the restoration and ecological plan of our Torrelavega soda ash site in Spain. It's a great example of the typical remediation effort applied at our plants.
Let me now move to our results. I am very proud of the strong performance we delivered in the third quarter despite the challenging environment facing the whole industry. In fact, our employees are doing an excellent job managing this environment of inflationary pressures. And I'd like to say to them, thank you. Thank you to our teams globally for their continued hard work. Your efforts are paying off and without you, we would never be in such a good position after such a crisis.
As you know, sales in the quarter were up 25% on an organic basis and up by 6% versus 2019. I'd like to highlight that most of our end markets are back at the level of 2019, and the demand continues to be very strong. I will suggest the example of Specialty Polymers, hitting a new sales record in the quarter. As we told you previously, this was driven by continued strong demand for our high-performance polymers used to lightweight various parts of the vehicle and automobile and also used in electric vehicle batteries. Both areas grew by similar amounts in the quarter, around 50% year-on-year.
Other markets continued to the group's double-digit growth versus quarter 3 last year. In fact, markets growing between 25% to 30% included auto, electronics and building. Markets growing between 15% and 20% included mining, consumer goods, agro and health care. And in fact, volumes were higher than 2019 levels in every business outside of composites. Now geographically, all regions delivered double-digit organic sales growth versus quarter 3 last year. Europe was up 20%, Asia Pacific by 22%, north America was up 24% and finally, Latin America was up 45%. 
Let's now discuss about the inflation, obviously, and inflation, given its significant impact. You may recall that we have been projecting these significant increases for several quarters, and the impact has sharply increased in the second half as anticipated. We are progressing well in securing price increases, and we will be unrelenting in protecting our margins in the face of these significant and ongoing industry-wide inflationary headwinds.
Now navigating within such an inflationary market is, in fact, an everyday fight. But again, our customer intimacy, our highly valued technologies, together with our good energy hedging and management, efficient procurement processes and the structural cost saving program initiated 2 years ago have allowed us to post another strong EBITDA performance. And we delivered on cash. And I'm happy with that. This is the tenth consecutive quarter of positive free cash flow generation. All in all, we are above last year levels on a like-to-like or for-like basis. And year-to-date, we have achieved double the cash flow versus 2019.
Before I pass the floor to Karim, we would like to celebrate a couple of recent achievements and reinvestments for growth in line with our strategy. We are adding a new thermoplastic composite capacity in the United States of America with the completion of an investment in Greenville in South Carolina. The new product line will have the ability to manufacture unidirectional composite tape from a range of high-performance polymers, including PVDF, EPS and PEEK and help customers in energy, aero and auto markets by reducing weight and emission while being recyclable and circular.
Second, we have also announced the creation of a new joint venture for the production of highly purified hydrogen peroxide for semiconductors. The JV is scheduled to begin operations in the first quarter of 2023, enabling penetration of these critical ingredients into a new market and will have an initial production capacity of 30,000 tons per year.  
You may remember, in July, we explained to you our strong leadership position in batteries and the potential it represents for Solvay. A couple of days ago, we announced that Solvay is advancing its innovation power in the electric and hybrid vehicle market to develop the next generation of solid-state electrolyte for batteries. On the ground, investments started with the opening earlier in the year of a dry room laboratory and research and development pilot lines in France. As you know, Solvay is leading the development of advanced inorganic material for solid electrolytes. This is a key component for solid-state batteries and well accelerating the scale-up of these materials. Full operation is anticipated for the second quarter of 2022.
Also related to polymers, recycling is an important element. And Solvay together with scientists has conducted a proof-of-concept showing that PVDC has the potential to be recycled. As you may know, PVDC is used in food, beverage and health care multilayer barrier packaging across the world. Now that this initial breakthrough has been achieved, we're inviting fellow companies operating within the plastic industry to play their part and to set a global PVDC recycling stream across the globe.
I also wish to highlight our recent innovation called Actizone, I'm really proud of as it started actually last year. We created a unique and long-lasting disinfection technology and it's now commercialized by Reckitt a global market leader in their iconic brand, Lysol. The technology was just launched in France this month and it will launch in Germany in the coming weeks, followed by other European countries in 2022 and in the United States of America in 2023.
Also our SOLVAir bicarbonate technology has been successfully tested on one vessel of La Méridionale passenger ferry operator, you can see in the south of France, and we will extend our solution to all the engines of the ferry. The partnerships will enable compliance with International Maritime Organization, IMO, regulations for the reduction of, what we call in our jargon, SOx, it's sulphur oxide emissions and will facilitate the removal of 99.9% of particle matters. 
Finally, our soda ash is an essential material for the production of lithium carbonate by the Chilean chemical company, Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile. And believe it or not, this is the biggest lithium producer in the world whose production is based on the natural brine resources from the Atacama Desert. We managed to close the multiyear agreements and expect to supply about 170,000 tons of soda ash next year and we will reach about 200,000 per annum from 2023 onwards. And this is a great example. And remember, I told you that Solvay is circling the battery. This is yet another one. We are going beyond the material businesses or special chem businesses and leveraging our full portfolio.
And now Karim will review in more detail the group segment and financial performance. Karim?"
377837,1686011419,2416237,"Solvay SA, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2021",2021-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Solvay SA","Executives","Thank you, Ilham. Good morning, good afternoon, everybody. I will start with an overview of the 3 business segments, and I'll refer as usual to figures on an organic basis, which means at constant portfolio scope and currency. And before going any further",2585,"Thank you, Ilham. Good morning, good afternoon, everybody. I will start with an overview of the 3 business segments, and I'll refer as usual to figures on an organic basis, which means at constant portfolio scope and currency. And before going any further, let me remind you that the 6 businesses we divested early this year, together with the currency fluctuations are expected to impact full year EBITDA by around EUR 120 million. At this stage, the impact is EUR 16 million for the third quarter, EUR 87 million for the 9 months thus far.
Turning to the Materials segment on Slide #7. You'll see that sales in the third quarter were up 26% against Q3 last year. Sequentially, up 6% versus second quarter of this year, driven by another record quarter, as Ilham mentioned, in the Specialty Polymers business. Sales in this business unit alone were up 33% in Q3, reaching EUR 570 million, and this reflects continued high demand across all its key markets.
As Ilham referenced, growth was across all markets by the business, and we continue our penetration of materials into auto and in particular, electric vehicle batteries where our technologies can be found in binders and separators and enclosures as well as sealing and cooling applications. Altogether, these grew by almost 50%, 5-0 percent over last year. And that's not the only market growing double digits. Our polymer sales into electronics also grew around 50% in the quarter. This was boosted by semiconductors, electrical components as well as smart devices. Sales also grew 20% in health care, and that includes polymers that are used in medical devices and pharmaceutical packaging. 
Turning to Composites. Sales are up 6% year-on-year as we start to see some signs of recovery. This quarter was the first with year-on-year volume increase since the beginning of the pandemic. It's also the third consecutive sequential improvement. Now it's important to note that our top line was again affected by supply chain, labor and manufacturing issues. The recovery that we're seeing is mainly visible in single-aisle craft, but do keep in mind the high level of inventories that are still there for the 737 MAX. And we need to see that reduced before we see a more pronounced acceleration of production rates expected by customers starting in 2022. Sales of the space and defense markets also grew in the quarter and have remained resilient.
Turning to profitability. The EBITDA of Materials in Q3 increased 52% year-on-year, and EBITDA margins improved almost 600 basis points to 32.7%, primarily driven by the record sales in specialty polymers by sustained pricing and significant cost reductions especially in the Composites business.
Turning to Chemicals on Slide 8. Third quarter sales in the segment, up 20%. All businesses experiencing organic growth year-on-year. Soda ash sales were up 8% in the quarter, and that's driven by higher volumes, slightly offset by lower prices. Demand trends in the third quarter were similar to what we saw in Q2 with sustained demand in the building market where flat glass is used, while the container glass market that's used in hospitality, restaurant, catering, HORECA industry, slightly improved sequentially, although it still lags 2019 levels.
Sales in the bicarbonate product line continue to be very strong. That's about 1/4 of our business there, the bicarbonate product line and it's very strong mainly in the U.S., driven by our SOLVAir technology that's used in flue gas treatments, which as -- I highlighted just a few moments ago, it represents alone about 10% of the business sales.
Peroxide sales were up 11%, driven by volumes and prices. Market conditions remained strong in HPPO, which is used in automotive and building industries predominantly. Volume growth was further supported by customer wins in the electronic markets. Our silica business had another strong quarter. Sales growth of 17% with strong continued growth in the replacement tire market.
The business also continues to benefit from market share gains, thanks to the penetration of its sustainable solutions, including our highly dispersible silica for tires that enable better rolling resistance and far better wear. The Coatis business in Latin America is going from strength to strength. It's continuing its record run. Sales up 70% against Q3 last year, reflecting continued strong demand, customer wins as well as pricing actions.
Wrapping up, the EBITDA of Chemicals segment increased 19% year-on-year, thanks to higher volumes in all businesses, high prices and also very strong contribution from our RusVinyl joint venture, which is in Russia in PVC. Taking all this together, it translated to an EBITDA margin of 27.3% in the quarter.
I'm now going to turn to the Solutions segment, which you can see outlined on page -- on Slide #9. This segment delivered sales growth of 28% this quarter. Beginning with Novecare, sales were up 25%, driven by double-digit growth across key markets, including coatings, industrial products used in auto and building and construction markets. We also saw more robust demand, more somewhat sustainable technologies, which supported the double-digit growth -- sales growth in agro as well as HPC, home and personal care markets.
You may have noticed that we also have now provided separate sales figures for the oil and gas business, which today represents about EUR 100 million in sales in Q3, a sharp improvement over last year. We really hope that you welcome this additional disclosure, not least because it helps to also highlight the significant progress being achieved by Novecare in all its non-oil and gas markets. To be clear, most of oil and gas business resulted in the Novecare business units in the past. And we've added 1 product line from our Technology Solutions business because that also supports the oil and gas market. And now what we have is a distinctive business where all of our fracking activities reside.
The Special Chem business delivered sales growth of 26% in Q3, again reflecting the continued strength in the electronics sector, particularly in semiconductors. Now although products used in the automotive sector showed modest growth against last year, the business is now feeling the impact of the slowdown in production related to the chip shortage that I'm sure you're all aware of. 
In Technology Solutions, sales were up 27% in the quarter, driven by higher volumes and strong pricing across the mining sector. As we mentioned last quarter, we are gaining market share with existing customers, and we're winning new customers as well. Other product lines, including phosphorus specialties and additives are also progressing and are supporting the growth. 
In our Aroma business, sales were up 16% in the quarter, driven by strong demand in food and beverage as well as flavors and fragrance markets. Wrapping up Solutions. The segment delivered 28% EBITDA growth versus Q3 last year, reflecting the strong and continued recovery across most markets, whereas the EBITDA margin was stable at 18.3%.
Now I'll move to the group financials. And first and foremost, I would like to share some elements that are related to the inflationary cost increases that we experienced in the third quarter because they reached EUR 145 million versus Q3 last year and a sharp increase versus the second quarter. And please note that the impacts I'm highlighting are after our well-established hedging practices.
To give you a bit more color, about 80%, 8-0, of this increase relates directly to raw materials and energy and the balanced logistics. Keep in mind that a significant part of the energy increase is related to the spike in natural gas in Europe, which manifested itself in the latter part -- in the latter half of the third quarter. As a result of these developments, we now estimate that the full year cost inflation will be of the order of EUR 400 million, that's 400, rather than the EUR 250 million we'd indicated in July. Now that's the backdrop that has really motivated us to really drive and accelerate the increase in prices as the main lever that helps us to maintain our leading margins.
Turning to cost savings on Slide 10. Once again, we've been able to generate new additional cost savings, this time EUR 41 million in the third quarter. There are 3 main areas for that delivery. First and foremost, restructuring, which came in at EUR 18 million, and that reflects the reductions in labor-related costs. And you know that we've launched different simplification and restructuring plans such as in composites, but really across the group as we will continue to delayer. These plans have thus far resulted in EUR 171 million of savings since the beginning of 2020.
Indirect cost reductions came in at EUR 15 million, and that also reflects the benefit of programs such as the zero-based budgeting that we put in place last year. And then finally, productivity efficiencies at our sites came in with EUR 6 million in this quarter. This brings our year-to-date total structural cost savings to EUR 172 million. Therefore, I can confirm that we are on track to achieve our full year guidance of EUR 200 million.
Now you may also remember that our objective is to achieve EUR 500 million structural cost reductions by 2024. We remain well on track. And indeed, at the end of 2021, the cumulative cost reductions over the 2-year period should amount to EUR 375 million. That's EUR 200 million more than fixed cost inflation. These cost reductions, together with the strong top line performance that you've seen have allowed us to post another strong EBITDA performance, coming in at EUR 599 million which represents a 31% organic increase against last year, and nearly 7% against 2019 as well on a like-for-like basis. That's really encouraging.
Now what I also want to do is to highlight that this EBITDA performance has been achieved in a very specific context. This beginning of the year, the impact from increasing raw materials, energy and logistics, particularly taking Q2 and Q3, now that totaled EUR 210 million so far this year. Now that is unprecedented. Therefore, these new market conditions, these headwinds, they require new actions. They require a new way of facing off to these headwinds, and we'll be actively pursuing those price increases across our businesses to mitigate the significant headwind. I can tell you that, for example, we've been engaged very deeply with customers as we seek to both meet their needs but also preserve our margins because everybody understands the necessity to maintain that balance, that important balance in our commercial relationships as we navigate together through these challenging times.
And again, you can see, actually, that are strong margins show that we're making progress. That said, there is more to be done. We can never relent. And of course, I can tell you that the focus of the entire leadership in Solvay and for the entire commercial organization is very much around maintaining our leading position in the market and driving pricing up. That is key. I would suggest to you that has been our priority #1 for quite a few months this year.
But there's more. Cash is where it matters as well. It's where the rubber hits the road, as we say. So if you can turn to Slide 11, you know it's important to us. We worked really hard for more than 2 years to drive sustainable and consistent improvement in cash generation. And I'm really pleased that we're continuing to deliver. For the tenth quarter in a row, we're delivering positive free cash flow, this time EUR 276 million in the quarter. Since the beginning of the year, the total is EUR 692 million, slightly higher than the first 9 months of last year when we exclude scope, currency and the onetime elements that you recall we highlighted last year.
Now I would like to highlight a few additional elements to give you some color on that free cash flow. And I'll start with working capital. The current top line growth is driving a natural increase in our inventories, in our receivables, but we are managing it very, very carefully. And up to now, everything is completely under control. Just look at working capital to sales, you will see that and it speaks for itself. As of end of Q3, we're about 2% better than we were at the beginning of 2020, for example, stronger than in 2019 as well. That discipline is here to stay.
Two, CapEx. You see that we spent EUR 412 million in the first 9 months, which is broadly the same amount as last year. Now despite our best efforts to resume to ramp up our investment plan, we were impacted by raw material shortages and supply chain issues that again are very well-known for the whole industries, many industries. Now as a result of this, we now expect to finish the year with a total CapEx slightly below the EUR 700 million -- slightly below EUR 700 million. And you know that we compare with EUR 700 million to EUR 750 million we indicated to you at the very beginning of this year.
Third point I'd like to add on free cash flow is, as you know, we're deepening, we're accelerating our restructuring programs. We spent EUR 39 million in cash to make that happen, which brings the 9-month total to EUR 92 million. That's the highest I've seen for many, many years. It's actually EUR 26 million more than last year. The payback is very compelling.
Finally, not in -- but certainly not the least impact, but it's very important, is the continued deleveraging of our balance sheet. The benefit of all the work done on pensions and on our debt are paying off and are visible in the bottom line with pension financial charges together being EUR 32 million below the first 9 months of last year. As a result of all these actions, our free cash flow conversion ratio is close to 40%, 4-0 percent, for the last 12 months.
Finally, before I turn back to Ilham, a word on our net debt. The level at the end of September 2021 is slightly below the end of 2020. The strong free cash flow and the inflows related to the 6 divestments more than offset both the dividend payments of EUR 388 million and EUR 102 million voluntary contribution to our pensions that we made in Belgium, in fact, in the first quarter this year.
And I remind you that we still have plans to make another EUR 300 million in additional contributions in the next 6 months, which will bring the cumulative additional pension contributions to about EUR 1.1 billion. Indeed, on the question of debt and pensions, it's useful to take a step back sometimes and to really take note of the cumulative progress on our global indebtedness since 2019.
And Ilham, I'm not sure if you realize this, but since you became CEO, the fact is -- and this is a real fact, that our balance sheet has strengthened by EUR 2.5 billion in just 10 quarters with a fall in net debt from EUR 5.5 billion to EUR 4 billion now, a fall in pensions from EUR 2.7 billion to EUR 1 billion. I just wanted to make note of that because when you look at each quarter individually, we may sometimes miss the big picture.
And with that, I'll hand you back to Ilham, who will provide our outlook for the remainder of the year."

I'll now comment on our outlook for the full year shown on Slide 12. We are very pleased to confirm today our full year EBITDA guidance for 2021 despite the key headwinds facing the whole industry today. The fourth quarter won't be easy to navigate, considering not only the strong demand in a lot of markets; the usual softness during the holiday season; the chip shortages impacting some auto businesses; the raw material, logistics and supply chain disruptions; or the potential power restriction in China as you all know.
So some of our brands that are sold out 1 day and have to slow down or stop the day after because of these issues, and discussions with clients on price increases or difficulty to deliver products, in fact, managing these uncertainties has become an integral part of the daily job of our teams. It's also somewhat difficult to anticipate the full impact of cost increases and disruptions given the very high volatility we see with some raw materials and with the energy prices in Europe. As Karim mentioned, our best estimate for the full year inflationary cost impact is now about EUR 400 million. So things are changing rapidly, and we are fully mobilized to respond effectively and we are ready.
Notwithstanding these challenges, our focus on the top line gives the confidence to confirm our EUR 2.2 billion to EUR 2.3 billion EBITDA guidance for the full year. I remind you, this represents 20% to 25% growth on an organic basis against 2020 and around 4% against 2019. Even plus 13% excluding composites and oil and gas, which had a slower recovery. On cash, we are increasing, as Karim said, our free cash flow guidance and now estimate generating around EUR 800 million for the full year. This will represent a free cash flow conversion ratio between 35% and 40%, higher than our strategic commitments and 3 years ahead of time.
In short, we have not forgotten the lessons learned during the COVID crisis, and we are making good use of them today to make Solvay even stronger. This means we will continue to be innovative, to think differently, to stay close to our customers, drive value and to go the extra mile. And we will continue to implement our growth strategy and look forward to the future, a future that will be more sustainable for sure.
So by now, Karim and I will be happy to take your questions. Back to you, Jodi."

I'm not sure if you agree with those numbers, but is there a way to think about the percentage price increase you need next year to pass this through? Is it around 20%? Or is that -- am I way off there?"

Yes, indeed, you've seen the IHS publication is EUR 40 ton, 20% more or less for Europe in 2022. There are also prices up in APAC, about USD 300 almost per ton as we speak, et cetera, and [ USD 350, USD 350 ] LatAM and EMEA. You can take them as a proxy. You always know that we at Solvay we are in the higher range and above this. The way to look at it is that, obviously, this is a high energy intense business. Obviously, we have a policy of also energy hedging. We don't disclose the amount of it, but it's supporting us and helping us. And you've seen our numbers in terms of pricing in the sales bridge against the quarterly cost savings, although we don't disclose it on a business unit level.
Believe it or not, this is the first time in our history where we have started renegotiating the prices on soda ash business, right, in a given year for contracted business because it's abnormal times. Our customers, they understand that. So we are discussing it with them. And obviously, as we are in quarter 4, we are also starting the discussion as traditionally we do for next year pricing. So more to come as usual, and you've seen it through my tenure with the team, we will ensure that we protect our margin and continue ensuring that in each business, it deserves the prices it should deserve.
On the neutrality, and maybe, Karim, you can give a bit of color how we are going to send this. Obviously, you've seen us announcing carbon neutrality and it's a big day for Solvay because we are part of the chemical industry, which is harder to [ abate ] industry. We've been working on this since my arrival in the company in March 2019. Obviously, Solvay One Planet was the first step to declare a bigger ambition on sustainability. We joined the Paris Agreement. We joined the SBTi last year. We did 2 ex-Paris in 2019, 2020, so 4% structural decrease in emissions in 2019, 2020. And Paris requested 2%. This shows -- and we did it on high-value projects with good returns.
On the soda ash, you know that soda ash represents last year, I think 2020 was 64% of our emissions. So there is a soda ash case and non-soda ash and that's why we are making the split. On the soda ash side, it's about exiting coal, and we have 7 assets in Europe, which are still using coal as primary energy. Since I joined the company, we are now announcing the second plant, Dombasle in France after Rheinberg in Germany we announced earlier in the year, exiting coal, which has approved -- has been approved by the Board of Directors yesterday. And we are doing it through recourse financing, obviously. So we deconsolidate, but the CapEx is turning to OpEx. And we asked the team to do it. It's very simple, it's to show me and to show us and obviously, it's a competitive landscape that we can do it at lower landed costs, including vis-a-vis our natural imported competition. And that's what we are doing with those 2 investments.
And moving away from coal or gas, you've seen it now with the spike in gas pricing, it actually supports our less cyclicality and dependency of highly cyclical energy, right? And that's what we are going to do with biomass based on wood chips in Rheinberg. And here, we are using what we call RDF, refuse-derived fuel, which is, by the way, just [ nonbio-derived ] waste, right? We burn the waste. And this is going to be good for the planet, but also profitable. Karim, anything to add on financing?"

I think it is a good proxy. But the reality is it's not going to be as linear as that. However, the important point, and I'll go back to what Ilham has said, is there will be a fair proportion of that, that will be nonrecourse financing. So yes, we use the strength of our balance sheet, but the cash will stay with us as well. More importantly, this will not get in the way of our growth plans and it also won't undermine the capital discipline and the real focus we have on generating returns. And I say that because what really like about this from a pure financial standpoint is the returns are really compelling. This underpins the resilience and improves the competitiveness of all our businesses without in any way disrupting our growth potential, and that's what I find particularly attractive. 
And clearly, maybe to give you an example, we announced you recall Rheinberg, same thing we moved away from coal earlier in the year. Soda ash, we've announced Dombasle. Both of them benefit also from project financing. Again, this is an example, let's say, being smart, using other people's money wisely, let's say, putting in the equity we need and that helps us to move the agenda. As I said, the returns are very, very strong. I hope that helps."

Is there an understanding that the pricing will need to come down when the raw materials come off or potentially in 2022 and therefore, we see the margin remaining flat as opposed to a margin expansion story?
The second question is a bit longer term. On capital allocation, with the strategic review of the soda ash division and the strong performance of materials business that you're seeing now, are you open to large ticket M&A? Or do you think the focus is still very much on cost containment and efficiency execution before you turn to thinking about big-ticket M&A? That would be helpful."

Well, listen, on pricing, frankly, although it's painful specifically the level of inflation we see now, and it's probably very unusual and first time in my career I see such spike in such short period of time. A",538,"Yes. Thank you very much for the question. Well, listen, on pricing, frankly, although it's painful specifically the level of inflation we see now, and it's probably very unusual and first time in my career I see such spike in such short period of time. Actually, a side of me like it because it stress tests our value proposition, and it's the best timing to go and get pricing, not only for commodities, obviously, but also for specialties. So yes, I mean, we are discussing constructively with all our customers, right? Our sales team is working hard. 
You may remember actually, I told you after getting fit and working on our cost, and I think Karim has given you a color on how the infrastructure now is getting leaner, better, more efficient and productive at Solvay, now it's the time we are switching gears to the growth potential of Solvay. And I think, frankly, even before joining the company that's what attracted me. We have -- we are the only one who has all these specialty polymers and the carbon fiber, the composite know-how in one home. And we are unique there. And you see it now when I told you back in 2019 at the growth strategy launch that the battery platform and the thermoplastic platform are going to be the emerging growth platform. I mean, frankly, even me, I couldn't believe that it's going to be so quickly increasing and growing after 1.5 years or 2 years.
So we have a unique value proposition. You've seen that our sales, you can -- in our sales bridge, we've achieved EUR 139 million in price increases in the quarter versus EUR 145 million cost impact. Those are the data and there is more to do given the headwinds, which remains and are clearly increasing in quarter 4. We expected it at the beginning of the year, but I told you EUR 200 million, EUR 250 million, now it's more EUR 400 million. And we are still continuing to increase prices. In the open volumes, we have energy surcharges. We are putting it. I told you that's the first time in our history where even contracted business like in soda ash, we are putting it on the table and customers, they understand. I mean they look at the numbers and the data like you do and I do. So that's extremely important.
So -- and we are anticipating the '22 price negotiations they are underway, just too early now to talk about it. And as you know, for contracts, there is a lag between cost increase and price increase. In average that's always 4 months, right? That's the example in silica, for example, and in commodities like Coatis, we are capturing the increase right away. And indeed, for the sustainability of it, I think what I like is it stress tests specifically the specialty portfolio. So now we are looking at our value proposition, our value pricing. And obviously, if we believe that we were not pricing enough and well our product and solution, we will fix it through this period of renegotiations, including, by the way, the terms and conditions. Karim, you want to address the other question?"

But at the moment, the focus is on driving that improvement. Not just financials, you can see the results, they speak for themselves, but also in terms of sustainability on the 2 projects.
So what's our view on M&A? We are clearly open. We're looking to upgrade our portfolio with discipline, absolutely with discipline. We won't overpay ever. We will make sure we focus on returns. So we look -- and clearly, we have some dry powder, look at the cash on our balance sheet. So to my mind, of course, we're looking very selectively and where that's very strategically coherent, where we find opportunities, we don't hesitate. And you've seen us acquire. Okay, it was small, a small business on agro, Novecare. Because we saw that we're clearly a very good owner that can drive a lot of value.
My only regret on that particular one, I wish it was 10x bigger. That would've been nice. So what I'd say is we are looking. Cash funding is not a constraint to our ambitions. It really is around driving the agenda organically in the first instance, priority #1, but also the portfolio lever is there and we'll take our time to find the right opportunity there."

We started it a bit later, and the objective of our carve-out is to reinforce the internal financial and operation transparency and accountability and increase the strategic flexibility and this remains our focus at the moment. I have done such carve-outs in my career. I know they can be complicated specifically for a founding business like soda ash at Solvay. And we indicated that in February 2021. It's going to last approximately 12 to 15 months. So you can expect better news by the end of quarter 2 next year. 
And when -- and if we make additional M&A decision, we will inform the markets. At this stage, there are no decisions. We are just busy with the carve-out and doing the right thing here. To give you an example, a significant number of legal entities out of total of 400 entities needs to be reviewed, and we consider carefully. So it takes time. And transformation is a process, not a destination. I mean we are not for sellers, and we are guided by improving Solvay's profile in order to create shareholder value. So that's key for us. And we've done it with 6 recent small product line divestitures. When we believe we are not the right owners, when we believe there are commodities, we make a deal, provided people are paying the right multiple.

I think -- but as I told you, Chetan and the team, I think I was -- frankly, during my career, inflation times are really good times to really challenge your pricing strategy, right? As we speak, we hired people to help us, externally even, to review thousands of contracts, terms and condition, the formula pricing, inbound, outbound.
Do we have the right formula in terms of energy, in terms of logistics, in terms of raw material and vulnerability here and there? Whenever we have a full supplier, we are validating and qualifying more than one. We are having a discussion, as I told you, I give you the extreme example of soda ash because it's historically in our history. And frankly, when I put it on the table with the team, obviously, it's never happened. But when you go, the customers understand that it's fair. It's very credible. They need winning suppliers.
So we are doing this. So we are on pricing every day. Costs are increasing. We don't see them decreasing. I don't have a crystal ball on energy and gas for next year. I'm hearing different energy companies, and we have our intel where it's going to go, but I am now counting with the team that H1 costs are not going to ease up. If it does, good news. It's going to be an upside. So therefore, we are keeping our pricing momentum and we're reviewing it every week with our team here, with the corporate team. So we are doing just that, and this is important.
Then the question -- there was a question about batteries. Yes, I mean, again, very happy that we -- since 2019, we really played the batteries game as a platform. I know it's -- as a platform, I'm not sure it really struck you guys, in 2019 was my first 9 months in the job. I was struck by the power-leading technology, power position of Solvay. And when I say we circle the battery, I'm weighing my word. I mean batteries, the cathode and the anode. We are in separators, we're in electrolytes, we're in the casing and now we have even soda ash and lithium mining. And we are technology agnostic, and that's what you are alluding to, probably, Chetan. We are not making anode, cathode or separators material but developing binders, coating and electrolyte.
So battery technology, it means using those different cathode chemistries and the answer is we are present in all. So different generation of batteries with commercialized Generation 2. We are already qualifying Generation 3 and Generation 5, which is the solid, we are working on this. 
Now on the technologies, it's beyond PVDF, that's what you asked for. We're not going to disclose which one is our preferred one because we have still competing technologies, but we are working on several ones. And the launch of this dry room lab and another line to assemble and already mimic what a solid battery of tomorrow can be is the testimony that we are progressing very fast with our customers. I think I -- that was the question around solid batteries, yes? Back to you."

So we're EUR 200 million to EUR 210 million of the way there. So that implies for the headwinds of the order of EUR 190 million to EUR 200 million in Q4, within our guidance. What we said is we will give you -- we expect to deliver an EBITDA for the full year between EUR 2.2 million, EUR 2.3 million. I'm not going to give you a precise answer. What I can tell you is we have factored in an expectation that we will mitigate now. Part of that will absolutely come from pricing. You saw what we did in Q3. The run rate of what we saw in Q3, that hasn't fully crystallized but also come through to the bottom line.
So in terms of euros, I can tell you, but I don't want to give you a percentage of because I think it could be unhelpful in many, many respects. It's the euros were looking at. But I do expect us more than ever to, let's say, to really maintain our leading margins. If I said it differently, we really like the fact that our EBITDA margin now 9 months into the year is 24.1%. If I can ignore 2020, look at 2019, that's 1.1% better than 2019. And I'm not going to say that's going to reduce, go up a bit. Yes, of course, there are always little seasonal impacts, et cetera. But do expect us to keep those leading margins. That's really what we're saying. But it may not be linear from 1 quarter exactly to the other.

The first question is around pricing and raw materials. You only had 1% pricing in Q3 for the division. So I'm assuming that there wasn't a lot of pricing, and there wasn't a lot of raw material inflation. I was wondering if you could talk about maybe the delay in inflation in composites because of the fiber contractual arrangements, but also what you're expecting in terms of the further innovation in specialty polymers.
And the second question on Specialty Polymers. On silica, you talked about the decline in car production and the issue with chip shortages. I'm surprised that polymers have managed to have the highest sales on record in the history of Solvay when car production is about 20% below all-time highs. So I'm just wondering, is it that the non-auto parts of Specialty Polymers is doing phenomenally well? Or is there some results in the chain?"

I may start, Karim, and I'll start probably with Specialty Polymers, right? Well, you've seen the numbers, obviously, a very good quarter on Specialty Polymers, and we expected it to be this way. Let me start with the market situation because you hea",531,"Yes. I may start, Karim, and I'll start probably with Specialty Polymers, right? Well, you've seen the numbers, obviously, a very good quarter on Specialty Polymers, and we expected it to be this way. Let me start with the market situation because you hear a lot about auto and probably you are trying to compare us with other peers. From OEM perspective, there was no major slowdown yet in quarter 3, right? So from a Specialty Polymers' perspective, absolutely our demand has been extremely high since January, by the way, yet we did have some customers' orders cancel here and there even in quarter 3. So we do expect to see some slowdown in quarter 4 and this is factored in our forecast.
The story on our results, it's a bit in my mind, I try to make it in a simple way. Even with some softness in demand, we still have full plants, right? That's what we see. I mean there's a lot of red in the capacity utilization here. There may be some inventory, but we don't think there is much yet on inventory buildup based on our intelligence directly with our customers. And here, I feel better than last year because last year, when the COVID-19 hit us, we didn't have a central order book, and we didn't waste a good crisis. So we built a central order book now where we have a pulse a bit on what's going on, and we are in direct contact with our customers. So some parts of the value chain had no inventory, so they try to rebuild, but it's getting consumed immediately, so no backlog.
Therefore, our -- many of our customers believe it's I'm not still screaming for inventory in quarter 3, and that's what we know from our intelligence again. Intrinsic demand from consumers. Still there are people who are still buying cars. Now OEMs are giving priority because of the chip shortages. You've seen it, and that's what we hear to the high-end, high-margin vehicles. And both are either EV or luxury brands, high-performance vehicle is the sweet spot of Specialty Polymers. It allows, frankly, the OEM to sustain their margin. Also, Specialty Polymers are used in this type of vehicle, therefore, we still saw a high demand in quarter 3, specifically on those areas. And we see a continued penetration of EV and hybrids, as you know, where we have more weight in this vehicle.
You remember my [ 6, 9, 12, ], 6 in ICE, mining, electric and 12 in hybrid. So the OEMs favoring those models, it's better for us. So all in all, the forecast, market is probably getting softer. This will somewhat affect us in quarter 4. It's again in the forecast, and it's in there already. And please note, I mean we talk about auto and batteries and like that, but all other markets in Specialty Polymers outside auto are also performing very well and growing at high rates. So all of this together translated into superior performance in quarter 3 and a new record. You want to talk about actually carbon fiber as well? You don't want to that? Yes?"

We procured a large option of our needs, as you know. And this means we have less of an issue with fixed costs, right? Although, as you know, last year with the slowdown and halting of civil aviation, we did what it takes. We structured our infrastructure. Two plants have been closing. The third one is underway. We didn't lose volumes. And frankly, composite material, when the aviation, civil, because defense is doing well, will get back to 2019 level, which we expect by 2013 is going to be a far better business that's very healthy and higher margin than what you've seen from [indiscernible] or even the composite material within Solvay in the earlier days of this decade.
And indeed, we are -- we procure our needs. Our contract structure provides some protection. We have formula pricing, as you know, but we are also able to get pricing, obviously, because we had those formula pricing. We have multiyear formula pricing. And as we speak, we are also reviewing those formula. But yes, definitely, we can pass on some pricing."
