The COVID-19 pandemic, global macroeconomic conditions, social unrest and geopolitical changes all posed significant challenges to enterprises around the world. In this context, Gart",919,"Good morning, and thanks for joining us. 2020 was an extraordinary year. The COVID-19 pandemic, global macroeconomic conditions, social unrest and geopolitical changes all posed significant challenges to enterprises around the world. In this context, Gartner delivered a strong performance across contract value, revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. 
As many of you know, we entered 2020 with a financial plan to align costs with revenues. By executing this plan and taking swift cost actions when the pandemic first began, we quickly stabilized our financial position. We maintained disciplined cost management throughout the year while restoring investments to support future growth. We successfully pivoted our global workforce to operate effectively in a remote environment. We grew our capability in key functions across our business. We drove strong operational execution, and we were extremely agile in serving our clients, pivoting our content to address critical, contemporary issues, such as the pandemic, remote work environments, cost optimization and business continuity. We are well positioned to spring back quickly as the macroeconomic environment improves. 
Our performance improved in Q4 compared to earlier in 2020. We delivered strong performances in GBS contract value, research revenues, EBITDA and free cash flow. Research is our largest and most profitable segment. There is a vast market opportunity across all sectors, sizes and geographies. Our research segment serves executives and their teams across all major enterprise functions in every industry around the world. We are uniquely positioned to support leaders enterprise-wide on hundreds of critically important topics. Topics with the highest interest during Q4 included data and analytics, cost optimization and talent management. 
Global technology sales, or GTS, serves leaders and their teams within IT. For the full year 2020, GTS contract value grew 4%. Our key underlying metrics have improved each quarter since Q2. Fourth quarter 2020 contract value from new logos was up from 1 year ago, while cancels were about the same. 
Our existing clients continued to increase their spend. However, it was a slower pace than in 2019. This was the biggest factor impacting our growth in the quarter. 
Client engagement continued to be strong, with both content and analyst interactions up 30% versus 2019. We saw strong performances across several regions and industries, including tech, retail and services. Some of the topics with the highest interest included digital transformation, application development, cloud management and the digital workplace. We expect GTS contract value growth to accelerate in 2021 and return to double-digit growth in the future. 
Global business sales, or GBS, serves leaders and their teams beyond IT. This includes HR, supply chain, finance, marketing, sales, legal and more. GBS contract value continued to perform well throughout the year, with contract value growth of 7%. New business growth was a very strong 26% in the quarter, driven by our GXL product line. The sales, finance and HR practices all ended Q4 with double-digit growth rates. And all practices, with the exception of marketing, contributed to GBS' growth. 
Across our entire research business, we've practiced relentless execution of proven practices, and we're seeing the results of our efforts. Our research business is well positioned to return to sustained double-digit growth over the medium term. 
Turning to conferences. As many of you know, our conferences segment had great momentum coming out of 2019, but was hard hit in 2020 by the global pandemic. To replace our traditional in-person destination conferences, which were no longer possible in 2020, we pivoted to virtual conferences. The performance of these conferences exceeded our expectations in 2020. And now, with several months' experience under our belt, we've got a set of best practices that we'll continue to refine. Our value proposition for virtual conferences remains the same as for in-person conferences. We deliver extraordinarily valuable insights to an engaged and qualified audience. 
Beyond virtual conferences, operationally, we're preparing to return to in-person conferences in the second half of 2021. 
Gartner consulting is an extension of Gartner research and helps clients execute their most strategic initiatives through deeper, extended project-based works. Our consulting segment was also impacted by the pandemic, with revenues down 12% in Q4 and 5% for the full year 2020. Over the past several years, we've made great progress in our consulting business. And it will continue to serve as an important complement to our IT research business. 
Company-wide, we continue to strengthen our stance against racism and discrimination. We appointed a new leader of diversity, equity and inclusion. We established a center of excellence dedicated to improvement in this area. And we strengthened our employee resource groups, which helped remove barriers for diverse populations and support associate engagement. 
Sustainability is an important factor in how we manage our business. For example, we've signed contracts for our Stamford headquarters and our U.K. hub to be powered by 100% renewable energy. We'll be eliminating single-use plastics across our offices. And finally, we're benchmarking our environmental footprint and development programs to minimize it over time. 
Summarizing, we performed well in the context of a pandemic. Looking ahead, we are well positioned for sustained growth. We expect to return to revenue growth in 2021 and are on track to return to double-digit CV and revenue growth thereafter. 
We expect to deliver 2021 EBITDA margins, up 2019, and to further expand margins over time. 
We generate significant free cash flow in excess of net income, which we'll deploy to return capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and make strategic tuck-in acquisitions. 
With that, I'll hand the call over to Craig. Craig?"
130705,702313345,2200285,"Gartner, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 09, 2021",2021-02-09,"Earnings Calls","Gartner, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gene, and good morning. I hope everyone remains safe and well.

As",2713,"Thank you, Gene, and good morning. I hope everyone remains safe and well. 
Fourth quarter results were ahead of our expectations, headlined by a strong performance in GBS, better-than-planned cost management and outstanding free cash flow generation. As our 2021 guidance highlights, we expect total revenue to increase versus 2020 while also positioning Gartner for a return to strong growth. 
Looking out over the medium term, we continue to expect double-digit CV in revenue growth, modest margin expansion and strong free cash flow generation. Because we can fund growth investments, we have ample capital to return to shareholders and to deploy to strategic tuck-in acquisitions when we find the right opportunities. Our Board authorized an additional $300 million for repurchases, bringing the total available to around $860 million. 
Reviewing our year-over-year financial performance for the full year 2020. Total contract value increased 4%. Total FX-neutral revenue was down 3%. FX-neutral adjusted EBITDA increased 20%. Diluted adjusted EPS was a strong $4.89. And free cash flow was $819 million, up almost 100% from 2019. We did see some timing benefits, which I will discuss a bit later. 
Fourth quarter revenue was $1.1 billion, down 8% as reported and 9% FX-neutral. Excluding conferences, our revenues were up 2% year-over-year FX-neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 68%, up more than 580 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA was $245 million, up 13% year-over-year and up 10% FX-neutral. Adjusted EPS was $1.59. And free cash flow in the quarter was a robust $237 million. 
Research revenue in the fourth quarter grew 5% year-over-year as reported and 4% on an FX-neutral basis. Fourth quarter research contribution margin was 72%, benefiting in part from the temporary cost avoidance initiatives we put in place starting in the first quarter of 2020. 
Total contract value grew 4% FX-neutral to $3.6 billion at December 31. This was the highest contract value in Gartner history, a notable achievement in a challenging year. 
For the full year 2020, research revenues increased by 7%, both on a reported and FX-neutral basis. The gross contribution margin was 72%, up about 240 basis points from the prior year. 
Global technology sales contract value at the end of the fourth quarter was $2.9 billion, up almost 4% versus the prior year. The selling environment continued to improve in the fourth quarter, but we are still seeing less upsell with existing clients than normal. Our clients are staying with us, but not adding as much incremental CV as we've historically seen given the challenging economic environment. Moving forward, we expect win backs and a return to more expansion with existing clients to contribute to growth in 2021, consistent with our experience coming out of the last downturn. By industry, CV growth was led by technology, retail and services. 
While retention for GTS was 98% for the quarter, down about 600 basis points year-over-year. A majority of our industry groups saw retention improved from the third quarter. GTS new business declined 5% versus last year, an improvement from both the second and third quarters. Our regular full set of metrics can be found in our earnings supplement. 
Global business sales contract value was $696 million at the end of the fourth quarter. That's about 20% of our total contract value. 
CV increased 7% year-over-year. CV growth was led by the health care and technology industries. The sales, finance and human resources practices all recorded double-digit CV growth for the year. All practices contributed to the 7% CV growth rate for GBS with the exception of marketing, which was impacted by discontinued products. That said, our marketing business saw improving retention rates and a return to year-over-year new business growth in the fourth quarter. 
Wallet retention for GBS was 101% for the quarter, down 43 basis points year-over-year. GBS new business was up 26% over last year, led by very strong growth in HR, finance and legal. As with GTS, our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in our earnings supplement. Overall, GBS continued to demonstrate its resilience and strength as we exited 2020. 
The conferences segment was materially impacted by the global pandemic, as you know. During the year, we pivoted to producing virtual conferences with a focus on maximizing the value we deliver for our clients. We held 13 virtual conferences in the fourth quarter. We also held a number of virtual Evanta meetings, shifting these 1-day local conferences online due to the pandemic. 
Conferences revenue for the quarter was $93 million. Contribution margin in the quarter was 78%. 
Our fast transition to virtual conferences has been positive for the overall business. As we discussed last quarter, virtual conferences offer significant value to our research clients and prospects. And while we've shown that we can run virtual conferences profitably, it is important to recognize the different economics associated with virtual versus in-person conferences. 
Similar to last quarter, I'd highlight 2 primary differences. First, our mix of revenue from attendees and exhibitors has essentially flipped. With the in-person format, approximately 2/3 of revenue comes from exhibitors and 1/3 from attendees. In the virtual format, we've seen about 2/3 of revenue come from attendees. 
Second, the vast majority of our attendee revenue has continued to come from research contract entitlements as opposed to incremental tickets. 
I'd also highlight that our fourth quarter destination conferences have historically been our largest, most profitable conferences. In 2020, we held our biggest, most highly anticipated conferences of the year in the fourth quarter in a virtual format. 
For the full year 2020, revenue decreased by 75%, both on a reported and FX-neutral basis. Gross contribution margin was 48%, down about 290 basis points from 2019 as we maintained some of our cost of service as well as SG&A despite the lower revenue. We did this to ensure we were in a position to execute our new virtual conferences and to resume in-person conferences when it is safe and permitted. Lastly, the timing of receiving conference cancellation insurance claims remains uncertain, so we will not record any recoveries in excess of expenses incurred until the receipt of the insurance proceeds. 
Fourth quarter consulting revenues decreased by 10% year-over-year to $94 million. On an FX-neutral basis, revenues declined 12%. Consulting contribution margin was 26% in the fourth quarter, down about 160 basis points versus the prior year quarter due to lower contract optimization revenue, which usually flows through at high margins. 
Labor-based revenues were $73 million, down 10% versus Q4 of last year or 12% on an FX-neutral basis. Labor-based billable headcount of 730 was down 10%. Utilization was 63%, up about 300 basis points year-over-year. Backlog at December 31 was $100 million, down 14% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis. Our backlog provides us with about 4 months of forward revenue coverage. 
Our contract optimization business was down 9% on a reported basis versus the prior year quarter. As we have detailed in the past, this part of the consulting segment is highly variable. 
Full year consulting revenue was down 4% on a reported basis and 5% on an FX-neutral basis, and its gross contribution margin of 31% was up 68 basis points from 2019. 
SG&A decreased 6% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. SG&A as a percentage of revenue was up year-over-year as we restored certain compensation and benefit costs and had significantly less revenue from conferences. For the full year, SG&A decreased 3% on a reported and FX-neutral basis. 
EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $245 million, up 13% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 10% FX neutral. As we have seen improvements in the macro environment, we have resumed growth spending and started to restore some of the compensation and benefit programs which we had put on hold when the pandemic first hit. 
Fourth quarter EBITDA benefited from several factors. First, we've continued to maintain very strong cost discipline across the company. Second, we had better-than-planned revenue performance in research and conferences, which flowed through with very strong incremental margins. Third, we had planned for an increase in certain costs, such as travel, which didn't materialize due to pandemic-related shutdowns. And finally, we have been conservative in our implied fourth quarter guidance given the geopolitical uncertainty, due in part to the U.S. election, rising COVID counts and a still recovering global economy. 
Depreciation in the quarter was up approximately $4.5 million from last year, including expense acceleration from facilities-related charges. Amortization was down about $800,000 sequentially. 
Net interest expense, excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter, was $26 million, flat versus the fourth quarter of 2019. 
The Q4 adjusted tax rate, which we used for the calculation of adjusted net income, was 25% for the quarter. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 28.4% in the quarter. The adjusted tax rate for the full year was 21%. 
Adjusted EPS in Q4 was $1.59. For the full year, adjusted EPS was $4.89. EPS growth for the year was 25%. Note that about $7 million of equity compensation expense, which we normally would have incurred in the fourth quarter, has shifted into the first quarter of 2021. That was a benefit to fourth quarter adjusted EPS of about $0.07. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $260 million compared to $83 million last year. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily driven by cost avoidance initiatives, improved collections and timing of tax payments. 
CapEx for the quarter was $23 million, down 57% year-over-year. Lower CapEx is largely a function of lower real estate expansion needs due to the pandemic. 
We define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. Free cash flow for the quarter was $237 million, which is up about 700% versus the prior year. Free cash flow as a percent of revenue or free cash flow margin was 20% on a rolling 4-quarter basis, continuing the improvement we've been making over the past few years. Free cash flow was well in excess of GAAP and adjusted net income. Adjusted for timing and onetime benefits, 2020 normalized free cash flow margin is around 13%. We had a fantastic year for free cash flow driven by the resiliency of the business, continued strong collections, disciplined cost and cash management and lower cash taxes and deferrals of certain tax payments. 
We took a number of actions in 2020 to further strengthen our balance sheet. We had 2 successful bond offerings and amended and extended our credit facility. We reduced our maturity risk, and our annual interest expense will be lower starting in 2021. Our December 31 debt balance was $2 billion. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had about $1 billion of revolver capacity. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA is about 2.5x. 
At the end of the fourth quarter, we had $713 million of cash. We resumed our share repurchases after pausing earlier in the year, buying back $100 million in stock at an average price of $156 per share. The Board recently increased our share repurchase authorization by $300 million because we have significant capacity for buybacks from cash on hand and expected free cash flow. As of February 8, we have around $860 million available for open market repurchases. We expect the Board will refresh the repurchase authorization as needed going forward. We will deploy excess cash for share repurchases and strategic tuck-in acquisitions. 
Before providing the 2021 guidance details, I want to discuss our base level assumptions and planning philosophy for 2021. 
For research, most of our 2021 revenue is determined by our year-end 2020 contract value. As we move through the year, we will revisit the research revenue outlook. 
For conferences, our guidance is based on being 100% virtual for the full year. Operationally, we are planning to relaunch in-person 1-day events in the third quarter and in-person destination conferences starting in September. Our guidance includes fixed costs, primarily people and marketing related to both a full year of virtual and in-person conferences. We've excluded the variable costs, primarily venue-related, associated with the in-person conferences from our guidance. We've been able to run profitable virtual conferences in 2020, and that is reflected in our 2021 guidance. If we are able to run in-person conferences, we expect incremental upside to both our revenue and profitability for 2021. The economics in 2021, even in a partial in-person year, won't be fully back to normal. As we get closer to the go, no-go decision point, we'll provide additional insight to sizing the incremental revenue and profits. 
For consulting revenues, the compares get easier as we move through the year. We have more visibility into the first half based on the composition of our backlog and pipeline as usual. 
For expenses, we have planned for the full reinstatement of benefits that were either canceled or deferred in 2020. This includes our annual merit increase and certain other benefits. We are also returning to growing our sales forces, with planned quota-bearing headcount growth in the high single digits for both GTS and GBS. We have also planned for several additional programs, including technology investments. The impact of most of these expense restorations or investments impact our P&L starting in the second quarter. 
As you know, travel expense was close to 0 from April through December. Our current plans assume a modest ramp-up in travel-related expenses over the course of 2021. Most of this ramp is built into the second half of the year. If travel restrictions remain in place for longer than we've assumed, we'd see expense savings. 
Our guidance for 2021 is as follows: We expect research revenue of at least $3.815 billion, which is growth of at least 5.9%. We expect conferences revenue of at least $160 million, which is growth of at least 33%. We expect consulting revenue of at least $390 million, which is growth of at least 3.6%. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $4.365 billion, which is growth of 6.5%. Based on current foreign exchange rates and business mix, the consolidated growth includes an FX benefit of about 200 basis points. 
We expect full year adjusted EBITDA of at least $760 million, which is a decline of about 7%, and reported margins of at least 17.4%. This is based on conferences running virtual only. 
We expect our full year 2021 adjusted net interest expense to be $102 million. 
We expect an adjusted tax rate of around 22% for 2021. 
We expect 2021 adjusted EPS of at least $4.10. 
For 2021, we expect free cash flow of at least $630 million. This is before any insurance proceeds related to 2020 conference cancellations. 
It is also important to note that we have revalued our contract value at current year FX rates, which had a modest overall impact. Our 2020 ending contract value at 2021 FX rates is $2.9 billion for GTS and $706 million for GBS. Details are included in the appendix of the earnings supplement. 
All the details of our full year guidance are included on our Investor Relations site. 
Finally, we expect to deliver at least $200 million of EBITDA in Q1 of 2021. 
In summary, despite an unfavorable economic environment, we delivered better-than-planned financial results in 2020. We had outstanding free cash flow and strong EBITDA. We strengthened our balance sheet and moved quickly to implement cost avoidance initiatives while still investing for future growth. 
While there is still uncertainty in the macro outlook, our contract value held up better than in the last downturn. We were able to launch and monetize virtual conferences and virtual Evanta meetings. We will continue with targeted investments and restoration of certain expenses to ensure we are well positioned to rebound when the economy recovers. 
As I mentioned at the start of my remarks, looking out over the medium term, we continue to expect double-digit CV and revenue growth, modest margin expansion and strong free cash flow generation. Because we can fund growth investments, we have ample capital to return to shareholders through our buyback programs and to deploy to strategic tuck-in acquisitions when we find the right opportunities.

The way we sort of think about it is, yes, you're right, we did maintain a team in conferences to be able to return to producing our fantastic in-person events, or conferences rather, as soon as we can, and that is baked into our base level guidance. 
Obviously, if we pivot to in-person, we generate a lot more revenue. The way we thought about it in our modeling is it will flow through at historical incremental margin rates roughly for conferences. And so if you look back to how our incremental margins flow through historically, that's what we're expecting as we make this pivot. 
Now the other thing I would mention is as we do return to in-person, and I mentioned this in my prepared remarks as well, we don't expect to full return to the size and scale that we exited 2019 at. It's going to take a little bit of time to grow back. And that obviously impacts the flow-through economics as well."

I think one thing to keep in mind is we did a really great job of very quickly pivoting and a great job of monetizing in the back half of this year. 
In the last 3 months of the year, we ran our global symposium series, which, as you know, are typically and historically our largest, most profitable conferences. And we were actually -- we had significant pent-up demand, if you will, from not being able to run conferences for the first several months of the year. 
I think -- and so again, we'll continue to refine our monetization and our ability to market to and sell incremental tickets to those virtual conferences. So again, we expect we'll get better and better at this as we move on. 
In terms of exhibitors, we did a decent job, I would argue, in the fourth quarter. While the revenue mix has shifted, as I mentioned, to being more attendee-driven, still a full 1/3 of our revenue was generated from exhibitors in the fourth quarter. And so I think similar to the attendee commentary I just gave you, we continue to get better and better at that as well by providing exhibitors the opportunity to meet with or get exposed to our highly qualified audience. And then on top of that, our attendee is, generally one of the things that they really put a lot of value on when they come to a conference, is that exposure to the exhibitors as well. 
So I think both are works in process. We've gotten, as Gene mentioned, better and smarter at how we deliver it after each and every conference, and we'll continue to refine that as we move forward."

So I think that, obviously, our business model is one that should generate significant amounts of free cash flow. And when we were in the 2017 to 2019 time frame, we were investing significantly, both from an operating P&L perspective and also from a CapEx perspective as we were dealing with all the growth. We -- and we had some challenges with our collection pacing and DSOs and things of that nature as well. 
I think in 2020, we got everything back on track. And so we did a fantastic job on collections in 2020, especially in a really tough environment, which was great. And obviously, that flowed through in 2020, and we expect to maintain that level of collection pacing moving forward. 
The other big factor I would say is Capex. And so we had a significant amount of investment, as I mentioned, in capital expenditures primarily behind facilities to support our very significant investment in growth and headcount. Obviously, we muted that in 2020, and our 2021 guidance assumes that we're going to run at roughly the same level of CapEx spending as we had in 2020. And I think moving forward, we can expect that to remain at roughly the levels that we are today, sort of in that percent of revenue range. So it will increase, but we don't see it going back to the roughly $150 million that we spent on it in 2019. 
So I think the combination of those 2 things and really getting the benefit of our upfront negative working capital model is what we're seeing flow through. And so we focused on it. We sort of strayed from it for 1 year or 2. We got real focused on it again, and we saw the benefits of that in 2020. Obviously, 2020 was sort of an extraordinary year with a lot of unique things in it. But you're right, our 2021 guidance for free cash flow margin, if you will, is even a little bit higher than that normalized rate that we saw in 2020.

I think as we progressed through 2020, with an eye towards cost discipline and cost management, we were able to flex on things that we didn't necessarily think were possible previously. And so I think as we look at our cost savings that we generated and cost avoidance that we generated in 2020, portions of that were permanent and we'll be able to yield the benefits of that moving forward. Portions of them were what I would characterize as semi permanent, we'll get smarter around the way we spend in the future based on what we learned in 2020. And some of them will come right back, right? So like the benefit stuff that we saved and our compensation and benefit savings in 2020, we're obviously bringing that back in 2021, and we think it's really important from an associate perspective, to keep everyone motivated and running towards our goals. But there certainly are things that we definitely see permanent and/or semi permanent savings from that we learned in 2020 that will be able to help us manage to that better margin outlook moving forward."

And so we've got a significant amount of sellers in both GTS and GBS ready to go and tackle 2021. 
And so the way to think about the inflection and what we expect from a CV perspective is that, obviously, Q1 is the last, if you will, tough compare from a semi normal environment and the compares do get easier in Q2 and beyond. And so that's why we expect that inflection point from a CV growth perspective to sort of pivot upwards after Q1. 
I think there's a variety of different productivity scenarios you can run. If we're able to get back to 2019 levels of productivity, obviously, that would drive a really nice rebound and very significant contract value growth in 2021. But you can also get there getting somewhere in between where we finished 2020 and where we finished 2019. 
And so as we think about it, we believe that there's no reason why in the future, not necessarily in 2021, in the future, we can't get back to the productivity levels we were at pre pandemic. It's going to take potentially a little bit of time to get there. But even if we glide up to that level, we can see a pretty nice rebound in the contract value growth for GTS over the course of both 2021 and into 2022."

One thing is for sure, which is we are operationally much better. As we went through the last recession, we sat down and figured out kind of the things that worked the best and we made sure we ran those plays very early in this recession. 
Obviously, one big difference was that we literally couldn't hold conferences. In the last recession, you got all conferences, people might have been restraining the travel expenses, you had less people going, but not -- but we can actually hold them. That's very different than this year. And so I think one big difference in terms of how it recovers, as Craig mentioned earlier, we're looking forward to being able to -- we'll continue the virtual conference that we've had, but we also think that there's value in-person conferences and look forward to going to those as we -- as the economy recovers."

The COVID-19 pandemic, global macroeconomic conditions, social unrest and geopolitical changes all posed significant challenges to enterprises around the world. In this context, Gartner delivered a strong performance across contract value, revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow.  
As many of you know, we entered 2020 with a financial plan to align costs with revenues. By executing this plan and taking swift cost actions when the pandemic first began, we quickly stabilized our financial position. We maintained disciplined cost management throughout the year while restoring investments to support future growth. We successfully pivoted our global workforce to operate effectively in a remote environment. We grew our capability in key functions across our business. 
We drove strong operational execution, and we were extremely agile in serving our clients, pivoting our content to address critical, contemporary issues, such as the pandemic, remote work environments, cost optimization and business continuity. We are well positioned to spring back quickly as the macroeconomic environment improves. 
Our performance improved in Q4 compared to earlier in 2020. We delivered strong performances in GBS contract value, Research revenues, EBITDA and free cash flow. Research is our largest and most profitable segment. This is a vast market opportunity across all sectors, sizes and geographies. 
Our Research segment serves executives and their teams across all major enterprise functions in every industry around the world. We are uniquely positioned to support leaders enterprise-wide on hundreds of critically-important topics. Topics with the highest interest during Q4 included data and analytics, cost optimization and talent management. 
Global Technology Sales, or GTS, serves leaders and their teams within IT. For the full year 2020, GTS contract value grew 4%. Our key underlying metrics have improved each quarter since Q2. Fourth quarter 2020 contract value from new logos was up from 1 year ago, while cancels were about the same. Our existing clients continued to increase their spend. However, it was a slower pace than in 2019. This was the biggest factor impacting our growth in the quarter. 
Client engagement continued to be strong, with both content and analyst interactions up 30% versus 2019. We saw strong performances across several regions and industries, including tech, retail and services. Some of the topics with the highest interest included digital transformation, application development, cloud management and the digital workplace. We expect GTS contract value growth to accelerate in 2021 and return to double-digit growth in the future. 
Global Business Sales, or GBS, serves leaders and their teams beyond IT. This includes HR, supply chain, finance, marketing, sales, legal and more. GBS contract value continued to perform well throughout the year, with contract value growth of 7%. 
New business growth was a very strong 26% in the quarter, driven by our GxL product line. The sales, finance and HR practices all ended Q4 with double-digit growth rates. And all practices, with the exception of marketing, contributed to GBS' growth. 
Across our entire research business, we've practiced relentless execution of proven practices, and we're seeing the results of our efforts. Our research business is well positioned to return to sustained double-digit growth over the medium term.  
Turning to Conferences. As many of you know, our Conferences segment had great momentum coming out of 2019, but was hard hit in 2020 by the global pandemic. To replace our traditional, in-person destination conferences, which were no longer possible in 2020, we pivoted to virtual conferences. The performance of these conferences exceeded our expectations in 2020. And now, with several months' experience under our belt, we've got a set of best practices that we'll continue to refine. 
Our value proposition for virtual conferences remains the same as for in-person conferences. We deliver extraordinarily valuable insights to an engaged and qualified audience. Beyond virtual conferences, operationally, we're preparing to return to in-person conferences in the second half of 2021. 
Gartner Consulting is an extension of Gartner Research and helps clients execute their most strategic initiatives through deeper, extended project-based works. Our Consulting segment was also impacted by the pandemic, with revenues down 12% in Q4 and 5% for the full year 2020. Over the past several years, we've made great progress in our Consulting business and it will continue to serve as an important complement to our IT Research business.
Company-wide, we continue to strengthen our stance against racism and discrimination. We appointed a new leader of diversity, equity and inclusion. We established a center of excellence dedicated to improvement in this area. And we strengthened our employee resource groups, which helped remove barriers for diverse populations and support associate engagements. 
Sustainability is an important factor in how we manage our business. For example, we've signed contracts for our Stamford headquarters in our U.K. hub to be powered by 100% renewable energy. We'll be eliminating single-use plastics across our offices. And finally, we're benchmarking our environmental footprint and development programs to minimize it over time. 
Summarizing, we performed well in the context of a pandemic. Looking ahead, we are well positioned for sustained growth. We expect to return to revenue growth in 2021 and are on track to return to double-digit CV and revenue growth thereafter. 
We expect to deliver 2021 EBITDA margins, up 2019, and to further expand margins over time. We generate significant free cash flow in excess of net income, which we'll deploy to return capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and make strategic tuck-in acquisitions. 
With that, I'll hand the call over to Craig. Craig?"

Fourth quarter results were ahead of our expectations, headlined by a strong performance in GBS, better-than-planned cost management and outstanding free cash flow generation. As our 2021 guidance highlights, we expect total revenue to increase versus 2020 while also positioning Gartner for a return to strong growth. 
Looking out over the medium term, we continue to expect double-digit CV in revenue growth, modest margin expansion and strong free cash flow generation. Because we can fund growth investments, we have ample capital to return to shareholders and to deploy to strategic tuck-in acquisitions when we find the right opportunities. Our Board authorized an additional $300 million for repurchases, bringing the total available to around $860 million.  
Reviewing our year-over-year financial performance for the full year 2020, total contract value increased 4%; total FX-neutral revenue was down 3%; FX-neutral adjusted EBITDA increased 20%; diluted adjusted EPS was a strong $4.89; and free cash flow was $819 million, up almost 100% from 2019. We did see some timing benefits, which I will discuss a bit later.
Fourth quarter revenue was $1.1 billion, down 8% as reported and 9% FX-neutral. Excluding conferences, our revenues were up 2% year-over-year FX-neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 68%, up more than 580 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA was $245 million, up 13% year-over-year and up 10% FX-neutral. Adjusted EPS was $1.59. And free cash flow in the quarter was a robust $237 million.  
Research revenue in the fourth quarter grew 5% year-over-year as reported and 4% on an FX-neutral basis. Fourth quarter Research contribution margin was 72%, benefiting in part from the temporary cost avoidance initiatives we put in place starting in the first quarter of 2020.  
Total contract value grew 4% FX-neutral to $3.6 billion at December 31. This was the highest contract value in Gartner history, a notable achievement in a challenging year.  
For the full year 2020, Research revenues increased by 7%, both on a reported and FX-neutral basis. The gross contribution margin was 72%, up about 240 basis points from the prior year.  
Global Technology Sales contract value at the end of the fourth quarter was $2.9 billion, up almost 4% versus the prior year. The selling environment continued to improve in the fourth quarter, but we are still seeing less upsell with existing clients than normal. Our clients are staying with us, but not adding as much incremental CV as we've historically seen given the challenging economic environment. 
Moving forward, we expect win backs and a return to more expansion with existing clients to contribute to growth in 2021, consistent with our experience coming out of the last downturn. By industry, CV growth was led by technology, retail and services. 
While retention for GTS was 98% for the quarter, down about 600 basis points year-over-year, a majority of our industry groups saw retention improve from the third quarter. GTS new business declined 5% versus last year, an improvement from both the second and third quarters. Our regular full set of metrics can be found in our earnings supplement.  
Global Business Sales contract value was $696 million at the end of the fourth quarter. That's about 20% of our total contract value.  
CV increased 7% year-over-year. CV growth was led by the health care and technology industries. The sales, finance and human resources practices all recorded double-digit CV growth for the year. All practices contributed to the 7% CV growth rate for GBS with the exception of marketing, which was impacted by discontinued products. That said, our marketing business saw improving retention rates and a return to year-over-year new business growth in the fourth quarter. 
Wallet retention for GBS was 101% for the quarter, down 43 basis points year-over-year. GBS new business was up 26% over last year, led by very strong growth in HR, finance and legal. As with GTS, our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in our earnings supplement. Overall, GBS continued to demonstrate its resilience and strength as we exited 2020. 
The Conferences segment was materially impacted by the global pandemic, as you know. During the year, we pivoted to producing virtual conferences with a focus on maximizing the value we deliver for our clients. We held 13 virtual conferences in the fourth quarter. We also held a number of virtual Evanta meetings, shifting these 1-day local conferences online due to the pandemic. Conferences revenue for the quarter was $93 million. Contribution margin in the quarter was 78%.  
Our fast transition to virtual conferences has been positive for the overall business. As we discussed last quarter, virtual conferences offer significant value to our research clients and prospects. And while we've shown that we can run virtual conferences profitably, it is important to recognize the different economics associated with virtual versus in-person conferences. 
Similar to last quarter, I'd highlight 2 primary differences. First, our mix of revenue from attendees and exhibitors has essentially flipped. With the in-person format, approximately 2/3 of revenue comes from exhibitors and 1/3 from attendees. In the virtual format, we've seen about 2/3 of revenue come from attendees. Second, the vast majority of our attendee revenue has continued to come from research contract entitlements as opposed to incremental tickets. 
I'd also highlight that our fourth quarter destination conferences have historically been our largest, most profitable conferences. In 2020, we held our biggest, most highly-anticipated conferences of the year in the fourth quarter in a virtual format. 
For the full year 2020, revenue decreased by 75%, both on a reported and FX-neutral basis. Gross contribution margin was 48%, down about 290 basis points from 2019 as we maintained some of our cost of service as well as SG&A despite the lower revenue. We did this to ensure we were in a position to execute our new virtual conferences and to resume in-person conferences when it is safe and permitted. Lastly, the timing of receiving conference cancellation insurance claims remains uncertain, so we will not record any recoveries in excess of expenses incurred until the receipt of the insurance proceeds. 
Fourth quarter Consulting revenues decreased by 10% year-over-year to $94 million. On an FX-neutral basis, revenues declined 12%. Consulting contribution margin was 26% in the fourth quarter, down about 160 basis points versus the prior year quarter due to lower contract optimization revenue, which usually flows through at high margins. 
Labor-based revenues were $73 million, down 10% versus Q4 of last year or 12% on an FX-neutral basis. Labor-based billable headcount of 730 was down 10%. Utilization was 63%, up about 300 basis points year-over-year. Backlog at December 31 was $100 million, down 14% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis. Our backlog provides us with about 4 months of forward revenue coverage. 
Our contract optimization business was down 9% on a reported basis versus the prior year quarter. As we have detailed in the past, this part of the Consulting segment is highly variable. 
Full year Consulting revenue was down 4% on a reported basis and 5% on an FX-neutral basis. And its gross contribution margin of 31% was up 68 basis points from 2019. 
SG&A decreased 6% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. SG&A as a percentage of revenue was up year-over-year as we restored certain compensation and benefit costs and had significantly less revenue from conferences. For the full year, SG&A decreased 3% on a reported and FX-neutral basis. 
EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $245 million, up 13% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 10% FX neutral. As we have seen improvements in the macro environment, we have resumed growth spending and started to restore some of the compensation and benefit programs which we had put on hold when the pandemic first hit. 
Fourth quarter EBITDA benefited from several factors. First, we've continued to maintain very strong cost discipline across the company. Second, we had better-than-planned revenue performance in research and conferences, which flowed through with very strong incremental margins. 
Third, we had planned for an increase in certain costs such as travel, which didn't materialize due to pandemic-related shutdowns. And finally, we have been conservative in our implied fourth quarter guidance given the geopolitical uncertainty, due in part to the U.S. election, rising COVID counts and a still recovering global economy.
Depreciation in the quarter was up approximately $4.5 million from last year, including expense acceleration from facilities-related charges. Amortization was down about $800,000 sequentially. Net interest expense, excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter, was $26 million, flat versus the fourth quarter of 2019. 
The Q4 adjusted tax rate, which we used for the calculation of adjusted net income, was 25% for the quarter. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 28.4% in the quarter. The adjusted tax rate for the full year was 21%. 
Adjusted EPS in Q4 was $1.59. For the full year, adjusted EPS was $4.89. EPS growth for the year was 25%. Note that about $7 million of equity compensation expense, which we normally would have incurred in the fourth quarter, has shifted into the first quarter of 2021. That was a benefit to fourth quarter adjusted EPS of about $0.07. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $260 million compared to $83 million last year. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily driven by cost avoidance initiatives, improved collections and timing of tax payments.  
CapEx for the quarter was $23 million, down 57% year-over-year. Lower CapEx is largely a function of lower real estate expansion needs due to the pandemic. We define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. 
Free cash flow for the quarter was $237 million, which is up about 700% versus the prior year. Free cash flow as a percent of revenue or free cash flow margin was 20% on a rolling 4-quarter basis, continuing the improvement we've been making over the past few years. 
Free cash flow was well in excess of GAAP and adjusted net income. Adjusted for timing and onetime benefits, 2020 normalized free cash flow margin is around 13%. We had a fantastic year for free cash flow driven by the resiliency of the business, continued strong collections, disciplined cost and cash management and lower cash taxes and deferrals of certain tax payments.  
We took a number of actions in 2020 to further strengthen our balance sheet. We had 2 successful bond offerings and amended and extended our credit facility. We reduced our maturity risk, and our annual interest expense will be lower starting in 2021. Our December 31 debt balance was $2 billion. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had about $1 billion of revolver capacity. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA is about 2.5x.  
At the end of the fourth quarter, we had $713 million of cash. We resumed our share repurchases after pausing earlier in the year, buying back $100 million in stock at an average price of $156 per share. The Board recently increased our share repurchase authorization by $300 million because we have significant capacity for buybacks from cash on hand and expected free cash flow. 
As of February 8, we have around $860 million available for open market repurchases. We expect the Board will refresh the repurchase authorization as needed going forward. We will deploy excess cash for share repurchases and strategic tuck-in acquisitions. 
Before providing the 2021 guidance details, I want to discuss our base level assumptions and planning philosophy for 2021. For Research, most of our 2021 revenue is determined by our year-end 2020 contract value. As we move through the year, we will revisit the Research revenue outlook.  
For Conferences, our guidance is based on being 100% virtual for the full year. Operationally, we are planning to relaunch in-person 1-day events in the third quarter and in-person destination conferences starting in September. Our guidance includes fixed costs, primarily people and marketing related to both a full year of virtual and in-person conferences. We've excluded the variable costs, primarily venue-related, associated with the in-person conferences from our guidance. 
We've been able to run profitable virtual conferences in 2020, and that is reflected in our 2021 guidance. If we are able to run in-person conferences, we expect incremental upside to both our revenue and profitability for 2021. 
The economics in 2021, even in a partial in-person year, won't be fully back to normal. As we get closer to the go, no-go decision point, we'll provide additional insight to sizing the incremental revenue and profits. 
For Consulting revenues, the compares get easier as we move through the year. We have more visibility into the first half based on the composition of our backlog and pipeline as usual. 
For expenses, we have planned for the full reinstatement of benefits that were either canceled or deferred in 2020. This includes our annual merit increase and certain other benefits. We are also returning to growing our sales forces, with planned quota-bearing headcount growth in the high single digits for both GTS and GBS. 
We have also planned for several additional programs, including technology investments. The impact of most of these expense restorations or investments impact our P&L starting in the second quarter. 
As you know, travel expense was close to 0 from April through December. Our current plans assume a modest ramp-up in travel-related expenses over the course of 2021. Most of this ramp is built into the second half of the year. If travel restrictions remain in place for longer than we've assumed, we'd see expense savings. 
Our guidance for 2021 is as follows: We expect research revenue of at least $3.815 billion, which is growth of at least 5.9%. We expect conferences revenue of at least $160 million, which is growth of at least 33%. We expect consulting revenue of at least $390 million, which is growth of at least 3.6%. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $4.365 billion, which is growth of 6.5%. Based on current foreign exchange rates and business mix, the consolidated growth includes an FX benefit of about 200 basis points.  
We expect full year adjusted EBITDA of at least $760 million, which is a decline of about 7%, and reported margins of at least 17.4%. This is based on conferences running virtual only. We expect our full year 2021 adjusted net interest expense to be $102 million. We expect an adjusted tax rate of around 22% for 2021. We expect 2021 adjusted EPS of at least $4.10. For 2021, we expect free cash flow of at least $630 million. This is before any insurance proceeds related to 2020 conference cancellations. 
It is also important to note that we have revalued our contract value at current year FX rates, which had a modest overall impact. Our 2020 ending contract value at 2021 FX rates is $2.9 billion for GTS and $706 million for GBS. 
Details are included in the appendix of the earnings supplement. All the details of our full year guidance are included on our Investor Relations site. Finally, we expect to deliver at least $200 million of EBITDA in Q1 of 2021. 
In summary, despite an unfavorable economic environment, we delivered better-than-planned financial results in 2020. We had outstanding free cash flow and strong EBITDA. We strengthened our balance sheet and moved quickly to implement cost avoidance initiatives while still investing for future growth. 
While there is still uncertainty in the macro outlook, our contract value held up better than in the last downturn. We were able to launch and monetize virtual conferences and virtual Evanta meetings. We will continue with targeted investments and restoration of certain expenses to ensure we are well positioned to rebound when the economy recovers. 
As I mentioned at the start of my remarks, looking out over the medium term, we continue to expect double-digit CV and revenue growth, modest margin expansion and strong free cash flow generation. Because we can fund growth investments, we have ample capital to return to shareholders through our buyback programs and to deploy to strategic tuck-in acquisitions when we find the right opportunities.

It may vary depending on regions that open up earlier than others or certain restrictions that are in place. And so there's no easy yes or no answer here. 
The way we sort of think about it is, yes, you're right, we did maintain a team in Conferences to be able to return to producing our fantastic in-person events, or conferences rather, as soon as we can, and that is baked into our base level guidance. 
Obviously, if we pivot to in-person, we generate a lot more revenue. The way we've thought about it in our modeling it is, it will flow through at historical incremental margin rates roughly for conferences. And so if you look back to how our incremental margins flow through historically, that's what we're expecting as we make this pivot.  
Now the other thing I would mention is as we do return to in-person, and I mentioned this in my prepared remarks as well, we don't expect to fully return to the size and scale that we exited 2019 at. It's going to take a little bit of time to grow back. And that obviously impacts the flow-through economics as well."

I think one thing to keep in mind is we did a really great job of very quickly pivoting and a great job of monetizing in the back half of this year.  
In the last 3 months of the year, we ran our global symposium series, which, as you know, are typically and historically our largest, most profitable conferences. And we were actually -- we had significant pent-up demand, if you will, from not being able to run conferences for the first several months of the year.  
I think -- and so again, we'll continue to refine our monetization and our ability to market to and sell incremental tickets to those virtual conferences. So again, we expect we'll get better and better at this as we move on.  
In terms of exhibitors, we did a decent job, I would argue, in the fourth quarter. While the revenue mix has shifted, as I mentioned, to being more attendee-driven, still a full 1/3 of our revenue was generated from exhibitors in the fourth quarter. And so I think similar to the attendee commentary I just gave you, we continue to get better and better at that as well by providing exhibitors the opportunity to meet with or get exposed to our highly qualified audience. And then on top of that, our attendees, generally one of the things that they really put a lot of value on when they come to a conference is that exposure to the exhibitors as well. 
So I think both are works in process. We've gotten, as Gene mentioned, better and smarter at how we deliver it after each and every conference, and we'll continue to refine that as we move forward."

So I think that, obviously, our business model is one that should generate significant amounts of free cash flow. And when we were in the 2017 to 2019 time frame, we were investing significantly, both from an operating P&L perspective and also from a CapEx perspective as we were dealing with all the growth. We -- and we had some challenges with our collection pacing and DSOs and things of that nature as well. 
I think in 2020, we got everything back on track. And so we did a fantastic job on collections in 2020, especially in a really tough environment, which was great. And obviously, that flowed through in 2020, and we expect to maintain that level of collection pacing moving forward. 
The other big factor I would say is CapEx. And so we had a significant amount of investment, as I mentioned, in capital expenditures, primarily behind facilities to support our very significant investment in growth and headcount. Obviously, we muted that in 2020, and our 2021 guidance assumes that we're going to run at roughly the same level of CapEx spending as we had in 2020. And I think moving forward, we can expect that to remain at roughly the levels that we are today, sort of in that percent of revenue range. So it will increase, but we don't see it going back to the roughly $150 million that we spent on it in 2019. 
So I think the combination of those 2 things and really getting the benefit of our upfront negative working capital model is what we're seeing flow through. And so we focused on it. We sort of strayed from it for 1 year or 2. We got real focused on it again, and we saw the benefits of that in 2020. Obviously, 2020 was sort of an extraordinary year with a lot of unique things in it. But you're right, our 2021 guidance for free cash flow margin, if you will, is even a little bit higher than that normalized rate that we saw in 2020.

I think as we progressed through 2020, with an eye towards cost discipline and cost management, we were able to flex on things that we didn't necessarily think were possible previously. And so I think as we look at our cost savings that we generated and cost avoidance that we generated in 2020, portions of that were permanent and we'll be able to yield the benefits of that moving forward. Portions of them were what I would characterize as semipermanent, we'll get smarter around the way we spend in the future based on what we learned in 2020. And some of them will come right back, right? 
So like the benefit stuff that we saved and our compensation and benefit savings in 2020, we're obviously bringing that back in 2021, and we think it's really important from an associate perspective, to keep everyone motivated and running towards our goals.

And so the way to think about the inflection and what we expect from a CV perspective is that, obviously, Q1 is the last, if you will, tough compare from a semi-normal environment and the compares do get easier in Q2 and beyond. And so that's why we expect that inflection point from a CV growth perspective to sort of pivot upwards after Q1.
I think there's a variety of different productivity scenarios you can run. If we're able to get back to 2019 levels of productivity, obviously, that would drive a really nice rebound and very significant contract value growth in 2021. But you can also get there, getting somewhere in between where we finished 2020 and where we finished 2019. 
And so as we think about it, we believe that there's no reason why in the future, not necessarily in 2021, in the future, we can't get back to the productivity levels we were at pre pandemic. It's going to take potentially a little bit of time to get there.

In terms of win backs, for the ones that did downgrade and so there -- and there are obviously some of those. Actually, we are going to see win backs. And in fact, in Q4, particularly in December, we saw some win backs from some of the business we lost earlier in the year. And as we go through '21, we'd expect that to continue."

They actually were able to pivot a little sooner to virtual, just given the size of the communities and the size of the events or the meetings that they run. And so again, we're very, very pleased with what we've been able to do from a monetization perspective on both the Evanta 1-day meetings and the destination meetings.  
We do believe as we look at our 2021 calendar that we will be able to return to in-person Evanta meetings perhaps a little bit sooner, really dependent on the geography and what is allowed or permitted in those geographies. But we do think, given the size of them, that we'll be able to return to them a little bit earlier. 
But in any event, we've focused or we've pivoted to really driving virtual value in absence of in-person value.

Obviously, one big difference was that we literally couldn't hold conferences. In the last recession, you could hold conferences. People might have been restraining their travel expenses, you had less people going, but not -- but we could actually hold them. That's very different than this year.

The COVID-19 pandemic, global macroeconomic conditions, social unrest and geopolitical changes all posed significant challenges to enterprises around the world. In this context, Gart",919,"Good morning, and thanks for joining us. 2020 was an extraordinary year. The COVID-19 pandemic, global macroeconomic conditions, social unrest and geopolitical changes all posed significant challenges to enterprises around the world. In this context, Gartner delivered a strong performance across contract value, revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow.  
As many of you know, we entered 2020 with a financial plan to align costs with revenues. By executing this plan and taking swift cost actions when the pandemic first began, we quickly stabilized our financial position. We maintained disciplined cost management throughout the year while restoring investments to support future growth. We successfully pivoted our global workforce to operate effectively in a remote environment. We grew our capability in key functions across our business. 
We drove strong operational execution, and we were extremely agile in serving our clients, pivoting our content to address critical, contemporary issues, such as the pandemic, remote work environments, cost optimization and business continuity. We are well positioned to spring back quickly as the macroeconomic environment improves. 
Our performance improved in Q4 compared to earlier in 2020. We delivered strong performances in GBS contract value, Research revenues, EBITDA and free cash flow. Research is our largest and most profitable segment. This is a vast market opportunity across all sectors, sizes and geographies. 
Our Research segment serves executives and their teams across all major enterprise functions in every industry around the world. We are uniquely positioned to support leaders enterprise-wide on hundreds of critically important topics. Topics with the highest interest during Q4 included data and analytics, cost optimization and talent management. 
Global Technology Sales, or GTS, serves leaders and their teams within IT. For the full year 2020, GTS contract value grew 4%. Our key underlying metrics have improved each quarter since Q2. Fourth quarter 2020 contract value from new logos was up from 1 year ago, while cancels were about the same. Our existing clients continued to increase their spend. However, it was a slower pace than in 2019. This was the biggest factor impacting our growth in the quarter. 
Client engagement continued to be strong, with both content and analyst interactions up 30% versus 2019. We saw strong performances across several regions and industries, including tech, retail and services. Some of the topics with the highest interest included digital transformation, application development, cloud management and the digital workplace. We expect GTS contract value growth to accelerate in 2021 and return to double-digit growth in the future. 
Global Business Sales, or GBS, serves leaders and their teams beyond IT. This includes HR, supply chain, finance, marketing, sales, legal and more. GBS contract value continued to perform well throughout the year, with contract value growth of 7%. 
New business growth was a very strong 26% in the quarter, driven by our GxL product line. The sales, finance and HR practices all ended Q4 with double-digit growth rates. And all practices, with the exception of marketing, contributed to GBS' growth. 
Across our entire research business, we've practiced relentless execution of proven practices, and we're seeing the results of our efforts. Our research business is well positioned to return to sustained double-digit growth over the medium term.  
Turning to Conferences. As many of you know, our Conferences segment had great momentum coming out of 2019, but was hard hit in 2020 by the global pandemic. To replace our traditional, in-person destination conferences, which were no longer possible in 2020, we pivoted to virtual conferences. The performance of these conferences exceeded our expectations in 2020. And now, with several months' experience under our belt, we've got a set of best practices that we'll continue to refine. 
Our value proposition for virtual conferences remains the same as for in-person conferences. We deliver extraordinarily valuable insights to an engaged and qualified audience. Beyond virtual conferences, operationally, we're preparing to return to in-person conferences in the second half of 2021. 
Gartner Consulting is an extension of Gartner Research and helps clients execute their most strategic initiatives through deeper, extended project-based works. Our Consulting segment was also impacted by the pandemic, with revenues down 12% in Q4 and 5% for the full year 2020. Over the past several years, we've made great progress in our Consulting business and it will continue to serve as an important complement to our IT Research business.
Company-wide, we continue to strengthen our stance against racism and discrimination. We appointed a new leader of diversity, equity and inclusion. We established a center of excellence dedicated to improvement in this area. And we strengthened our employee resource groups, which helped remove barriers for diverse populations and support associate engagements. 
Sustainability is an important factor in how we manage our business. For example, we've signed contracts for our Stamford headquarters in our U.K. hub to be powered by 100% renewable energy. We'll be eliminating single-use plastics across our offices. And finally, we're benchmarking our environmental footprints and development programs to minimize it over time. 
Summarizing, we performed well in the context of a pandemic. Looking ahead, we are well positioned for sustained growth. We expect to return to revenue growth in 2021 and are on track to return to double-digit CV and revenue growth thereafter. 
We expect to deliver 2021 EBITDA margins, up 2019, and to further expand margins over time. We generate significant free cash flow in excess of net income, which we'll deploy to return capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and make strategic tuck-in acquisitions. 
With that, I'll hand the call over to Craig. Craig?"

As our 2021 guidance highlights, we expect total revenue to increase versus 2020 while also positioning Gartner for a return to strong growth. 
Looking out over the medium term, we continue to expect double-digit CV in revenue growth, modest margin expansion and strong free cash flow generation. Because we can fund growth investments, we have ample capital to return to shareholders and to deploy to strategic tuck-in acquisitions when we find the right opportunities. Our Board authorized an additional $300 million for repurchases, bringing the total available to around $860 million.  
Reviewing our year-over-year financial performance for the full year 2020, total contract value increased 4%; total FX-neutral revenue was down 3%; FX-neutral adjusted EBITDA increased 20%; diluted adjusted EPS was a strong $4.89; and free cash flow was $819 million, up almost 100% from 2019. We did see some timing benefits, which I will discuss a bit later.
Fourth quarter revenue was $1.1 billion, down 8% as reported and 9% FX-neutral. Excluding conferences, our revenues were up 2% year-over-year FX-neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 68%, up more than 580 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA was $245 million, up 13% year-over-year and up 10% FX-neutral. Adjusted EPS was $1.59. And free cash flow in the quarter was a robust $237 million.  
Research revenue in the fourth quarter grew 5% year-over-year as reported and 4% on an FX-neutral basis. Fourth quarter Research contribution margin was 72%, benefiting in part from the temporary cost avoidance initiatives we put in place starting in the first quarter of 2020.  
Total contract value grew 4% FX-neutral to $3.6 billion at December 31. This was the highest contract value in Gartner history, a notable achievement in a challenging year.  
For the full year 2020, Research revenues increased by 7%, both on a reported and FX-neutral basis. The gross contribution margin was 72%, up about 240 basis points from the prior year.  
Global Technology Sales contract value at the end of the fourth quarter was $2.9 billion, up almost 4% versus the prior year. The selling environment continued to improve in the fourth quarter, but we are still seeing less upsell with existing clients than normal. Our clients are staying with us, but not adding as much incremental CV as we've historically seen given the challenging economic environment. 
Moving forward, we expect win backs and a return to more expansion with existing clients to contribute to growth in 2021, consistent with our experience coming out of the last downturn. By industry, CV growth was led by technology, retail and services. 
While retention for GTS was 98% for the quarter, down about 600 basis points year-over-year, a majority of our industry groups saw retention improve from the third quarter. GTS new business declined 5% versus last year, an improvement from both the second and third quarters. Our regular full set of metrics can be found in our earnings supplement.  
Global Business Sales contract value was $696 million at the end of the fourth quarter. That's about 20% of our total contract value.  
CV increased 7% year-over-year. CV growth was led by the health care and technology industries. The sales, finance and human resources practices all recorded double-digit CV growth for the year. All practices contributed to the 7% CV growth rate for GBS with the exception of marketing, which was impacted by discontinued products. That said, our marketing business saw improving retention rates and a return to year-over-year new business growth in the fourth quarter. 
Wallet retention for GBS was 101% for the quarter, down 43 basis points year-over-year. GBS new business was up 26% over last year, led by very strong growth in HR, finance and legal. As with GTS, our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in our earnings supplement. Overall, GBS continued to demonstrate its resilience and strength as we exited 2020. 
The Conferences segment was materially impacted by the global pandemic, as you know. During the year, we pivoted to producing virtual conferences with a focus on maximizing the value we deliver for our clients. We held 13 virtual conferences in the fourth quarter. We also held a number of virtual Evanta meetings, shifting these 1-day global conferences online due to the pandemic. Conferences revenue for the quarter was $93 million. Contribution margin in the quarter was 78%.  
Our fast transition to virtual conferences has been positive for the overall business. As we discussed last quarter, virtual conferences offer significant value to our research clients and prospects. And while we've shown that we can run virtual conferences profitably, it is important to recognize the different economics associated with virtual versus in-person conferences. 
Similar to last quarter, I'd highlight 2 primary differences. First, our mix of revenue from attendees and exhibitors has essentially flipped. With the in-person format, approximately 2/3 of revenue comes from exhibitors and 1/3 from attendees. In the virtual format, we've seen about 2/3 of revenue come from attendees. Second, the vast majority of our attendee revenue has continued to come from research contract entitlements as opposed to incremental tickets. 
I'd also highlight that our fourth quarter destination conferences have historically been our largest, most profitable conferences. In 2020, we held our biggest, most highly anticipated conferences of the year in the fourth quarter in a virtual format. 
For the full year 2020, revenue decreased by 75%, both on a reported and FX-neutral basis. Gross contribution margin was 48%, down about 290 basis points from 2019 as we maintained some of our costs of service as well as SG&A despite the lower revenue. We did this to ensure we were in a position to execute our new virtual conferences and to resume in-person conferences when it is safe and permitted. Lastly, the timing of receiving conference cancellation insurance claims remains uncertain, so we will not record any recoveries in excess of expenses incurred until the receipt of the insurance proceeds. 
Fourth quarter Consulting revenues decreased by 10% year-over-year to $94 million. On an FX-neutral basis, revenues declined 12%. Consulting contribution margin was 26% in the fourth quarter, down about 160 basis points versus the prior year quarter due to lower contract optimization revenue, which usually flows through at high margins. 
Labor-based revenues were $73 million, down 10% versus Q4 of last year or 12% on an FX-neutral basis. Labor-based billable headcount of 730 was down 10%. Utilization was 63%, up about 300 basis points year-over-year. Backlog at December 31 was $100 million, down 14% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis. Our backlog provides us with about 4 months of forward revenue coverage. 
Our contract optimization business was down 9% on a reported basis versus the prior year quarter. As we have detailed in the past, this part of the Consulting segment is highly variable. 
Full year Consulting revenue was down 4% on a reported basis and 5% on an FX-neutral basis. And its gross contribution margin of 31% was up 68 basis points from 2019. 
SG&A decreased 6% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. SG&A as a percentage of revenue was up year-over-year as we restored certain compensation and benefit costs and had significantly less revenue from conferences. For the full year, SG&A decreased 3% on a reported and FX-neutral basis. 
EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $245 million, up 13% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 10% FX neutral. As we have seen improvements in the macro environment, we have resumed growth spending and started to restore some of the compensation and benefit programs which we had put on hold when the pandemic first hit. 
Fourth quarter EBITDA benefited from several factors. First, we've continued to maintain very strong cost discipline across the company. Second, we had better-than-planned revenue performance in research and conferences, which flowed through with very strong incremental margins. 
Third, we had planned for an increase in certain costs such as travel, which didn't materialize due to pandemic-related shutdowns. And finally, we had been conservative in our implied fourth quarter guidance given the geopolitical uncertainty, due in part to the U.S. election, rising COVID counts and a still-recovering global economy.
Depreciation in the quarter was up approximately $4.5 million from last year, including expense acceleration from facilities-related charges. Amortization was down about $800,000 sequentially. Net interest expense, excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter, was $26 million, flat versus the fourth quarter of 2019. 
The Q4 adjusted tax rate, which we used for the calculation of adjusted net income, was 25% for the quarter. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 28.4% in the quarter. The adjusted tax rate for the full year was 21%. 
Adjusted EPS in Q4 was $1.59. For the full year, adjusted EPS was $4.89. EPS growth for the year was 25%. Note that about $7 million of equity compensation expense, which we normally would have incurred in the fourth quarter, has shifted into the first quarter of 2021. That was a benefit to fourth quarter adjusted EPS of about $0.07. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $260 million compared to $83 million last year. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily driven by cost avoidance initiatives, improved collections and timing of tax payments.  
CapEx for the quarter was $23 million, down 57% year-over-year. Lower CapEx is largely a function of lower real estate expansion needs due to the pandemic. We define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. 
Free cash flow for the quarter was $237 million, which is up about 700% versus the prior year. Free cash flow as a percent of revenue or free cash flow margin was 20% on a rolling 4-quarter basis, continuing the improvement we've been making over the past few years. 
Free cash flow was well in excess of GAAP and adjusted net income. Adjusted for timing and onetime benefits, 2020 normalized free cash flow margin is around 13%. We had a fantastic year for free cash flow driven by the resiliency of the business, continued strong collections, disciplined cost and cash management and lower cash taxes and deferrals of certain tax payments.  
We took a number of actions in 2020 to further strengthen our balance sheet. We had 2 successful bond offerings and amended and extended our credit facility. We reduced our maturity risk, and our annual interest expense will be lower starting in 2021. Our December 31 debt balance was $2 billion. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had about $1 billion of revolver capacity. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA is about 2.5x.  
At the end of the fourth quarter, we had $713 million of cash. We resumed our share repurchases after pausing earlier in the year, buying back $100 million in stock at an average price of $156 per share. The Board recently increased our share repurchase authorization by $300 million because we have significant capacity for buybacks from cash on hand and expected free cash flow. 
As of February 8, we have around $860 million available for open market repurchases. We expect the Board will refresh the repurchase authorization as needed going forward. We will deploy excess cash for share repurchases and strategic tuck-in acquisitions. 
Before providing the 2021 guidance details, I want to discuss our base level assumptions and planning philosophy for 2021. For Research, most of our 2021 revenue is determined by our year-end 2020 contract value. As we move through the year, we will revisit the Research revenue outlook.  
For Conferences, our guidance is based on being 100% virtual for the full year. Operationally, we are planning to relaunch in-person 1-day events in the third quarter and in-person destination conferences starting in September. Our guidance includes fixed costs, primarily people and marketing related to both a full year of virtual and in-person conferences. We've excluded the variable costs, primarily venue-related, associated with the in-person conferences from our guidance. 
We've been able to run profitable virtual conferences in 2020, and that is reflected in our 2021 guidance. If we are able to run in-person conferences, we expect incremental upside to both our revenue and profitability for 2021. 
The economics in 2021, even in a partial in-person year, won't be fully back to normal. As we get closer to the go, no-go decision point, we'll provide additional insight to sizing the incremental revenue and profits. 
For Consulting revenues, the compares get easier as we move through the year. We have more visibility into the first half based on the composition of our backlog and pipeline, as usual. 
For expenses, we have planned for the full reinstatement of benefits that were either canceled or deferred in 2020. This includes our annual merit increase and certain other benefits. We are also returning to growing our sales forces, with planned quota-bearing headcount growth in the high single digits for both GTS and GBS. 
We have also planned for several additional programs, including technology investments. The impact of most of these expense restorations or investments impact our P&L starting in the second quarter. 
As you know, travel expense was close to 0 from April through December. Our current plans assume a modest ramp-up in travel-related expenses over the course of 2021. Most of this ramp is built into the second half of the year. If travel restrictions remain in place for longer than we've assumed, we'd see expense savings. 
Our guidance for 2021 is as follows: We expect research revenue of at least $3.815 billion, which is growth of at least 5.9%. We expect conferences revenue of at least $160 million, which is growth of at least 33%. We expect consulting revenue of at least $390 million, which is growth of at least 3.6%. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $4.365 billion, which is growth of 6.5%. Based on current foreign exchange rates and business mix, the consolidated growth includes an FX benefit of about 200 basis points.  
We expect full year adjusted EBITDA of at least $760 million, which is a decline of about 7%, and reported margins of at least 17.4%. This is based on conferences running virtual only. We expect our full year 2021 adjusted net interest expense to be $102 million. We expect an adjusted tax rate of around 22% for 2021. We expect 2021 adjusted EPS of at least $4.10. For 2021, we expect free cash flow of at least $630 million. This is before any insurance proceeds related to 2020 conference cancellations. 
It is also important to note that we have revalued our contract value at current year FX rates, which had a modest overall impact. Our 2020 ending contract value at 2021 FX rates is $2.9 billion for GTS and $706 million for GBS. 
Details are included in the appendix of the earnings supplement. All the details of our full year guidance are included on our Investor Relations site. Finally, we expect to deliver at least $200 million of EBITDA in Q1 of 2021. 
In summary, despite an unfavorable economic environment, we delivered better-than-planned financial results in 2020. We had outstanding free cash flow and strong EBITDA. We strengthened our balance sheet and moved quickly to implement cost avoidance initiatives while still investing for future growth. 
While there is still uncertainty in the macro outlook, our contract value held up better than in the last downturn. We were able to launch and monetize virtual conferences and virtual Evanta meetings. We will continue with targeted investments and restoration of certain expenses to ensure we are well positioned to rebound when the economy recovers. 
As I mentioned at the start of my remarks, looking out over the medium term, we continue to expect double-digit CV and revenue growth, modest margin expansion and strong free cash flow generation. Because we can fund growth investments, we have ample capital to return to shareholders through our buyback programs and to deploy to strategic tuck-in acquisitions when we find the right opportunities.

It may vary depending on regions that open up earlier than others or certain restrictions that are in place. And so there's no easy yes or no answer here. 
The way we sort of think about it is, yes, you're right, we did maintain a team in Conferences to be able to return to producing our fantastic in-person events, or conferences rather, as soon as we can, and that is baked into our base-level guidance. 
Obviously, if we pivot to in-person, we generate a lot more revenue. The way we've thought about it in our modeling it is, it will flow through at historical incremental margin rates roughly for conferences. And so if you look back to how our incremental margins flowed through historically, that's what we're expecting as we make this pivot.  
Now the other thing I would mention is as we do return to in-person, and I mentioned this in my prepared remarks as well, we don't expect to fully return to the size and scale that we exited 2019 at. It's going to take a little bit of time to grow back. And that obviously impacts the flow-through economics as well."

I think one thing to keep in mind is we did a really great job of very quickly pivoting and a great job of monetizing in the back half of this year.  
In the last 3 months of the year, we ran our global symposium series, which, as you know, are typically and historically our largest, most profitable conferences. And we were actually -- we had significant pent-up demand, if you will, from not being able to run conferences for the first several months of the year.  
I think -- and so again, we'll continue to refine our monetization and our ability to market to and sell incremental tickets to those virtual conferences. So again, we expect we'll get better and better at this as we move on.  
In terms of exhibitors, we did a decent job, I would argue, in the fourth quarter. While the revenue mix has shifted, as I mentioned, to being more attendee-driven, still a full 1/3 of our revenue was generated from exhibitors in the fourth quarter. And so I think similar to the attendee commentary I just gave you, we continue to get better and better at that as well by providing exhibitors the opportunity to meet with or get exposed to our highly qualified audience. And then on top of that, our attendees, generally one of the things that they really put a lot of value on when they come to a conference is that exposure to the exhibitors as well. 
So I think both are works in process. We've gotten, as Gene mentioned, better and smarter at how we deliver it after each and every conference, and we'll continue to refine that as we move forward."

So I think that, obviously, our business model is one that should generate significant amounts of free cash flow. And when we were in the 2017 to 2019 time frame, we were investing significantly, both from an operating P&L perspective and also from a CapEx perspective as we were dealing with all the growth. We -- and we had some challenges with our collection pacing and DSOs and things of that nature as well. 
I think in 2020, we got everything back on track. And so we did a fantastic job on collections in 2020, especially in a really tough environment, which was great. And obviously, that flowed through in 2020, and we expect to maintain that level of collection pacing moving forward. 
The other big factor, I would say, is CapEx. And so we had a significant amount of investment, as I mentioned, in capital expenditures, primarily behind facilities to support our very significant investment in growth and headcount. Obviously, we muted that in 2020, and our 2021 guidance assumes that we're going to run at roughly the same level of CapEx spending as we had in 2020. And I think moving forward, we can expect that to remain at roughly the levels that we are today, sort of in that percent of revenue range. So it will increase, but we don't see it going back to the roughly $150 million that we spent on it in 2019. 
So I think the combination of those 2 things and really getting the benefit of our upfront negative working capital model is what we're seeing flow through. And so we focused on it. We sort of strayed from it for 1 year or 2. We got real focused on it again, and we saw the benefits of that in 2020. Obviously, 2020 was sort of an extraordinary year with a lot of unique things in it. But you're right, our 2021 guidance for free cash flow margin, if you will, is even a little bit higher than that normalized rate that we saw in 2020. So we feel really good about the free cash flow generation capability and forecast and outlook moving forward."

So when we entered 2020, our operating plan was essentially, let's make sure 100% that we have revenue growth and cost growth in line and set ourselves up to then be able to modestly expand margins moving forward. 
I think as we progressed through 2020, with an eye towards cost discipline and cost management, we were able to flex on things that we didn't necessarily think were possible previously. And so I think as we look at our cost savings that we generated and cost avoidance that we generated in 2020, portions of that were permanent and we'll be able to yield the benefits of that moving forward. Portions of them were what I would characterize as semipermanent. We'll get smarter around the way we spend in the future based on what we learned in 2020. And some of them will come right back, right? 
So like the benefit stuff that we saved and our compensation and benefit savings in 2020, we're obviously bringing that back in 2021, and we think it's really important from an associate perspective, to keep everyone motivated and running towards our goals. But there certainly are things that we definitely see permanent and/or semipermanent savings from that we learned in 2020 that will be able to help us manage to that better margin outlook moving forward."

Obviously, in 2020, we didn't do that. We actually pared down a little bit. We were able to work through a pretty large bench that we had built at the end of 2019. And so we feel really good about our sales capacity or selling capacity entering 2021. And so we've got a significant amount of sellers in both GTS and GBS ready to go and tackle 2021. 
And so the way to think about the inflection and what we expect from a CV perspective is that, obviously, Q1 is the last, if you will, tough compare from a semi-normal environment and the compares do get easier in Q2 and beyond. And so that's why we expect that inflection point from a CV growth perspective to sort of pivot upwards after Q1.
I think there's a variety of different productivity scenarios you can run. If we're able to get back to 2019 levels of productivity, obviously, that would drive a really nice rebound and very significant contract value growth in 2021. But you can also get there getting somewhere in between where we finished 2020 and where we finished 2019. 
And so as we think about it, we believe that there's no reason why in the future, not necessarily in 2021, in the future, we can't get back to the productivity levels we were at pre pandemic. It's going to take potentially a little bit of time to get there. But even if we glide up to that level, we can see a pretty nice rebound in the contract value growth for GTS over the course of both 2021 and into 2022."

We continue to have a vast and largely unpenetrated addressable market. The Gartner formula for sustained long-term growth continues to drive success in our research business. And looking ahead, we are well positioned for sustained success. 
We will return to revenue growth in 2021. And beyond 2021, or the medium and long term, we expect to return to sustained double-digit contract value and revenue growth. We expect to deliver EBITDA margins up from 2019, and to further expand margins over time. 
We generate significant free cash flow in excess of net income, which we'll deploy to return capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and to make strategic tuck-in acquisitions. And finally, we expect to come out of this recession strong and well positioned to drive long-term sustained double-digit growth for years to come. 
Thanks again for joining us, and I look forward to updating you again next quarter."

We delivered strong results across contract value, revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. Total revenues were up 6%, with each of our business segments, research, conferences and consulting, exceeding our expectations. Research is our largest and most profitable segment. Our Research segment serves executives and their teams across all major enterprise functions in every industry around the world. Research has a vast market opportunity across all sectors, sizes and geographies. 
Global Technology Sales, or GTS, source leaders and their teams within IT. For Q1, GTS contract value grew 5%. First quarter new business was up 21% as a result of new logos and upsell with existing clients. Client engagement continue to be strong, with content and analyst interaction volumes up to 26% compared to Q [indiscernible] 2020. 
We saw strong performances across several regions and industries, including tech and midsized enterprises. We expect GTS contract value growth to continue to accelerate in 2021 and return to double-digit growth in the future. 
Global Business Sales, or GBS, serves leaders and their teams beyond IT. This includes HR, supply chain, finance, marketing, sales, legal and more. GBS achieved contract value growth of 12%, its first quarter of double-digit growth. New business growth was a very strong 87% in the quarter. All practices, with the exception of marketing, ended Q1 with double-digit contract value growth rates, and all practices delivered positive quarterly in CVI. 
Across our entire research business, we practiced relentless execution of proven practices, and we're seeing the results of our efforts. Our Research business is well positioned to return to sustained double-digit growth over the medium term. 
Turning to Conferences, as many of you know, during 2020, our Conferences business pivoted from in-person destination conferences to virtual. Our value proposition for virtual conferences remains the same as for in-person conferences. We deliver extraordinarily valuable insights to an engaged and qualified audience. 
While Q1 is a small quarter for conferences, the business exceeded our expectations. Beyond virtual conferences, we continue to prepare to return to in-person conferences in the second half of 2021. 
Gartner Consulting is an extension of Gartner Research, and helps clients execute their most strategic initiatives through deeper extended project based work. Our Consulting segment also exceeded our expectations, with bookings up 26% during Q1. Our Consulting business will continue to serve as an important complement to our IT Research business. 
One of our objectives is to generate strong cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was $145 million, up significantly versus the prior year. In addition, we used that cash flow plus cash balances to purchase more than $600 million in stock through April of this year. With these repurchases, our Board increased our share repurchase authorization by another $500 million. 
We recently launched our 2020 Corporate Responsibility Report. The report details the progress we made in accelerating positive social change and contributing to a more sustainable world. We want our associates, communities and clients to continue to thrive today and in the future. The report can be found on gartner.com, and I encourage you to take a look. 
Summarizing, Q1 was a strong quarter with all 3 business segments exceeding our expectations. Looking ahead, we are well positioned for sustained success. We have a vast addressable market which will allow us to achieve double-digit contract value and revenue growth over the next 5 years and beyond. We expect to deliver modest EBITDA margin expansion going forward from a normalized 2021. We generate significant free cash flow in excess of net income, which we'll continue to deploy through share repurchases and strategic tuck-in acquisitions. 
And with that, I'll hand the call over to Craig. Craig?"
130705,711963644,2268030,"Gartner, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 04, 2021",2021-05-04,"Earnings Calls","Gartner, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gene, and good morning. I hope everyone remains safe and well. First quarter results were outstanding with very good momentum across the business. Revenue was well above our expectations.

First quarter results were outstanding with very good momentum across the business. 
Revenue was well above our expectations. Despite the lower-than-planned expenses, we are well positioned to take advantage of the strong demand environment. We will continue to restore spending to support and drive long-term sustained double-digit growth. With stronger-than-expected results in contract value, non subscription research and consulting, we are increasing our revenue growth and normalized margin outlook, which results in a meaningful increase to our 2021 guidance. The improved outlook reflects the increased visibility we have following the stronger-than-expected first quarter. 
First quarter revenue was $1.1 billion, up 8% year-over-year as reported and 6% FX neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 70%, up more than 320 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA was $320 million, up 50% year-over-year and up 44% FX neutral. Adjusted EPS was $2, and free cash flow in the quarter was $145 million. Research revenue in the first quarter grew 8% year-over-year as reported and 6% on an FX-neutral basis, and we saw strong retention and new business throughout the quarter. 
First quarter research contribution margin was 74%, up about 200 basis points versus 2020. Higher contribution margins reflect both improved operational effectiveness and the avoidance of travel expenses. Some of the margin improvement compared to historical levels is temporary and will reverse as the world reopens, and we increase spending to support growth. We are seeing a benefit from increased scale and a mix shift to higher-margin products, including from the discontinuation of certain lower margin marketing products. 
Total contract value grew 6% FX-neutral to $3.7 billion at March 31. Quarterly net contract value increase, or NCVI, was $59 million, significantly better than the pandemic affected first quarter last year. Quarterly NCVI is a helpful way to measure contract value performance in the quarter, even though there is notable seasonality in this metric. 
Global Technology Sales contract value at the end of the first quarter was $3 billion, up 5% versus the prior year.   GTS CV increased $34 million from the fourth quarter. The selling environment continued to improve in the first quarter but while retention isn't yet fully back to normal. Moving forward, we expect win backs and a return to more expansion with existing clients to contribute to growth in 2021, consistent with our experience coming out of the last downturn. 
By industry, CV growth was led by technology, health care and services, while retention for GTS was 98% for the quarter, down about 560 basis points year-over-year. Sequentially, a majority of our industry groups saw retention improve from the fourth quarter. 
GTS new business was up 21% versus last year with strength in new logos and an improvement in upsell with existing clients. Our regular full set of metrics can be found in our earnings supplement. 
Global Business Sales contract value was $731 million at the end of the first quarter, up 12% year-over-year. GBS CV increased $25 million from the fourth quarter. This was the strongest first quarter performance we've seen from GBS. 
CV growth was led by the health care and technology industries. All practices recorded double-digit CV growth with the exception of marketing, which was impacted by discontinued products. However, our marketing practice saw improving retention rates and a return to year-over-year new business growth in the quarter. All of our practices, including marketing, showed sequential increases in CV from the fourth quarter. While retention for GBS was 104% for the quarter, up more than 330 basis points year-over-year. GBS new business was up 87% over last year, led by very strong growth across the full portfolio.  As with GTS, our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in our earnings supplement. 
Conferences revenue for the quarter was $25 million. We had about $10 million of onetime revenue in the quarter. This reflected contract entitlements, which we extended beyond the end of 2020 as a result of the pandemic. Contribution margin in the quarter was 56%. We held 5 virtual conferences in the quarter. We also held a number of virtual Avanta meetings. 
First quarter consulting revenues increased by 4% year-over-year to $100 million. On an FX-neutral basis, revenues were flat. Consulting contribution margin was 39% in the first quarter, up 860 basis points versus the prior year quarter. Labor-based revenues were $84 million, up 4% versus Q1 of last year and down 1% on an FX-neutral basis. Labor-based billable headcount of 744 was down 8% due to headcount actions taken in Q2 and Q3 of last year.  Utilization was 68%, up about 550 basis points year-over-year. Backlog at March 31 was $116 million, up 3% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis after a strong bookings quarter. Our backlog provides us with about 4 months of forward revenue coverage. 
Our Contract Optimization business was up 6% on a reported basis versus the prior year quarter and 3% FX neutral. As we have detailed in the past, this part of the consulting segment is highly variable. 
Consolidated cost of services decreased 2% year-over-year and 4% FX-neutral in the first quarter. Cost of services declined due to lower travel and entertainment costs during the quarter, as well as the continuation of various cost avoidance initiatives. 
SG&A decreased 2% year-over-year and 4% FX-neutral in the first quarter as well. SG&A declined due to lower facilities, travel, entertainment and conference-related expenses, as well as the continuation of various cost avoidance initiatives. 
As CV rebounds this year, our traditional sales productivity metrics will also improve. For 2021, we have ample sales capacity to drive increasing CV growth, a more tenured than usual sales force, several consecutive quarters of strong client engagement which should drive improving retention, and the insights to help our clients address their most critical priorities. Going forward, in addition to the initiatives to improve sales force productivity and cost effectiveness we've been discussing the past few years, this year, we are investing to upgrade many of our sales technology tools. We will be ramping up our sales force hiring later in the year to ensure we have the team in place to drive strong CV growth next year. We still anticipate high single-digit growth in both GTS and GBS headcount by the end of 2021. 
EBITDA for the first quarter was $320 million, up 50% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 44% FX neutral. First quarter EBITDA reflected revenue above the high end and costs towards the low end of our expectations for the first quarter.  
Depreciation in the quarter was up about $3 million versus 2020, including real estate and software, which went into service since the first quarter of last year. Net interest expense, excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter, was $25 million, flat versus the first quarter of 2020. 
The Q1 adjusted tax rate, which we used for the calculation of adjusted net income was 23.5% for the quarter. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 22.4% in the quarter. 
Adjusted EPS in Q1 was $2. Recall that about $6 million of equity compensation expense, which we normally would have incurred in the fourth quarter of 2020, shifted into the first quarter of 2021. The weighted average fully diluted share count for the first quarter was 89.1 million shares. The ending fully diluted share count at March 31st was 87.7 million shares. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $157 million compared to $56 million last year. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily driven by EBITDA growth, improved collections and cost avoidance initiatives. 
CapEx for the quarter was $13 million, down 49% year-over-year. Lower CapEx is largely a function of lower real estate investments. 
Free cash flow for the quarter was $145 million, which was up about 360% versus the prior year. Free cash flow growth continues to be an important part of our business model, with modest capital expenditure needs and upfront client payments. Free cash flow as a percent of revenue or free cash flow margin was 22% on a rolling 4-quarter basis, continuing the improvement we've been making over the past few years. Free cash flow is well in excess of both GAAP and adjusted net income. 
At the end of the first quarter, we had $446 million of cash. Our March 31st debt balance was $2 billion. At the end of the first quarter, we had about $1 billion of revolver capacity. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was about 2.2x. We remain very comfortable with our current gross debt level and the corresponding lower leverage multiple. The multiple has reduced predominantly from increased EBITDA. 
Our expected free cash flow generation and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity and cash to deliver on our capital allocation strategy of share repurchases and strategic tuck-in M&A. During the first quarter, we repurchased $398 million in stock at an average price of about $180 per share. In the month of April, we repurchased more than $200 million of our stock. 
At the end of April, the Board increased our share repurchase authorization for the second time this year, adding another $500 million. As of April 30, we have around $790 million available for open market repurchases. We expect the Board will continue to refresh the repurchased authorization as needed going forward. As we continue to repurchase shares, we expect our capital base to shrink going forward. This is accretive to earnings per share and combined with growing profits, also delivers increasing returns on invested capital over time as well. We are updating our full year guidance to reflect Q1 performance and an improved and increased outlook for the remainder of the year. For 
Research, the strong start to the year in CV performance and improvements to nonsubscription revenue are contributing to higher than previously expected research revenue. For Conferences, our guidance is still based on being virtual for the full year. Operationally, we are planning to relaunch in-person Avanta meetings in the third quarter and in-person destination conferences starting in September. 
Our guidance includes fixed costs, primarily people and marketing related to both a full year of virtual and a partial year of in-person conferences. We've excluded the variable costs, primarily venue-related associated with in-person conferences from our guidance. If we are able to run in-person conferences, we expect incremental upside to both our revenue and profitability for 2021. 
For consulting revenues, demand started the year better than we expected and the backlog improved during the first quarter. For expenses, we have reinstated benefits, which were either canceled or deferred in 2020. This includes our annual merit increase, which took effect April 1. We also plan to increase quota-bearing head count in the high single digits for both GTS and GBS by the end of 2021. 
Additionally, we continue to invest in several other programs. The impact of most of these expense restorations or investments impact our P&L starting in the second quarter. 
As you know, travel expenses were close to 0 from April 2020 through March 2021. Our current plans continue to assume a modest ramp-up in travel-related expenses over the course of 2021. Most of this ramp is built into the second half of the year. If travel restrictions remain in place for longer than we've assumed, we'd see expense savings. 
For our revenue guidance, we now expect Research revenue of at least $3.935 billion, which is growth of at least 9.2%. We expect Conferences revenue of at least $170 million which is growth of at least 42%. We now expect consulting revenue of at least $400 million, which is growth of at least 6.4%. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $4.5 billion, which is growth of 9.9%. 
Based on current foreign exchange rates and business mix, the consolidated growth includes an FX benefit of about 200 basis points. The year-over-year FX benefit is more pronounced in the first half of the year. 
With the ongoing business momentum we are seeing, we are planning to restore growth spending as we move through the year. We now expect full year adjusted EBITDA of at least $1 billion, which is an increase of about 22.3% versus 2020 and reported margins of at least 22%. This is based on Conferences running virtual only. The 18% to 19% expected margins in the back half of the year should provide a reasonable run rate for thinking about the margins going forward as we will have more fully restored costs and resumed growth hiring. 
We expect our full year 2021 adjusted net interest expense to be $102 million. We expect an adjusted tax rate of around 22% for 2021. We now expect 2021 adjusted EPS of at least $6.25. For 2021, we now expect free cash flow of at least $850 million. This is before any insurance proceeds related to 2020 conference cancellations. All the details of our full year guidance are included on our Investor Relations site. 
Finally, we expect to deliver at least $270 million of EBITDA in Q2 of 2021. We expect the second quarter tax rate in the high 20s. 
Looking out over the medium term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged. With 12% to 16% research CV growth, we will deliver double-digit revenue growth. With gross margin expansion, sales cost growing in line with CV growth over time and G&A leverage, we can modestly expand margins from a normalized 2021 level of around 18% to 19%. We can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA because of our modest CapEx needs and the benefits of our clients paying us upfront. We will repurchase shares over time, which will lower the share count as well. 
We had a strong start to the year with momentum across the business. We have meaningfully updated our outlook for 2021 to reflect the stronger demand environment and our enhanced visibility. We are restoring certain expenses and investing to ensure we are well positioned to rebound as the economy recovers. We repurchased more than $600 million worth of stock this year through the end of April and remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders.

And so the first piece of it is there's an incredibly large market opportunity. 
The second piece of it is that we had to get all of the elements that we know that are part of the Gartner formula lined up to fully realize that opportunity. And it's things like training the sales force, we introduced a whole set of products, which the GXL products we talked about over time. And the combination of both, getting our sales force up to speed on the kind of Gartner way we sell and getting all the new products introduced and making sure the sales force understood on how to sell them, that has resulted in us getting, and implementing all the kind of process improvements that we've used historically and continue to improve.

Many probably -- a large proportion of our field sales people are actually deployed remotely even before the pandemic. And so we're used to working remotely there. 
The -- we use the opportunity of the pandemic to look at what sales territories were most productive. And our sales headcount did go down a little bit as we looked at areas that we thought that were less productive than we could actually invest better. And if you look at our sales productivity, for 2021, we have plenty of capacity to continue to accelerate the terms of our growth for both GBS and GTS. 
Then going forward, as Craig said, during the year, we expect to accelerate our hiring and end the year with high single-digit growth in headcount in both GBS and GTS, which positions us really well for 2022 to continue the growth as we've done in the past."

As we look out over the balance of the year, we expect margins in the 18% to 19% range for the balance of the year, for the second half of the year. And we feel like that's a good baseline because we will have fully restored or at least begun -- begin restoring all the expenses that we have been avoiding for the last several quarters that we want to put back in. We will be aggressively adding growth to our sales force in a number of other areas and also investing in key areas that we believe are super important for us to be able to sustain double-digit growth. 
Obviously, moving forward, the business is going to look a little bit different. The P&L is going to look a little bit different than it did pre pandemic. And clearly, our expectations around our ""normal operating margins"" or EBITDA margins are a lot higher than they were pre pandemic. And that's because of some of the structural changes that you alluded to, Toni, that we are going to fully harvest moving forward. And so those are things like having lower overall travel expenses we've learned through the pandemic that we do want to travel and we do need to travel. But we don't need to spend nearly as much or drive as much volume in terms of travel to run our business going forward. 
I think similarly, with facilities, we have the ability now to reallocate and reapportion our facility footprint which means we can really grow into what we currently have and we shouldn't need to meaningfully increase our facilities expenses as we did historically when we added lots of people. We always needed to make sure we grow our facilities. Those are the 2 big ones. 
And then the last thing I would mention, just on your point on the margin side, we are benefiting from a few things there. One is, and I'll give you the example is within the marketing practice. And as we told you several quarters ago, we discontinued several low margin products, and the sales team has been focused on replacing them with higher-margin products. And we're seeing that happen in the marketing practice, and we're also seeing that happen in several of our other practices, including GTS as well, which is certainly helping the overall gross margin and overall margin profile as well. 
And then lastly, clearly with GBS growing the way it is, we're adding scale to each of the practices that we serve and support as well, which is clearly helping on the economic and margin front as well."

We don't guide on CV specifically, as you know, George. And so we're not going to provide what we think the number is going to be in Q3 or Q4, but we do feel very good about the pacing and the strength of the business that we've seen.

There's the old adage about the tough times make you stronger, I think, certainly applies to how we feel about it for us. In the sense that when the pandemic hit last year, it was pretty tough. And so there were a lot of innovations we tried. We really were -- had the largest set of innovative things that we tried in, I guess, in the second -- beginning second quarter of last year, things like different kinds of formats for adding value remotely, things like that. And what we found is that the whole wave of innovation has resulted in some learnings. Some stuff didn't work that great. Some stuff worked really, really well, and we're going to continue that -- those things going forward. 
So I think 1 learning is just that there were a bunch of specific innovations that we came up with. An example of it kind of is very clear is virtual conferences where we didn't have any virtual conferences before. It certainly begs the question going forward. We've learned to be very successful with virtual conferences. Well, when we can go back to in-person, should we continue those virtual conferences as well, which we almost certainly will in different circumstances. 
Similarly, with our products, we learned some ways to add value remotely that we hadn't used before that we will continue to use going forward. 
We also learned that we need less travel -- as Craig said earlier, we'd probably be less travel we thought we did before the pandemic. We also -- we've always had a large -- a relatively large share of our workforce working remotely, but for the pandemic, everybody will work remotely. Again, we developed new work practices that will, I think, improve our productivity going forward for all of our remote workers, even when some of our workers are back in the office.

And we are going to be increasing costs nicely and consistently over the next 3 quarters. That said, it's a little bit lighter than what we originally baked into our forecast just based on some of the softness we saw in Q1 and our ability to ramp up as quickly as we want to. So it is definitely a combination of the Q1 overperformance and then extending that through the balance of the year, given the momentum we've seen, not only on the subscription part of the research business, but the non subscription part of the research business, the strength we saw in bookings and backlog in the quarter allowed us to increase our consulting outlook. We increased our conferences outlook a little bit as well. So it was strength across the board.

One is, it's down year-over-year, but we've actually seen nice sequential improvement, particularly from fourth quarter into Q1. And if you'll remember, Manav, the way we go-to-market in GBS is essentially by functional area. And so just because a client might be an HR client, we've got a team that goes in and then tries to convert the finance team and bring them honest clients. And so we are able to generate really nice growth from existing enterprises because we may only have 1 function. As clients, we may have 2, we may have 3, we may have 4, and it varies across the board. 
And so I think the strength in GBS new business was a combination of new logo growth and expanding within existing client enterprises. But even, again, to understood our point, when we are expanding in in enterprises, it is often like a brand-new client, where they've gone from 0 CV in finance, they become a finance client. And again, it won't increment up necessarily the client enterprise count. 
But again, we did see a nice sequential bump from 4Q into the first quarter and a large portion of that new business strength we saw in GBS in the first quarter could be attributed to brand-new logos."

Yes, I think we want to guide in ways that we feel that we are very confident that we will be able to achieve that guidance. And the way we've been updating our guidance each quarter over the last several quarters is we analyzed what happened in the most recent quarter. We utilize the enhanced visibility we have from a performance in that quarter and looking forward. And then we flow that through both our top line metrics and on the expense side as well. 
I think, in particular, we were a little cautious entering the year, particularly with thinking about the CV ramp, which drives the bulk of our book of our revenue for the business. And we had a really strong first quarter from a CV ramp perspective. And the beauty of that is we had some benefit in the first quarter. But the reality is the bulk of that benefit flows through to the balance of the year as we recognize that revenue. And now we've got a view into Q2 pipeline and into Q3 pipeline as well. So we just have that advanced -- enhanced visibility as well. 
And so again, I think from a guidance perspective, these are numbers that, based on everything we're seeing, based on most recent performance, based on the visibility that we have around subsequent quarters or quarters that are coming up, this is what we believe the business is going to perform at. And that hasn't really changed in terms of our, I'd say guidance philosophy or guidance methodology. So just given the volatility in the overall selling environment driven by the pandemic, driven by recessions, driven by other things. Obviously, the visibility does change or the facts that drive the visibility have been changing very rapidly quarter-to-quarter, and we've been adjusting on that each and every quarter since. And so from where we sit today, the updated guide, while it is significantly higher than we had guided originally in the year, those are the numbers we feel very confident with."

And then secondly then, within each enterprise, we have a lot of opportunity for additional seats. And it's a little different with GTS and GBS. With GTS, if you think about it as being within the technology organizations, those are large organizations, they're growing. And even among our existing clients, there's tremendous growth opportunities. We have products for, obviously, the C level, their direct reports and then on down to their organization. 
And then if you look at GBS, then you have each of the functions, as Craig mentioned earlier, finance, marketing, sales, legal, et cetera. And each of those functions today, we have very, very low penetration in both enterprises, and we still have the same opportunity to add seats for each of those organizations as well. And many of those organizations are quite large, like you think about the sales organization, for example, our finance organization. There's just enormous opportunities there.

We delivered strong results across contract value, revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. Total revenues were up 6%, with each of our business segments, research, conferences, and consulting, exceeding our expectations. 
Research is our largest and most profitable segment. Our Research segment serves executives and their teams across all major enterprise functions in every industry around the world. Research has a vast market opportunity across all sectors, sizes and geographies. 
Global Technology Sales, or GTS, source leaders and their teams within IT. For Q1, GTS contract value grew 5%. First quarter new business was up 21% as a result of new logos and upsell with existing clients. Client engagement continue to be strong, with content and analyst interaction volumes up to 26% compared to Q [indiscernible] 2020. 
We saw strong performances across several regions and industries, including tech and midsized enterprises. We expect GTS contract value growth to continue to accelerate in 2021 and return to double-digit growth in the future. 
Global Business Sales, or GBS, serves leaders and their teams beyond IT. This includes HR, supply chain, finance, marketing, sales, legal and more. GBS achieved contract value growth of 12%, its first quarter of double-digit growth. New business growth was a very strong 87% in the quarter. All practices, with the exception of marketing, ended Q1 with double-digit contract value growth rates, and all practices delivered positive quarterly NCVI. 
Across our entire research business, we practiced relentless execution of proven practices, and we're seeing the results of our efforts. Our Research business is well positioned to return to sustained double-digit growth over the medium term. 
Turning to Conferences, as many of you know, during 2020, our Conferences business pivoted from in-person destination conferences to virtual. Our value proposition for virtual conferences remains the same as for in-person conferences. We deliver extraordinarily valuable insights to an engaged and qualified audience. 
While Q1 is a small quarter for conferences, the business exceeded our expectations. Beyond virtual conferences, we continue to prepare to return to in-person conferences in the second half of 2021. 
Gartner Consulting is an extension of Gartner Research, and helps clients execute their most strategic initiatives through deeper extended project-based work. Our Consulting segment also exceeded our expectations, with bookings up 26% during Q1. Our Consulting business will continue to serve as an important complement to our IT Research business. 
One of our objectives is to generate strong cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was $145 million, up significantly versus the prior year. In addition, we used that cash flow plus cash balances to purchase more than $600 million in stock through April of this year. With these repurchases, our Board increased our share repurchase authorization by another $500 million. 
We recently launched our 2020 Corporate Responsibility Report. The report details the progress we made in accelerating positive social change and contributing to a more sustainable world. We want our associates, communities and clients to continue to thrive today and in the future. The report can be found on gartner.com, and I encourage you to take a look. 
Summarizing, Q1 was a strong quarter with all 3 business segments exceeding our expectations. Looking ahead, we are well positioned for sustained success. We have a vast addressable market which will allow us to achieve double-digit contract value and revenue growth over the next 5 years and beyond. We expect to deliver modest EBITDA margin expansion going forward from a normalized 2021. We generate significant free cash flow in excess of net income, which we'll continue to deploy through share repurchases and strategic tuck-in acquisitions.

I hope everyone remains safe and well. First quarter results were outstanding with very good momentum across the business. Revenue was well above our expectations.

First quarter results were outstanding with very good momentum across the business. 
Revenue was well above our expectations. Despite the lower-than-planned expenses, we are well positioned to take advantage of the strong demand environment. We will continue to restore spending to support and drive long-term sustained double-digit growth. With stronger-than-expected results in contract value, nonsubscription research and consulting, we are increasing our revenue growth and normalized margin outlook, which results in a meaningful increase to our 2021 guidance. The improved outlook reflects the increased visibility we have following the stronger-than-expected first quarter. 
First quarter revenue was $1.1 billion, up 8% year-over-year as reported and 6% FX-neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 70%, up more than 320 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA was $320 million, up 50% year-over-year and up 44% FX-neutral. Adjusted EPS was $2, and free cash flow in the quarter was $145 million. Research revenue in the first quarter grew 8% year-over-year as reported and 6% on an FX-neutral basis, and we saw strong retention and new business throughout the quarter. 
First quarter research contribution margin was 74%, up about 200 basis points versus 2020. Higher contribution margins reflect both improved operational effectiveness and the avoidance of travel expenses. Some of the margin improvement compared to historical levels is temporary and will reverse as the world reopens, and we increase spending to support growth. We are seeing a benefit from increased scale and a mix shift to higher-margin products, including from the discontinuation of certain lower-margin marketing products. 
Total contract value grew 6% FX-neutral to $3.7 billion at March 31. Quarterly net contract value increase, or NCVI, was $59 million, significantly better than the pandemic affected first quarter last year. Quarterly NCVI is a helpful way to measure contract value performance in the quarter, even though there is notable seasonality in this metric. 
Global Technology Sales contract value at the end of the first quarter was $3 billion, up 5% versus the prior year. GTS CV increased $34 million from the fourth quarter. The selling environment continued to improve in the first quarter but while retention isn't yet fully back to normal. Moving forward, we expect win backs and a return to more expansion with existing clients to contribute to growth in 2021, consistent with our experience coming out of the last downturn. 
By industry, CV growth was led by technology, health care and services, while retention for GTS was 98% for the quarter, down about 560 basis points year-over-year. Sequentially, a majority of our industry groups saw retention improve from the fourth quarter. 
GTS new business was up 21% versus last year with strength in new logos and an improvement in upsell with existing clients. Our regular full set of metrics can be found in our earnings supplement. 
Global Business Sales contract value was $731 million at the end of the first quarter, up 12% year-over-year. GBS CV increased $25 million from the fourth quarter. This was the strongest first quarter performance we've seen from GBS. 
CV growth was led by the health care and technology industries. All practices recorded double-digit CV growth with the exception of marketing, which was impacted by discontinued products. However, our marketing practice saw improving retention rates and a return to year-over-year new business growth in the quarter. All of our practices, including marketing, showed sequential increases in CV from the fourth quarter. While retention for GBS was 104% for the quarter, up more than 330 basis points year-over-year, GBS new business was up 87% over last year, led by very strong growth across the full portfolio. As with GTS, our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in our earnings supplement. 
Conferences revenue for the quarter was $25 million. We had about $10 million of onetime revenue in the quarter. This reflected contract entitlements, which we extended beyond the end of 2020 as a result of the pandemic. Contribution margin in the quarter was 56%. We held 5 virtual conferences in the quarter. We also held a number of virtual Avanta meetings. 
First quarter consulting revenues increased by 4% year-over-year to $100 million. On an FX-neutral basis, revenues were flat. Consulting contribution margin was 39% in the first quarter, up 860 basis points versus the prior year quarter. Labor-based revenues were $84 million, up 4% versus Q1 of last year and down 1% on an FX-neutral basis. Labor-based billable headcount of 744 was down 8% due to headcount actions taken in Q2 and Q3 of last year.  Utilization was 68%, up about 550 basis points year-over-year. Backlog at March 31 was $116 million, up 3% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis after a strong bookings quarter. Our backlog provides us with about 4 months of forward revenue coverage. 
Our Contract Optimization business was up 6% on a reported basis versus the prior year quarter and 3% FX-neutral. As we have detailed in the past, this part of the consulting segment is highly variable. 
Consolidated cost of services decreased 2% year-over-year and 4% FX-neutral in the first quarter. Cost of services declined due to lower travel and entertainment costs during the quarter, as well as the continuation of various cost avoidance initiatives. 
SG&A decreased 2% year-over-year and 4% FX-neutral in the first quarter as well. SG&A declined due to lower facilities, travel, entertainment, and conference-related expenses, as well as the continuation of various cost avoidance initiatives. 
As CV rebounds this year, our traditional sales productivity metrics will also improve. For 2021, we have ample sales capacity to drive increasing CV growth, a more tenured-than-usual sales force, several consecutive quarters of strong client engagement which should drive improving retention, and the insights to help our clients address their most critical priorities. 
Going forward, in addition to the initiatives to improve sales force productivity and cost effectiveness we've been discussing the past few years, this year, we are investing to upgrade many of our sales technology tools. We will be ramping up our sales force hiring later in the year to ensure we have the team in place to drive strong CV growth next year. We still anticipate high single-digit growth in both GTS and GBS headcount by the end of 2021. 
EBITDA for the first quarter was $320 million, up 50% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 44% FX-neutral. First quarter EBITDA reflected revenue above the high end and costs towards the low end of our expectations for the first quarter.  
Depreciation in the quarter was up about $3 million versus 2020, including real estate and software, which went into service since the first quarter of last year. Net interest expense, excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter, was $25 million, flat versus the first quarter of 2020. 
The Q1 adjusted tax rate, which we used for the calculation of adjusted net income, was 23.5% for the quarter. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 22.4% in the quarter. 
Adjusted EPS in Q1 was $2. Recall that about $6 million of equity compensation expense, which we normally would have incurred in the fourth quarter of 2020, shifted into the first quarter of 2021. The weighted average fully diluted share count for the first quarter was 89.1 million shares. The ending fully diluted share count at March 31st was 87.7 million shares. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $157 million compared to $56 million last year. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily driven by EBITDA growth, improved collections and cost avoidance initiatives. 
CapEx for the quarter was $13 million, down 49% year-over-year. Lower CapEx is largely a function of lower real estate investments. 
Free cash flow for the quarter was $145 million, which was up about 360% versus the prior year. Free cash flow growth continues to be an important part of our business model, with modest capital expenditure needs and upfront client payments. Free cash flow as a percent of revenue or free cash flow margin was 22% on a rolling 4-quarter basis, continuing the improvement we've been making over the past few years. Free cash flow is well in excess of both GAAP and adjusted net income. 
At the end of the first quarter, we had $446 million of cash. Our March 31st debt balance was $2 billion. At the end of the first quarter, we had about $1 billion of revolver capacity. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was about 2.2x. We remain very comfortable with our current gross debt level and the corresponding lower leverage multiple. The multiple has reduced predominantly from increased EBITDA. 
Our expected free cash flow generation and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity and cash to deliver on our capital allocation strategy of share repurchases and strategic tuck-in M&A. During the first quarter, we repurchased $398 million in stock at an average price of about $180 per share. In the month of April, we repurchased more than $200 million of our stock. 
At the end of April, the Board increased our share repurchase authorization for the second time this year, adding another $500 million. As of April 30, we have around $790 million available for open market repurchases. We expect the Board will continue to refresh the repurchased authorization as needed going forward. As we continue to repurchase shares, we expect our capital base to shrink going forward. This is accretive to earnings per share and combined with growing profits, also delivers increasing returns on invested capital over time as well. We are updating our full year guidance to reflect Q1 performance and an improved and increased outlook for the remainder of the year. 
For Research, the strong start to the year in CV performance and improvements to nonsubscription revenue are contributing to higher-than-previously-expected research revenue. For Conferences, our guidance is still based on being virtual for the full year. Operationally, we are planning to relaunch in-person Avanta meetings in the third quarter and in-person destination conferences starting in September.
Our guidance includes fixed costs, primarily people and marketing related to both a full year of virtual and a partial year of in-person conferences. We've excluded the variable costs, primarily venue-related associated with in-person conferences from our guidance. If we are able to run in-person conferences, we expect incremental upside to both our revenue and profitability for 2021. 
For Consulting revenues, demand started the year better than we expected and the backlog improved during the first quarter. For expenses, we have reinstated benefits, which were either canceled or deferred in 2020. This includes our annual merit increase, which took effect April 1. We also plan to increase quota-bearing head count in the high single digits for both GTS and GBS by the end of 2021. 
Additionally, we continue to invest in several other programs. The impact of most of these expense restorations or investments impact our P&L starting in the second quarter. 
As you know, travel expenses were close to 0 from April 2020 through March 2021. Our current plans continue to assume a modest ramp-up in travel-related expenses over the course of 2021. Most of this ramp is built into the second half of the year. If travel restrictions remain in place for longer than we've assumed, we'd see expense savings.
For our revenue guidance, we now expect Research revenue of at least $3.935 billion, which is growth of at least 9.2%. We expect Conferences revenue of at least $170 million which is growth of at least 42%. We now expect consulting revenue of at least $400 million, which is growth of at least 6.4%. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $4.5 billion, which is growth of 9.9%. 
Based on current foreign exchange rates and business mix, the consolidated growth includes an FX benefit of about 200 basis points. The year-over-year FX benefit is more pronounced in the first half of the year. 
With the ongoing business momentum we are seeing, we are planning to restore growth spending as we move through the year. We now expect full year adjusted EBITDA of at least $1 billion, which is an increase of about 22.3% versus 2020 and reported margins of at least 22%. This is based on conferences running virtual only. The 18% to 19% expected margins in the back half of the year should provide a reasonable run rate for thinking about the margins going forward as we will have more fully restored costs and resumed growth hiring. 
We expect our full year 2021 adjusted net interest expense to be $102 million. We expect an adjusted tax rate of around 22% for 2021. We now expect 2021 adjusted EPS of at least $6.25. For 2021, we now expect free cash flow of at least $850 million. This is before any insurance proceeds related to 2020 conference cancellations. All the details of our full year guidance are included on our Investor Relations site. 
Finally, we expect to deliver at least $270 million of EBITDA in Q2 of 2021. We expect the second quarter tax rate in the high 20s. 
Looking out over the medium term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged. With 12% to 16% research CV growth, we will deliver double-digit revenue growth. With gross margin expansion, sales cost growing in line with CV growth over time and G&A leverage, we can modestly expand margins from a normalized 2021 level of around 18% to 19%. We can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA because of our modest CapEx needs and the benefits of our clients paying us upfront. We will repurchase shares over time, which will lower the share count as well.
We had a strong start to the year with momentum across the business. We have meaningfully updated our outlook for 2021 to reflect the stronger demand environment and our enhanced visibility. We are restoring certain expenses and investing to ensure we are well positioned to rebound as the economy recovers. We repurchased more than $600 million worth of stock this year through the end of April and remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders.

And what's going on is, as you said, there's a tremendous growth opportunity, the untapped market in GBS -- in GTS, it's a huge untapped market. In GBS, we're even less penetrated than that. And so, the first piece of it is there's an incredibly large market opportunity. 
The second piece of it is that we had to get all of the elements that we know that are part of the Gartner formula lined up to fully realize that opportunity. And it's things like training the sales force, we introduced a whole set of products, which, the GxL products, we talked about over time. And the combination of both, getting our sales force up to speed on the kind of Gartner way we sell and getting all the new products introduced and making sure the sales force understood on how to sell them, that has resulted in us getting and implementing all the kind of process improvements that we've used historically and continue to improve. 
You pull all those things together, and that's resulted in GBS accelerating each of the quarters, as we talked about earlier. And so it's a combination of all the sort of applying subtle versions, it's applying the Gartner formula to the GBS market where we have this incredibly huge opportunity."

We have over time, and we continue to be -- if you want to be in the selling field, Gartner is the place to be. And by the way, we've had remote salespeople for a long time. Many, probably -- a large proportion of our field salespeople are actually deployed remotely even before the pandemic. And so we're used to working remotely there. 
The -- we use the opportunity of the pandemic to look at what sales territories were most productive. And our sales headcount did go down a little bit as we looked at areas that we thought that were less productive than we could actually invest better. And if you look at our sales productivity, for 2021, we have plenty of capacity to continue to accelerate the terms of our growth for both GBS and GTS.
Then going forward, as Craig said, during the year, we expect to accelerate our hiring and end the year with high single-digit growth in headcount in both GBS and GTS, which positions us really well for 2022 to continue the growth as we've done in the past."

And as we talked about, earlier, it was a combination of super strong performance on the top line. And underspending versus our estimates, sort of across the board, resulting in very strong EBITDA and very strong EBITDA margins. 
As we look out over the balance of the year, we expect margins in the 18% to 19% range for the balance of the year, for the second half of the year. And we feel like that's a good baseline because we will have fully restored or at least begun -- begin restoring all the expenses that we have been avoiding for the last several quarters that we want to put back in. We will be aggressively adding growth to our sales force in a number of other areas and also investing in key areas that we believe are super important for us to be able to sustain double-digit growth. 
Obviously, moving forward, the business is going to look a little bit different. The P&L is going to look a little bit different than it did pre pandemic. And clearly, our expectations around our ""normal operating margins"", or EBITDA margins, are a lot higher than they were pre pandemic. And that's because of some of the structural changes that you alluded to, Toni, that we are going to fully harvest moving forward. And so those are things like having lower overall travel expenses. We've learned through the pandemic that we do want to travel and we do need to travel but we don't need to spend nearly as much -- or drive as much volume in terms of travel to run our business going forward. 
I think similarly, with facilities, we have the ability now to reallocate and reapportion our facility footprint which means we can really grow into what we currently have and we shouldn't need to meaningfully increase our facilities expenses as we did historically when we added lots of people. We always needed to make sure we grow our facilities. Those are the 2 big ones. 
And then the last thing I would mention, just on your point on the margin side, we are benefiting from a few things there. One is -- and I'll give you the example, is within the marketing practice. And as we told you several quarters ago, we discontinued several low margin products, and the sales team has been focused on replacing them with higher-margin products. And we're seeing that happen in the marketing practice, and we're also seeing that happen in several of our other practices, including GTS as well, which is certainly helping the overall gross margin and overall margin profile as well. 
And then lastly, clearly with GBS growing the way it is, we're adding scale to each of the practices that we serve and support as well, which is clearly helping on the economic and margin front as well."

In addition to that, we are currently in the process of implementing a new CRM system, which we use by sales as well as other people throughout the business.

There's the old adage about the tough times make you stronger, I think, certainly applies to how we feel about it for us. In the sense that when the pandemic hit last year, it was pretty tough. And so, there were a lot of innovations we tried. We really were -- had the largest set of innovative things that we tried in -- I guess, in the second -- beginning second quarter of last year, things like different kinds of formats for adding value remotely, things like that. And what we found is that the whole wave of innovation has resulted in some learnings. Some stuff didn't work that great. Some stuff worked really, really well, and we're going to continue that -- those things going forward. 
So I think one learning is just that there were a bunch of specific innovations that we came up with. An example of it kind of is very clear is virtual conferences where we didn't have any virtual conferences before. It certainly begs the question going forward. We've learned to be very successful with virtual conferences. Well, when we can go back to in-person, should we continue those virtual conferences as well, which we almost certainly will in different circumstances. 
Similarly, with our products, we learned some ways to add value remotely that we hadn't used before that we will continue to use going forward. We also learned that we need less travel -- as Craig said earlier, we'd probably need less travel than we thought we did before the pandemic. We also -- we've always had a large -- a relatively large share of our workforce working remotely, but for the pandemic, where everybody working remotely. So again, we developed new work practices that will, I think, improve our productivity going forward for all of our remote workers, even when some of our workers are back in the office.

That said, it's a little bit lighter than what we originally baked into our forecast just based on some of the softness we saw in Q1 and our ability to ramp up as quickly as we want to. So it is definitely a combination of the Q1 overperformance and then extending that through the balance of the year, given the momentum we've seen, not only on the subscription part of the research business, but the nonsubscription part of the research business, the strength we saw in bookings and backlog in the quarter allowed us to increase our consulting outlook. We increased our conferences outlook a little bit as well. So it was strength across the board.

One is, it's down year-over-year, but we've actually seen nice sequential improvement, particularly from fourth quarter into Q1. If you'll remember, Manav, the way we go to market in GBS is essentially by functional area. And so just because a client might be an HR client, we've got a team that goes in and then tries to convert the finance team and bring them honest clients. And so, we are able to generate really nice growth from existing enterprises because we may only have one function. As clients, we may have 2, we may have 3, we may have 4, and it varies across the board. 
And so, I think, the strength in GBS new business was a combination of new logo growth and expanding within existing client enterprises. But even, again, to understand our point, when we are expanding in client enterprises, it is often like a brand-new client, where they've gone from zero CV in finance, they become a finance client. And again, it won't increment up necessarily the client enterprise count. 
But again, we did see a nice sequential bump from 4Q into the first quarter and a large portion of that new business strength we saw in GBS in the first quarter could be attributed to brand-new logos."

It gets associated with the it -- with the pandemic, but we had actually converted to this way of guiding just prior to the pandemic. 
Yes, I think, we want to guide in ways that we feel that we are very confident that we will be able to achieve that guidance. And the way we've been updating our guidance each quarter over the last several quarters is we analyzed what happened in the most recent quarter. We utilized the enhanced visibility we have from a performance in that quarter and looking forward. And then we flow that through both our top line metrics and on the expense side as well. 
I think, in particular, we were a little cautious entering the year, particularly with thinking about the CV ramp, which drives the bulk of our -- bulk of our revenue for the business. And we had a really strong first quarter from a CV ramp perspective. And the beauty of that is we had some benefit in the first quarter. But the reality is the bulk of that benefit flows through to the balance of the year as we recognize that revenue. And now we've got a view into Q2 pipeline and into Q3 pipeline as well. So we just have that advanced -- enhanced visibility as well. 
And so again, I think, from a guidance perspective, these are numbers that, based on everything we're seeing, based on most recent performance, based on the visibility that we have around subsequent quarters or quarters that are coming up, this is what we believe the business is going to perform at. And that hasn't really changed in terms of our, I'd say, guidance philosophy or guidance methodology. So just given the volatility in the overall selling environment driven by the pandemic, driven by recessions, driven by other things. 
Obviously, the visibility does change or the facts that drive the visibility have been changing very rapidly quarter-to-quarter, and we've been adjusting on that each and every quarter since. And so from where we sit today, the updated guide, while it is significantly higher than what we had guided originally in the year, those are the numbers we feel very confident with."

As we talked about before, we have more than 100,000 enterprises that we target today. And so we have a large number of enterprises we can go after. And then secondly then, within each enterprise, we have a lot of opportunity for additional seats. And it's a little different with GTS and GBS. 
With GTS, if you think about it as being within the technology organizations, those are large organizations, they're growing. And even among our existing clients, there's tremendous growth opportunities. We have products for, obviously, the C level, their direct reports and then on down through to their organization. 
And then if you look at GBS, then you have each of the functions, as Craig mentioned earlier, finance, marketing, sales, legal, et cetera. And each of those functions today, we have very, very low penetration in both enterprises, and we still have the same opportunity to add seats for each of those organizations as well. And many of those organizations are quite large, like you think about the sales organization, for example, our finance organization. There's just enormous opportunities there. 
And so the -- whether it's GTS or GBS, we have huge opportunities, both for additional enterprises, but also for individual seats within those enterprises, both directly reporting -- the C-level -- reporting the C level and then throughout the organization."

We delivered strong results across contract value, revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. Total revenues were up 6%, with each of our business segments, research, conferences, and consulting, exceeding our expectations. 
Research is our largest and most profitable segment. Our Research segment serves executives and their teams across all major enterprise functions in every industry around the world. Research has a vast market opportunity across all sectors, sizes and geographies. 
Global Technology Sales, or GTS, source leaders and their teams within IT. For Q1, GTS contract value grew 5%. First quarter new business was up 21% as a result of new logos and upsell with existing clients. Client engagement continue to be strong, with content and analyst interaction volumes up to 26% compared to Q [Audio Gap] 2020. 
We saw strong performances across several regions and industries, including tech and midsized enterprises. We expect GTS contract value growth to continue to accelerate in 2021 and return to double-digit growth in the future. 
Global Business Sales, or GBS, serves leaders and their teams beyond IT. This includes HR, supply chain, finance, marketing, sales, legal and more. GBS achieved contract value growth of 12%, its first quarter of double-digit growth. New business growth was a very strong 87% in the quarter. All practices, with the exception of marketing, ended Q1 with double-digit contract value growth rates, and all practices delivered positive quarterly NCVI. 
Across our entire research business, we practiced relentless execution of proven practices, and we're seeing the results of our efforts. Our Research business is well positioned to return to sustained double-digit growth over the medium term. 
Turning to Conferences, as many of you know, during 2020, our Conferences business pivoted from in-person destination conferences to virtual. Our value proposition for virtual conferences remains the same as for in-person conferences. We deliver extraordinarily valuable insights to an engaged and qualified audience. 
While Q1 is a small quarter for conferences, the business exceeded our expectations. Beyond virtual conferences, we continue to prepare to return to in-person conferences in the second half of 2021. 
Gartner Consulting is an extension of Gartner Research, and helps clients execute their most strategic initiatives through deeper extended project-based work. Our Consulting segment also exceeded our expectations, with bookings up 26% during Q1. Our Consulting business will continue to serve as an important complement to our IT Research business. 
One of our objectives is to generate strong cash flow. Free cash flow for the quarter was $145 million, up significantly versus the prior year. In addition, we used that cash flow plus cash balances to purchase more than $600 million in stock through April of this year. With these repurchases, our Board increased our share repurchase authorization by another $500 million. 
We recently launched our 2020 Corporate Responsibility Report. The report details the progress we made in accelerating positive social change and contributing to a more sustainable world. We want our associates, communities and clients to continue to thrive today and in the future. The report can be found on gartner.com, and I encourage you to take a look. 
Summarizing, Q1 was a strong quarter with all 3 business segments exceeding our expectations. Looking ahead, we are well positioned for sustained success. We have a vast addressable market which will allow us to achieve double-digit contract value and revenue growth over the next 5 years and beyond. We expect to deliver modest EBITDA margin expansion going forward from a normalized 2021.

First quarter results were outstanding with very good momentum across the business. 
Revenue was well above our expectations. Despite the lower-than-planned expenses, we are well positioned to take advantage of the strong demand environment. We will continue to restore spending to support and drive long-term sustained double-digit growth. With stronger-than-expected results in contract value, nonsubscription research and consulting, we are increasing our revenue growth and normalized margin outlook, which results in a meaningful increase to our 2021 guidance. The improved outlook reflects the increased visibility we have following the stronger-than-expected first quarter. 
First quarter revenue was $1.1 billion, up 8% year-over-year as reported and 6% FX-neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 70%, up more than 320 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA was $320 million, up 50% year-over-year and up 44% FX-neutral. Adjusted EPS was $2, and free cash flow in the quarter was $145 million. Research revenue in the first quarter grew 8% year-over-year as reported and 6% on an FX-neutral basis, and we saw strong retention and new business throughout the quarter. 
First quarter research contribution margin was 74%, up about 200 basis points versus 2020. Higher contribution margins reflect both improved operational effectiveness and the avoidance of travel expenses. Some of the margin improvement compared to historical levels is temporary and will reverse as the world reopens, and we increase spending to support growth. We are seeing a benefit from increased scale and a mix shift to higher-margin products, including from the discontinuation of certain lower-margin marketing products. 
Total contract value grew 6% FX-neutral to $3.7 billion at March 31. Quarterly net contract value increase, or NCVI, was $59 million, significantly better than the pandemic affected first quarter last year. Quarterly NCVI is a helpful way to measure contract value performance in the quarter, even though there is notable seasonality in this metric. 
Global Technology Sales contract value at the end of the first quarter was $3 billion, up 5% versus the prior year. GTS CV increased $34 million from the fourth quarter. The selling environment continued to improve in the first quarter but [ while ] retention isn't yet fully back to normal. Moving forward, we expect win backs and a return to more expansion with existing clients to contribute to growth in 2021, consistent with our experience coming out of the last downturn. 
By industry, CV growth was led by technology, health care and services, while retention for GTS was 98% for the quarter, down about 560 basis points year-over-year. Sequentially, a majority of our industry groups saw retention improve from the fourth quarter. 
GTS new business was up 21% versus last year with strength in new logos and an improvement in upsell with existing clients. Our regular full set of metrics can be found in our earnings supplement. 
Global Business Sales contract value was $731 million at the end of the first quarter, up 12% year-over-year. GBS CV increased $25 million from the fourth quarter. This was the strongest first quarter performance we've seen from GBS. 
CV growth was led by the health care and technology industries. All practices recorded double-digit CV growth with the exception of marketing, which was impacted by discontinued products. However, our marketing practice saw improving retention rates and a return to year-over-year new business growth in the quarter. All of our practices, including marketing, showed sequential increases in CV from the fourth quarter. While retention for GBS was 104% for the quarter, up more than 330 basis points year-over-year, GBS new business was up 87% over last year, led by very strong growth across the full portfolio. As with GTS, our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in our earnings supplement. 
Conferences revenue for the quarter was $25 million. We had about $10 million of onetime revenue in the quarter. This reflected contract entitlements, which we extended beyond the end of 2020 as a result of the pandemic. Contribution margin in the quarter was 56%. We held 5 virtual conferences in the quarter. We also held a number of virtual Avanta meetings. 
First quarter consulting revenues increased by 4% year-over-year to $100 million. On an FX-neutral basis, revenues were flat. Consulting contribution margin was 39% in the first quarter, up 860 basis points versus the prior year quarter. Labor-based revenues were $84 million, up 4% versus Q1 of last year and down 1% on an FX-neutral basis. Labor-based billable headcount of 744 was down 8% due to headcount actions taken in Q2 and Q3 of last year.  Utilization was 68%, up about 550 basis points year-over-year. Backlog at March 31 was $116 million, up 3% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis after a strong bookings quarter. Our backlog provides us with about 4 months of forward revenue coverage. 
Our Contract Optimization business was up 6% on a reported basis versus the prior year quarter and 3% FX-neutral. As we have detailed in the past, this part of the consulting segment is highly variable. 
Consolidated cost of services decreased 2% year-over-year and 4% FX-neutral in the first quarter. Cost of services declined due to lower travel and entertainment costs during the quarter, as well as the continuation of various cost avoidance initiatives. 
SG&A decreased 2% year-over-year and 4% FX-neutral in the first quarter as well. SG&A declined due to lower facilities, travel, entertainment, and conference-related expenses, as well as the continuation of various cost avoidance initiatives. 
As CV rebounds this year, our traditional sales productivity metrics will also improve. For 2021, we have ample sales capacity to drive increasing CV growth, a more tenured-than-usual sales force, several consecutive quarters of strong client engagement which should drive improving retention, and the insights to help our clients address their most critical priorities. 
Going forward, in addition to the initiatives to improve sales force productivity and cost effectiveness we've been discussing the past few years, this year, we are investing to upgrade many of our sales technology tools. We will be ramping up our sales force hiring later in the year to ensure we have the team in place to drive strong CV growth next year. We still anticipate high single-digit growth in both GTS and GBS headcount by the end of 2021. 
EBITDA for the first quarter was $320 million, up 50% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 44% FX-neutral. First quarter EBITDA reflected revenue above the high end and costs towards the low end of our expectations for the first quarter.  
Depreciation in the quarter was up about $3 million versus 2020, including real estate and software, which went into service since the first quarter of last year. Net interest expense, excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter, was $25 million, flat versus the first quarter of 2020. 
The Q1 adjusted tax rate, which we used for the calculation of adjusted net income, was 23.5% for the quarter. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 22.4% in the quarter. 
Adjusted EPS in Q1 was $2. Recall that about $6 million of equity compensation expense, which we normally would have incurred in the fourth quarter of 2020, shifted into the first quarter of 2021. The weighted average fully diluted share count for the first quarter was 89.1 million shares. The ending fully diluted share count at March 31st was 87.7 million shares. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $157 million compared to $56 million last year. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily driven by EBITDA growth, improved collections and cost avoidance initiatives. 
CapEx for the quarter was $13 million, down 49% year-over-year. Lower CapEx is largely a function of lower real estate investments. 
Free cash flow for the quarter was $145 million, which was up about 360% versus the prior year. Free cash flow growth continues to be an important part of our business model, with modest capital expenditure needs and upfront client payments. Free cash flow as a percent of revenue or free cash flow margin was 22% on a rolling 4-quarter basis, continuing the improvement we've been making over the past few years. Free cash flow is well in excess of both GAAP and adjusted net income. 
At the end of the first quarter, we had $446 million of cash. Our March 31st debt balance was $2 billion. At the end of the first quarter, we had about $1 billion of revolver capacity. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was about 2.2x. We remain very comfortable with our current gross debt level and the corresponding lower leverage multiple. The multiple has reduced predominantly from increased EBITDA. 
Our expected free cash flow generation and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity and cash to deliver on our capital allocation strategy of share repurchases and strategic tuck-in M&A. During the first quarter, we repurchased $398 million in stock at an average price of about $180 per share. In the month of April, we repurchased more than $200 million of our stock. 
At the end of April, the Board increased our share repurchase authorization for the second time this year, adding another $500 million. As of April 30, we have around $790 million available for open market repurchases. We expect the Board will continue to refresh the repurchased authorization as needed going forward. As we continue to repurchase shares, we expect our capital base to shrink going forward. This is accretive to earnings per share and combined with growing profits, also delivers increasing returns on invested capital over time as well. We are updating our full year guidance to reflect Q1 performance and an improved and increased outlook for the remainder of the year. 
For Research, the strong start to the year in CV performance and improvements to nonsubscription revenue are contributing to higher-than-previously-expected research revenue. For Conferences, our guidance is still based on being virtual for the full year. Operationally, we are planning to relaunch in-person Avanta meetings in the third quarter and in-person destination conferences starting in September.
Our guidance includes fixed costs, primarily people and marketing related to both a full year of virtual and a partial year of in-person conferences. We've excluded the variable costs, primarily venue-related associated with in-person conferences from our guidance. If we are able to run in-person conferences, we expect incremental upside to both our revenue and profitability for 2021. 
For Consulting revenues, demand started the year better than we expected and the backlog improved during the first quarter. For expenses, we have reinstated benefits, which were either canceled or deferred in 2020. This includes our annual merit increase, which took effect April 1. We also plan to increase quota-bearing head count in the high single digits for both GTS and GBS by the end of 2021. 
Additionally, we continue to invest in several other programs. The impact of most of these expense restorations or investments impact our P&L starting in the second quarter. 
As you know, travel expenses were close to 0 from April 2020 through March 2021. Our current plans continue to assume a modest ramp-up in travel-related expenses over the course of 2021. Most of this ramp is built into the second half of the year. If travel restrictions remain in place for longer than we've assumed, we'd see expense savings.
For our revenue guidance, we now expect Research revenue of at least $3.935 billion, which is growth of at least 9.2%. We expect Conferences revenue of at least $170 million which is growth of at least 42%. We now expect consulting revenue of at least $400 million, which is growth of at least 6.4%. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $4.5 billion, which is growth of 9.9%. 
Based on current foreign exchange rates and business mix, the consolidated growth includes an FX benefit of about 200 basis points. The year-over-year FX benefit is more pronounced in the first half of the year. 
With the ongoing business momentum we are seeing, we are planning to restore growth spending as we move through the year. We now expect full year adjusted EBITDA of at least $1 billion, which is an increase of about 22.3% versus 2020 and reported margins of at least 22%. This is based on conferences running virtual only. The 18% to 19% expected margins in the back half of the year should provide a reasonable run rate for thinking about the margins going forward as we will have more fully restored costs and resumed growth hiring. 
We expect our full year 2021 adjusted net interest expense to be $102 million. We expect an adjusted tax rate of around 22% for 2021. We now expect 2021 adjusted EPS of at least $6.25. For 2021, we now expect free cash flow of at least $850 million. This is before any insurance proceeds related to 2020 conference cancellations. All the details of our full year guidance are included on our Investor Relations site. 
Finally, we expect to deliver at least $270 million of EBITDA in Q2 of 2021. We expect the second quarter tax rate in the high 20s. 
Looking out over the medium term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged. With 12% to 16% research CV growth, we will deliver double-digit revenue growth. With gross margin expansion, sales cost growing in line with CV growth over time and G&A leverage, we can modestly expand margins from a normalized 2021 level of around 18% to 19%. We can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA because of our modest CapEx needs and the benefits of our clients paying us upfront. We will repurchase shares over time, which will lower the share count as well.
We had a strong start to the year with momentum across the business. We have meaningfully updated our outlook for 2021 to reflect the stronger demand environment and our enhanced visibility. We are restoring certain expenses and investing to ensure we are well positioned to rebound as the economy recovers. We repurchased more than $600 million worth of stock this year through the end of April and remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders.

And so, the first piece of it is there's an incredibly large market opportunity. 
The second piece of it is that we had to get all of the elements that we know that are part of the Gartner formula lined up to fully realize that opportunity. And it's things like training the sales force, we introduced a whole set of products, which, the GxL products, we talked about over time. And the combination of both, getting our sales force up to speed on the kind of Gartner way we sell and getting all the new products introduced and making sure the sales force understood on how to sell them, that has resulted in us getting and implementing all the kind of process improvements that we've used historically and continue to improve. 
You pull all those things together, and that's resulted in GBS accelerating each of the quarters, as we talked about earlier. And so it's a combination of all the sort of applying subtle versions, it's applying the Gartner formula to the GBS market where we have this incredibly huge opportunity."

We have over time, and we continue to be -- if you want to be in the selling field, Gartner is the place to be. And by the way, we've had remote salespeople for a long time. Many, probably -- a large proportion of our field salespeople are actually deployed remotely even before the pandemic. And so we're used to working remotely there. 
The -- we used the opportunity of the pandemic to look at what sales territories were most productive. And our sales headcount did go down a little bit as we looked at areas that we thought that were less productive than we could actually invest better. And if you look at our sales productivity, for 2021, we have plenty of capacity to continue to accelerate the terms of our growth for both GBS and GTS.
Then going forward, as Craig said, during the year, we expect to accelerate our hiring and end the year with high single-digit growth in headcount in both GBS and GTS, which positions us really well for 2022 to continue the growth as we've done in the past."

And as we talked about, earlier, it was a combination of super strong performance on the top line. And underspending versus our estimates, sort of across the board, resulting in very strong EBITDA and very strong EBITDA margins. 
As we look out over the balance of the year, we expect margins in the 18% to 19% range for the balance of the year, for the second half of the year. And we feel like that's a good baseline because we will have fully restored or at least begun -- begin restoring all the expenses that we have been avoiding for the last several quarters that we want to put back in. We will be aggressively adding growth to our sales force in a number of other areas and also investing in key areas that we believe are super important for us to be able to sustain double-digit growth. 
Obviously, moving forward, the business is going to look a little bit different. The P&L is going to look a little bit different than it did pre pandemic. And clearly, our expectations around our ""normal operating margins"", or EBITDA margins, are a lot higher than they were pre pandemic. And that's because of some of the structural changes that you alluded to, Toni, that we are going to fully harvest moving forward. And so those are things like having lower overall travel expenses. We've learned through the pandemic that we do want to travel and we do need to travel but we don't need to spend nearly as much -- or drive as much volume in terms of travel to run our business going forward. 
I think similarly, with facilities, we have the ability now to reallocate and reapportion our facility footprint which means we can really grow into what we currently have and we shouldn't need to meaningfully increase our facilities expenses as we did historically when we added lots of people. We always needed to make sure we grow our facilities. Those are the 2 big ones. 
And then the last thing I would mention, just on your point on the margin side, we are benefiting from a few things there. One is -- and I'll give you the example, is within the marketing practice. And as we told you several quarters ago, we discontinued several low margin products, and the sales team has been focused on replacing them with higher-margin products. And we're seeing that happen in the marketing practice, and we're also seeing that happen in several of our other practices, including GTS as well, which is certainly helping the overall gross margin and overall margin profile as well. 
And then lastly, clearly with GBS growing the way it is, we're adding scale to each of the practices that we serve and support as well, which is clearly helping on the economic and margin front as well."

In addition to that, we are currently in the process of implementing a new CRM system, which we use by sales as well as other people throughout the business. And as we design that system, we know there are a number of opportunities to put capabilities of that system that we believe will enhance sales productivity over time.

There's the old adage about the tough times make you stronger, I think, certainly applies to how we feel about it for us. In the sense that when the pandemic hit last year, it was pretty tough. And so, there were a lot of innovations we tried. We really were -- had the largest set of innovative things that we tried in -- I guess, in the second -- beginning second quarter of last year, things like different kinds of formats for adding value remotely, things like that. And what we found is that the whole wave of innovation has resulted in some learnings. Some stuff didn't work that great. Some stuff worked really, really well, and we're going to continue that -- those things going forward. 
So I think one learning is just that there were a bunch of specific innovations that we came up with. An example of it kind of is very clear is virtual conferences where we didn't have any virtual conferences before. It certainly begs the question going forward. We've learned to be very successful with virtual conferences. Well, when we can go back to in-person, should we continue those virtual conferences as well, which we almost certainly will in different circumstances. 
Similarly, with our products, we learned some ways to add value remotely that we hadn't used before that we will continue to use going forward. We also learned that we need less travel -- as Craig said earlier, we'd probably need less travel than we thought we did before the pandemic. We also -- we've always had a large -- a relatively large share of our workforce working remotely, but for the pandemic, where everybody is working remotely. So again, we developed new work practices that will, I think, improve our productivity going forward for all of our remote workers, even when some of our workers are back in the office. So those are some examples of some of the learnings that we've had from the -- this time we've gone through this pandemic time."

So the strength we saw in the first quarter or the source of the beat, if you will, was a combination of revenue strength which sticks. And also, because a lot of it was CV strength, we get to flow that through now the balance of the year combined with lightness in spending. And we are going to be increasing costs nicely and consistently over the next 3 quarters. 
That said, it's a little bit lighter than what we originally baked into our forecast just based on some of the softness we saw in Q1 and our ability to ramp up as quickly as we want to. So it is definitely a combination of the Q1 overperformance and then extending that through the balance of the year, given the momentum we've seen, not only on the subscription part of the research business, but the nonsubscription part of the research business, the strength we saw in bookings and backlog in the quarter allowed us to increase our consulting outlook. We increased our conferences outlook a little bit as well. So it was strength across the board. 
And I'd say the other big thing is, obviously, getting through the first quarter gave us a lot more visibility into not only what happened in the rearview mirror during the first quarter, but the outlook as well and the combination of all those things gave us the confidence to increase the overall outlook for the year the way you see in our updated guidance."

One is, it's down year-over-year, but we've actually seen nice sequential improvement, particularly from fourth quarter into Q1. If you'll remember, Manav, the way we go to market in GBS is essentially by functional area. And so just because a client might be an HR client, we've got a team that goes in and then tries to convert the finance team and bring them honest clients. And so, we are able to generate really nice growth from existing enterprises because we may only have one function. As clients, we may have 2, we may have 3, we may have 4, and it varies across the board. 
And so, I think, the strength in GBS new business was a combination of new logo growth and expanding within existing client enterprises. But even, again, to understand our point, when we are expanding in client enterprises, it is often like a brand-new client, where they've gone from 0 CV in finance, they become a finance client. And again, it won't increment up necessarily the client enterprise count. 
But again, we did see a nice sequential bump from 4Q into the first quarter and a large portion of that new business strength we saw in GBS in the first quarter could be attributed to brand-new logos."

It gets associated with the -- with the pandemic, but we had actually converted to this way of guiding just prior to the pandemic. 
Yes, I think, we want to guide in ways that we feel that we are very confident that we will be able to achieve that guidance. And the way we've been updating our guidance each quarter over the last several quarters is we analyzed what happened in the most recent quarter. We utilized the enhanced visibility we have from a performance in that quarter and looking forward. And then we flow that through both our top line metrics and on the expense side as well. 
I think, in particular, we were a little cautious entering the year, particularly with thinking about the CV ramp, which drives the bulk of our -- bulk of our revenue for the business. And we had a really strong first quarter from a CV ramp perspective. And the beauty of that is we had some benefit in the first quarter. But the reality is the bulk of that benefit flows through to the balance of the year as we recognize that revenue. And now we've got a view into Q2 pipeline and into Q3 pipeline as well. So we just have that advanced -- enhanced visibility as well. 
And so again, I think, from a guidance perspective, these are numbers that, based on everything we're seeing, based on most recent performance, based on the visibility that we have around subsequent quarters or quarters that are coming up, this is what we believe the business is going to perform at. And that hasn't really changed in terms of our, I'd say, guidance philosophy or guidance methodology. So just given the volatility in the overall selling environment driven by the pandemic, driven by recessions, driven by other things. 
Obviously, the visibility does change or the facts that drive the visibility have been changing very rapidly quarter-to-quarter, and we've been adjusting on that each and every quarter since. And so from where we sit today, the updated guide, while it is significantly higher than what we had guided originally in the year, those are the numbers we feel very confident with."

And then secondly then, within each enterprise, we have a lot of opportunity for additional seats. And it's a little different with GTS and GBS. 
With GTS, if you think about it as being within the technology organizations, those are large organizations, they're growing. And even among our existing clients, there's tremendous growth opportunities. We have products for, obviously, the C level, their direct reports and then on down through to their organization. 
And then if you look at GBS, then you have each of the functions, as Craig mentioned earlier, finance, marketing, sales, legal, et cetera. And each of those functions today, we have very, very low penetration in both enterprises, and we still have the same opportunity to add seats for each of those organizations as well.

Total company revenues were up 16%, with strength in all 3 business segments, and Research exceeding our expectations. We continue to see growth opportunities across industries, geographies and every size enterprise. 
Research is our largest and most profitable segment. Our Research segment serves executives and their teams across all major enterprise functions in every industry around the world. Our market opportunity is vast across all sectors, [indiscernible] and geographies. 
Total contract value growth increased to 11%, with both GTS and GBS accelerating in the quarter. This was driven by strength in both retention and new business. 
Global Technology Sales, or GTS, serves leaders and their teams within IT. For Q2, GTS contract value growth accelerated to 9%, and we have [ CV ] growth in all of our top 10 countries. GTS drove strong growth across virtually all industries, including manufacturing, services and tech and telecom. And we expect GTS contract value growth to continue accelerating, returning to double-digit growth in the future.

So across our entire Research business, we're seeing results of sustained focus and consistent execution of proven practices. We continue to have a vast market opportunity, and our Research business is well positioned as we continue to deliver long-term sustained double-digit growth. 
Turning to Conferences. For the second quarter of 2021, Conferences revenues were $58 million, again exceeding our expectations. As many of you know, during 2020, we were unable to hold in-person conferences. To address this situation, we created virtual conferences to deliver extraordinarily valuable insights to our audiences. We continue to operationally prepare for some in-person conferences in the second half of the year if conditions allow. 
Gartner Consulting is extension of Gartner Research and helps clients execute their most strategic initiatives through deeper, extended project-based work. Consulting revenues were up 4% in Q2. We had strength in our labor-based business, with labor-based revenue up 20% over this time last year. Contract Optimization revenue was down from a record high last year. Overall, Consulting continues to be an important complement to our IT Research business. 
To ensure we keep pace with our accelerating growth rates, we're rapidly growing our recruiting capacity. Our hiring is accelerating. Even in today's tough labor market, candidates see Gartner as a great place for a long-term career. They know we have an incredible impact on our clients, that were a sales-driven growth company and our growth provides among the best promotion and professional development opportunities for all our associates. 
With strong revenues and continued disciplined cost management, EBITDA exceeded expectations. Strong EBITDA, combined with effective cash management, resulted in strong free cash flow. Our priorities for cash flow continue to be strategic, tuck-in acquisitions, like the small one we did this quarter, or repurchases. 
Summarizing. Q2 was another strong quarter, with strength in all 3 business segments and Research exceeding our expectations. We delivered strong results across contract value, revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. Looking ahead, we are well positioned for long-term, sustained double-digit growth. We have a vast addressable market. We have an attractive recurring revenue business model with strong contribution margins. We expect to deliver modest EBITDA margin expansion going forward from a normalized 2021. We generate significant free cash flow in excess of net income, which we'll continue to deploy through share repurchases and strategic tuck-in acquisitions. 
With that, I'll hand the call over to Craig. Craig?"

Second quarter results were excellent, with strength in contract value growth, revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. We are increasing our 2021 guidance to reflect our strong Q2 performance. Second quarter revenue was $1.2 billion, up 20%",2303,"Thank you, gene. Second quarter results were excellent, with strength in contract value growth, revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. We are increasing our 2021 guidance to reflect our strong Q2 performance. 
Second quarter revenue was $1.2 billion, up 20% year-over-year as reported and 16% FX-neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 70%, up more than 300 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA was $355 million, up 85% year-over-year and up 75% FX-neutral. Adjusted EPS was $2.24. 
Free cash flow in the quarter was $563 million. Free cash flow includes $150 million from insurance proceeds related to canceled 2020 conferences. 
Research revenue in the second quarter grew 15% year-over-year as reported and 11% on an FX-neutral basis. We saw strong retention and new business in the quarter. 
Second quarter Research contribution margin was 74%, up about 170 basis points versus 2020. Contribution margins reflect both improved operational effectiveness, continued avoidance of travel expenses and lower-than-planned headcount. However, some of the margin improvement compared to historical levels is temporary and will reverse as we resume normal travel and increased spending to support growth. 
Total contract value grew 11% FX-neutral year-over-year to $3.8 billion at June 30. Quarterly net contract value increase, or NCVI, was $114 million, significantly better than the pandemic lows in the second quarter of last year and a new record high for second quarter NCVI. Quarterly NCVI is a helpful way to measure contract value performance in the quarter even though there is notable seasonality in this metric. 
Global Technology Sales contract value at the end of the second quarter was $3 billion, up 9% versus the prior year. GTS CV increased $75 million from the first quarter. The selling environment continued to improve in the second quarter. By industry, CV growth was led by technology, manufacturing and services. 
Wallet retention for GTS was 101% for the quarter, up about 110 basis points year-over-year. Wallet retention isn't yet fully back to normal because it's a rolling 4-quarter measure. 
GTS new business was up 38% versus last year with strength in new logos and continued improvement in upsell with existing clients. Our regular full set of metrics can be found in our earnings supplement. 
Global Business Sales contract value was $770 million at the end of the second quarter, up 18% year-over-year, which is above the high end of our medium-term outlook of 12% to 16%. 
GBS CV increased $39 million from the first quarter. Broad-based CV growth was led by the health care and technology industries. All of our practices, including marketing, delivered year-over-year and sequential CV growth. HR, finance, sales and supply chain each grew 20% or more year-over-year. Wallet retention for GBS was 110% for the quarter, up more than 950 basis points year-over-year. GBS new business was up 76% over last year, led by very strong growth across the full portfolio. As with GTS, our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in our earnings supplement. 
Conferences revenue for the second quarter was $58 million compared to no revenue in the year ago quarter. Contribution margin in the quarter was 73%, driven by strong top line performance. We held 13 virtual conferences in the quarter. We also held a number of virtual Avanta meetings. 
Second quarter Consulting revenues increased by 9% year-over-year to $106 million. On FX-neutral basis, revenues were up 4%. 
Consulting contribution margin was 40% in the second quarter up almost 600 basis points versus the prior year quarter. 
Labor-based revenues were $86 million, up 25% versus Q2 of last year and up 20% on an FX-neutral basis. Labor-based billable headcount of 740 was down 7%. Utilization was 70%, up more than 1,100 basis points year-over-year. Backlog at June 30 was $108 million, up 7% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis after another strong bookings quarter. 
Our Contract Optimization business was down 31% on a reported basis versus the prior year quarter and down 33% FX-neutral. The prior year period was the highest ever revenue quarter for Contract Optimization. And as we have detailed in the past, this part of the Consulting segment is highly variable. 
Consolidated cost of services increased 9% year-over-year and 6% FX-neutral in the second quarter. Cost of services increased due to the reinstatement of annual merit increases and to support growth in the business. 
SG&A decreased 1% year-over-year and 4% FX-neutral in the second quarter. Compared with the prior year period, SG&A declined due to lower severance and conference-related expenses partially offset by higher personnel costs. [ E&E ] remains close to 0. 
Operating expenses were lower than planned in part because net headcount growth was below our targets. While our rate of hiring continues to ramp up, turnover remains modestly above normal levels due to tighter labor market conditions. As Gene said, we're rapidly growing our recruiting capacity to keep pace with our accelerating growth rates. 
EBITDA for the second quarter was $355 million, up 85% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 75% FX-neutral. Second quarter EBITDA again reflected revenue above the high end and costs towards the low end of our expectations. 
Depreciation in the quarter was up about $3 million versus 2020, reflecting real estate and software, which went into service since the second quarter of last year. 
Net interest expense, excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter was $26 million, roughly flat versus the second quarter of 2020.  
The Q2 adjusted tax rate, which we used for the calculation of adjusted net income, was 29.9% for the quarter. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 24.6% in the quarter. 
Adjusted EPS in Q2 was $2.24. The weighted average fully diluted share count for the second quarter was 86.6 million shares. We exited the second quarter with 85.1 million fully diluted shares. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $575 million, up 68% compared to last year. Q2 operating cash flow includes $150 million of proceeds from insurance related to 2020 conference cancellations. Excluding the insurance proceeds, operating cash flow improved by 24% versus the prior year quarter. Cash flow strength continues to be driven by EBITDA growth and improved collections. 
CapEx for the quarter was $12 million, down 44% year-over-year. Lower CapEx is largely a function of lower real estate investments. 
Free cash flow for the quarter was $563 million, which was up about 75% versus the prior year. Excluding the insurance proceeds, free cash flow improved by 28% versus the prior year quarter. Free cash flow growth continues to be an important part of our business model with modest capital expenditure needs and upfront client payments. Free cash flow as a percent of revenue or free cash flow margin was 27% on a rolling 4-quarter basis. Excluding the insurance proceeds, free cash flow was 23% of revenue, continuing the improvement we've been making over the past few years. Free cash flow was well in excess of both GAAP and adjusted net income. 
At the end of the second quarter, we had $796 million of cash. 
During the quarter, we issued $600 million of new 8-year senior unsecured notes with a 3 5/8% coupon. We used the proceeds from this new issuance to repay $100 million of the existing term loan A. The balance is available for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases. 
Our June 30 debt balance was $2.5 billion. At the end of the second quarter, we had about $1 billion of revolver capacity. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was about 2.3x. 
Our expected free cash flow generation and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity and cash to deliver on our capital allocation strategy of share repurchases and strategic tuck-in M&A. 
During the quarter, we made a small acquisition with net cash paid at closing of $23 million. 
Year-to-date, we have repurchased more than $1 billion in stock, including $685 million during the second quarter. In July, the Board increased our share repurchase authorization for the third time this year, adding another $800 million. As of August 1, we have more than $1 billion available for share repurchases. We expect the Board will continue to refresh the repurchase authorization as needed. 
As we continue to repurchase shares, we expect our capital base [indiscernible]. This is accretive to earnings per share and, combined with growing profits, also delivers increasing returns on invested capital over time. 
We are updating our full year guidance to reflect Q2 performance and an improved and increased outlook for the remainder of the year. 
For Research, the strong start to the year in CV performance and improvements in nonsubscription revenue are contributing to higher-than-previously-expected Research revenue. 
For Conferences, our guidance is still based on being virtual for the full year. With the uptick in COVID and shifting government directives, there is much more uncertainty around our ability to run in-person conferences during the balance of the year. We continue to operationally plan for some in-person conferences. Our updated guidance reflects some additional cancellation-related costs for conferences where we have been planning to run in-person but may need to cancel. If we are able to run in-person conferences, we expect incremental upside to both our revenue and profitability for 2021. 
For expenses, we have reinstated benefits which were either canceled or deferred in 2020. This includes our annual merit increase, which took effect April 1. 
We are investing in expanding our recruiting capacity, drive additional hiring across the business. The additional hiring will continue into 2022 and beyond to support current and future growth. Our current plan is to increase quota-bearing headcount in the mid-single digits for GTS and low double digits for GBS by the end of 2021. Additionally, we continue to invest in a number of programs with a focus on improving sales productivity. 
As you know, travel expenses were close to 0 from April 2020 through June 2021. Our current plans continue to assume a ramp-up in travel-related expenses over the course of the rest of this year, weighted more to the fourth quarter. If travel restrictions remain in place for longer than we've assumed, we'd see expense savings. 
For our revenue guidance, we now expect Research revenue of at least $4 billion, which is a growth of 11%. We still expect Conferences revenue of at least $170 million, which is growth of 41%. We still expect Consulting revenue of at least $400 million, which is a growth of 6%. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $4.57 billion, which is growth of 11%. Based on current foreign exchange rates and business mix, the consolidated growth includes an FX benefit of about 200 basis points. The year-over-year FX benefit was more pronounced in the first half of the year. With the ongoing business momentum we are seeing, we will continue to restore growth spending as we move through the year. 
We now expect full year adjusted EBITDA of at least $1.16 billion, which is an increase of about 42% versus 2020 and reflects reported margins of 25.4%. We expect a reasonable baseline for thinking about the margins going forward is around 18% to 19%, consistent with our comments last quarter. We expect our full year 2021 adjusted net interest expense to be $113 million. 
Looking out to 2022, as the balance sheet stands today, we expect interest expense to be around $115 million. 
We expect an adjusted tax rate of around 22% for 2021. 
We now expect 2021 adjusted EPS of at least $7.60. 
For 2021, we now expect free cash flow of at least $1.13 billion. This includes the $150 million of insurance proceeds received in the second quarter of this year. All the details of our full year guidance are included on our Investor Relations site. 
Turning to the second half of the year. For Research, we have more visibility into revenue the farther we get into the year. This is because NCVI earlier in the year has more of an effect on the full year revenue. Seasonally, Conferences and Consulting are also both typically lighter in Q3. Finally, at the start of 2021, there was a lot of uncertainty in the world, and we began with a prudently conservative plan. More than halfway through the year and with less macro uncertainty, there's a lower likelihood of the kind of upside we've seen in the past few quarters. As a result, we expect reported numbers to be closer to our guidance than earlier in the year. Any upside is more likely to come from lower cost and higher revenue. 
For Q3, we expect to deliver at least $250 million of EBITDA. We also expect the tax rate for the quarter in the high 20s. 
Looking out over the medium term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged. With 12% to 16% Research CV growth, we will deliver double-digit revenue growth. With gross margin expansion, sales costs growing in line with CV growth over time and G&A leverage, we can modestly expand margins from a normalized 2021 level of around 18% to 19%. We can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA because of our modest CapEx needs and the benefits of our clients paying us upfront. We will repurchase shares over time, which will lower the share count. 
We had a strong first half with momentum across the business. We have meaningfully updated our outlook for 2021 to reflect the stronger demand environment and our enhanced visibility. We are restoring certain expenses and investing to ensure we are well positioned to continue our momentum. We repurchased more than $1 billion worth of stock this year, and we remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders.

And so we have a large number of what we call account executives whose job is to sell more business to those existing clients. In GTS, we also have the business developers. But in GBS, we have a much higher number of business developers compared to account executives than we do at GTS. That's part of the thing that helps -- that impact sales productivity with GBS, both now and over time."

[ Yet ], as Gary highlighted as well, it's a little bit higher than the 18% to 19% that we've guided or at least preliminarily guided around how to think about a normalized margin for this year. And there's really 1 primary reason for that. And it's the deferral and the pushing out of spending that we expected to come in sooner just happening a little bit later over the course of 2021, but I was assuming we bear the full burden of that as the business continues to accelerate into 2022. And so a little bit higher than the 18% to 19% is the expectation for the second half of the year. But again, that's largely because we've pushed out and deferred certain expenses to later in this year, but will have a full impact on the 2022 P&L."

But the sentiment as of just right now in terms of registrations, things, hasn't changed very much. Outside of the U.S., I'd say there is more concern about it. And so it's not the same around the world. 
Having said that, even there's a concern about the Delta variant, the kind of underlying demand there, even the clients that are concerned about the Delta variant in terms of [indiscernible] conference, if we can address that, are wildly enthusiastic about conferences and really want to return back to them.

Given what we see in the market, clearly, in the first half of this year, we put a bias or a priority around returning capital through our buyback programs. But as we move forward, we have ample free cash flow, ample cash on balance sheet, ample balance sheet flexibility for it to be an and.

We significantly increased the pace of our buybacks.",653,"Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Gartner's positive momentum continued in the second quarter of 2021. We again delivered strong results across contract value, revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. We significantly increased the pace of our buybacks. 
Total company revenues were up 16%, with strength in all 3 business segments, and research exceeding our expectations. We continue to see growth opportunities across industries, geographies and every size enterprise. 
Research is our largest and most profitable segment. Our research segment serves executives and their teams across all major enterprise functions in every industry around the world. Our market opportunity is vast across all sectors, sizes and geographies. 
Total contract value growth increased 11%, with both GTS and GBS accelerating in the quarter. This was driven by strength in both retention and new business. 
Global Technology Sales, or GTS, serves leaders and their teams within IT. For Q2, GTS contract value growth accelerated to 9%, and we have CV growth in all of our top 10 countries. GTS drove strong growth across virtually all industries, including manufacturing, services and tech and telecom. And we expect GTS contract value growth to continue accelerating, returning to double-digit growth in the future. 
Global Business Sales, or GBS, serves leaders and their teams beyond IT. This includes HR, supply chain, finance, marketing, sales, legal and more. GBS again accelerated, delivering outstanding contract value growth of 18%. All practices contributed to our growth. And our HR, finance, sales and supply chain practices each exceeded 20% contract value growth.
So across our entire research business, we're seeing the results of sustained focus and consistent execution of proven practices. We continue to have a vast market opportunity, and our research business is well positioned as we continue to deliver long-term, sustained double-digit growth.
Turning to conferences. For the second quarter of 2021, conferences revenues were $58 million, again exceeding our expectations. As many of you know, during 2020, we were unable to hold in-person conferences. To address this situation, we created virtual conferences to deliver extraordinarily valuable insights to our audiences. We continue to operationally prepare for some in-person conferences in the second half of the year if conditions allow.
Gartner Consulting is the extension of Gartner Research and helps clients execute their most strategic initiatives through deeper, extended project-based work. Consulting revenues were up 4% in Q2. We had strength in our labor-based business, with labor-based revenue up 20% over this time last year. Contract optimization revenue was down from a record high last year. Overall, consulting continues to be an important complement to our IT research business. 
To ensure we keep pace with our accelerating growth rates, we're rapidly growing our recruiting capacity. Our hiring is accelerating. Even in today's tough labor market, candidates see Gartner as a great place for a long-term career. They know we have an incredible impact on our clients, that we're a sales-driven growth company and our growth provides among the best promotion and professional development opportunities for all our associates. 
With strong revenues and continued disciplined cost management, EBITDA exceeded expectations. Strong EBITDA, combined with effective cash management, resulted in strong free cash flow. Our priorities for cash flow continue to be strategic, tuck-in acquisitions, like the small one we did this quarter, and repurchases. 
Summarizing. Q2 was another strong quarter, with strength in all 3 business segments and research exceeding our expectations. We delivered strong results across contract value, revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. Looking ahead, we are well positioned for long-term, sustained, double-digit growth. We have a vast addressable market. We have an attractive, recurring revenue business model with strong contribution margins. We expect to deliver modest EBITDA margin expansion going forward from a normalized 2021. We generate significant free cash flow in excess of net income, which we'll continue to deploy through share repurchases and strategic tuck-in acquisitions.
With that, I'll hand the call over to Craig. Craig?"
130705,1674572188,2360750,"Gartner, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2021",2021-08-03,"Earnings Calls","Gartner, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gene, and good morning. Second quarter results were excellent with strength in contract value growth, revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. We are increasing our 2021 guidance to reflect our strong Q2 performance. Second quarter revenue was $1.",2304,"Thank you, Gene, and good morning. Second quarter results were excellent with strength in contract value growth, revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. We are increasing our 2021 guidance to reflect our strong Q2 performance. 
Second quarter revenue was $1.2 billion, up 20% year-over-year as reported and 16% FX-neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 70%, up more than 300 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA was $355 million, up 85% year-over-year and up 75% FX-neutral. Adjusted EPS was $2.24. Free cash flow in the quarter was $563 million. Free cash flow includes $150 million from insurance proceeds related to canceled 2020 conferences. 
Research revenue in the second quarter grew 15% year-over-year as reported and 11% on an FX-neutral basis. We saw strong retention and new business in the quarter. Second quarter research contribution margin was 74%, up about 170 basis points versus 2020. Contribution margins reflect both improved operational effectiveness, continued avoidance of travel expenses and lower-than-planned headcount. However, some of the margin improvement compared to historical levels is temporary and will reverse as we resume normal travel and increased spending to support growth. 
Total contract value grew 11% FX-neutral year-over-year to $3.8 billion at June 30. Quarterly net contract value increase, or NCVI, was $114 million, significantly better than the pandemic lows in the second quarter of last year and a new record high for second quarter NCVI. Quarterly NCVI is a helpful way to measure contract value performance in the quarter even though there is notable seasonality in this metric.
Global Technology Sales contract value at the end of the second quarter was $3 billion, up 9% versus the prior year. GTS CV increased $75 million from the first quarter. The selling environment continued to improve in the second quarter. By industry, CV growth was led by technology, manufacturing and services. 
Wallet retention for GTS was 101% for the quarter, up about 110 basis points year-over-year. Wallet retention isn't yet fully back to normal because it's a rolling 4-quarter measure. GTS new business was up 38% versus last year with strength in new logos and continued improvement in upsell with existing clients. Our regular full set of metrics can be found in our earnings supplement. 
Global Business Sales contract value was $770 million at the end of the second quarter, up 18% year-over-year, which is above the high end of our medium-term outlook of 12% to 16%. GBS CV increased $39 million from the first quarter. Broad-based CV growth was led by the health care and technology industries. All of our practices, including marketing, delivered year-over-year and sequential CV growth. HR, finance, sales and supply chain each grew 20% or more year-over-year. 
Wallet retention for GBS was 110% for the quarter, up more than 950 basis points year-over-year. GBS new business was up 76% over last year, led by very strong growth across the full portfolio. As with GTS, our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in our earnings supplement. 
Conferences revenue for the second quarter was $58 million compared to no revenue in the year ago quarter. Contribution margin in the quarter was 73%, driven by strong top line performance. We held 13 virtual conferences in the quarter. We also held a number of virtual Evanta meetings. 
Second quarter consulting revenues increased by 9% year-over-year to $106 million. On an FX-neutral basis, revenues were up 4%. Consulting contribution margin was 40% in the second quarter up almost 600 basis points versus the prior year quarter. 
Labor-based revenues were $86 million, up 25% versus Q2 of last year and up 20% on an FX-neutral basis. Labor-based billable headcount of $740 million was down 7%. Utilization was 70%, up more than 1,100 basis points year-over-year. Backlog at June 30 was $108 million, up 7% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis after another strong bookings quarter. 
Our contract optimization business was down 31% on a reported basis versus the prior year quarter and down 33% FX-neutral. The prior year period was the highest ever revenue quarter for contract optimization. And as we have detailed in the past, this part of the consulting segment is highly variable. 
Consolidated cost of services increased 9% year-over-year and 6% FX-neutral in the second quarter. Cost of services increased due to the reinstatement of annual merit increases and to support growth in the business. 
SG&A decreased 1% year-over-year and 4% FX-neutral in the second quarter. Compared with the prior year period, SG&A declined due to lower severance and conference-related expenses partially offset by higher personnel costs. T&E remains close to 0. 
Operating expenses were lower than planned, in part because net headcount growth was below our targets. While our rate of hiring continues to ramp up, turnover remains modestly above normal levels due to tighter labor market conditions. As Gene said, we're rapidly growing our recruiting capacity to keep pace with our accelerating growth rates.
EBITDA for the second quarter was $355 million, up 85% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 75% FX-neutral. Second quarter EBITDA again reflected revenue above the high end and costs towards the low end of our expectations. 
Depreciation in the quarter was up about $3 million versus 2020, reflecting real estate and software, which went into service since the second quarter of last year. Net interest expense, excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter was $26 million, roughly flat versus the second quarter of 2020.
The Q2 adjusted tax rate, which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income, was 29.9% for the quarter. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 24.6% in the quarter. Adjusted EPS in Q2 was $2.24. The weighted average fully diluted share count for the second quarter was 86.6 million shares. We exited the second quarter with 85.1 million fully diluted shares. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $575 million, up 68% compared to last year. Q2 operating cash flow includes $150 million of proceeds from insurance related to 2020 conference cancellations. Excluding the insurance proceeds, operating cash flow improved by 24% versus the prior year quarter. Cash flow strength continues to be driven by EBITDA growth and improved collections. CapEx for the quarter was $12 million, down 44% year-over-year. Lower CapEx is largely a function of lower real estate investments. 
Free cash flow for the quarter was $563 million, which was up about 75% versus the prior year. Excluding the insurance proceeds, free cash flow improved by 28% versus the prior year quarter. Free cash flow growth continues to be an important part of our business model, with modest capital expenditure needs and upfront client payments. Free cash flow as a percent of revenue or free cash flow margin was 27% on a rolling 4-quarter basis. Excluding the insurance proceeds, free cash flow was 23% of revenue, continuing the improvement we've been making over the past few years. Free cash flow was well in excess of both GAAP and adjusted net income. At the end of the second quarter, we had $796 million of cash. 
During the quarter, we issued $600 million of new 8-year senior unsecured notes with a 3 5/8% coupon. We used the proceeds from this new issuance to repay $100 million of the existing term loan A. The balance is available for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases. 
Our June 30 debt balance was $2.5 billion. At the end of the second quarter, we had about $1 billion of revolver capacity. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was about 2.3x. 
Our expected free cash flow generation and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity and cash to deliver on our capital allocation strategy of share repurchases and strategic tuck-in M&A. During the quarter, we made a small acquisition with net cash paid at closing of $23 million. 
Year-to-date, we have repurchased more than $1 billion in stock, including $685 million during the second quarter. In July, the Board increased our share repurchase authorization for the third time this year, adding another $800 million. As of August 1, we have more than $1 billion available for share repurchases. We expect the Board will continue to refresh the repurchase authorization as needed. As we continue to repurchase shares, we expect our capital base will shrink. This is accretive to earnings per share and combined with growing profits, also delivers increasing returns on invested capital over time. 
We are updating our full year guidance to reflect Q2 performance and an improved and increased outlook for the remainder of the year. For research, the strong start to the year in CV performance and improvements in nonsubscription revenue are contributing to higher-than-previously-expected research revenue. 
For conferences, our guidance is still based on being virtual for the full year. With the uptick in COVID and shifting government directives, there is much more uncertainty around our ability to run in-person conferences during the balance of the year. We continue to operationally plan for some in-person conferences. Our updated guidance reflects some additional cancellation-related costs for conferences where we have been planning to run in-person but may need to cancel. If we are able to run in-person conferences, we expect incremental upside to both our revenue and profitability for 2021. 
For expenses, we have reinstated benefits which were either canceled or deferred in 2020. This includes our annual merit increase, which took effect April 1. We are investing in expanding our recruiting capacity, drive additional hiring across the business. The additional hiring will continue into 2022 and beyond to support current and future growth. Our current plan is to increase quota-bearing headcount in the mid-single digits for GTS and low double digits for GBS by the end of 2021. Additionally, we continue to invest in a number of programs with a focus on improving sales productivity.
As you know, travel expenses were close to 0 from April 2020 through June 2021. Our current plans continue to assume a ramp-up in travel-related expenses over the course of the rest of this year, weighted more to the fourth quarter. If travel restrictions remain in place for longer than we've assumed, we'd see expense savings.
For our revenue guidance, we now expect research revenue of at least $4 billion, which is growth of 11%. We still expect conferences revenue of at least $170 million, which is growth of 41%. We still expect consulting revenue of at least $400 million, which is growth of 6%. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $4.57 billion, which is growth of 11%. Based on current foreign exchange rates and business mix, the consolidated growth includes an FX benefit of about 200 basis points. The year-over-year FX benefit was more pronounced in the first half of the year. 
With the ongoing business momentum we are seeing, we will continue to restore growth spending as we move through the year. We now expect full year adjusted EBITDA of at least $1.16 billion, which is an increase of about 42% versus 2020 and reflects reported margins of 25.4%. We expect a reasonable baseline for thinking about the margins going forward is around 18% to 19%, consistent with our comments last quarter. We expect our full year 2021 adjusted net interest expense to be $113 million. Looking out to 2022, as the balance sheet stands today, we expect interest expense to be around $115 million. 
We expect an adjusted tax rate of around 22% for 2021. We now expect 2021 adjusted EPS of at least $7.60. For 2021, we now expect free cash flow of at least $1.13 billion. This includes the $150 million of insurance proceeds received in the second quarter of this year. All the details of our full year guidance are included on our Investor Relations site. 
Turning to the second half of the year. For research, we have more visibility into revenue the farther we get into the year. This is because NCVI earlier in the year has more of an effect on the full year revenue. Seasonally, conferences and consulting are also both typically lighter in Q3. 
Finally, at the start of 2021, there was a lot of uncertainty in the world and we began with a prudently conservative plan. More than halfway through the year and with less macro uncertainty, there's a lower likelihood of the kind of upside we've seen in the past few quarters. As a result, we expect reported numbers to be closer to our guidance than earlier in the year. Any upside is more likely to come from lower cost and higher revenue. For Q3, we expect to deliver at least $250 million of EBITDA. We also expect the tax rate for the quarter in the high 20s. 
Looking out over the medium term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged. With 12% to 16% research CV growth, we will deliver double-digit revenue growth. With gross margin expansion, sales costs growing in line with CV growth over time and G&A leverage, we can modestly expand margins from a normalized 2021 level of around 18% to 19%. We can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA because of our modest CapEx needs and the benefits of our clients paying us upfront. We will repurchase shares over time, which will lower the share count. 
We had a strong first half with momentum across the business. We have meaningfully updated our outlook for 2021 to reflect the stronger demand environment and our enhanced visibility. We are restoring certain expenses and investing to ensure we are well positioned to continue our momentum. We repurchased more than $1 billion worth of stock this year and remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders.

GTS has a much larger installed base. And so we have a large number of what we call account executives, whose job is to sell more business to those existing clients. In GTS, we also have the business developers. But in GBS, we have a much higher number of business developers compared to account executives than we do at GTS.

And there's really one primary reason for that. And it's the deferral and the pushing out of spending that we expected to come in sooner just happening a little bit later over the course of 2021. But I was assuming we bear the full burden of that as the business continues to accelerate into 2022. And so a little bit higher than the 18% to 19% is the expectation for the second half of the year.

And so it's not the same around the world. 
Having said that, even there's a concern about the Delta variant, the kind of underlying demand there, even the clients that are concerned about the Delta variant in terms of attending a conference, if we can address that, are wildly enthusiastic about conferences and really want to return back to them.

As we look forward, those remain the 2 priorities. 
Given what we see in the market, clearly, in the first half of this year, we put a bias or a priority around returning capital through our buyback programs. But as we move forward, we have ample free cash flow, ample cash on balance sheet, ample balance sheet flexibility for it to be an and.

Our growth increased again in the third quarter. We're performing well across the business. We delivered strong performances in contract value, revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. Total company revenues were up 15%",722,"Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Our growth increased again in the third quarter. We're performing well across the business. We delivered strong performances in contract value, revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. Total company revenues were up 15% in Q3 with continued momentum across all 3 of our business segments. We also repurchased another $355 million of stock in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total through October to $1.6 billion. And we're thriving in the current environment. 
Research continues to be our largest and most profitable segment. Our Research segment provides actionable objective insight to executives and their teams. We serve leaders across all major enterprise functions in every industry around the world. Our market opportunity is vast across all sectors, sizes and geographies. And we're delivering more value than ever. 
Everywhere around the world, our clients are facing more issues than ever before, challenging issues, things like the future of work, cybersecurity, carbon footprint, digital business, diversity, equity and inclusion, cloud and more. Our research is closely aligned to our clients' priorities. 
We recently launched a new sustainability resource center that provides clients and prospects with actual insights on sustainable business strategy. Total research contract value growth increased to 14% with acceleration in both GTS and GBS, driven by strong execution in both retention and new business. 
Global Technology Sales, or GTS, returned to double-digit growth. GTS contract value growth accelerated to 12%. We expect GTS would deliver long-term, sustained, double-digit contract value growth. 
Global Business Sales, or GBS, delivered another outstanding quarter with contract value growth of 22%. All practices across GBS drove double-digit contract value growth. Across our entire Research business, we're driving consistent execution of proven practices, and we continue to see the results of our efforts. 
Our Conferences business also continues to deliver excellent performance. In 2020, we developed an entirely new conferences business model. This model leverages virtual conferences to deliver extraordinarily valuable insights to our audiences. We delivered a strong performance in Conferences. For the third quarter of 2021, Conferences revenues were $24 million Total attendee numbers were up in Q3 as we're increasing our reach through our valuable content. 
There's a large constituency of our clients and prospects who prefer in-person conferences. We've recently held some in-person event events, which were very well received. As conditions continue to stabilize, we are operationally prepared to return to in-person conferences where and when we can. We'll continue to leverage our profitable virtual conferences as appropriate. 
Gartner Consulting is an extension of Gartner Research. Consulting helps clients execute their most strategic initiatives through deeper, extended, project-based work. Consulting is an important complement to our IT research business. Consulting revenues grew 6% in Q3. So overall, we're performing really well as a company. 
We're thriving at our current environment. We're able to serve our clients and sell the prospects very effectively in a virtual environment. Most of our associates appreciate working virtually. They would like some in-person interactions with their colleagues when that's the best way to engage with each other and get work done. We've created an operating model that supports virtual and in-person interactions. And this gives our associates flexibility while promoting activities that drive associate engagement. 
We've also ramped up our recruiting function to support long-term, sustained double-digit growth. We're seeing great success in hiring during one of the toughest labor markets ever. Finally, we're taking steps to make the associate experience at Gartner even better. We're a growth company. We're focused on ensuring our associates have clear and compelling career paths. We're helping our managers and leaders have powerful career development conversations with their teams. We continue to improve on our proven practices, and we're innovating processes and technology to streamline operations. 
In closing, Gartner delivered another strong performance in Q3. We're performing well across all 3 of our business segments. We delivered strong performances in contract value, revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow, and we repurchased another $355 million of stock in the quarter. We continue to get better, faster, stronger as a company. Gartner is a great place to be for our associates. We deliver extraordinary value to our current clients. We provide outstanding returns for our shareholders, and we're thriving in the current environment. 
With that, I'll hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Safian. Craig?"
130705,1685550179,2420977,"Gartner, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 02, 2021",2021-11-02,"Earnings Calls","Gartner, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Gene, and good morning. Third quarter results were again excellent with acceleration in contract value growth and strength in revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. We are increasing our 2021 guidance to reflect our strong Q3 performance. Third",1861,"Thank you, Gene, and good morning. Third quarter results were again excellent with acceleration in contract value growth and strength in revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. We are increasing our 2021 guidance to reflect our strong Q3 performance. 
Third quarter revenue was $1.2 billion, up 16% year-over-year as reported and 15% FX neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 69%, up more than 200 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA was $305 million, up 82% year-over-year and up 80% FX neutral. Adjusted EPS was $2.03, and free cash flow in the quarter was $331 million. 
Research revenue in the third quarter grew 16% year-over-year as reported and 15% on an FX-neutral basis. We drove both strong retention and new business in the quarter. Third quarter research contribution margin was 74%, up over 200 basis points versus 2020. Higher-than-normal contribution margins reflect improved operational effectiveness, continued avoidance of travel expenses and lower-than-planned headcount. 
Total contract value grew 14% FX neutral year-over-year to $4 billion at September 30. Quarterly net contract value increase, or NCVI, was a very strong $146 million. Quarterly NCVI is a helpful way to measure contract value performance in the quarter even though there is notable seasonality in this metric. 
Global Technology Sales contract value was $3.2 billion at the end of the third quarter, up almost 12% versus the prior year. GTS CV increased $102 million from the second quarter. CV growth was led by the technology, manufacturing and retail industries. While retention for GTS was 104% for the quarter, up 490 basis points year-over-year. GTS new business was up 25% versus last year with strong growth in new logos and expansion with existing client enterprises. 
GTS quota-bearing headcount increased from the second quarter. We are beginning to see the positive effects of our investments to ramp up recruiting capacity. We continue to be successful in recruiting new salespeople. Turnover among GTS frontline sellers is stable at the modestly elevated range we saw in the second quarter. With increased recruiting capacity and stable turnover, we expect to see continued expansion of the GTS sales team in Q4 and into 2022 and beyond. Our regular full set of metrics can be found in our earnings supplement. 
Global Business Sales contract value was $814 million at the end of the third quarter, up 22% year-over-year, which is above the high end of our medium-term outlook of 12% to 16%. GBS CV increased $43 million from the second quarter. Broad-based CV growth included particular strength in the health care, technology and services industries. All of our GBS practices achieved double-digit growth rates with the majority growing more than 20% year-over-year. Growth in the third quarter was led by the supply chain, HR and sales practices. While retention for GBS was 113% for the quarter, up more than 14 percentage points year-over-year. 
GBS new business was up 38% compared to last year, reflecting strong growth across the full portfolio. GBS quota-bearing headcount increased sequentially and is up 8% year-over-year. As with GTS, our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in our earnings supplement. 
Conferences revenue for the third quarter was $24 million with reported growth of 92% and 93% FX neutral. Contribution margin in the quarter was 47%. We held 8 virtual conferences in the quarter. We also held a number of virtual Evanta meetings. We were able to reintroduce in-person of Evanta meetings in the quarter and plan to ramp those up in Q4. Attendance is up significantly year-over-year as we've launched more virtual conferences to cover additional roles. 
Third quarter Consulting revenues increased by 6% year-over-year to $95 million. On an FX-neutral basis, revenues were also up 6%. Consulting contribution margin was 33% in the third quarter, up more than 110 basis points versus the prior year quarter. 
Labor-based revenues were $78 million, up 5% versus Q3 of last year and up 4% on an FX-neutral basis. Labor-based billable headcount of 749 was up 2%. Utilization was 62%, up more than 130 basis points year-over-year. Backlog at September 30 was $126 million, increasing 27% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis after another strong bookings quarter. 
Our Contract Optimization business was up 13% on a reported basis versus the prior year quarter and up 12% FX neutral. As we have detailed in the past, this part of the Consulting segment is highly valuable. Consolidated cost of services increased 9% year-over-year and 8% FX neutral in the third quarter. SG&A decreased 2% year-over-year and 3% FX neutral in the third quarter. The year-over-year decline is largely related to the timing of certain prior year expenses. We expect SG&A expenses to increase over time as our hiring across the business continues to ramp. 
Total operating expenses were lower than planned because conferences continue to be virtual. We're resuming business travel and reopening offices at a very deliberate pace. And we are still ramping up our net growth hiring to our target levels. 
EBITDA for the third quarter was $305 million, up 82% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 80% FX neutral. Third quarter EBITDA again reflected revenue above the high end and costs towards the low end of our expectations. Depreciation in the quarter was up about $3 million versus 2020, reflecting real estate and software, which went into service since the third quarter of last year. Net interest expense, excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter, was $30 million, up slightly versus the third quarter of 2020 due to an increase in total debt balances. 
The Q3 adjusted tax rate, which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income, was 25.2% for the quarter. The tax rate for the items used to adjusted net income was 25.4% in the quarter. Adjusted EPS in Q3 was $2.03. The weighted average fully diluted share count for the third quarter was 84.8 million shares. We exited the quarter with 84.2 million fully diluted shares. 
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $345 million, up 41% compared to last year. Cash flow strength continues to be driven by EBITDA growth and improved collections. CapEx for the quarter was $14 million, down 5% year-over-year. Lower CapEx is largely a function of lower real estate investments. 
Free cash flow for the quarter was $331 million. Free cash flow growth continues to be an important part of our business model with modest capital expenditure needs and upfront client payments. Free cash flow as a percent of revenue or free cash flow margin was 25% on a rolling 4-quarter basis adjusted for the $150 million of insurance proceeds received in the second quarter. Free cash flow is well in excess of both GAAP and adjusted net income. 
At the end of the third quarter, we had $766 million of cash. Our September 30 debt balance was $2.5 billion. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was about 2x. Our expected free cash flow generation and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity to deliver on our capital allocation strategy of share repurchases and strategic tuck-in M&A. 
Through the end of October, we have repurchased more than $1.6 billion in stock this year, including $355 million during the third quarter. Year-to-date, we have repurchased over 7 million shares, reducing our net share count by around 7%. As of November 1, we have around $600 million remaining on our repurchase authorization, which we expect the board will refresh as needed. 
As we continue to repurchase shares, we expect our capital base will shrink. This is accretive to earnings per share and, combined with growing profits, also delivers increasing returns on invested capital over time. We are updating our full year guidance to reflect Q3 performance and an improved and increased outlook for the remainder of the year. 
For revenue guidance, we now expect research revenue of at least $4.07 billion, which is a growth of 13%. We now expect conferences revenue of at least $190 million, which is a growth of 58%. We still expect Consulting revenue of at least $400 million, which is a growth of 6%. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $4.66 billion, which is a growth of 14%. 
Based on current foreign exchange rates and business mix, the consolidated growth includes an FX benefit of about 190 basis points. This reflects modest headwinds from FX in the fourth quarter. For expenses, we are investing in expanding our recurring capacity to drive additional hiring across the entire business, including our sales teams. The additional hiring will continue into 2022 and beyond to support current and future growth. We plan to exit the year with quota-bearing headcount about flat for GTS. We expect low double-digit growth for GBS by the end of 2021. Additionally, we continue to invest in a number of programs with a focus on improving sales productivity and cost effectiveness. We are also incurring some conference cancellation fees in the fourth quarter and are in the process of reopening dozens of offices as well. 
We now expect full year adjusted EBITDA of at least $1.26 billion, which is an increase of about 54% versus 2020 and reflects reported margins of 27%. Consistent with our comments last quarter, we estimate that the normalized 2021 margins would be around 19% if this had been a more typical year. About 2/3 of the adjustments are headcount related with most of the rest from travel and real estate. We expect our full year 2021 adjusted net interest expense to be $113 million. 
Looking out to 2022, as the balance sheet stands today, we expect interest expense to be around $115 million. We expect an adjusted tax rate of around 22% for 2021. We now expect 2021 adjusted EPS of at least $8.54. For 2021, we now expect free cash flow of at least $1.225 billion. This includes the $150 million of insurance proceeds received in the second quarter of this year. All the details of our full year guidance are included on our Investor Relations site. 
We had a strong third quarter with momentum across the business. Contract value growth accelerated and we had very strong revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow in the quarter. We've put our capital to work, repurchasing more than $1.6 billion worth of our stock this year through the end of October. And we've updated our guidance to reflect continuing strength and momentum in the business. 
Looking out over the medium term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged. With 12% to 16% Research CV growth, we will deliver double-digit revenue growth. With gross margin expansion, sales costs growing in line with CV growth over time and G&A leverage, we can modestly expand margins from a normalized 2021 level of around 19%. We can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA because of our modest CapEx needs and the benefits of our clients paying us upfront. And we'll continue to deploy our capital on share repurchases, which lower the share count over time and strategic value-enhancing tuck-in M&A. 
With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator?"

In parallel with that, as I mentioned on the call, Craig did as well, we have initiatives underway to ramp up our recruiting capacity output. And we're finding actually we have a great value proposition. It's very attractive to the market. And so we're quite optimistic about our ability to ramp up hiring as we need to leverage productivity in the meantime."

I think, number one, seeing the pickup in wallet retention is certainly a very positive trend, which we anticipated, and as we've looked at the amount of up-sell and expansion that we're driving within existing client enterprises, we're back to normal levels. And that wallet retention is strong. It's not quite back to historical levels, but we feel really good about the level of expansion we're driving within existing enterprises again. Some of that is win back. Some of that is organic growth activities within existing enterprises. But the wallet is pretty strong. 
I think on the enterprise count and enterprise growth, we've seen now a few quarters of enterprise is expanding. And as you'd expect, when a new enterprise comes in, it comes in at a lower CV level than our overall average. And so the net enterprise adds that we've been doing will suppress a little bit or mute a little bit the CV per enterprise that you see. But what you're seeing actually is both levers working really well for the last several quarters, particularly in the third quarter, with that expansion with the existing enterprises showing up in the wallet retention number and the number of enterprise is growing nicely as well."

I know last quarter, you talked about having to ramp up recruiting capacity to deliver on that. But how much is the tight labor market impacting the pace at which you bring people back? And what's the risk in the next 6 months that you continue to have sort of sluggish additions? How do we think about that? And when would that impact revenue growth in the segment if you don't get that up towards high single digits or whatever you're targeting?"

First, it is a highly competitive labor market. And so our turnover is up modestly. And of course, they're within that modestly higher turnover, there are pockets that are higher -- they're higher than last turnover. But overall, it's honestly up. And we recognize that. And we are -- we have a number of programs in place, which we think will actually address that. We have a very good -- we have a very strong employee value proposition. In fact, we don't have any trouble recruiting people into the company. 
And so the combination of continuing to strengthen our employee value proposition we believe will get this mildly high turnover back to normal levels. And in parallel with that, we are rapidly ramping up our recruitment capacity, as I mentioned. We actually started ramping up recruiting capacity back in May. But obviously, what happens is you start -- you have to hire recruiters. It takes a little while to actually get them on the job. And then just like any other job, it takes recruiters some time to get up to full capacity. 
And so while we started to ramping recruitment capacity back in May, it takes a little time before that fully kicks in. As Craig mentioned in the script on his prepared remarks, we're already seeing that we're back to kind of the levels of hiring that we were back in 2019. And again, we expect that to continue to go up. So we expect a combination of improved employee turnover from the programs we get in place, combined with higher recruiting capacity to really address this issue."

I guess one could argue you've got multiple franchises that you're selling there, and so it could be higher. But there's also a lot of factors have improved it. Would it be reasonable to think that it gravitates back towards where GTS has been historically? Or do you believe you can keep this level of productivity or at least higher just because of the number of shots on goal you've got with the different practice areas you're selling?"

I think across the -- all the GBS practices, as we mentioned, all of them are at double-digit growth rates on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter, and more than half of them are north of 20% year-over-year growth. So we highlighted the top 3, which are performing really strongly. But that's not -- those aren't the only ones that are even north of 20%. And again, to underscore the point, all of them are at double-digit growth rates. 
I think what we're seeing, and you can see this through a combination of metrics is, we are selling a lot of new functions within existing enterprises, which is why you've seen the retention rate move up as nicely as it has. And so just because a client is purchasing supply chain subscription, selling into their finance team or their HR team or their legal team is a brand-new sale for us. And we're doing really, really well there in addition to bringing on brand-new enterprises into the GBS franchise as well. So it's a combination of those 2 factors really really driving that GBS growth. 
On the cyclical versus secular, I think I'd go back to gene's point earlier. We have a really, really strong value proposition in each of these functional areas that we are selling into. We've invested a lot over the last several years to make sure that we've got the right content and the right analysts and advisers and the right service capacity and the right selling capacity. And so we feel good about each of these opportunities. Again, if you scan back, I mean, these are enormous market opportunities for us. And we're in the really, really, really early innings of going after that market opportunity."

I think the way that I'm sort of thinking about it is you have T&E and hiring that are going to make up probably some of the bigger buckets of returning costs. And I know you talked about hiring a lot, so I'll skip that one. But just on T&E, I guess how far back are you at this point versus what is fully back? Versus pre-COVID, like is the level sort of lower? And maybe the easier way to ask it is you talked about the 19% baseline for adjusted EBITDA margin this year, so modest growth off of that next year. Is that how we should be thinking about '22? Or could you see costs more gradually come back and with sort of our stock in a situation like we had this year where you're a little bit over earning on the margin next year?"

So one, the biggest bucket by far is headcount related. And as we've talked about, we are making progress there. We've increased recruitment capacity, as Gene talked about. We're growing both sales forces now sequentially. And we intend to do that not only with sales but across the rest of the company as needed as well. And so that is by far the biggest piece of it. And I think as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, about 2/3 of the ""normalizing"" adjustments relate to headcount. 
On the travel front, we are still almost at 0. And so there's still a long way to bounce back from that. When we were sitting here in May, we thought second half of the year, it would start to bounce back. When we were sitting here in August, we thought in the fourth quarter it would bounce back. It is reopening a little bit, but we are still at a tiny fraction of where we were historically. 
And as we roll into 2022, we do think it will rebound to reset at a new normal level. Will that be all the way back to 2019? Perhaps not as there are things we can do a little more efficiently and effectively, but it's still going to be a pretty significant step up from what we spent in 2021, which is virtually nothing, back to a new normal level in 2022."

There are some structural differences that we've talked about in the past in looking at GBS compared to GTS and again, based on where we are in the journey on these 2 businesses. And so on the GBS side, because we are, as I mentioned earlier, in the really early innings of going after this really informs market opportunity, we have a richer mix of what we call business developers or hunters whose sole job is to go out and find new business. And they're performing really, really well. It has been, and we've been building to that. It wasn't just a 1 quarter phenomenon. It's a several quarter, multiyear phenomenon that we've been experiencing there. And So again, they are performing really well. The retention levels are helping a lot on on the types of quota-bearing hires or AEs that manage CV and drive growth account expansion. So it's really a combination of those 2 things. 
As we look out in the future, is this the right level to think about? We will see. I mean there is -- we do believe there was a little bit pent-up of demand out there in the market coming through the pandemic last year. But we feel like we're in a really good place with GBS achieving strong growth rates, and again, through a combination of really strong new business and improving retention rates as well."

So as we look out in the future, right now, the way we're thinking is we would -- when it is safe to do so and allowed in each geographic area regulatory environment, we will -- we plan to hold in-person conferences because it does provide tremendous value to our clients. 
And having said that, we also plan to continue with virtual conferences for those clients that either don't want to travel or can't travel given when we have our in-person conferences.

But we -- and again, we've talked about this in the past, we are not going to be in a position to relaunch the 70 in-person conferences that we had in 2019, run them at the exact same profile, economic and otherwise in 2022.

And so that's one of the factors that drives the U.S. markets. 
In terms of actual, our value proposition is very strong in the U.S. It's very strong in Europe. It's very strong in Asia. And so the -- it's equally effective there. Sometimes, the mix of industries affect a particular geography or a particular market where one set of industries might not be doing as well. And so it's a little tougher selling environment.

And as we roll forward, as Gene talked about in this sort of hybrid world of running in person where we can and where it's safe to do so, we're going to take advantage of that from a research perspective. And when we run virtual, we intend to make sure we get the benefits of that on the research side as well. So whatever format we run in, it's a great business, but it's really an extension of our Research business, and that's the way we'll continue to run it whether it's in person or virtual."

Our growth increased again in the third quarter. We're performing well across the business. We delivered strong performances in contract value, revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. Total company revenues were up 15%",722,"Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Our growth increased again in the third quarter. We're performing well across the business. We delivered strong performances in contract value, revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. Total company revenues were up 15% in Q3 with continued momentum across all 3 of our business segments. We also repurchased another $355 million of stock in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total through October to $1.6 billion. And we're thriving in the current environment.  
Research continues to be our largest and most profitable segment. Our Research segment provides actionable objective insight to executives and their teams. We serve leaders across all major enterprise functions in every industry around the world. Our market opportunity is vast across all sectors, sizes and geographies, and we're delivering more value than ever. 
Everywhere around the world, our clients are facing more issues than ever before, challenging issues, things like the future of work; cybersecurity; carbon footprint; digital business; diversity, equity and inclusion; cloud; and more. Our research is closely aligned to our clients' priorities. We recently launched a new sustainability resource center that provides clients and prospects with actual insights on sustainable business strategy. 
Total Research contract value growth increased to 14% with acceleration in both GTS and GBS, driven by strong execution in both retention and new business. Global Technology Sales or GTS returned to double-digit growth. GTS contract value growth accelerated to 12%. We expect GTS would deliver long-term sustained double-digit contract value growth. Global Business Sales or GBS delivered another outstanding quarter with contract value growth of 22%. All practices across GBS drove double-digit contract value growth. Across our entire Research business, we're driving consistent execution of proven practices, and we continue to see the results of our efforts. 
Our Conferences business also continues to deliver excellent performance. In 2020, we developed an entirely new conferences business model. This model leverages virtual conferences to deliver extraordinarily valuable insights to our audiences. We delivered a strong performance in Conferences. For the third quarter of 2021, Conferences revenues were $24 million. Total attendee numbers were up in Q3 as we're increasing our reach through our valuable content.  
There's a large constituency of our clients and prospects who prefer in-person conferences. We've recently held some in-person Evanta events, which were very well received. As conditions continue to stabilize, we are operationally prepared to return to in-person conferences where and when we can. We'll continue to leverage our profitable virtual conferences as appropriate.  
Gartner Consulting is an extension of Gartner Research. Consulting helps clients execute their most strategic initiatives through deeper, extended, project-based work. Consulting is an important complement to our IT Research business. Consulting revenues grew 6% in Q3. So overall, we're performing really well as a company.  
We're thriving at our current environment. We're able to serve our clients and sell the prospects very effectively in a virtual environment. Most of our associates appreciate working virtually. They would like some in-person interactions with their colleagues when that's the best way to engage with each other and get work done. We've created an operating model that supports virtual and in-person interactions, and this gives our associates flexibility while promoting activities that drive associate engagement. We've also ramped up our recruiting function to support long-term sustained double-digit growth. We're seeing great success in hiring during one of the toughest labor markets ever. 
Finally, we're taking steps to make the associate experience at Gartner even better. We're a growth company. We're focused on ensuring our associates have clear and compelling career paths. We're helping our managers and leaders have powerful career development conversations with their teams. We continue to improve on our proven practices, and we're innovating processes and technology to streamline operations.  
In closing, Gartner delivered another strong performance in Q3. We're performing well across all 3 of our business segments. We delivered strong performances in contract value, revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow, and we repurchased another $355 million of stock in the quarter. We continue to get better, faster, stronger as a company. Gartner is a great place to be for our associates. We deliver extraordinary value to our current clients. We provide outstanding returns for our shareholders, and we're thriving in the current environment.  
With that, I'll hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Craig Safian. Craig?"

Third quarter results were again excellent with acceleration in contract value growth and strength in revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. We are increasing our 2021 guidance to reflect our strong Q3 performance.  Third",1863,"Thank you, Gene, and good morning. Third quarter results were again excellent with acceleration in contract value growth and strength in revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. We are increasing our 2021 guidance to reflect our strong Q3 performance.  
Third quarter revenue was $1.2 billion, up 16% year-over-year as reported and 15% FX neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 69%, up more than 200 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA was $305 million, up 82% year-over-year and up 80% FX neutral. Adjusted EPS was $2.03, and free cash flow in the quarter was $331 million.  
Research revenue in the third quarter grew 16% year-over-year as reported and 15% on an FX-neutral basis. We drove both strong retention and new business in the quarter. Third quarter Research contribution margin was 74%, up over 200 basis points versus 2020. Higher-than-normal contribution margins reflect improved operational effectiveness, continued avoidance of travel expenses and lower-than-planned head count.  
Total contract value grew 14% FX neutral year-over-year to $4 billion at September 30. Quarterly net contract value increase or NCVI was a very strong $146 million. Quarterly NCVI is a helpful way to measure contract value performance in the quarter even though there is notable seasonality in this metric.  
Global Technology Sales contract value was $3.2 billion at the end of the third quarter, up almost 12% versus the prior year. GTS CV increased $102 million from the second quarter. CV growth was led by the technology, manufacturing and retail industries while retention for GTS was 104% for the quarter, up 490 basis points year-over-year. GTS new business was up 25% versus last year with strong growth in new logos and expansion with existing client enterprises.  
GTS quota-bearing head count increased from the second quarter. We are beginning to see the positive effects of our investments to ramp up recruiting capacity. We continue to be successful in recruiting new salespeople. Turnover among GTS frontline sellers is stable at the modestly elevated range we saw in the second quarter. With increased recruiting capacity and stable turnover, we expect to see continued expansion of the GTS sales team in Q4 and into 2022 and beyond. Our regular full set of metrics can be found in our earnings supplement.  
Global Business Sales contract value was $814 million at the end of the third quarter, up 22% year-over-year, which is above the high end of our medium-term outlook of 12% to 16%. GBS CV increased $43 million from the second quarter. Broad-based CV growth included particular strength in the health care, technology and services industries. All of our GBS practices achieved double-digit growth rates with the majority growing more than 20% year-over-year. 
Growth in the third quarter was led by the supply chain, HR and sales practices while retention for GBS was 113% for the quarter, up more than 14 percentage points year-over-year. GBS new business was up 38% compared to last year, reflecting strong growth across the full portfolio. GBS quota-bearing head count increased sequentially and is up 8% year-over-year. As with GTS, our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in our earnings supplement.  
Conferences revenue for the third quarter was $24 million with reported growth of 92% and 93% FX neutral. Contribution margin in the quarter was 47%. We held 8 virtual conferences in the quarter. We also held a number of virtual Evanta meetings. We were able to reintroduce in-person Evanta meetings in the quarter and plan to ramp those up in Q4. Attendance is up significantly year-over-year as we've launched more virtual conferences to cover additional roles.  
Third quarter Consulting revenues increased by 6% year-over-year to $95 million. On an FX-neutral basis, revenues were also up 6%. Consulting contribution margin was 33% in the third quarter, up more than 110 basis points versus the prior year quarter.  
Labor-based revenues were $78 million, up 5% versus Q3 of last year and up 4% on an FX-neutral basis. Labor-based billable head count of 749 was up 2%. Utilization was 62%, up more than 130 basis points year-over-year. Backlog at September 30 was $126 million, increasing 27% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis after another strong bookings quarter. Our contract optimization business was up 13% on a reported basis versus the prior year quarter and up 12% FX neutral. As we have detailed in the past, this part of the Consulting segment is highly valuable. 
Consolidated cost of services increased 9% year-over-year and 8% FX neutral in the third quarter. SG&A decreased 2% year-over-year and 3% FX neutral in the third quarter. The year-over-year decline is largely related to the timing of certain prior year expenses. We expect SG&A expenses to increase over time as our hiring across the business continues to ramp. Total operating expenses were lower than planned because conferences continue to be virtual. We are resuming business travel and reopening offices at a very deliberate pace, and we are still ramping up our net growth hiring to our target levels.  
EBITDA for the third quarter was $305 million, up 82% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 80% FX neutral. Third quarter EBITDA again reflected revenue above the high end and costs towards the low end of our expectations. Depreciation in the quarter was up about $3 million versus 2020, reflecting real estate and software which went into service since the third quarter of last year. Net interest expense excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter was $30 million, up slightly versus the third quarter of 2020 due to an increase in total debt balances. The Q3 adjusted tax rate, which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income, was 25.2% for the quarter. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 25.4% in the quarter. 
Adjusted EPS in Q3 was $2.03. The weighted average fully diluted share count for the third quarter was 84.8 million shares. We exited the quarter with 84.2 million fully diluted shares.  
Operating cash flow for the quarter was $345 million, up 41% compared to last year. Cash flow strength continues to be driven by EBITDA growth and improved collections. CapEx for the quarter was $14 million, down 5% year-over-year. Lower CapEx is largely a function of lower real estate investments.  
Free cash flow for the quarter was $331 million. Free cash flow growth continues to be an important part of our business model with modest capital expenditure needs and upfront client payments. Free cash flow as a percent of revenue or free cash flow margin was 25% on a rolling 4-quarter basis adjusted for the $150 million of insurance proceeds received in the second quarter. Free cash flow is well in excess of both GAAP and adjusted net income.  
At the end of the third quarter, we had $766 million of cash. Our September 30 debt balance was $2.5 billion. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was about 2x. Our expected free cash flow generation and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity to deliver on our capital allocation strategy of share repurchases and strategic tuck-in M&A.  
Through the end of October, we have repurchased more than $1.6 billion in stock this year, including $355 million during the third quarter. Year-to-date, we have repurchased over 7 million shares, reducing our net share count by around 7%. As of November 1, we have around $600 million remaining on our repurchase authorization, which we expect the board will refresh as needed. As we continue to repurchase shares, we expect our capital base will shrink. This is accretive to earnings per share and combined with growing profits, also delivers increasing returns on invested capital over time. 
We are updating our full year guidance to reflect Q3 performance and an improved and increased outlook for the remainder of the year. For revenue guidance, we now expect Research revenue of at least $4.07 billion, which is growth of 13%. We now expect Conferences revenue of at least $190 million, which is growth of 58%. We still expect Consulting revenue of at least $400 million, which is growth of 6%. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $4.66 billion, which is growth of 14%. Based on current foreign exchange rates and business mix, the consolidated growth includes an FX benefit of about 190 basis points. This reflects modest headwinds from FX in the fourth quarter. 
For expenses, we are investing in expanding our recruiting capacity to drive additional hiring across the entire business, including our sales teams. The additional hiring will continue into 2022 and beyond to support current and future growth. We plan to exit the year with quota-bearing head count about flat for GTS. We expect low double-digit growth for GBS by the end of 2021. Additionally, we continue to invest in a number of programs with a focus on improving sales productivity and cost effectiveness. We are also incurring some conference cancellation fees in the fourth quarter and are in the process of reopening dozens of offices as well.  
We now expect full year adjusted EBITDA of at least $1.26 billion, which is an increase of about 54% versus 2020 and reflects reported margins of 27%. Consistent with our comments last quarter, we estimate that the normalized 2021 margins would be around 19% if this had been a more typical year. About 2/3 of the adjustments are head count related with most of the rest from travel and real estate. 
We expect our full year 2021 adjusted net interest expense to be $113 million. Looking out to 2022, as the balance sheet stands today, we expect interest expense to be around $115 million. 
We expect an adjusted tax rate of around 22% for 2021. We now expect 2021 adjusted EPS of at least $8.54. For 2021, we now expect free cash flow of at least $1.225 billion. This includes the $150 million of insurance proceeds received in the second quarter of this year. All the details of our full year guidance are included on our Investor Relations site.  
We had a strong third quarter with momentum across the business. Contract value growth accelerated and we had very strong revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow in the quarter. We've put our capital to work, repurchasing more than $1.6 billion worth of our stock this year through the end of October. And we've updated our guidance to reflect continuing strength and momentum in the business.  
Looking out over the medium term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged. With 12% to 16% Research CV growth, we will deliver double-digit revenue growth. With gross margin expansion, sales costs growing in line with CV growth over time and G&A leverage, we can modestly expand margins from a normalized 2021 level of around 19%. We can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA because of our modest CapEx needs and the benefit of our clients paying us upfront. And we'll continue to deploy our capital on share repurchases, which lower the share count over time, and strategic value-enhancing tuck-in M&A.  
With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator?"

I think there's a couple of ways to look at what's happening under the covers. I think number one, seeing the pickup and while retention is certainly a very positive trend which we anticipated and as we've looked at the amount of up-sell and expansion that we're driving within existing client enterprises, we're back to normal levels. And that wallet retention is strong. It's not quite back to historical levels, but we feel really good about the level of expansion we're driving within existing enterprises again. Some of that is win back. Some of that is organic growth activities within existing enterprises. But the wallet is pretty strong.  
I think on the enterprise count and enterprise growth, we've seen now a few quarters of enterprises expanding. And as you'd expect, when a new enterprise comes in, it comes in at a lower CV level than our overall average. And so the net enterprise adds that we've been doing will suppress a little bit or mute a little bit the CV per enterprise that you see. But what you're seeing actually is both levers working really well for the last several quarters, particularly in the third quarter, with that expansion with the existing enterprises showing up in the wallet retention number and the number of enterprises growing nicely as well."

First, it is a highly competitive labor market, and so our turnover is up modestly. And of course, there are -- within that modestly higher turnover, there are pockets that are higher than modest turnover. But overall, it's modestly up, and we recognize that. 
And we are -- we have a number of programs in place which we think will actually address that. We have a very good -- we have a very strong employee value proposition. In fact, we don't have any trouble recruiting people into the company. And so the combination of continuing to strengthen our employee value proposition, we believe, will get turnover -- this modestly higher turnover back to normal levels. 
And in parallel with that, we are rapidly ramping up our recruiting capacity, as I mentioned. We actually started ramping up recruiting capacity back in May. But obviously, what happens is you start -- you've got to hire recruiters. It takes a little while to actually get them on the job. And then just like any other job, it takes recruiters some time to get up to full capacity. And so while we started ramping recruiting capacity back in May, it takes a little time before that fully kicks in. 
As Craig mentioned on his script -- on his prepared remarks, we're already seeing that we're back to kind of the levels of hiring that we were back in 2019. And again, we expect that to continue to go up. So we expect a combination of improved employee turnover from the programs we got in place combined with higher recruiting capacity to really address this issue."

The LTM right now is way ahead of what it's ever been in GTS. I guess one could argue you've got multiple franchises that you're selling there, and so it could be higher. But there's also a lot of factors have improved it. Is -- would it be reasonable to think that it gravitates back towards where GTS has been historically? Or do you believe you can keep this level of productivity or at least higher just because of the number of shots on goal you've got with the different practice areas you're selling?"

So it underscores Gene's point around the value proposition being super strong.

Are these really new client subscriptions or add-ons from existing clients for the most part? And do you view any of that as temporary? So like if supply issues are to -- if supply chain issues are to wane, for example, would those clients still stay on? Or could you see sort of a little bit of a higher turnover of those clients next year?"

I think across the -- all the GBS practices, as we mentioned, all of them are at double-digit growth rates on a year-over-year basis in the third quarter, and more than half of them are north of 20% year-over-year growth. So we highlighted the top 3, which are performing really strongly. But that's not -- those aren't the only ones that are even north of 20%. And again, to underscore the point, all of them are at double-digit growth rates.  
I think what we're seeing, and you can see this through a combination of metrics, is we are selling a lot of new functions within existing enterprises, which is why you've seen the wallet retention rate move up as nicely as it has. And so just because a client is purchasing a supply chain subscription, selling into their finance team or their HR team or their legal team is a brand-new sale for us. And we're doing really, really well there in addition to bringing on brand-new enterprises into the GBS franchise as well. So it's a combination of those 2 factors really driving that GBS growth.  
On the cyclical versus secular, I think I'd go back to Gene's points earlier. We have a really, really strong value proposition in each of these functional areas that we are selling into. We've invested a lot over the last several years to make sure that we've got the right content and the right analysts and advisers and the right service capacity and the right selling capacity. And so we feel good about each of these opportunities. Again, if you scan back, I mean, these are enormous market opportunities for us.

And I know you talked about hiring a lot, so I'll skip that one. But just on T&E, I guess, how far back are you at this point versus what is fully back? And versus pre COVID, like is the level sort of lower? 
Maybe the easier way to ask it is -- you talked about the 19% baseline for adjusted EBITDA margin this year, so modest growth off of that next year. Is that how we should be thinking about '22? Or could you see costs more gradually come back and we sort of are stuck in a situation like we had this year, where you're a little bit over earning on the margin next year?"

We're growing both sales forces now sequentially. And we intend to do that not only with sales but across the rest of the company as needed as well. And so that is, by far, the biggest piece of it. And I think as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, about 2/3 of the ""normalizing adjustments"" relate to head count. 
On the travel front, we are still almost at 0. And so there's still a long way to bounce back from that. When we were sitting here in May, we thought second half of the year, it would start to bounce back. When we were sitting here in August, we thought, in the fourth quarter, it would bounce back. It is reopening a little bit, but we are still at a tiny fraction of where we were historically. 
And as we roll into 2022, we do think it will rebound to reset at a new normal level. Will that be all the way back to 2019? Perhaps not. Perhaps -- there are things we can do a little more efficiently and effectively. But it's still going to be a pretty significant step up from what we spent in 2021, which is virtually nothing, back to a new normal level in 2022."

And so on the GBS side, because we are, as I mentioned earlier, in the really early innings of going after this really enormous market opportunity, we have a richer mix of what we call business developers or hunters whose sole job is to go out and find new business, and they are performing really, really well. 
It has been -- and we've been building to that. It wasn't just a 1 quarter phenomenon. It's a several-quarter or multiyear phenomenon that we've been experiencing there. And so again, they are performing really well. The retention levels are helping a lot on the types of quota-bearing hires or AEs that manage CV and drive growth through account expansion. So it's really a combination of those 2 things. 
As we look out to the future, is this the right level to think about? We will see. I mean there is -- we do believe there was a little bit of pent-up demand out there in the market coming through the pandemic last year.

And having said that, we also continue -- plan to continue with virtual conferences for those clients that either don't want to travel or can't travel given when we have our in-person conferences.

And so that's one of the factors that drives the U.S. markets. 
In terms of actual -- our value proposition is very strong in the U.S. It's very strong in Europe. It's very strong in Asia. And so the -- it's equally effective there. Sometimes, the mix of industries affect a particular geography or a particular market where one set of industry might not be doing as well and so it's a little tougher selling environment.

So the -- one of the things in the hybrid world we need to focus on, and we've always focused on this to a degree but we have to talk about it differently, which is our employee value proposition and why should an associate want to come work in Gartner. The talent market we compete in is a very, very competitive market. We're a very attractive employer. We have to make sure that our candidates understand that and understand what's different in a virtual environment than might have been when it was a pure office-based environment. So that's kind of the key change."

One of those is in getting prospects there and having them experience Gartner insight and then converting them. We also obviously have the benefit of engagement with existing clients, and so there's a positive benefit on retention as well. 
From a -- when we did pivot to virtual, we were very focused on making sure that we maintained those levels of engagement, both in terms of engaging existing seat holders to help with retention rates and also getting lots of prospects through. So we've been very focused. And again, I think, in the fourth quarter of last year when we really ran our virtual conference portfolio in earnest, we did a really good job on both fronts. And I think we're seeing the benefit of that from a retention rate perspective this year. It's certainly helping. And it's also been contributing nicely to our overall new business growth rates on research as well. 
And as we roll forward, as Gene talked about, in this sort of hybrid world of running in person where we can and where it is safe to do so, we're going to take advantage of that from a research perspective. And when we run virtual, we intend to make sure we get the benefits of that on the research side as well. So whatever format we run in, it's a great business. But it's really an extension of our Research business, and that's the way we'll continue to run it whether it's in person or virtual."

Our growth increased again in the third quarter. We're performing well across the business. We delivered strong performances in contract value, revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. Total company revenues were up 15%",721,"Good morning, and thanks for joining us. Our growth increased again in the third quarter. We're performing well across the business. We delivered strong performances in contract value, revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. Total company revenues were up 15% in Q3 with continued momentum across all 3 of our business segments. We also repurchased another $355 million of stock in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total through October to $1.6 billion. And we're thriving in the current environment.  
Research continues to be our largest and most profitable segment. Our Research segment provides actionable, objective insight to executives and their teams. We serve leaders across all major enterprise functions in every industry around the world. Our market opportunity is vast across all sectors, sizes and geographies, and we're delivering more value than ever. 
Everywhere around the world, our clients are facing more issues than ever before, challenging issues, things like the future of work; cybersecurity; carbon footprint; digital business; diversity, equity and inclusion; cloud; and more. Our research is closely aligned to our clients' priorities. We recently launched a new sustainability resource center that provides clients and prospects with actual insights on sustainable business strategy. 
Total Research contract value growth increased to 14% with acceleration in both GTS and GBS, driven by strong execution in both retention and new business. Global Technology Sales or GTS returned to double-digit growth. GTS contract value growth accelerated to 12%. We expect GTS would deliver long-term sustained double-digit contract value growth. Global Business Sales or GBS delivered another outstanding quarter with contract value growth of 22%. All practices across GBS drove double-digit contract value growth. Across our entire research business, we're driving consistent execution of proven practices, and we continue to see the results of our efforts. 
Our Conferences business also continues to deliver excellent performance. In 2020, we developed an entirely new conferences business model. This model leverages virtual conferences to deliver extraordinarily valuable insights to our audiences. We delivered a strong performance in Conferences. For the third quarter 2021, Conferences revenues were $24 million. Total attendee numbers were up in Q3 as we're increasing our reach through our valuable content.  
There's a large constituency of our clients and prospects who prefer in-person conferences. We've recently held some in-person Evanta events, which were very well received. As conditions continue to stabilize, we are operationally prepared to return to in-person conferences where and when we can. We'll continue to leverage our profitable virtual conferences as appropriate.  
Gartner Consulting is an extension of Gartner Research. Consulting helps clients execute their most strategic initiatives through deeper, extended, project-based work. Consulting is an important complement to our IT research business. Consulting revenues grew 6% in Q3. So overall, we're performing really well as a company.  
We're thriving in our current environment. We're able to serve our clients and sell to prospects very effectively in a virtual environment. Most of our associates appreciate working virtually. They would like some in-person interactions with their colleagues when that's the best way to engage with each other and get work done. We've created an operating model that supports virtual and in-person interactions, and this gives our associates flexibility while promoting activities that drive associate engagement. We've also ramped up our recruiting function to support long-term sustained double-digit growth. We're seeing great success in hiring during one of the toughest labor markets ever. 
Finally, we're taking steps to make the associate experience at Gartner even better. We're a growth company. We're focused on ensuring our associates have clear and compelling career paths. We're helping our managers and leaders have powerful career development conversations with their teams. We continue to improve on our proven practices, and we're innovating processes and technology to streamline operations.  
In closing, Gartner delivered another strong performance in Q3. We're performing well across all 3 of our business segments. We delivered strong performances in contract value, revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow, and we repurchased another $355 million of stock in the quarter. We continue to get better, faster, stronger as a company. Gartner is a great place to be for our associates. We deliver extraordinary value to our current clients. We provide outstanding returns for our shareholders, and we're thriving in the current environment.

Third quarter results were again excellent with acceleration in contract value growth and strength in revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. We are increasing our 2021 guidance to reflect our strong Q3 performance. Third qu",1861,"Thank you, Gene, and good morning. Third quarter results were again excellent with acceleration in contract value growth and strength in revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow. We are increasing our 2021 guidance to reflect our strong Q3 performance. Third quarter revenue was $1.2 billion, up 16% year-over-year as reported and 15% FX neutral. In addition, total contribution margin was 69%, up more than 200 basis points versus the prior year. EBITDA was $305 million, up 82% year-over-year and up 80% FX neutral. Adjusted EPS was $2.03, and free cash flow in the quarter was $331 million.  
Research revenue in the third quarter grew 16% year-over-year as reported and 15% on an FX-neutral basis. We drove both strong retention and new business in the quarter. Third quarter Research contribution margin was 74%, up over 200 basis points versus 2020. Higher-than-normal contribution margins reflect improved operational effectiveness, continued avoidance of travel expenses and lower-than-planned head count. Total contract value grew 14% FX neutral year-over-year to $4 billion at September 30. Quarterly net contract value increase or NCVI was a very strong $146 million. Quarterly NCVI is a helpful way to measure contract value performance in the quarter even though there is notable seasonality in this metric.  
Global Technology Sales contract value was $3.2 billion at the end of the third quarter, up almost 12% versus the prior year. GTS CV increased $102 million from the second quarter. CV growth was led by the technology, manufacturing and retail industries while retention for GTS was 104% for the quarter, up 490 basis points year-over-year. GTS new business was up 25% versus last year with strong growth in new logos and expansion with existing client enterprises.  
GTS quota-bearing head count increased from the second quarter. We are beginning to see the positive effects of our investments to ramp up recruiting capacity. We continue to be successful recruiting new salespeople. Turnover among GTS frontline sellers is stable at the modestly elevated range we saw in the second quarter. With increased recruiting capacity and stable turnover, we expect to see continued expansion of the GTS sales team in Q4 and into 2022 and beyond. Our regular full set of metrics can be found in our earnings supplement.  
Global Business Sales contract value was $814 million at the end of the third quarter, up 22% year-over-year, which is above the high end of our medium-term outlook of 12% to 16%. GBS CV increased $43 million from the second quarter. Broad-based CV growth included particular strength in the health care, technology and services industries. All of our GBS practices achieved double-digit growth rates with the majority growing more than 20% year-over-year. 
Growth in the third quarter was led by the supply chain, HR and sales practices while retention for GBS was 113% for the quarter, up more than 14 percentage points year-over-year. GBS new business was up 38% compared to last year, reflecting strong growth across the full portfolio. GBS quota-bearing head count increased sequentially and is up 8% year-over-year. As with GTS, our regular full set of GBS metrics can be found in our earnings supplement.  
Conferences revenue for the third quarter was $24 million with reported growth of 92% and 93% FX neutral. Contribution margin in the quarter was 47%. We held 8 virtual conferences in the quarter. We also held a number of virtual Evanta meetings. We were able to reintroduce in-person Evanta meetings in the quarter and plan to ramp those up in Q4. Attendance is up significantly year-over-year as we've launched more virtual conferences to cover additional roles. Third quarter Consulting revenues increased by 6% year-over-year to $95 million. On an FX-neutral basis, revenues were also up 6%. Consulting contribution margin was 33% in the third quarter, up more than 110 basis points versus the prior year quarter.  
Labor-based revenues were $78 million, up 5% versus Q3 of last year and up 4% on an FX-neutral basis. Labor-based billable head count of 749 was up 2%. Utilization was 62%, up more than 130 basis points year-over-year. Backlog at September 30 was $126 million, increasing 27% year-over-year on an FX-neutral basis after another strong bookings quarter. Our contract optimization business was up 13% on a reported basis versus the prior year quarter and up 12% FX neutral. As we have detailed in the past, this part of the Consulting segment is highly valuable. 
Consolidated cost of services increased 9% year-over-year and 8% FX neutral in the third quarter. SG&A decreased 2% year-over-year and 3% FX neutral in the third quarter. The year-over-year decline is largely related to the timing of certain prior year expenses. We expect SG&A expenses to increase over time as our hiring across the business continues to ramp. Total operating expenses were lower than planned because conferences continue to be virtual. We are resuming business travel and reopening offices at a very deliberate pace, and we are still ramping up our net growth hiring to our target levels.  
EBITDA for the third quarter was $305 million, up 82% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 80% FX neutral. Third quarter EBITDA again reflected revenue above the high end and costs towards the low end of our expectations. Depreciation in the quarter was up about $3 million versus 2020, reflecting real estate and software which went into service since the third quarter of last year. Net interest expense, excluding deferred financing costs in the quarter, was $30 million, up slightly versus the third quarter of 2020 due to an increase in total debt balances. The Q3 adjusted tax rate, which we use for the calculation of adjusted net income, was 25.2% for the quarter. The tax rate for the items used to adjust net income was 25.4% in the quarter. 
Adjusted EPS in Q3 was $2.03. Weighted average fully diluted share count for the third quarter was 84.8 million shares. We exited the quarter with 84.2 million fully diluted shares. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $345 million, up 41% compared to last year. Cash flow strength continues to be driven by EBITDA growth and improved collections. CapEx for the quarter was $14 million, down 5% year-over-year. Lower CapEx is largely a function of lower real estate investments.  
Free cash flow for the quarter was $331 million. Free cash flow growth continues to be an important part of our business model with modest capital expenditure needs and upfront client payments. Free cash flow as a percent of revenue or free cash flow margin was 25% on a rolling 4-quarter basis adjusted for the $150 million of insurance proceeds received in the second quarter. Free cash flow is well in excess of both GAAP and adjusted net income.  
At the end of the third quarter, we had $766 million of cash. Our September 30 debt balance was $2.5 billion. Our reported gross debt to trailing 12-month EBITDA was about 2x. Our expected free cash flow generation and excess cash remaining on the balance sheet provide ample liquidity to deliver on our capital allocation strategy of share repurchases and strategic tuck-in M&A.  
Through the end of October, we have repurchased more than $1.6 billion in stock this year, including $355 million during the third quarter. Year-to-date, we have repurchased over 7 million shares, reducing our net share count by around 7%. As of November 1, we have around $600 million remaining on our repurchase authorization, which we expect the Board will refresh as needed. As we continue to repurchase shares, we expect our capital base will shrink. This is accretive to earnings per share and combined with growing profits also delivers increasing returns on invested capital over time. 
We are updating our full year guidance to reflect Q3 performance and an improved and increased outlook for the remainder of the year. For revenue guidance, we now expect Research revenue of at least $4.07 billion, which is growth of 13%. We now expect Conferences revenue of at least $190 million, which is growth of 58%. We still expect Consulting revenue of at least $400 million, which is growth of 6%. The result is an outlook for consolidated revenue of at least $4.66 billion, which is growth of 14%. Based on current foreign exchange rates and business mix, the consolidated growth includes an FX benefit of about 190 basis points. This reflects modest headwinds from FX in the fourth quarter. 
For expenses, we are investing in expanding our recruiting capacity to drive additional hiring across the entire business, including our sales teams. The additional hiring will continue into 2022 and beyond to support current and future growth. We plan to exit the year with quota-bearing head count about flat for GTS. We expect low double-digit growth for GBS by the end of 2021. Additionally, we continue to invest in a number of programs with a focus on improving sales productivity and cost effectiveness. We are also incurring some conference cancellation fees in the fourth quarter and are in the process of reopening dozens of offices as well.  
We now expect full year adjusted EBITDA of at least $1.26 billion, which is an increase of about 54% versus 2020 and reflects reported margins of 27%. Consistent with our comments last quarter, we estimate that the normalized 2021 margins would be around 19% if this had been a more typical year. About 2/3 of the adjustments are head count related with most of the rest from travel and real estate. We expect our full year 2021 adjusted net interest expense to be $113 million. Looking out to 2022, as the balance sheet stands today, we expect interest expense to be around $115 million. 
We expect an adjusted tax rate of around 22% for 2021. We now expect 2021 adjusted EPS of at least $8.54. For 2021, we now expect free cash flow of at least $1.225 billion. This includes the $150 million of insurance proceeds received in the second quarter of this year. All the details of our full year guidance are included on our Investor Relations site. We had a strong third quarter with momentum across the business. Contract value growth accelerated and we had very strong revenue, EBITDA and free cash flow in the quarter. We've put our capital to work, repurchasing more than $1.6 billion worth of our stock this year through the end of October. And we've updated our guidance to reflect continuing strength and momentum in the business.  
Looking out over the medium term, our financial model and expectations are unchanged. With 12% to 16% Research CV growth, we will deliver double-digit revenue growth. With gross margin expansion, sales costs growing in line with CV growth over time and G&A leverage, we can modestly expand margins from a normalized 2021 level of around 19%. We can grow free cash flow at least as fast as EBITDA because of our modest CapEx needs and the benefits of our clients paying us upfront. And we'll continue to deploy our capital on share repurchases, which lower the share count over time, and strategic value-enhancing tuck-in M&A.  
With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, and we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator?"

I think there's a couple of ways to look at what's happening under the covers. I think number one, seeing the pickup and while retention is certainly a very positive trend which we anticipated and as we've looked at the amount of up-sell and expansion that we're driving within existing client enterprises, we're back to normal levels. And that wallet retention is strong. It's not quite back to historical levels, but we feel really good about the level of expansion we're driving within existing enterprises again. Some of that is win back. Some of that is organic growth activities within existing enterprises. But the wallet is pretty strong.  
I think on the enterprise count and enterprise growth, we've seen now a few quarters of enterprises expanding. And as you'd expect, when a new enterprise comes in, it comes in at a lower CV level than our overall average. And so the net enterprise adds that we've been doing will suppress a little bit or mute a little bit the CV per enterprise that you see. But what you're seeing actually is both levers working really well for the last several quarters, particularly in the third quarter, with that expansion with the existing enterprises showing up in the wallet retention number and the number of enterprises growing nicely as well."

First, it is a highly competitive labor market, and so our turnover is up modestly. And of course, there are -- within that modestly higher turnover, there are pockets that are higher than modest turnover. But overall, it's modestly up, and we recognize that. And we are -- we have a number of programs in place which we think will actually address that. We have a very good -- we have a very strong employee value proposition. In fact, we don't have any trouble recruiting people into the company. And so the combination of continuing to strengthen our employee value proposition, we believe, will get turnover -- this modestly higher turnover back to normal levels. 
And in parallel with that, we are rapidly ramping up our recruiting capacity, as I mentioned. We actually started ramping up recruiting capacity back in May. But obviously, what happens is you start -- you've got to hire recruiters. It takes a little while to actually get them on the job. And then just like any other job, it takes recruiters some time to get up to full capacity. And so while we started ramping recruiting capacity back in May, it takes a little time before that fully kicks in. As Craig mentioned on his script -- on his prepared remarks, we're already seeing that we're back to kind of the levels of hiring that we were back in 2019. And again, we expect that to continue to go up. So we expect a combination of improved employee turnover from the programs we have in place combined with higher recruiting capacity to really address this issue."

So we highlighted the top 3, which are performing really strongly. But that's not -- those aren't the only ones that are even north of 20%. And again, to underscore the point, all of them are at double-digit growth rates.  
I think what we're seeing, and you can see this through a combination of metrics, is we are selling a lot of new functions within existing enterprises, which is why you've seen the wallet retention rate move up as nicely as it has. And so just because a client is purchasing a supply chain subscription, selling into their finance team or their HR team or their legal team is a brand-new sale for us. And we're doing really, really well there in addition to bringing on brand-new enterprises into the GBS franchise as well. So it's a combination of those 2 factors really driving that GBS growth.  
On the cyclical versus secular, I think I'd go back to Gene's points earlier. We have a really, really strong value proposition in each of these functional areas that we are selling into. We've invested a lot over the last several years to make sure that we've got the right content and the right analysts and advisers and the right service capacity and the right selling capacity. And so we feel good about each of these opportunities. Again, if you scan back, I mean, these are enormous market opportunities for us.

Maybe the easier way to ask it is -- you talked about the 19% baseline for adjusted EBITDA margin this year, so modest growth off of that next year. Is that how we should be thinking about '22? Or could you see costs more gradually come back and we sort of are stuck in a situation like we had this year, where you're a little bit over-earning on the margin next year?"

We're growing both sales forces now sequentially. And we intend to do that not only with sales but across the rest of the company as needed as well. And so that is, by far, the biggest piece of it. And I think as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, about 2/3 of the ""normalizing adjustments"" relate to head count. 
On the travel front, we are still almost at 0. And so there's still a long way to bounce back from that. When we were sitting here in May, we thought second half of the year, it would start to bounce back. When we were sitting here in August, we thought, in the fourth quarter, it would bounce back. It is reopening a little bit, but we are still at a tiny fraction of where we were historically. 
And as we roll into 2022, we do think it will rebound to reset at a new normal level. Will that be all the way back to 2019? Perhaps not. Perhaps -- there are things we can do a little more efficiently and effectively. But it's still going to be a pretty significant step up from what we spent in 2021, which is virtually nothing, back to a new normal level in 2022."

It has been -- and we've been building to that. It wasn't just a 1 quarter phenomenon. It's a several-quarter or multiyear phenomenon that we've been experiencing there. And so again, they are performing really well. The retention levels are helping a lot on the types of quota-bearing hires or AEs that manage CV and drive growth through account expansion. So it's really a combination of those 2 things. As we look out to the future, is this the right level to think about? We will see.

And so typically, like we -- as you know, this year, we planned to go live for some of our conferences and then concluded it was not either allowed or was not safe to do so, and so we didn't. But it's easier that way, once you have an in-person conference plan to go virtual because you don't have to worry about the venue and things like that. If you haven't reserved those venues, trying to get them at the right time and -- et cetera, is pretty tough to do."

One of those is in getting prospects there and having them experience Gartner insight and then converting them. We also obviously have the benefit of engagement with existing clients, and so there's a positive benefit on retention as well. 
From a -- when we did pivot to virtual, we were very focused on making sure that we maintained those levels of engagement, both in terms of engaging existing seat holders to help with retention rates and also getting lots of prospects through. So we've been very focused. And again, I think, in the fourth quarter of last year when we really ran our virtual conference portfolio in earnest, we did a really good job on both fronts. And I think we're seeing the benefit of that from a retention rate perspective this year. It's certainly helping. And it's also been contributing nicely to our overall new business growth rates on research as well. 
And as we roll forward, as Gene talked about, in this sort of hybrid world of running in-person where we can and where it is safe to do so, we're going to take advantage of that from a research perspective. And when we run virtual, we intend to make sure we get the benefits of that on the research side as well. So whatever format we run in, it's a great business. But it's really an extension of our Research business, and that's the way we'll continue to run it whether it's in-person or virtual."
