Following the close of the Legg Mason transaction on July 31, the results we announced earlier this morning include the first full quarter of the combined organization. On the call with me today is Greg Johnson, our Executive Chairman; and Matthew Nicholls, our CFO. 
And joining the call for the first time is Adam Spector. Adam joined our firm last July as managing partner of Brandywine Global and additionally became our Executive Vice President and Head of Global Distribution on October 1. 
To start, we hope that everyone is staying healthy and safe. We'd also like to recognize our incredible employees who continue to work hard every day on behalf of our clients and firm. 
It has been 6 months since we closed our acquisition of Legg Mason and its specialist investment managers. And over that time all while under a remote work environment, we've made significant progress in bringing our teams together to maximize our collective potential. We're seeing a high degree of stability within the organization as well as a number of encouraging trends across the business. 
First off, assets under management reached a record high of approximately $1.5 trillion this quarter, driven primarily by strong market performance. That's an increase of $79 billion or 6% during the quarter.
Turning next to operating and financial results. Adjusted revenues increased by 20% to $1.5 billion, primarily due to an additional month of Legg Mason results. Higher revenues and continued expense discipline resulted in a 28% increase in adjusted operating income to $550 million and an increase in operating margin to 37.2%. 
On the performance front, our investment results improved this quarter with 61%, 66%, 68% and 75% of our strategy composites outperforming their respective benchmarks for the 4 key time periods. Looking deeper into those numbers, Western Asset continues to have standout performance and reached $423 billion in long-term assets and $480 billion in total assets, its highest level on both fronts in over a decade. Brandywine performance rebounded strongly and saw net inflows into global multi-sector products in the latter part of the quarter. 
And as we saw improvement in performance at ClearBridge across many Franklin Templeton strategies, ClearBridge is another example of one of our specialized investment managers reaching a record in AUM, which was $176 billion at quarter end. Likewise, our Fiduciary Trust net worth AUM is at an all-time high of $32 billion, while the business also generated positive net flows for the quarter. Record AUM levels were also reached for Clarion Partners at $58.1 billion. 
Long-term relative investment performance of our U.S. and international mutual funds also improved this quarter. A significant driver of the improvement was our Franklin Income Fund, and several of our value-oriented equity strategies also generated noteworthy results. We continue to see strong performance in U.S. equities and U.S. fixed income. Our mutual funds that are rated 4 or 5 stars by Morningstar increased during the quarter and now number 140 funds. 
On the distribution front, long-term net outflows were $4.5 billion, which includes $12.6 billion of reinvested distributions. But notably, momentum continued to build with positive flows into a number of our specialized investment managers, including Benefit Street Partners, Clarion Partners, Clearbridge, Fiduciary Trust, Franklin Equity Group, Franklin Templeton Fixed income; Martin Currie, Royce, and Western Asset Management. Franklin Equity Group saw strong inflows, which were led by the Franklin Biotech Fund, which reached a record $22.5 billion in AUM. As of quarter end, we have a promising institutional pipeline of opportunities and a combined total of one but unfunded win of $11 billion. 
As we've noted on previous calls, a strategic focus for the firm has been to expand our alternatives platform to offer strategies that do not lend themselves to passive replication. With $127 billion in assets under management in alternatives and robust relationships across the retail channel, we've seen demand for our retail alternative offerings increase. Our EMEA region led the way with a focus on multi-strategy, social infrastructure and real estate. 
Also importantly as we look to deliver investment expertise through our clients' investment vehicle of choice, we now have a top 3 market position in the retail SMA business, which saw positive net flows this quarter and increased to $113 billion in assets. In other news, we were excited to launch our new Franklin Templeton Investment Institute, an innovative hub for research and knowledge sharing. Steven Dover will be leading that effort. With the launch of the institute, we're doubling down on what sets our firm apart: unmatched insight and research from experts on the ground in over 70 locations around the world. 
At the same time, tapping into the strength of our collective leadership talent, we've expanded Terrence Murphy's role to become head of equities for Franklin Templeton, while retaining his existing role as CEO of ClearBridge Investments. While our equity teams will continue to maintain their individual investment processes and autonomy, Terrence will facilitate collaboration across the groups to drive results and growth.
Looking at another key area, capital management remains an important focus. Our strong balance sheet continues to provide us with financial and strategic flexibility to evolve our business. Cash and investments totaled $6.3 billion following the public offering of 750 million aggregate principal senior notes due 2030 issued at a 1.6% coupon. As previously explained, it is our intention to pay down more expensive debt with the proceeds of the offering. 
Excluding net proceeds from the senior note offering, we have $5.5 billion in cash and investments. We also continue our track record of dividend growth for the 40th consecutive year, with a 4% increase to our regular dividend in December. 
To wrap things up, over the past 6 months, we've created a stronger firm that combines the best of both worlds: global strength and boutique specialization. Our global presence has expanded in key growth markets around the world with a greater range of specialized high-quality investment capabilities, and we think that all points to a positive future.
Now I'd like to open up the call to your questions. Operator?"

I mean we are -- for example, our largest distributor has just added 10 new funds. Many of them are Legg Mason funds, and we -- so we're seeing good penetration that is really cross-selling. And again as we talked about, Franklin was much stronger on the independent side; Legg Mason was much stronger on the wirehouse side. And so we've been able to basically cross-sell platform listings and getting through the gatekeepers on those platforms, so that's worked well. 
And just to give you an idea from a diversification of flows, if you look at the top 9, -- I don't know why I have the top 9 instead of the top 10. But the top 9 of -- it accounts for about 38% of our flows. 5 of those are Legg Mason funds, 4 are Franklin funds, 3 of them are fixed income, 5 are equities, and one is balanced. So we're seeing both a diversification by getting products on the platforms, cross-selling platforms and getting through the gatekeepers and getting them listed. So we'll continue to see more penetration as well as good diversification with the types of products, so that we don't have kind of the risk of a single large product that potentially gets out of favor. So it's much more diversified. 
I don't know, Greg, if you want to add anything there?"

That's it, but that's the new norm in this day and age of working from home. So I did not have the ability to hear what Jenny said, so I'm going to maybe overlap a bit with her comments. 
But in terms of cross-selling, there are a couple of things I would point to. One, the firm's legacy Franklin and legacy Legg Mason had different strength. Franklin was really strong, for instance, in the regional broker-dealers, and we've been able to get Western and ClearBridge products on the platform there. We're seeing positive momentum there. At the same time, when we look at something like the wires where Legg Mason traditionally was a little stronger, we've been able to have some real success with BSP there through legacy Legg Mason. 
The same thing is really true if we look outside of the United States where Franklin, for instance, was much stronger in Canada. Legg Mason had a real strength in Japan. So we've been able to start some cross-selling initiatives there that are really quite positive. And even within countries where outside of the U.S. where both firms were strong like Germany, we had a situation where Franklin was much stronger in the retail banking world, Legg Mason in the private banking world. 
And again, that lets us sell one set of products into the other legacy distribution system. Those are the types of cross-selling efforts that have been really strong. I would also say that cross-selling comes into play on defense as well where we've had clients, for instance, that are in particular strategies that might be higher alpha, higher tracking [error] strategies. When they want to derisk, what we've seen is that that money, instead of leaving our system, can shift to another lower-vol strategy that's within the system. So we're actually doing a better job retaining assets through cross-selling as well."

One is we're only really aware of 2 [we'll call them] deal-based redemptions: the one in Korea, which we talked about on the last earnings call; and the most recently, Legg Mason's 529 plan. And part of the issue there was there was just an agreement that they would only have one 529 plan, and Franklin obviously has one already with the New Jersey 529 plan. 
Otherwise, we are not seeing any kind of deal issues with respect to -- look, you go from 2 sales forces to one. You're talking about relationships on the retail side, just to give you an example of say, 150,000 financial advisers. So we're talking like less than 0.1% or so. And then they're tinny number of complaints with the change of adviser. We've been really surprised by how little complaints we've had and ultimately when you're having to pick kind of who's going to win out. 
And that's really because of Legg Mason's strength again in the big wirehouses and Franklin's in the independent. So there wasn't kind of overlap you would have expected on many deals. So there was not really product overlap and not really distribution overlap.

The other thing I would say is that following in the U.S., the sales force is essentially 50-50 legacy Franklin and legacy Legg. That's not true by channel. Our regional channel is predominantly Franklin Templeton people. Our wired channel is predominantly Legg Mason. So that really limited the disruption that we had because we kept the folks who were strongest in specific channels and moved to a channelized approach in sales, which we did not have before at Franklin Templeton."

And when you look at that, you'll notice that the sales are roughly the same and the redemptions are a little bit lower. 
So obviously we want redemptions to come down further. We want sales to go up. But in terms of trying to understand and quantify attrition risk, when we look at the pattern quarter by quarter, it's looking quite encouraging so far."

It's essentially staying steady. I think the number is around $11 billion. And it's staying steady, not because we're not adding, but because we're actually funding deals out of that. So that's going strong. 
What I would say in terms of consultants is that Franklin Templeton's central distribution has historically distributed to the consultant community and the institutional community for the Franklin investment team. Many of the Legg Mason Investment affiliates, in fact I believe all of them, did that on their own. 
Going forward, we're having a differentiated approach where the Legg Mason SIMs will continue to call on the consultants as they always have. That's been a really successful channel for them. Remember Legg was much stronger in the institutional business historically, so we're not changing that approach to the investment consultants. Outside of the U.S., some of the smaller former Legg Mason SIMs are beginning to leverage Franklin Templeton's resources, especially in the coverage of field consultants where those SIMs may cover the research centers on their own but will have much more connectivity with the field consultant. 
I would say in general, what we're trying to do with consultants is similar to what we're trying to do with global financial institutions, is recognizing that many of these large consultants are global firms, and we have to face off them holistically as a global firm. So that's how we've organized ourselves, and we are really allowing each investment team to tap into our centralized coverage of consultants as they see fit. In general, the larger [family investment ] might not need help at all in that area, where some of the smaller groups definitely rely on the central distribution team."

So we would expect G&A to creep up a little bit in the next -- in the last 2 quarters in particular, I would say. But that's included in the 3.75 billion of guidance. 
I think the number that's more likely to move a little bit, which is what caused the change a little bit in the guidance, is the comp and benefits in line with revenue. And we expect we're selling more, so there's some more commissions involved in that. It's all linked with the growth of the business. So I think we could expect the compensation line on an adjusted basis to go up a couple or so percent, maybe up 3% in the next quarter. But then because of the cost saves from the transaction, I would expect that to come down in the third quarter by about 1% or 2%, and then down again in the fourth quarter by about 4%, probably maybe a little bit more than that, which then gets us to the 3.7 to 3.75, maybe a little bit more if the markets stay stable."

So the first stage was really selecting the team, getting them settled into their territories, and that happened. 
The next stage that we're in the middle of right now is -- because they're all trained, the sales teams are trained. But in order for them to really cross-sell effectively, we have to get all of our products cross-listed on the different platforms and research-approved. 
That's really what we're doing now. We've started where you might expect with our largest distribution partners where we think we can get the most bang. We've got 2 of them already where we've onboarded a number of products. We are kind of marching through that, and it's going pretty well. 
So it's really a question of getting the back offices set up correctly and getting things on the platform. The distributors themselves are eager to have it. One of the things we're seeing that across the board is that people want to do more business with fewer bigger players. So the fact that we're able to bring such an array of investment styles, and not only investment styles but different vehicles from fund to SMAs to ETFs to these partners, that makes us much more attractive to them. So they're really working as quickly as they can with us to get our products onboarding. 
As we get onboarded, what we're seeing is that we're able to start to sell more. So for instance at some of the regionals, we've seen a real uptick in December and January for some legacy Legg Mason product on the regional platforms because those are just getting onboarded now. It's continuing work, but it's going well and we're a bit ahead of schedule."

First of all, as we spend more time together as a joint company, I think just naturally speaking, we find interesting ways to improve how we work together. That's not just operational things. It's how we can share information and improve price of that information from various vendors. We spend a lot of money on data and information across the investment teams and across the specialized investment managers. There's a natural embedded leverage in that system in terms of being saved money, and we're just really frankly just scratching the surface on that. And that also benefits the teams in a way from just costs -- way from just cost, but the cost is a good output from that work. 
And then we have been working very hard on our operations side and technology side on the future and how to position the firm in terms of capital expenditures, understanding what that is risk management and potential cost efficiencies with different partners externally. And we've seen some very interesting things there. So nothing specific to report now, but I think over the next 6 months to a year, we're going to see some very interesting opportunities for the firm, and we're likely to take action. 
And that -- and to put some numbers around it, we don't have any specific guidance today, but we're talking $20 million, $25 million per annum at least on some of the things we're looking at. And we'll provide more guidance to that in the next quarter."

Brandywine has a few income-oriented funds that are global. Given the demand for income, that's strong.

And then we grew in alternatives also. And I think the right way to answer the question is when we think about the things that push up the fee, [typically we're] higher in equities and alternatives and lower global bond outflows. In any of our outflowing areas that we've experienced over the last several quarters that you're very familiar with, if any of those turn in just -- just a little way, that also helps with the fee rate. And we saw that in the last quarter also in having less outflows in those areas. 
What pushes the fee rate down is if we scale up much faster in institutional fixed income and/or if we see outflows in the higher -- the areas that I just talked about. I think we model out, and I think we've talked about this, a fairly steady fee rate for the year, all else remaining equal. We don't see any reason why we shouldn't be in the 38 area. But there could be a continued significant momentum in institutional fixed income, which could be a very positive reason for the fee rate going down, a lot of people, all else remaining equal. 
So that's -- I think 36 is pretty -- very, very much on the low end of things. And I think we would -- I wouldn't say guide to higher, but I certainly say we would expect to be close to where we are today for the year."

And somebody gave me a fact or a stat that something like 1/3 of asset managers' assets are ESG. And the reality is, and I think maybe we have an advantage as a real global player or anybody who's a global player and has operated in markets in Europe or Australia, has had to have this very focus and incorporated into their investment process. 
So it's our belief that there's going to be no credible manager out there, certainly at an institutional level, without being able to clearly articulate how they're considering ESG risks in their investment process. And we feel very good about all of our teams, and they're having incorporated their consideration of those risks in their investment processes. 
As a matter of fact, we've talked about our investment data lake where we have unique sources of data that are contributed by various teams, and they're available for any teams for their analysis. We've done the same thing on ESG. So we have a portion of our investment data like that is dedicated to ESG. So for example, our global macro team gets 14 different feeds. It goes into the ESG data lake, and that data is now cleansed and available for any of the teams to consider it in their process. 
And that's important as we all know because the top 5 ESG providers only correlate 57% of the time. So you can imagine that it really takes active management and engagement to get accurate ESG information. 
So to answer your question, it is absolutely well incorporated in all of our processes. We also -- Europe is coming out with something, Article 6, Article 8 and Article 9. And we have been very focused on ensuring, I think it's the March date, that the products that are selling there and the ones in our pipeline to sell there qualify for those. So Article 6 is -- it is ESG evaluated and considered. Article 8 is overweight ESG considerations in portfolio construction. And Article 9 is really kind of impact investing. And so we have products like our [Paris] line with our first active global green bond ETF. We have a social infrastructure, and those are getting good flows there, as well as they qualified our political line. 
So we think ESG remains to be seen. And I just anecdotally, prior to lockdown I had visited U.S. institutions a year before the lockdown. And it was very mixed in the U.S  whether or not they were focused on ESG. And right before the lockdown, I visited institutional investors, and every single one was talking about ESG.

So let me -- so first of all, think of it as a really good financial planning tool that's cloud-based so it can be tied into any platform out there.

So let me -- so first of all, think of it as a really good financial planning tool that's cloud-based so it can be tied into any platform out there. But we think if you move -- and that's why we filed a patent on it. Because -- so let's say Rob, you have 3 goals, and your goals are, ""I want to retire. I want to put some money aside for my kids. And I want to -- if there's enough left over and I'm doing really well, I'd like to buy that second home on the beach. I must have enough money to retire. It'd be nice if I can help my kids. And what the heck, I'm rolling the die on that second home."" 
If you think about traditional kind of financial planning model, they interview you and they'd come up with a portfolio based on your risk and it would be a single portfolio. What goal does if it follows your guide path trajectory to your likelihood of achieving that goal. And if you're doing really well and ahead, it rolls the money down -- think of it as a waterfall into your next goal. When you achieve that, it rolls it down into your final goal or however many you have. 
And if you think about how you structure those portfolios, they're very different. You're not going to get the second home unless you stay high octane all out. But your glide path on retirement as you're getting older and closer, you're going to want to be more conservative. 
So it adds that dimension. We worked with universities on doing it. I have to tell you, we -- our data analytics team came up with it. Our AI team came up with it. We pitched the idea, they were a little skeptical. When they looked at the data, [they weren't sure this] really works. 
And so as it has resonated very well as we've shown, because it's a very simple sort of way to think about and it resonates with clients well. Because you're not talking about benchmarks and things. You're talking about things that absolutely mean something to them. 
And we've built it with easy APIs to connect into various platforms. And we find global demand where we are talking to a firm in China who are interested in it. So we see Asia, Europe. It's just really resonated well with the platforms."

So I said 3.7 billion as long as the market increase was within sort of the low single -- low to mid-single digit. Obviously, we've gone quite considerably above that, which does put some pressure on increasing compensation. 
As I mentioned, for the second quarter we can expect compensation line to go up by 2% to 3%. But then that should come down again based on the expense discipline that we've communicated, so 1% to 2% down in the third quarter, another 4% down in the fourth quarter, all else remaining equal. So that's if the assets under management state, it's sort of roughly the levels they're at today. 
So I'd say that the on all the other line items, it's very little change. I think if anything, we're finding ways to create more expense opportunities to bring expenses down as I communicated a moment ago. But I think that the 3.7 billion mostly is a function of the markets being up in the high single digits to double digits. 
double digits is leading us to guide a little bit higher than the 3.7 billion to 3.75 billion. If it comes back down again, it will be 3.7 billion yet, but that's the range. We're trying to keep that as tight as possible as also communicated."

Having said that, we've said that we will continue to grow. We want to double our size of Fiduciary Trust. 
So as opportunities come up, I think we do some smaller bolt-on acquisitions there. We'd love to continue to expand in the alternative space if something made sense there. That's just a hard space to acquire. And we think that fintech is disrupting traditional distribution. 
So you'll see us continuing to make investments, whether they're acquisitions. It just has to be the right one, but we'll certainly make investments in places where we think there's greater distribution opportunity with some fintech investments."

Following the close of the Legg Mason transaction on July 31, the results we announced earlier this morning include the first full quarter of the combined organization. On the call with me today is Greg Johnson, our Executive Chairman; and Matthew Nicholls, our CFO.  
And joining the call for the first time is Adam Spector. Adam joined our firm last July as managing partner of Brandywine Global and additionally became our Executive Vice President and Head of Global Distribution on October 1.  
To start, we hope that everyone is staying healthy and safe. We'd also like to recognize our incredible employees who continue to work hard every day on behalf of our clients and firm.  
It has been 6 months since we closed our acquisition of Legg Mason and its specialist investment managers. And over that time all while under a remote work environment, we've made significant progress in bringing our teams together to maximize our collective potential. We're seeing a high degree of stability within the organization as well as a number of encouraging trends across the business.  
First off, assets under management reached a record high of approximately $1.5 trillion this quarter, driven primarily by strong market performance. That's an increase of $79 billion or 6% during the quarter. 
Turning next to operating and financial results. Adjusted revenues increased by 20% to $1.5 billion, primarily due to an additional month of Legg Mason results. Higher revenues and continued expense discipline resulted in a 28% increase in adjusted operating income to $550 million and an increase in operating margin to 37.2%.  
On the performance front, our investment results improved this quarter with 61%, 66%, 68% and 75% of our strategy composites outperforming their respective benchmarks for the 4 key time periods. Looking deeper into those numbers, Western Asset continues to have standout performance and reached $423 billion in long-term assets and $480 billion in total assets, its highest level on both fronts in over a decade. Brandywine performance rebounded strongly and saw net inflows into global multi-sector products in the latter part of the quarter.  
And as we saw improvement in performance at ClearBridge and across many Franklin Templeton strategies, ClearBridge is another example of one of our specialized investment managers reaching a record in AUM, which was $176 billion at quarter end. Likewise, our Fiduciary Trust net worth AUM is at an all-time high of $32 billion, while the business also generated positive net flows for the quarter. Record AUM levels were also reached for Clarion Partners at $58.1 billion.  
Long-term relative investment performance of our U.S. and international mutual funds also improved this quarter. A significant driver of the improvement was our Franklin Income Fund, and several of our value-oriented equity strategies also generated noteworthy results. We continue to see strong performance in U.S. equities and U.S. fixed income. Our mutual funds that are rated 4 or 5 stars by Morningstar increased during the quarter and now number 140 funds.  
On the distribution front, long-term net outflows were $4.5 billion, which includes $12.6 billion of reinvested distributions. But notably, momentum continued to build with positive flows into a number of our specialized investment managers, including Benefit Street Partners, Clarion Partners, ClearBridge, Fiduciary Trust, Franklin Equity Group, Franklin Templeton Fixed Income; Martin Currie, Royce, and Western Asset Management. Franklin Equity Group saw strong inflows, which were led by the Franklin Biotech Fund, which reached a record $22.5 billion in AUM.  
As of quarter end, we have a promising institutional pipeline of opportunities and a combined total of one but unfunded wins of $11 billion. As we've noted on previous calls, a strategic focus for the firm has been to expand our alternatives platform to offer strategies that do not lend themselves to passive replication. With $127 billion in assets under management in alternatives and robust relationships across the retail channel, we've seen demand for our retail alternative offerings increase. Our EMEA region led the way with a focus on multi-strategy, social infrastructure and real estate.  
Also importantly as we look to deliver investment expertise through our clients' investment vehicle of choice, we now have a top 3 market position in the retail SMA business, which saw positive net flows this quarter and increased to $113 billion in assets.  
In other news, we were excited to launch our new Franklin Templeton Investment Institute, an innovative hub for research and knowledge sharing. Steven Dover will be leading that effort. With the launch of the institute, we're doubling down on what sets our firm apart: unmatched insight and research from experts on the ground in over 70 locations around the world, at the same time tapping into the strength of our collective leadership talent, we've expanded Terrence Murphy's role to become head of equities for Franklin Templeton, while retaining his existing role as CEO of ClearBridge Investments. While our equity teams will continue to maintain their individual investment processes and autonomy, Terrence will facilitate collaboration across the groups to drive results and growth. 
Looking at another key area, capital management remains an important focus. Our strong balance sheet continues to provide us with financial and strategic flexibility to evolve our business. Cash and investments totaled $6.3 billion following the public offering of 750 million aggregate principal senior notes due 2030 issued at a 1.6% coupon. As previously explained, it is our intention to pay down more expensive debt with the proceeds of the offering. 
Excluding net proceeds from the senior note offerings, we have $5.5 billion in cash and investments. We also continue our track record of dividend growth for the 40th consecutive year, with a 4% increase to our regular dividend in December.  
To wrap things up, over the past 6 months, we've created a stronger firm that combines the best of both worlds: global strength and boutique specialization. Our global presence has expanded in key growth markets around the world with a greater range of specialized high-quality investment capabilities, and we think that all points to a positive future.

I mean we are -- for example, our largest distributor has just added 10 new funds. Many of them are Legg Mason funds, and we -- so we're seeing good penetration that is really cross-selling. And again as we talked about, Franklin was much stronger on the independent side; Legg Mason was much stronger on the wirehouse side. And so we've been able to basically cross-sell platform listings and getting through the gatekeepers on those platforms, so that's worked well.  
And just to give you an idea from a diversification of flows, if you look at the top 9, I don't know why I have the top 9 instead of the top 10. But the top 9 of -- it accounts for about 38% of our flows. 5 of those are Legg Mason funds. 4 are Franklin funds, 3 of them are fixed income, 5 are equities, and one is balanced. So we're seeing both diversification by getting products on the platforms, cross-selling on platforms and getting through the gatekeepers and getting them listed. So we'll continue to see more penetration as well as good diversification with the types of products so that we don't have kind of the risk of a single large product that potentially gets out of favor. So it's much more diversified.

That's it, but that's a new one in this day and age of working from home.  
So I did not have the ability to hear what Jenny said, so I'm going to maybe overlap a bit with her comments.  
But in terms of cross-selling, there are a couple of things I would point to. One, the firm's legacy Franklin and legacy Legg Mason had different strength. Franklin was really strong, for instance, in the regional broker-dealers, and we've been able to get Western and ClearBridge products on the platform there. We're seeing positive momentum there.  
At the same time, when we look at something like the wires where Legg Mason traditionally was a little stronger, we've been able to have some real success with BSP there through legacy Legg Mason.  
The same thing is really true if we look outside of the United States where Franklin, for instance was much stronger in Canada, Legg Mason had a real strength in Japan. So we've been able to start some cross-selling initiatives there that are really quite positive.  
And even within countries where outside of the U.S. where both firms were strong like Germany, we had a situation where Franklin was much stronger in the retail banking world, Legg Mason in the private banking world. And again, that lets us sell one set of products into the other legacy distribution system. Those are the types of cross-selling efforts that have been really strong. I would also say that cross-selling comes into play on defense as well where we've had clients, for instance, that are in particular strategies that might be higher alpha, higher tracking error strategies. When they want to derisk, what we've seen is that that money, instead of leaving our system, can shift to another lower-vol strategy that's within the system. So we're actually doing a better job retaining assets through cross-selling as well."

The other thing I would say is that following in the U.S., the sales force is essentially 50-50 legacy Franklin and legacy Legg. That's not true by channel.

It's essentially staying steady. I think the number is around $11 billion. And it's staying steady, not because we're not adding, but because we're actually funding deals out of that. So that's going strong.  
What I would say in terms of consultants is that Franklin Templeton's central distribution has historically distributed to the consultant community, the institutional community for the Franklin investment team. Many of the Legg Mason Investment affiliates, in fact I believe all of them, did that on their own. Going forward, we're having a differentiated approach where the Legg Mason SIMs will continue to call on the consultants as they always have. That's been a really successful channel for them. Remember Legg was much stronger in the institutional business historically, so we're not changing that approach to the investment consultants. Outside of the U.S., some of the smaller former Legg Mason SIMs are beginning to leverage Franklin Templeton's resources, especially in the coverage of field consultants where those SIMs may cover the research centers on their own but will have much more connectivity with the field consultant.  
I would say in general, what we're trying to do with consultants is similar to what we're trying to do with global financial institutions, is recognizing that many of these large consultants are global firms, and we have to face off them holistically as a global firm. So that's how we've organized ourselves, and we are really allowing each investment team to tap into our centralized coverage of consultants as they see fit. In general, the larger [ companies ] like Western might not need help at all in that area, where some of the smaller groups definitely rely on the central distribution team."

So in our numbers and in the guidance that we've given, we've assumed that there will be a pickup in travel and some other G&A items like advertising in terms of the combined company and what we need to do there.

So we would expect G&A to creep up a little bit in the next -- in the last 2 quarters in particular, I would say.  
But that's included in the $3.75 billion of guidance. So I think the number that's more likely to move a little bit, which is what caused the change a little bit in the guidance, is the comp and benefits in line with revenue. And we expect we're selling more, so there's some more commissions involved in that. It's all linked with the growth of the business. So I think we could expect the compensation line on an adjusted basis to go up a couple or so percent, maybe up 3% in the next quarter. But then because of the cost saves from the transaction, I would expect that to come down in the third quarter by about 1% or 2%, and then down again in the fourth quarter by about 4%, probably maybe a little bit more than that, which then gets us to the $3.7 billion to $3.75 billion, maybe a little bit more if the markets stay stable."

So the first stage was really selecting the team, getting them settled into their territories, and that happened. 
The next stage that we're in the middle of right now is -- because they're all trained, the sales teams are trained. But in order for them to really cross-sell effectively, we have to get all of our products cross-listed on the different platforms and research-approved. 
That's really what we're doing now. We've started where you might expect that our largest distribution partners where we think we can get the most bang. We've got 2 of them already where we've onboarded a number of products. We are kind of marching through that, and it's going pretty well. 
So it's really a question of getting the back offices set up correctly and getting things on the platform. The distributors themselves are eager to have it. One of the things we're seeing that across the board is that people want to do more business with fewer bigger players. So the fact that we're able to bring such an array of investment styles, and not only investment styles but different vehicles from fund to SMAs to ETFs to these partners, that makes us much more attractive to them. So they're really working as quickly as they can with us to get our products onboarded. 
As we get onboarded, what we're seeing is that we're able to start to sell more. So for instance at some of the regionals, we've seen a real uptick in December and January for some legacy Legg Mason product on the regional platforms because those are just getting onboarded now. It's continuing work, but it's going well and we're a bit ahead of schedule."

We spend a lot of money on data and information across the investment teams and across the specialized investment managers.

ClearBridge I would say has a very strong capability in ESG, and that's across the board. With that in favor, ClearBridge has seen real growth. 
Brandywine has a few income-oriented funds that are global. Given the demand for income, that's strong. 
Royce, Martin Currie, we saw inflows for them that were more than 5% of the firm, so strong demand there. If you take a look at a group like Clarion, what's more in demand than alternatives? And they're the top of their game in real estate.

And then we grew in alternatives also. And I think the right way to answer the question is when we think about the things that push up the fee, [ typically ] higher in equities and alternatives and lower global bond outflows. In any of our outflowing areas that we've experienced over the last several quarters that you're very familiar with, if any of those turn in just -- just a little way, that also helps with the fee rate. And we saw that in the last quarter also in having less outflows in those areas. 
What pushes the fee rate down is if we scale up much faster in institutional fixed income and/or if we see outflows in the higher -- the areas that I just talked about. I think we model out, and I think we've talked about this, a fairly steady fee rate for the year, all else remaining equal. We don't see any reason why we shouldn't be in the 38 area. But there could be a continued significant momentum in institutional fixed income, which could be a very positive reason for the fee rate going down, [ a lot of ] -- all else remaining equal. 
So that's -- I think 36 is pretty -- very, very much on the low end of things. And I think we would -- we wouldn't say guide to higher, but I'd certainly say we would expect to be close to where we are today for the year."

And somebody gave me a fact or a stat that something like 1/3 of asset managers' assets are ESG. And the reality is, and I think maybe we have an advantage as a real global player or anybody who's a global player and has operated in markets in Europe or Australia, has had to have this very focused and incorporated into their investment process. 
So it's our belief that there's going to be no credible manager out there, certainly at an institutional level, without being able to clearly articulate how they're considering ESG risks in their investment process. And we feel very good about all of our teams, and they're having incorporated their consideration of those risks in their investment processes. 
As a matter of fact, we've talked about our investment data lake where we have unique sources of data that are contributed by various teams, and they're available for any teams for their analysis. We've done the same thing on ESG. So we have a portion of our investment data lake that is dedicated to ESG. So for example, our global macro team gets 14 different feeds. It goes into the ESG data lake, and that data is now cleansed and available for any of the teams to consider it in their process. 
And that's important as we all know because ESG -- the top 5 ESG providers only correlate 57% of the time. So you can imagine that it really takes active management and engagement to get accurate ESG information. 
So to answer your question, it is absolutely well incorporated in all of our processes. We also -- Europe is coming out with something, Article 6, Article 8 and Article 9. And we have been very focused on ensuring, I think it's the March date, that the products that are selling there and the ones in our pipeline to sell there qualify for those. So Article 6 is -- it is ESG evaluated and considered. Article 8 is overweight ESG considerations in like portfolio construction. And Article 9 is really kind of impact investing. And so we have products like our [ Paris line ], we're the first active global green bond ETF. We have a social infrastructure, and those are getting good flows there, as well as they qualified the Article 9. 
So we think ESG remains to be seen. And I just anecdotally, prior to lockdown I had visited U.S. institutions a year before the lockdown. And it was very mixed in the U.S  whether or not they were focused on ESG. And right before the lockdown, I visited institutional investors, and every single one was talking about ESG. 
So that's why we are focused and committed. Adam, I don't know if you want to add to that."

I want to put some money aside for my kids. And I want to -- if there's enough left over and I'm doing really well, I'd like to buy that second home on the beach. I must have enough money to retire. It'd be nice if I can help my kids. And what the heck, I'm rolling the die on that second home."" 
If you think about traditional kind of financial planning model, they interview you, you'd come up with a portfolio based on your risk and it would be a single portfolio. What goal does is it follows your guide path trajectory to your likelihood of achieving that goal. And if you're doing really well and ahead, it rolls the money down -- think of it as a waterfall into your next goal. When you achieve that, it rolls it down into your final goal or however many you have. 
And if you think about how you structure those portfolios, they're very different. You're not going to get the second home unless you stay high octane all out. But your glide path on retirement as you're getting older and closer, you're going to want to be more conservative. 
So it adds that dimension. We worked with universities on doing it. I have to tell you, we -- our data analytics team came up with it. Our AI team came up with it. We pitched the idea, they were a little skeptical. When they looked at the data, they said, this really works. 
And so as it has resonated very well as we've shown, because it's a very simple sort of way to think about and it resonates with clients well. Because you're not talking about benchmarks and things. You're talking about things that absolutely mean something to them.

They've been small, but as we get more traction, we think we'll even pick up more on the institutional side.

So the average fee is in the mid-30s for the SMAs, and the life that you're asking about is between 6 and 8 years. So it's lower fee, but we generally hold them for a longer period. So that's why it's a very good business for us. I just wanted to make sure we answered that question."

So I said $3.7 billion as long as the market increase was within sort of the low single -- low to mid-single digit. Obviously, we've gone quite considerably above that, which does put some pressure on increasing compensation. 
As I mentioned, for the second quarter we can expect compensation line to go up by 2% to 3%. But then that should come down again based on the expense discipline that we've communicated, so 1% to 2% down in the third quarter, another 4% down in the fourth quarter, all else remaining equal. So that's if the assets under managements that -- it's sort of roughly the levels they're at today. 
So I'd say that the -- on all the other line items, very little change. I think if anything, we're finding ways to create more expense opportunities to bring expenses down as I communicated a moment ago. But I think that the   $3.7 billion mostly is a function of the markets being up in the high single digits to double digits is -- low double digits is leading us to guide a little bit higher than the $3.7 billion to $3.75 billion. If it comes back down again, it will be $3.7 billion again, but that's the range. We're trying to keep that as tight as possible as also communicated."

Having said that, we've said that we will continue to grow. We want to double our size of Fiduciary Trust. 
So as opportunities come up, I think we do some smaller bolt-on acquisitions there. We'd love to continue to expand in the alternative space if something made sense there. That's just a hard space to acquire. And we think that fintech is disrupting traditional distribution.

Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Franklin Templeton's second quarter results. Fred Johnson, our Executive Chairman; Matt Nicols, our CFO; and Adam Spector, our Head of Global Distribution, are also on the call with me today. We hope that everyone is well. 
We continue to operate our business effectively, with over 95% of our employees working from home. Broadly speaking, we are planning for a return to office in September, though our approach will be flexible and shaped by local requirements and the status of the pandemic in the countries where we do business. We are encouraged by the number of vaccines that are now being distributed worldwide. Though the rollout rates obviously varied by country, the progress is very promising. Having said that, we have been deeply concerned by the suffering that has resulted from a surge in cases in India and other parts of the world. Our thoughts go out to our employees and clients who have been personally impacted by this terrible disease. 
Turning now to our second fiscal quarter. Today, we are pleased to report financial results that reflect our continued progress, with revenue growth and margin expansion resulting in a 6% increase in adjusted operating income to $581 million. Our financial flexibility remains strong, with cash and investments of $6.2 billion at March 31, net of $250 million of debt paid down in the quarter. 
After only 2 quarters as a combined company, we're experiencing organic growth in a number of key areas. We're now a more robust and diversified active management business, and we're encouraged and excited by our collective potential. Our merger has created a differentiated global firm, which balances scale and specialization, and which we believe offers expanded opportunities for our stockholders, clients and employees as well as the financial professionals with whom we partner. 
Turning to performance. We're seeing an improvement in performance across a broad base of investment strategies from the prior quarter. More than 2/3 of our strategy composites outperformed their respective benchmarks for the 4 key time periods. The number of our mutual funds rated 4 or 5 stars by Moonstar increased to over 140 funds this quarter. 
Turning next to distribution highlights. We're encouraged by the positive results of our new sales initiatives and efforts to deepen relationships. More clients purchased both legacy Franklin Templeton and legacy Legg Mason striking, as demonstrated by our merger wins during this quarter. Our expanded distribution efforts drove an increase in gross sales of 32% from the prior quarter across a broad array of funds, vehicles and asset classes, led by U.S. rate. Long-term inflows increased by $15.9 billion or 19% quarter-over-quarter to $99.4 billion, excluding reinvested distribution. Second quarter long-term net outflows improved to $4.2 billion compared to $4.5 billion in the prior quarter. Importantly, if you exclude reinvesting distribution, net outflows improved by over $10 billion. 
Our sales momentum continued with positive net flows in the Benefit Street Partners, Clarion Partners, ClearBridge, Fiduciary Trust International, Franklin Equity Group, Franklin Couple on Fixed Income, Martin Currie, Royce and Western assets. As we said on previous calls, the firm has been focused on expanding our alternatives platform, and this quarter we did. Alternative strategies grew by $4 billion to $131 billion in assets under management, with contributions from real estate, private credit and retail alternatives. 
Clarion Partners and Benefit Street Partners both reached record AUM levels, and K2 alternative strides also contributed to positive net flows. Fixed income inflows increased by 27% to $53.5 billion from the prior quarter due to positive contributions from a diverse group of fixed income strategies, including core bond, Core+ and corporate. We are pleased that Western Asset experienced net inflows of almost $10 billion in the quarter, its highest level in over a decade. Equity inflows were $32.4 billion, consistent with the prior quarter, excluding reinvestment distributions. 
We continue to see strong interest in our thematic equity strategies. And while it's still early days, we're seeing progress and increased interest in our value strategies. 
As of this quarter's end, our institutional pipeline has increased with a combined total of one but unfunded mandate of $13 billion and is diversified across all asset classes. 
Aside from our specific results for the quarter, we are also pleased to release our corporate social responsibility report in April. We established clear goals and priorities for fiscal year 2021, ESG investing key among them. And we continue to make important strides to keep our diversity inclusion efforts at the forefront. 
Before we open it up to questions, I'd like to thank our outstanding teams around the globe that could give you the extraordinary work every day on behalf of our clients and firm. And they've done so this past year under challenging circumstances. I am grateful for everything they do.

In terms of alternatives, I'd say 2 things happened there. At the top end of the market, we saw really healthy subscriptions into Clarion, K2 and others from the institutional market, but we are also really trying to address the democratization of alternatives and had some very healthy raises for BSP and others in the wires.

So that's an accurate change for this quarter, but not something that you should see happening quarter-over-quarter. 
In terms of solutions in general though, that has become a focus. What we see at our largest distribution partners is that there is a focus on having their advisers focus more on asset gathering and less on portfolio management, which means that the management teams that our biggest partners are really looking to firms like Franklin that are full service offer active sleeves across the entire suite to provide models and solutions.

So from a cross-selling perspective, if you take a look at the 2 organizations premerger, Franklin had much more of a strength in the regional broker-dealer channel. Legg was a little stronger in the wires. There were some geographic differences as well. One of our major, major efforts is to make sure that we take advantage of that complementary nature of the 2 businesses. So if you take a look at what's happened so far year-to-date, we've cross-sold to about 5,000 new advisers, advisers who either owned only legacy Franklin and legacy Legg product or vice versa. And that cross-selling is having a pretty significant impact. Another way to look at that geographically is to think about the presence that say Franklin had in Canada or the Americas where Legg was a little lighter. We're now at about 25% ahead of last year's sales in those regions from legacy Legg Mason. So yes, kind of that cross-selling has had a significant impact."

So we have about 43% of our AUM in fixed income, and there are multiple fixed income franchises within Franklin Templeton. And they all manage differently. So we go anywhere from treasuries, obviously, to private credit with the BSP. And so they all manage differently. With a rising rate environment, obviously, you're going to have an impact on the duration component of the fixed income portfolio. But if you take Western, for example, only 4% of their AUM is actually in government bonds. So the rest of it, they're doing -- they're managing across sectors, bank loan, high yield, emerging markets. And if you have a rising rate environment, chances are that's a better economy -- economic environment, and chances are those -- the credit component and the sector component outperform. So when you look at -- we actually did a study at Western and looked back to 2000, and there were 30x where you had a significant short-term -- or significant period of rate increase, which defined by greater than 15 basis points in a month and was extended. And in that, Western tended to underperform in the short term, but then significantly outperform in 6, 9 and 12 months because what ended up -- and that's versus obviously benchmark and peers. And that's because the credit sector component kicked in on the performance. So institutional clients understand that and are willing to kind of work through, at least that's been our experience."

So first of all, we would -- 93% of our AUM has ESG factors. I mean we think it's here to stay. We don't think anybody could be an active manager without ESG. And all of our investment teams incorporate ESG factors into their investment process. And we think that one of the reason we're so far along in that is, one, as an active manager, we think that the data out there is not particularly good, and it requires engagement by investment teams with companies to actually gather the data. And #2, having as a large -- having a large presence in both Europe and Australia, where really these trends kind of started, we had to develop these products way before they became really important in the U.S. And we think that, again, despite the industry coalescing around things like SASB and TCFD, right now, it really requires engagement of an active manager to do true ESG kind of screening. 
When you look at Europe, they have something called Article 6, Article 8 and Article 9. Article 6 is you do the screen. So our 93% of our AUM would qualify that. In Article 8, we have 25 products there. And Article 8 is, I have a tilt towards ESG. Factors in Article 9 is really impact, and we have 8 funds there. We are seeing good flows into our 2 Paris-aligned climate EPS. Our European total return and our Templeton global climate are both reaching $1 billion, good flows into our social infrastructure fund. I know ClearBridge U.S. Equity Sustainability Fund has been in net sales for the last 12 months. So to answer a little bit of your question, we're seeing flows in a broad set of products. 
And what's interesting, I think you're seeing is the supply side of ESG is really increasing. As you hear like Europe, 1/3 of their COVID relief fund will go into green bonds, which is doubling the size of the market. Obviously, with the Biden infrastructure, if that gets passed, you're going to see increase there. And so there'll be a lot more supply, which will continue to drive this. 
And Adam, I don't know if you want to add any additional details to that."

Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Franklin Templeton's second quarter results. Greg Johnson, our Executive Chairman; Matt Nicholls, our CFO; and Adam Spector, our Head of Global Distribution, are also on the call with me today. We hope that everyone is well. 
We continue to operate our business effectively with over 95% of our employees working from home. Broadly speaking, we are planning for a return to office in September, though our approach will be flexible and shaped by local requirements and the status of the pandemic in the countries where we do business. We are encouraged by the number of vaccines that are now being distributed worldwide. Though the rollout rates obviously vary by country, the progress is very promising. Having said that, we have been deeply concerned by the suffering that has resulted from a surge in cases in India and other parts of the world. Our thoughts go out to our employees and clients who have been personally impacted by this terrible disease.
Turning now to our second fiscal quarter. Today, we are pleased to report financial results that reflect our continued progress with revenue growth and margin expansion resulting in a 6% increase in adjusted operating income to $581 million. Our financial flexibility remained strong with cash and investments of $6.2 billion at March 31, net of $250 million of debt paid down in the quarter.
After only 2 quarters as a combined company, we're experiencing organic growth in a number of key areas. We're now a more robust and diversified active management business, and we're encouraged and excited by our collective potential. Our merger has created a differentiated global firm, which balances scale and specialization and which we believe offers expanded opportunities for our stockholders, clients and employees as well as the financial professionals with whom we partner.
Turning to performance. We're seeing an improvement in performance across a broad base of investment strategies from the prior quarter. More than 2/3 of our strategy composites outperformed their respective benchmarks for the 4 key time periods. The number of our mutual funds rated 4 or 5 stars by Morningstar increased to over 140 funds this quarter. 
Turning next to distribution highlights. We're encouraged by the positive results of our new sales initiatives and efforts to deepen relationships. More clients purchased both legacy Franklin Templeton and legacy Legg Mason striking as demonstrated by our larger wins during this quarter. Our expanded distribution efforts drove an increase in gross sales of 32% from the prior quarter across a broad array of funds, vehicles and asset classes, led by U.S. retail. Long-term inflows increased by $15.9 billion or 19% quarter-over-quarter to $99.4 billion, excluding reinvested distributions. Second quarter long-term net outflows improved to $4.2 billion compared to $4.5 billion in the prior quarter. Importantly, if you exclude reinvesting distributions, net outflows improved by over $10 billion.
Our sales momentum continued with positive net flows into Benefit Street Partners, Clarion Partners, ClearBridge, Fiduciary Trust International, Franklin Equity Group, Franklin Templeton Fixed Income, Martin Currie, Royce and Western Asset. 
As we said on previous calls, the firm has been focused on expanding our alternatives platform, and this quarter we did. Alternative strategies grew by $4 billion to $131 billion in assets under management with contributions from real estate, private credit and retail alternatives.
Clarion Partners and Benefit Street Partners both reached record AUM levels, and K2 alternative strategies also contributed to positive net flows. Fixed income inflows increased by 27% to $53.5 billion from the prior quarter due to positive contributions from a diverse group of fixed income strategies, including core bond, core plus and corporate. We are pleased that Western Asset experienced net inflows of almost $10 billion in the quarter, its highest level in over a decade. Equity inflows were $32.4 billion, consistent with the prior quarter, excluding reinvestment distributions. We continue to see strong interest in our thematic equity strategies. And while it's still early days, we're seeing progress and increased interest in our value strategies. 
As of this quarter's end, our institutional pipeline has increased with a combined total of won but unfunded mandates of $13 billion and is diversified across all asset classes.
Aside from our specific results for the quarter, we are also pleased to release our Corporate Social Responsibility Report in April. We established clear goals and priorities for fiscal year 2021. ESG investing is key among them, and we continue to make important strides to keep our diversity inclusion efforts at the forefront. 
Before we open it up to questions, I'd like to thank our outstanding teams around the globe for continuing their extraordinary work every day on behalf of our clients and firm, and they've done so this past year under challenging circumstances. I am grateful for everything they do.

The U.S. remains, by far, the largest driver of flows, but we're seeing very good flows in Europe and the Americas as well.
In terms of alternatives, I'd say 2 things happened there. At the top end of the market, we saw really healthy subscriptions into Clarion, K2 and others from the institutional market, but we are also really trying to address the democratization of alternatives and had some very healthy raises for BSP and others in the wires. And that's something that I think will continue throughout this year as we have other retail launches for other alternative products throughout our system."

So that's an accurate change for this quarter but not something that you should see happening quarter-over-quarter.
In terms of solutions, in general, though, that has become a focus. What we see at our largest distribution partners is that there is a focus on having their advisers focus more on asset gathering and less on portfolio management, which means that the management teams at our biggest partners are really looking to firms like Franklin that our full-service offer active sleeves across the entire suite to provide models and solutions.

So if you take a look at what's happened so far year-to-date, we've cross-sold to about 5,000 new advisers, advisers who either owned only legacy Franklin and bought legacy Legg product or vice versa. And that cross-selling is having a pretty significant impact. Another way to look at that geographically is to think about the presence that, say, Franklin had in Canada or the Americas where Legg was a little lighter. We're now at about 25% ahead of last year's sales in those regions from legacy Legg Mason. So yes, kind of that cross-selling has had a significant impact."

Obviously, when we get -- and we tend to have a backup in yields or a rising long-term yield environment. On retail bond funds, that tends to cause at least a temporary downdraft or a spike up in redemption sometimes as the NAVs get hit on that. But can you talk about -- for the institutional side, it could be a different dynamic. So can you talk about what clients are saying about that? Or what are their concerns about that or what you perceive as client demand? If we do have a spike up in yields for Western, would you see a temporary sort of elevated redemptions on that? Or do you think that's actually positive for long-term flows?"

So we have about 43% of our AUM in fixed income, and there are multiple fixed income franchises within Franklin Templeton. And they all manage differently. So we go anywhere from treasuries, obviously, to private credit with the BSP. And so they all manage differently. 
With a rising rate environment, obviously, you're going to have an impact on the duration component of the fixed income portfolio. But if you take Western, for example, only 4% of their AUM is actually in government bonds. So the rest of it, they're doing -- they're managing across sectors, bank loan, high yield, emerging markets. And if you have a rising rate environment, chances are that's a better economy -- economic environment, and chances are those -- the credit component and the sector component outperform. 
So when you look at -- we actually did a study at Western and looked back to 2000, and there were 30x where you had a significant short term -- or significant period of rate increase, which defined by greater than 15 basis points in a month and was extended. And in that, Western tended to underperform in the short term but then significantly outperform in 6, 9 and 12 months because what ended up -- and that's versus obviously benchmark and peers. And that's because the credit sector component kicked in on the performance. So institutional clients understand that and are willing to kind of work through, at least that's been our experience."

So in the case of AdvisorEngine, there are tools within AdvisorEngine, and it may be a simple -- the CRM system juncture that an adviser that's sitting on the Schwab platform and custom on the Schwab platform may want to use some of those tools for some of the clients or all of their clients. And they won't use it unless you have integrated to the custody level.

So first of all, we would -- 93% of our AUM has ESG factors. I mean we think it's here to stay. We don't think anybody could be an active manager without ESG. And all of our investment teams incorporate ESG factors into their investment process. 
And we think that one of the reasons we're so far along in that is, one, as an active manager, we think that the data out there is not particularly good, and it requires engagement by investment teams with companies to actually gather the data; and number two, having as a large -- having a large presence in both Europe and Australia, where really these trends kind of started, we had to develop these products way before they became really important in the U.S. And we think that, again, despite the industry coalescing around things like SASB and TCFD, right now, it really requires engagement of an active manager to do true ESG kind of screening.
When you look at Europe, they have something called Article 6, Article 8 and Article 9. Article 6 is you do the screen, so our 93% of our AUM would qualify in that. In Article 8, we have 25 products there. And Article 8 is I have a tilt towards ESG factors. And Article 9 is really impact, and we have 8 funds there. We are seeing good flows into our 2 Paris-aligned climate EPS. Our European total return and our Templeton global climate are both reaching $1 billion, good flows into our infrastructure fund. I know ClearBridge U.S. Equity Sustainability Fund has been in net sales for the last 12 months. So to answer a little bit of your question, we're seeing flows in a broad set of products.
And what's interesting I think you're seeing is the supply side of ESG is really increasing. As you hear like Europe, 1/3 of their COVID relief fund will go into green bonds, which is doubling the size of the market. Obviously, with the Biden infrastructure, if that gets passed, you're going to see increase there. And so there'll be a lot more supply, which will continue to drive this.
And Adam, I don't know if you want to add any additional details to that."

Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Franklin Templeton's results for our third fiscal quarter. Greg Johnson, our Executive Chairman; Matt Nicholls, our CFO; and Adam Spector, our Head of Global Distribution, are also on the call with me today. We hope that everybody is doing well. This past Saturday marked 1 year since we closed on our landmark acquisition of Legg Mason and its specialist investment managers. 
As we stated at the time, this is a growth story for our firm and our focus continues to be on delivering strong investment results for our valued clients. This commitment has been our North Star throughout the past year. Over the past 12 months, through the hard work and dedication of our employees, we've made significant strides bringing together the 2 firms and executing on our growth strategy. We have created a diversified business across asset class, vehicle, client type and region and we're well positioned in key growth areas where there is client demand, including alternatives, fixed income, SMAs and ESG investing. Early on, we redesigned a nimbler and more adaptable distribution model with a more region centric sales approach, pushing our decision-making and resources closer to our clients, and the positive momentum we're seeing around sales flows shows that what we're doing is working. 
Our sales initiatives are resulting in deeper relationships and increased diversification inflows across funds vehicles and asset classes. These factors have led to significant improvement in total net flows since the time of the acquisition. Our combined sales team has been actively cross-selling. In the U.S. alone, almost 6,000 financial advisers have deepened their relationships with Franklin Templeton through enhanced access to newly introduced capabilities. Specifically, this progress has led to growth in key areas of the business. Since the acquisition, we've grown alternatives by 15%, wealth management by 22% and SMAs by 25%. Above all else, we've been incredibly aligned in terms of culture and our focus on delivering strong investment results. Our efforts this past year have translated into a better Franklin Templeton. 
Turning now to our third fiscal quarter where our momentum has been building. [ Ending ] assets under management reached a record high of $1.55 trillion this quarter, and investment performance continues to strengthen across a broad array of investment strategies. Overall, results continue to reflect outperformance in fixed income, including Western Asset and Brandywine Global alternative asset strategies and global and international equity strategies across Franklin Templeton equities. Mutual funds with 4 or 5 star ratings by Morningstar increased to over 150 funds this quarter. 
Turning next to distribution highlights. We saw positive net flows into the majority of our specialist investment managers and Benefit Street Partners, Clarion, ClearBridge Fiduciary Trust International, and Martin Currie, all reached record highs in assets under management. We were pleased to see a record $3.1 billion in net inflows to alternatives, and also that our fixed income net inflows returned to positive territory at $2.1 billion. We made progress diversifying our net flows across funds, vehicles and asset classes during the quarter, scaling smaller products and creating broader sources of revenue. For example, 15 of our top 20 funds with positive flows or products outside of our largest 20 funds, and each have an average AUM of less than $2 billion. 
In the U.S., our collective sales initiatives are yielding positive results with net flows during the quarter. Specifically, we saw net flows into U.S. retail, which is our largest distribution opportunity and in global financial institutions, our largest client opportunity. On the product development front, we launched the $1 billion pre-leverage Western Asset diversified income fund. This was our largest ever fixed income closed-end fund IPO and illustrates the successful partnering of our SIM's investment capabilities with the combined reach of our distribution platform. 
Additional recent strategic developments include: the close of the acquisition of Diamond Hills, high-yield focused U.S. corporate credit mutual funds in July, adding $3.4 billion to assets under management; and the announcement of a merger of Benefit Street Partners Realty Trust with [ Capstead ] Mortgage Corporation, which will create the fourth largest publicly traded commercial mortgage REIT upon closing. 
Looking at our financial results. Our adjusted operating income increased by 3% to $601.2 million from the prior quarter, inclusive of the onetime impact of costs associated with the successful launch of the Western Asset closed-end fund that I just mentioned. And with $6.4 billion in cash and investments the ongoing strength of our balance sheet enables us to invest with confidence in the business and make sure we're best positioned to be a leader in an ever-evolving industry. 
Finally, I want to thank all of our employees for their efforts this past year working under extraordinary circumstances. I'm extremely proud of what we've been able to accomplish on behalf of our clients. Now your questions, operator?"

First of all, I'd say that about 70% of the performance fees are attributed to our largest alternative asset management, specialized investment managers. So that's attributed to Clarion and Benefit Street Partners. Two though, the rest of it comes from a fairly diversified group that represents about half of our specialized investment as it's a very diversified group of specialized investment managers that have been outperforming that have [ produced ] the performance fees. And to the second part of your question, how should we put this into context, this quarter versus future quarters. I think it's important to note that while it reflects the growth of our alternative asset business in particular. This quarter did include 2 quite large episodic performance fees that occurred at the same time. In 1 instance, we had several funds cleared the performance hurdles and became eligible for carried interest distributions, which had accumulated over several years. It's about 4 years actually. In the other, a significant tranche of invested capital became eligible for a long-dated performance fee, and this fund had significant investment performance over the management period, which resulted in a large performance fee. So for this combination of events and timing along with the performance fees at over half of the other specialized investment managers resulted in this elevation of performance fees or elevated performance fee levels. So I would repeat our guidance on performance fees of $10 million per quarter. I think you'll agree that sounds quite low, but we think it's best to be conservative around performance fees, but we do acknowledge that's conservative."

There are a few things that are really working for us and alternatives. One is just the quality firms that we have. We think it's -- they're strong in their individual asset classes, and we're in a number of different alternative areas from real estate to private debt, private equity to hedge funds. We also have an advantage of being able to raise money for alternatives in a geographically diverse base. We're seeing growth around the world in our alternatives. It's not just U.S. flows. A number of our alternatives have an ESG component to them, especially in real estate. And so that combination of ESG and alternatives is resonating, I think, quite strongly. And finally, from the alternative side, I'd say we spent a lot of time concentrating on how to democratize access to alternatives to make sure it's not just institutions in the ultra-high net worth segment that can access alternatives. And we're raising money in retail as well. All of that, to me, speaks to the ability to have continued strong momentum in fundraising there."

And then if you think about our great -- our biggest alternative managers with Clarion and BSP both are income-generating, and that fits very well in the retail space. So it's a matter of educating the advisers on it and getting the brand name out there. But having the relationships that we have, we think that that's just a huge upside opportunity for us there."

What I would highlight is that we added agreement are really a direct result of a concerted effort to cross-sell. So a lot of those additional agreements are onboarding legacy Legg Mason products to Franklin agreements or vice versa. And we've done both. One of the statistics we've called out is that we've cross-sold to about 6,000 new advisers in the U.S. that is advisers who used to do business with only legacy Franklin or legacy Legg Mason. We're able to do that because we're taking on more agreements and putting products on -- more products on broad platforms. We also see a real geographic benefit to taking those new platforms on. If you think about Europe, as an example, in EMEA, where Franklin historically had a stronger distribution footprint. About 15% of our AUM is legacy Legg Mason in terms of retail distribution, but it's about 30% of the flow. So getting products onto those platforms has had a real immediate benefit to us."

That's -- yes, I think that's a good -- I think that's correct, yes. I think it's the way to look at it. I mean I was thinking about Patrick's question. I think the way that we look at it in terms of the increased expenses this quarter versus last qu",364,"Yes. That's -- yes, I think that's a good -- I think that's correct, yes. I think it's the way to look at it. I mean I was thinking about Patrick's question. I think the way that we look at it in terms of the increased expenses this quarter versus last quarter is without the performance-related compensation. And without the closed-end fund launch costs. We would have been slightly down expenses quarter-over-quarter. So I think that's important. And that allows you to calculate in the roughly 50% or 60% of performance-related compensation. But it really depends, Brennan, on which performance fee and which specialized investment manager, which mandate it is, it's a little bit difficult to generalize. But I think in terms of this quarter, that's the right answer. 
In terms of the broader comp ratio, I'll just take advantage of this to give you a quick update, for the year -- for the fourth quarter and comparing it to where we're at now. Our comp ratio, as you can see, was 44% for the quarter, which was consistent to the last quarter, and I expect that to be 43% to 44%. And quarter. That's consistent with comp and benefits being down by about 5%. So that's the comp and benefits line. 
And in terms of Information Systems and Technology, we expect that to be up slightly probably 5% to 7% in the fourth quarter, and that's driven by outsourcing initiatives, which ultimately were helping compensation reductions next year, even somewhat into the fourth quarter. In terms of occupancy expense, we expect this to remain flat in the fourth quarter, perhaps 1% higher because we're working on some interesting opportunities there that result in slightly higher occupancy expense, but then followed by meaningful reductions in 2022. But for the quarter, about flat to 1% higher. And in G&A, as you know, this quarter was sharply higher because of the closed-end fund launch costs. Without that, G&A would have been flat. In terms of our expense guidance for the fourth quarter, we're assuming at least 50% normal -- let's call it, normalized T&E, which lead to about $125 million of G&A for the fourth quarter?"

Instead, I would say if you had to try to categorize it, think about it as more assets that are in line with the European Article 8 or Article 9 definition. That's roughly how we think about what that $200 billion is. Most of the change there really is due to either market performance or flows because we're seeing very strong flows, especially in Europe. If I take a look at our European assets, I think ESG is going to be key in every single market. Europe is just a little bit ahead right now. I believe that Article 8 and 9 type assets, that $200 billion number, that represents something like 15% of our AUM in the EMEA region, but 30% of our flow and 50% of our pipeline. So it is becoming more and more important. So I think you'll see that number rise over time."

Things are working really well there. We're continuing to do well with our biggest partners. We're cross-selling really well. And then the other thing I think we've done incredibly well in the U.S. is to start to bring more specialists to bear from across our investment teams, alternatives, ETFs, et cetera, to client relationships. So that's been really strong. Americas and our European business are roughly flat, and the outflows really have been in Asia. The Asian outflows are -- you know what's going on in India. That's a significant portion of it. some of those one-off equity outflows were in Asia as well. That hurt Asia. And then we've also talked a little bit about some of the issues we've had in Japan. The good news is that we're seeing a turnaround now in Asia. Our Japanese pipeline is really building. It's more diversified. And we're adding new clients there. Our Australian retail business is incredibly strong. I think we're something like 15 months in a row in net positive flow in Australian retail. So really starting to see Asia turn around, and that's been the region that's been the slowest for us. In terms of your other question about what do we see in the future. I really think of distribution as having 1 part that's really the machine, Bill, that's working. And that's the kind of continual grind day in and day out to make sales to fund assets. And that's just going well for us really across the board. So the machine is working. We're working really well in terms of the central distribution teams with our SIMs distribution teams. We're executing on our plan. It's the big chunky stuff that just hasn't been breaking our way lately, and that's what's been really impacting some of the negative numbers. We've got a lot, though in the pipeline, a lot of deals we're working on, and I think those bigger things will start to break for us shortly."

So we've kept -- and we've always said this, that we've kept a strong balance sheet because we want to be opportunistic and have the ability. It is -- we believe we have the broadest product lineup in the industry. And so from an acquisition to go out and do a large-scale acquisition, we would only be adding assets as opposed to capabilities. And often, there's a strategic buyer that will spend more than we will when you're just adding assets. So it's probably unlikely, but we never say never. If the right opportunity came up, we'd be open to it. Having said that, we've been, I think, pretty clear on the areas that we're focused on expanding. We want to grow our alternatives business. It is a major priority for us. We view that when you think about kind of growth opportunities, it's growing while we're $141 billion, and I think bigger than most people realize as far as our old business. It's still less than 10% of our AUM, and we think that there's more opportunity to grow there. We've already stated that we like the high net worth business. It's Fiduciary Trust, again, is one of the premier players in that space. We, again, celebrating their 90 years, a very fragmented market. And we'd like to do more acquisitions there. And what we're finding is there's more pressure on small RIAs that they want to join bigger firms who has all the capabilities that a fiduciary has with their trust and tax planning, generation education. All those things are now being demanded. And so you'll see us, we said, I think when we were a $20 billion that we would -- we'd see ourself growing to $50 million. We're already at $33 billion, and we continue to look to expand there. And then I would just say that if we're opportunities, we'd like to have more scale in places like ETFs, it's -- we love our ETF franchise. We think we have a phenomenal team. If something came up in a particular region that could be interesting to us. But today at 50% active. We actually think we've got really good products in that space. And then I would just say that we've talked about in the past on the fintech side, these will be more smaller investments or acquisitions. There'll be things that are specifically designed to help our distribution capabilities, things like our investment in Embark that was designed specifically for greater penetration on distribution. It turned out to be a good investment, too, but those types of things are -- you'll continue to see us focus there. Matt, do you want to add more?"

But there's -- we've got real missing components of the overall alternative asset strategy group. That we've sort of formed, which is a grouping of companies in the alternative asset space. And for example, we have nothing in the equity alternative asset arena. So we're very focused on that, and we think we're a very good home and we think we've got the right structure to put in place to make it for those companies out there. 
And another -- Jenny, you already mentioned wealth and distribution. The other thing I would think about around this is, in a way, in many ways, it's a capital allocation question. And with our income profile now, if you take the very important dividend into account a couple of hundred million dollars of share repurchases to make sure that we at least offset compensation grants. It leaves us with $1 billion to invest approximately in the firm, and that's unlevered and that will be fully invested in the firm in terms of acquisitions, in terms of investing in the business across all the SIMs, I think we mentioned in our prepared remarks, for example, that we've allocated $440 million new and co-invest capital since we announced the acquisition, that's already turned into over $4 billion of AUM. So it's almost like a tenfold return in that regard in terms of turning it -- from an AUM returns perspective. So we see a lot of opportunities there. We're being very disciplined about how we think about that. The size of our balance sheet gives us more confidence to spend that each year and frankly, we're very active across these areas strategically."

Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Franklin Templeton's results for our third fiscal quarter. Greg Johnson, our Executive Chairman; Matt Nicholls, our CFO; and Adam Spector, our Head of Global Distribution, are also on the call with me today. We hope that everybody is doing well. This past Saturday marked 1 year since we closed on our landmark acquisition of Legg Mason and its specialist investment managers. 
As we stated at the time, this is a growth story for our firm and our focus continues to be on delivering strong investment results for our valued clients. This commitment has been our North Star throughout the past year. Over the past 12 months, through the hard work and dedication of our employees, we've made significant strides bringing together the 2 firms and executing on our growth strategy. We have created a diversified business across asset class, vehicle, client type and region and we're well positioned in key growth areas where there is client demand, including alternatives, fixed income, SMAs and ESG investing. Early on, we redesigned a nimbler and more adaptable distribution model with a more region centric sales approach, pushing our decision-making and resources closer to our clients, and the positive momentum we're seeing around sales flows shows that what we're doing is working. 
Our sales initiatives are resulting in deeper relationships and increased diversification inflows across funds vehicles and asset classes. These factors have led to significant improvement in total net flows since the time of the acquisition. Our combined sales team has been actively cross-selling. In the U.S. alone, almost 6,000 financial advisers have deepened their relationships with Franklin Templeton through enhanced access to newly introduced capabilities. Specifically, this progress has led to growth in key areas of the business. Since the acquisition, we've grown alternatives by 15%, wealth management by 22% and SMAs by 25%. Above all else, we've been incredibly aligned in terms of culture and our focus on delivering strong investment results. Our efforts this past year have translated into a better Franklin Templeton. 
Turning now to our third fiscal quarter where our momentum has been building. [ Ending ] assets under management reached a record high of $1.55 trillion this quarter, and investment performance continues to strengthen across a broad array of investment strategies. Overall, results continue to reflect outperformance in fixed income, including Western Asset and Brandywine Global alternative asset strategies and global and international equity strategies across Franklin Templeton equities. Mutual funds with 4 or 5 star ratings by Morningstar increased to over 150 funds this quarter. 
Turning next to distribution highlights. We saw positive net flows into the majority of our specialist investment managers and Benefit Street Partners, Clarion, ClearBridge Fiduciary Trust International, and Martin Currie, all reached record highs in assets under management. We were pleased to see a record $3.1 billion in net inflows to alternatives, and also that our fixed income net inflows returned to positive territory at $2.1 billion. We made progress diversifying our net flows across funds, vehicles and asset classes during the quarter, scaling smaller products and creating broader sources of revenue. For example, 15 of our top 20 funds with positive flows or products outside of our largest 20 funds, and each have an average AUM of less than $2 billion. 
In the U.S., our collective sales initiatives are yielding positive results with net flows during the quarter. Specifically, we saw net flows into U.S. retail, which is our largest distribution opportunity and in global financial institutions, our largest client opportunity. On the product development front, we launched the $1 billion pre-leverage Western Asset diversified income fund. This was our largest ever fixed income closed-end fund IPO and illustrates the successful partnering of our SIM's investment capabilities with the combined reach of our distribution platform. 
Additional recent strategic developments include: the close of the acquisition of Diamond Hills, high-yield focused U.S. corporate credit mutual funds in July, adding $3.4 billion to assets under management; and the announcement of a merger of Benefit Street Partners Realty Trust with [ Capstead ] Mortgage Corporation, which will create the fourth largest publicly traded commercial mortgage REIT upon closing. 
Looking at our financial results. Our adjusted operating income increased by 3% to $601.2 million from the prior quarter, inclusive of the onetime impact of costs associated with the successful launch of the Western Asset closed-end fund that I just mentioned. And with $6.4 billion in cash and investments the ongoing strength of our balance sheet enables us to invest with confidence in the business and make sure we're best positioned to be a leader in an ever-evolving industry. 
Finally, I want to thank all of our employees for their efforts this past year working under extraordinary circumstances. I'm extremely proud of what we've been able to accomplish on behalf of our clients. Now your questions, operator?"

First of all, I'd say that about 70% of the performance fees are attributed to our largest alternative asset management, specialized investment managers.

Two though, the rest of it comes from a fairly diversified group that represents about half of our specialized investment as it's a very diversified group of specialized investment managers that have been outperforming that have [ produced ] the performance fees. And to the second part of your question, how should we put this into context, this quarter versus future quarters. I think it's important to note that while it reflects the growth of our alternative asset business in particular. This quarter did include 2 quite large episodic performance fees that occurred at the same time. In 1 instance, we had several funds cleared the performance hurdles and became eligible for carried interest distributions, which had accumulated over several years. It's about 4 years actually. In the other, a significant tranche of invested capital became eligible for a long-dated performance fee, and this fund had significant investment performance over the management period, which resulted in a large performance fee. So for this combination of events and timing along with the performance fees at over half of the other specialized investment managers resulted in this elevation of performance fees or elevated performance fee levels. So I would repeat our guidance on performance fees of $10 million per quarter. I think you'll agree that sounds quite low, but we think it's best to be conservative around performance fees, but we do acknowledge that's conservative."

We think it's -- they're strong in their individual asset classes, and we're in a number of different alternative areas from real estate to private debt, private equity to hedge funds. We also have an advantage of being able to raise money for alternatives in a geographically diverse base. We're seeing growth around the world in our alternatives. It's not just U.S. flows. A number of our alternatives have an ESG component to them, especially in real estate. And so that combination of ESG and alternatives is resonating, I think, quite strongly. And finally, from the alternative side, I'd say we spent a lot of time concentrating on how to democratize access to alternatives to make sure it's not just institutions in the ultra-high net worth segment that can access alternatives. And we're raising money in retail as well. All of that, to me, speaks to the ability to have continued strong momentum in fundraising there."

And then if you think about our great -- our biggest alternative managers with Clarion and BSP both are income-generating, and that fits very well in the retail space. So it's a matter of educating the advisers on it and getting the brand name out there. But having the relationships that we have, we think that that's just a huge upside opportunity for us there."

What I would highlight is that we added agreement are really a direct result of a concerted effort to cross-sell. So a lot of those additional agreements are onboarding legacy Legg Mason products to Franklin agreements or vice versa. And we've done both. One of the statistics we've called out is that we've cross-sold to about 6,000 new advisers in the U.S. that is advisers who used to do business with only legacy Franklin or legacy Legg Mason. We're able to do that because we're taking on more agreements and putting products on -- more products on broad platforms. We also see a real geographic benefit to taking those new platforms on. If you think about Europe, as an example, in EMEA, where Franklin historically had a stronger distribution footprint. About 15% of our AUM is legacy Legg Mason in terms of retail distribution, but it's about 30% of the flow. So getting products onto those platforms has had a real immediate benefit to us."

I think it's the way to look at it. I mean I was thinking about Patrick's question. I think the way that we look at it in terms of the increased expenses this quarter versus last quarter is without the performance-related compensation. And without the closed-end fund launch costs. We would have been slightly down expenses quarter-over-quarter. So I think that's important. And that allows you to calculate in the roughly 50% or 60% of performance-related compensation. But it really depends, Brennan, on which performance fee and which specialized investment manager, which mandate it is, it's a little bit difficult to generalize. But I think in terms of this quarter, that's the right answer. 
In terms of the broader comp ratio, I'll just take advantage of this to give you a quick update, for the year -- for the fourth quarter and comparing it to where we're at now. Our comp ratio, as you can see, was 44% for the quarter, which was consistent to the last quarter, and I expect that to be 43% to 44%. And quarter. That's consistent with comp and benefits being down by about 5%. So that's the comp and benefits line. 
And in terms of Information Systems and Technology, we expect that to be up slightly probably 5% to 7% in the fourth quarter, and that's driven by outsourcing initiatives, which ultimately were helping compensation reductions next year, even somewhat into the fourth quarter. In terms of occupancy expense, we expect this to remain flat in the fourth quarter, perhaps 1% higher because we're working on some interesting opportunities there that result in slightly higher occupancy expense, but then followed by meaningful reductions in 2022. But for the quarter, about flat to 1% higher. And in G&A, as you know, this quarter was sharply higher because of the closed-end fund launch costs. Without that, G&A would have been flat. In terms of our expense guidance for the fourth quarter, we're assuming at least 50% normal -- let's call it, normalized T&E, which lead to about $125 million of G&A for the fourth quarter?"

If I take a look at our European assets, I think ESG is going to be key in every single market. Europe is just a little bit ahead right now. I believe that Article 8 and 9 type assets, that $200 billion number, that represents something like 15% of our AUM in the EMEA region, but 30% of our flow and 50% of our pipeline.

So that's been really strong. Americas and our European business are roughly flat, and the outflows really have been in Asia. The Asian outflows are -- you know what's going on in India. That's a significant portion of it. some of those one-off equity outflows were in Asia as well. That hurt Asia. And then we've also talked a little bit about some of the issues we've had in Japan. The good news is that we're seeing a turnaround now in Asia. Our Japanese pipeline is really building. It's more diversified. And we're adding new clients there.

I really think of distribution as having 1 part that's really the machine, Bill, that's working. And that's the kind of continual grind day in and day out to make sales to fund assets. And that's just going well for us really across the board. So the machine is working. We're working really well in terms of the central distribution teams with our SIMs distribution teams. We're executing on our plan. It's the big chunky stuff that just hasn't been breaking our way lately, and that's what's been really impacting some of the negative numbers. We've got a lot, though in the pipeline, a lot of deals we're working on, and I think those bigger things will start to break for us shortly."

We've gone back for as far as we have data for the combined companies, and this quarter was always the slowest for gross sales. So there is a seasonal effect that's historic. In terms of the largest funds, right, if you think about things like Western Core or [ Dynatec ] or the income fund, those are still among our top-selling funds and are in positive flow. So a number of the largest funds still are growing. So we do think that we have the right balance between the absolute largest funds growing, but it's not only the largest funds that are growing. We've got a number of funds that are under, say, $2 billion where we see a lot of momentum. And I think that speaks really lend to the longer-term stability of the business. And one of the things we're trying to focus on is to really build a stable base for years to come. And I think when you're too focused in 1 geography and 1 vehicle type and 1 investment schemes, that creates a little instability in the business. So we're glad that a few of those huge funds are still growing are net flow positive, but we want to add diversification to the mix as well."

So we've kept -- and we've always said this, that we've kept a strong balance sheet because we want to be opportunistic and have the ability. It is -- we believe we have the broadest product lineup in the industry. And so from an acquisition to go out and do a large-scale acquisition, we would only be adding assets as opposed to capabilities. And often, there's a strategic buyer that will spend more than we will when you're just adding assets. So it's probably unlikely, but we never say never. If the right opportunity came up, we'd be open to it. Having said that, we've been, I think, pretty clear on the areas that we're focused on expanding. We want to grow our alternatives business. It is a major priority for us. We view that when you think about kind of growth opportunities, it's growing while we're $141 billion, and I think bigger than most people realize as far as our old business. It's still less than 10% of our AUM, and we think that there's more opportunity to grow there. We've already stated that we like the high net worth business. It's Fiduciary Trust, again, is one of the premier players in that space. We, again, celebrating their 90 years, a very fragmented market. And we'd like to do more acquisitions there. And what we're finding is there's more pressure on small RIAs that they want to join bigger firms who has all the capabilities that a fiduciary has with their trust and tax planning, generation education. All those things are now being demanded. And so you'll see us, we said, I think when we were a $20 billion that we would -- we'd see ourself growing to $50 million. We're already at $33 billion, and we continue to look to expand there. And then I would just say that if we're opportunities, we'd like to have more scale in places like ETFs, it's -- we love our ETF franchise. We think we have a phenomenal team. If something came up in a particular region that could be interesting to us. But today at 50% active. We actually think we've got really good products in that space. And then I would just say that we've talked about in the past on the fintech side, these will be more smaller investments or acquisitions. There'll be things that are specifically designed to help our distribution capabilities, things like our investment in Embark that was designed specifically for greater penetration on distribution. It turned out to be a good investment, too, but those types of things are -- you'll continue to see us focus there. Matt, do you want to add more?"

And you covered it perfectly. I think just a little bit more on the outside. I mean I think, Alex, the way we sort of think about the alternatives business is that's probably about 15% of our adjusted revenue at the moment. And we would like that to be significantly more than that. As you know, it's a large and growing area of asset management, and we have a really small market share overall. We think it's great what we have, and we're very pleased with the growth rate organically and the ability to bolt things on, such as the REIT transaction, which just have Benefit Street Partners. But there's -- we've got real missing components of the overall alternative asset strategy group. That we've sort of formed, which is a grouping of companies in the alternative asset space. And for example, we have nothing in the equity alternative asset arena. So we're very focused on that, and we think we're a very good home and we think we've got the right structure to put in place to make it for those companies out there. 
And another -- Jenny, you already mentioned wealth and distribution. The other thing I would think about around this is, in a way, in many ways, it's a capital allocation question. And with our income profile now, if you take the very important dividend into account a couple of hundred million dollars of share repurchases to make sure that we at least offset compensation grants. It leaves us with $1 billion to invest approximately in the firm, and that's unlevered and that will be fully invested in the firm in terms of acquisitions, in terms of investing in the business across all the SIMs, I think we mentioned in our prepared remarks, for example, that we've allocated $440 million new and co-invest capital since we announced the acquisition, that's already turned into over $4 billion of AUM. So it's almost like a tenfold return in that regard in terms of turning it -- from an AUM returns perspective. So we see a lot of opportunities there. We're being very disciplined about how we think about that. The size of our balance sheet gives us more confidence to spend that each year and frankly, we're very active across these areas strategically."

Greg Johnson, our Executive Chairman; Matt Nicholls, our CFO; and Adam Spector, our Head of Global Distribution, are also on the call with me today. We hope that everybody is doing well. 
This past Saturday marked 1 year since we closed on our landmark acquisition of Legg Mason and its specialist investment managers. As we stated at the time, this is a growth story for our firm and our focus continues to be on delivering strong investment results for our valued clients. This commitment has been our North Star throughout the past year. Over the past 12 months, through the hard work and dedication of our employees, we've made significant strides bringing together the 2 firms and executing on our growth strategy. We have created a diversified business across asset class, vehicle, client type and region and we're well positioned in key growth areas where there is client demand, including alternatives, fixed income, SMAs and ESG investing. 
Early on, we redesigned a nimbler and more adaptable distribution model with a more region-centric sales approach, pushing our decision-making and resources closer to our clients, and the positive momentum we're seeing around sales flows shows that what we're doing is working. Our sales initiatives are resulting in deeper relationships and increased diversification in flows across funds, vehicles and asset classes. These factors have led to significant improvement in total net flows since the time of the acquisition. 
Our combined sales team has been actively cross-selling. In the U.S. alone, almost 6,000 financial advisers have deepened their relationships with Franklin Templeton through enhanced access to newly introduced capabilities. Specifically, this progress has led to growth in key areas of the business. Since the acquisition, we've grown alternatives by 15%, wealth management by 22% and SMAs by 25%. Above all else, we've been incredibly aligned in terms of culture and our focus on delivering strong investment results. Our efforts this past year have translated into a better, stronger Franklin Templeton. 
Turning now to our third fiscal quarter where our momentum has been building. Ending assets under management reached a record high of $1.55 trillion this quarter, and investment performance continues to strengthen across a broad array of investment strategies. Overall, results continue to reflect outperformance in fixed income, including Western Asset and Brandywine Global alternative asset strategies and global and international equity strategies across Franklin Templeton equities. Mutual funds with 4 or 5 star ratings by Morningstar increased to over 150 funds this quarter. 
Turning next to distribution highlights. We saw positive net flows into the majority of our specialist investment managers and Benefit Street Partners, Clarion, ClearBridge, Fiduciary Trust International, and Martin Currie, all reached record highs in assets under management. We were pleased to see a record $3.1 billion in net inflows to alternatives, and also that our fixed income net inflows returned to positive territory at $2.1 billion. We made progress diversifying our net flows across funds, vehicles and asset classes during the quarter, scaling smaller products and creating broader sources of revenue. For example, 15 of our top 20 funds with positive flows or products outside of our largest 20 funds, and each have an average AUM of less than $2 billion. 
In the U.S., our collective sales initiatives are yielding positive results with net flows during the quarter. Specifically, we saw net flows into U.S. retail, which is our largest distribution opportunity and in global financial institutions, our largest client opportunity. On the product development front, we launched the $1 billion pre-leverage Western Asset Diversified Income Fund. This was our largest ever fixed income closed-end fund IPO and illustrates the successful partnering of our SIMs investment capabilities with the combined reach of our distribution platform. 
Additional recent strategic developments include: the close of the acquisition of Diamond Hill's high yield-focused U.S. corporate credit mutual funds in July, adding $3.4 billion to assets under management; and the announcement of a merger of Benefit Street Partners Realty Trust with Capstead Mortgage Corporation, which will create the fourth largest publicly traded commercial mortgage REIT upon closing. 
Looking at our financial results. Our adjusted operating income increased by 3% to $601.2 million from the prior quarter, inclusive of the onetime impact of costs associated with the successful launch of the Western Asset closed-end fund that I just mentioned. And with $6.4 billion in cash and investments, the ongoing strength of our balance sheet enables us to invest with confidence in the business and make sure we're best positioned to be a leader in an ever-evolving industry. 
Finally, I want to thank all of our employees for their efforts this past year working under extraordinary circumstances. I'm extremely proud of what we've been able to accomplish on behalf of our clients. Now to your questions, operator?"

First of all, I'd say that about 70% of the performance fees are attributed to our largest alternative asset management, specialized investment managers. So that's attributed to Clarion and Benefit Street Partners. Two, though, the rest of it comes from a fairly diversified group that represents about half of our specialized investment managers. So it's a very diversified group of specialized investment managers that have been outperforming that have produced the performance fees. 
While -- and then to the second part of your question, how should we put this into context, this quarter versus future quarters. I think it's important to note that while it reflects the growth of our alternative asset business in particular. This quarter did include 2 quite large episodic performance fees that occurred at the same time. In one instance, we had several funds cleared the performance hurdles and became eligible for carried interest distributions, which had accumulated over several years. It's about 4 years actually. 
In the other, a significant tranche of invested capital became eligible for a long-dated performance fee, and this fund had significant investment performance over the management period, which resulted in a large performance fee. So for this combination of events and timing along with the performance fees at over half of the other specialized investment managers resulted in this elevation of performance fees or elevated performance fee levels. So I would repeat our guidance on performance fees of $10 million per quarter. I think you'll agree that sounds quite low, but we think it's best to be conservative around performance fees, but we do acknowledge that's conservative."

We think it's -- they're strong in their individual asset classes, and we're in a number of different alternative areas from real estate to private debt, private equity to hedge funds. We also have an advantage of being able to raise money for alternatives in a geographically diverse base. We're seeing growth around the world and our alternatives. It's not just U.S. flows. A number of our alternatives have an ESG component to them, especially in real estate. And so that combination of ESG and alternatives is resonating, I think, quite strongly. 
And finally, from the alternative side, I'd say we spent a lot of time concentrating on how to democratize access to alternatives to make sure it's not just institutions in the ultra-high net worth segment that can access alternatives. And we're raising money in retail as well. All of that, to me, speaks to the ability to have continued strong momentum in fundraising there."

One of the statistics we've called out is that we've cross-sold to about 6,000 new advisers in the U.S. that is advisers who used to do business with only legacy Franklin or legacy Legg Mason. We're able to do that because we're taking on more agreements and putting products on -- more products on broad platforms. We also see a real geographic benefit to taking those new platforms on. If you think about Europe, as an example, in EMEA, where Franklin historically had a stronger distribution footprint, about 15% of our AUM is legacy Legg Mason in terms of retail distribution, but it's about 30% of the flow.

I think it's the way to look at it. I mean I was thinking about Patrick's question. I think the way that we look at it in terms of the increased expenses this quarter versus last quarter is without the performance-related compensation and without the closed-end fund launch costs, we would have been slightly down expenses quarter-over-quarter. So I think that's important. And that allows you to calculate in the roughly 50% or 60% of performance-related compensation. But it really depends, Brennan, on which performance fee and which specialized investment manager, which mandate it is, it's a little bit difficult to generalize. But I think in terms of this quarter, that's the right answer. 
In terms of the broader comp ratio, I'll just take advantage of this to give you a quick update for the year -- for the fourth quarter and comparing it to where we're at now. Our comp ratio, as you can see, was 44% for the quarter, which was consistent to the last quarter, and I expect that to be 43% to 44% next quarter. That's consistent with comp and benefits being down by about 5%. So that's the comp and benefits line. 
And in terms of information systems and technology, we expect that to be up slightly, probably 5% to 7% in the fourth quarter, and that's driven by outsourcing initiatives, which ultimately were helping compensation reductions next year, even somewhat into the fourth quarter. In terms of occupancy expense, we expect this to remain flat in the fourth quarter, perhaps 1% higher because we're working on some interesting opportunities there that result in slightly higher occupancy expense, but then followed by meaningful reductions in 2022. But for the quarter, about flat to 1% higher. 
And in G&A, as you know, this quarter was sharply higher because of the closed-end fund launch costs. Without that, G&A would have been flat. In terms of our expense guidance for the fourth quarter, we're assuming at least 50% normal -- let's call it, normalized T&E, which lead to about $125 million of G&A for the fourth quarter?"

That's roughly how we think about what that $200 billion is. 
Most of the change there really is due to either market performance or flows because we're seeing very strong flows, especially in Europe. If I take a look at our European assets, I think ESG is going to be key in every single market. Europe is just a little bit ahead right now. I believe that Article 8 and 9 type assets, that $200 billion number, that represents something like 15% of our AUM in the EMEA region, but 30% of our flow and 50% of our pipeline. So it is becoming more and more important. So I think you'll see that number rise over time."

So from a regional perspective, U.S. is really our largest market. It's somewhere between 70% and 75% of total AUM. And we are net flow positive, both for the quarter and year-to-date. Things are working really well there. We're continuing to do well with our biggest partners. We're cross-selling really well. And then the other thing I think we've done incredibly well in the U.S. is to start to bring more specialists to bear from across our investment teams, alternatives, ETFs, et cetera, to client relationships. So that's been really strong. Americas and our European business are roughly flat, and the outflows really have been in Asia. The Asian outflows are -- you know what's going on in India. That's a significant portion of it. Some of those one-off equity outflows were in Asia as well. That hurt Asia. 
And then we've also talked a little bit about some of the issues we've had in Japan. The good news is that we're seeing a turnaround now in Asia. Our Japanese pipeline is really building. It's more diversified and we're adding new clients there. Our Australian retail business is incredibly strong. I think we're something like 15 months in a row in net positive flow in Australian retail. So really starting to see Asia turn around, and that's been the region that's been the slowest for us. 
In terms of your other question about what do we see in the future. I really think of distribution as having that one part that's really the machine, Bill, that's working. And that's the kind of continual grind, day in and day out to make sales to defend assets. And that's just going well for us really across the board. So the machine is working. We're working really well in terms of the central distribution teams with our SIMs distribution teams. We're executing on our plan. It's the big chunky stuff that just hasn't been breaking our way lately, and that's what's been really impacting some of the negative numbers. We've got a lot, though, in the pipeline, a lot of deals we're working on, and I think those bigger things will start to break for us shortly."

In terms of the largest funds, right, if you think about things like Western core or DynaTech or the income fund, those are still among our top-selling funds and are in positive flow. So a number of the largest funds still are growing. So we do think that we have the right balance between the absolute largest funds growing, but it's not only the largest funds that are growing. We've got a number of funds that are under, say, $2 billion where we see a lot of momentum. And I think that speaks really lend to the longer-term stability of the business. 
And one of the things we're trying to focus on is to really build a stable base for years to come. And I think when you're too focused in one geography and one vehicle type and one investment team, that creates a little instability in the business.

It is -- we believe we have the broadest product lineup in the industry. And so from an acquisition -- to go out and do a large-scale acquisition, we would only be adding assets as opposed to capabilities. And often, there's a strategic buyer that will spend more than we will when you're just adding some assets. So it's probably unlikely, but we never say never if the right opportunity came up, we'd be open to it. 
Having said that, we've been, I think, pretty clear on the areas that we're focused on expanding. We want to grow our alternatives business. It is a major priority for us. We view that when we think about kind of growth opportunities, it's growing our alt. While we're $141 billion and I think bigger than most people realize as far as our alt business, it's still less than 10% of our AUM, and we think that there's more opportunity to grow there. 
We've already stated that we like the high net worth business. It's Fiduciary Trust, again, is one of the premier players in that space. We, again, celebrating their 90 years, a very fragmented market. and we'd like to do more acquisitions there. And what we're finding is there's more pressure on small RIAs that they want to join bigger firms who has all the capabilities that a fiduciary has with their trust and tax planning, generation education. All those things are now being demanded. 
And so you'll see us, we said, I think when we were a $20 billion that we would -- we'd see ourself growing to $50 million. We're already at $33 billion, and we continue to look to expand there. And then I would just say that if there are opportunities, we'd like to have more scale in places like ETFs, it's -- we love our ETF franchise. We think we have a phenomenal team -- if something came up in a particular region that could be interesting to us. But today at 50% active, we actually think we've got really good products in that space. 
And then I would just say that we've talked about in the past on the fintech side, these will be more smaller investments or acquisitions. There'll be things that are specifically designed to help our distribution capabilities, things like our investment in Embark that was designed specifically for greater penetration on distribution. It turned out to be a good investment, too, but those types of things are -- you'll continue to see us focus there. Matt, do you have anything to add?"

I think just a little bit more on the alt side, I mean, I think, Alex, the way we sort of think about the alternatives business is that's probably about 15% of our adjusted revenue at the moment. And we would like that to be significantly more than that. As you know, it's a large and growing area of asset management, and we have a really small market share overall. We think it's great what we have, and we're very pleased with the growth rate both organically and the ability to bolt things on, such as the REIT transaction. We just have Benefit Street Partners. 
But there's -- we've got real missing components of the overall alternative asset strategy group that we've sort of formed, which is a grouping of companies in the alternative asset space. And for example, we have nothing in the equity alternative asset arena. So we're very focused on that, and we think we're a very good home and we think we've got the right structure to put in place to make it very attractive for those companies out there. 
And another -- Jenny already mentioned wealth and distribution. The other thing I would think about around this is, in a way, in many ways, it's a capital allocation question. And with our income profile now, if you take the very important dividend into account a couple of hundred million dollars of share repurchases to make sure that we at least offset compensation grants, it leaves us with $1 billion to invest approximately in the firm, and that's unlevered and that will be fully invested in the firm in terms of acquisitions, in terms of investing in the business across all the SIMs. 
I think we mentioned in our prepared remarks, for example, that we've allocated $440 million new seed and co-invest capital since we announced the acquisition, that's already turned into over $4 billion of AUM. So it's almost like a tenfold return in that regard in terms of turning it from an AUM returns perspective. So we see a lot of opportunities there. And We're being very disciplined about how we think about that. The size of our balance sheet gives us more confidence to spend that money each year and frankly, we're very active across these areas strategically."

Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Franklin Templeton's results for our fourth quarter and fiscal year. We're also very excited to announce the acquisition of Lexington Partners, and I am delighted to extend our warmest welcome to such a talented team. 
Lexington's business provides us the exposure to a critical growth area in the alternative asset business, and we cannot be happier with this new partnership. We'll cover more on this transaction in a few minutes. 
Matthew Nicholls, our CFO; and Adam Spector, our Head of Global Distribution, are on the call with me today. We're also joined by Tom Gann, Head of Franklin Templeton Alternatives and Will Warren, President of Lexington Partners, who will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. 
I'll start by reviewing this year's milestones, then Matt will go through our financial results for the quarter and the fiscal year as well as spend some time discussing today's important transaction in greater detail. 
Throughout Franklin Templeton's history, we have invested in our business to build a truly diversified and resilient organization that performs across market cycles with a commitment to serving our clients, employees and shareholders. The results that we announced today represent the first full fiscal year since we closed the Legg Mason acquisition, a transformational transaction that created a more balanced business across asset classes, client mix and geographies. 
We are pleased to report that the strategic and financial benefits from our acquisition of Legg Mason exceeded our goals, and we have added important growth opportunities. Over the course of the year, we have created a management team consisting of key representation from Franklin Templeton, Legg Mason and our specialist investment managers. We have maintained our culture while invigorating collaboration and innovation across the firm. 
Through the hard work and dedication of our employees, we've successfully brought 2 firms together to maximize our collective potential, one that successfully combines the attributes of global strength with boutique specialization. We've made strong progress and yet in so many ways, we're just getting started. 
Turning to investment performance. There's been an improvement in performance across a broad base of investment strategies. Through September, 71%, 69%, 72% and 77% of strategy composites outperformed their respective benchmarks across the 4 key time periods. This quarter, we had 53% of mutual fund AUM in funds with 4- or 5-star ratings by Morningstar compared to 43% a year ago. 
During the year, we focused on updating our global distribution efforts by enhancing our generalist specialist model, reshaping client coverage and deepening relationships in each sales region, particularly with the largest global financial institutions. 
Fiscal year long-term inflows doubled to $365 billion from the prior year, notably the U.S., which is our largest sales region with over $1.1 trillion in AUM was net flow positive for the year. In terms of notable organic growth, we saw positive net flows in our core growth areas, including alternatives, SMAs, wealth management and ESG-specific strategies. We executed important acquisitions to further grow and diversify our business in alternative assets, customization and distribution of investment strategies. 
In terms of other accomplishments, our alternative asset strategies, an important area of focus for us, generated positive net flows in each quarter during the year and grew by 19% from the prior year to $145 billion in AUM with contributions from a diverse group of strategies, including real estate, infrastructure, private debt and hedge funds. 
Several years ago, we announced our intention to create a full suite of alternative strategies, and we have been very deliberate in building our capabilities. In 2018, the acquisition of Benefit Street Partners brought us a leading alternative credit manager. In 2020, we added a world-class real estate manager with Clarion Partners. This focus on alternatives led us to today's announcement of the acquisition of Lexington Partners, a leader in secondary private equity and co-investments. We now have top-tier specialist investment managers in all of the key alternative categories with Benefit Street Partners, Clarion Partners, Franklin Venture Partners, and now Lexington Partners. 
Specifically with the Lexington Partners transaction, I'm excited that Franklin Templeton will be partnering with such an outstanding firm that is led by an experienced and talented team immediately bringing us scale and capabilities in an attractive and growing global market. There will be no changes to the team or its independent investment management product, and they will continue to operate autonomously as Lexington partners. 
Upon the close of this transaction, we expect our alternative AUM to approach approximately $200 billion and over $1 billion in revenue, excluding performance fees, Matt will review the additional details of the transaction shortly. 
Another core growth area is our separately managed account business. We are a top 3 provider in SMAs with $125 billion in assets under management, which is one of the fastest-growing segments in retail. Our SMA business grew by 23% in AUM year-over-year and generated positive net flows in each quarter during the fiscal year. 
Our recently announced acquisition of O'Shaughnessy Asset Management and its custom indexing platform, Canvas, will take our existing strengths in SMAs to the next level enhancing our tax management factor-based and ESG customization capabilities. Canvas was launched in late 2019 and has seen strong growth since its inception and now represents $1.9 billion of the firm's total aim of $6.3 billion as of September 30. The transaction will bring compelling benefits to the clients that both companies serve across multiple channels. 
There's no question that investors are more focused on ESG goals than ever before. Increasingly, there are 3 dimensions to ESG that investors consider: ESG factors, as understood risks in a portfolio; how ESG contributes to overall returns and the overall impact of ESG considerations to society and the environment. 
As an active manager, approximately 95% of our AUM represents strategies that consider ESG factors as part of the investment process and ESG-specific strategies representing over $200 billion in AUM were net flow positive in each quarter this fiscal year. 
All this being said, none of our accomplishments this past year would be possible, if it weren't for our employees. We are extremely fortunate to have such dedicated colleagues who are focused on achieving investment excellence, fostering enduring relationships and delivering superior service to our broad range of investors around the globe.
Now I'd like to turn it over to our CFO, Matt Nicholls, who will review our financial results from the fourth quarter and fiscal year as well as take you through the specifics of the Lexington transaction. Matt?"

Fourth quarter long-term net outflows were $9.9 million, which were partially offset by the acquisition of Diamond Hill's high-yield focused U.S. corporate credit mutual funds, which added $3.5 billion in AUM and closed in July. This q",1062,"Thank you, Jenny. Fourth quarter long-term net outflows were $9.9 million, which were partially offset by the acquisition of Diamond Hill's high-yield focused U.S. corporate credit mutual funds, which added $3.5 billion in AUM and closed in July. 
This quarter included the previously disclosed $5.4 billion 529 plan redemption, which included $4.7 billion of long-term assets, a $2 billion fixed income institutional redemption that had minimal impact to revenue and $800 million of fixed income outflows from the nonmanagement fee earning India credit funds that are in the process of liquidation. 
Reinvested dividends were $2.3 billion this quarter, 1% higher average assets under management of $1.55 trillion compared to the prior quarter plus $69 million of performance fees generated $1.66 billion in adjusted revenue for the fourth quarter. Investment management fees, excluding performance fees, were 3% higher compared to the prior quarter. 
Adjusted operating expenses of $1.01 billion for the quarter were 3% lower due to lower compensation and lower G&A as a result of last quarter's upfront closed-end fund expenses. This led to an 8% increase in adjusted operating income of $647 million and an adjusted operating margin of 39%. 
Fourth quarter adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 31% to $645 million or $1.26 per share. These results include favorable discrete tax items of $155 million or $0.30 per share for the quarter. 
Turning to 2021 fiscal year financial results, which benefited from favorable market conditions and a full year of Legg Mason versus 2 months last year. For the full year, adjusted revenues were $6.32 billion and adjusted operating expenses were $3.94 billion, an increase of 63% and 65%, respectively. This led to fiscal year adjusted operating income of $2.38 billion, which was 60% higher compared to the prior year. Our adjusted operating margin was 37.7%. 
Compared to the prior year, fiscal year adjusted net income increased 46% to $1.92 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 43% to $3.74 per share, which included the impact of favorable discrete tax items of $175 million or $0.34 per share for the full year. 
As planned, we have achieved a run rate of 85% of our targeted merger-related cost synergies of $300 million this year. We anticipate that 100% of these synergies will be achieved by the end of fiscal year 2022. As a reminder, none of these cost efficiencies involved our specialist investment managers or investment teams.
Moving on to capital management. We believe our strong balance sheet continues to provide us with financial and strategic flexibility to evolve our business. For the fiscal year ended September 30, we returned $782 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. During the year, we also prefinanced a large portion of legacy Legg Mason debt with lower cost of debt, reflecting our credit profile. 
Specifically, we issued $850 million of 1.6% senior notes due 2030 and $350 million, 2.95% notes due 2051. We redeemed $250 million 6.38% Legg Mason junior subordinated notes due 2056 on March 15, 2021, and $500 million of 5.45% Legg Mason junior subordinated notes due 2056 on September 15, 2021. 
We ended the quarter with $6.93 billion of cash and investments. We will continue to prioritize our dividend and intend to repurchase enough shares to at least offset our employee equity grants. The remainder of our capacity will focus on continued investments in our business and acquisitions to further diversify and increase our sources of cash flow while positioning our and new growth opportunities as the industry continues to evolve. Consistent with this, we are excited to share the specifics on the acquisition of Lexington Partners that we announced this morning. 
As outlined in the transaction summary document, Lexington Partners is a global leader in secondary private equity and co-investments with current fee-based AUM of $34 billion. Since its founding in 1994, Lexington has raised over $55 billion in aggregate capital commitments and currently has a team of 135 employees across 8 global offices. It is expected to generate revenue of approximately $350 million and EBITDA of approximately $150 million in 2022. 
With this acquisition, we now have strong and complementary capabilities in alternative credit, real estate, hedge fund solutions and PE-related activities. Given the overall size and growth of private equity and the likelihood of further private market expansion, having a specialist investment manager tied to this sector of alternative assets is a logical step in the diversification of our business. 
Furthermore, providing access diversified versions of higher returning investments will continue to increase in importance to meet savings and retirement goals of our broad group of clients. This could also be important in both our multi-asset solutions business and the continued development of our customization capabilities. 
As Jenny mentioned earlier, this transaction takes us 1 important step further in creating a larger and more diversified alternative asset business and will result in pro forma fiscal year 2022 alternative asset AUM of approximately $200 million, producing approximately $1 billion in annual management fee revenue excluding performance fees at a margin of approximately 40%. 
We intend to continue adding complementary business in both wealth management and asset management, including asset class and geographic expansion. This will be both organic investment through allocating capital into our existing specialist investment managers and fire acquisitions. 
Given our global reach, financial flexibility, business model and experience in execution, we're able to attract highly talented teams and partnerships looking for a combination of independence, support and collaboration on a global and local scale to create new growth opportunities in what is a very large and expanding segment of the asset management industry. 
Turning to financial terms of the transaction. We're acquiring 100% Lexington Partners for $1 billion in cash at closing plus a further $750 million in cash over the next 3 years. We have also structured this transaction to ensure continuity and strong alignment of interest with Lexington's clients, partners and employees over the long term. 
Consistent with this, we will be simultaneously issuing grants equal to 25% of Lexington to employees of Lexington, subject to 5D vesting and establishing a performance-based cash retention pool of $338 million to be paid over the next 5 years. The transaction is expected to close by the end of our fiscal second quarter subject to customary approvals.

So obviously, one of the differences when you acquire alternative managers is there's a lot of things that traditional asset managers can be shared across investment teams that isn't the case. For example, an alternatives manager may want their own legal expertise as they're doing deals and things. And so there's a lot more that sits within the independent specialized investment team in the alternatives world. 
And in one of the changes that we've made with the acquisition of Legg Mason is having more institutional salespeople within the investment groups. So that's already part of an alternatives manager. And what we are working hard to build as we believe the opportunity to democratize alternative assets in the more retail channel is that global distribution of alternatives.

Okay. Thanks, Alex. So a couple of things there. In terms of the sort of unrestricted cash that's available to do other things at the time that we close this transaction and we're assuming that we can close this transaction at the end of March, that number will probably be something like $1 billion. So that's question 1. 
Question 2 on the GP commitment, there is very strong demand for the GP commitment from partners and employees, both at Lexington. And I know that Franklin Templeton senior executives and other folks are looking forward to being part of that also. But you're right to highlight the fact that Franklin Templeton also, from a balance sheet perspective, be committing capital to support the GP level. So yes, we have a commitment to that. We obviously can't say what the amount is because it depends on future fundraising."

But the more important answer to the question is that we think that the alignment of interest through providing equity in the actual business that the folks are operating in, you can't get a whole lot better than that. 
We've got plenty of incentives across the firm to make sure people collaborate and coordinate to create more value. The more that, that happens and that we create more revenue and EBITDA, the more Lexington will be worth in this case and the more Franklin will be worth. So we think that the 2 things align very well in this regard. And frankly, it's probably better shareholder value for Franklin investors."

And then to Glenn's question in your response about solutions being the point of differentiation and knitting together the various products. Can you flesh out more how you're thinking about solution-based products and services on the alt side? It looks like, for example, the bigger alternatives are buying insurance companies to leverage their diverse product offerings and create a solutions-based offering set.

So first of all, we look at it and say that, frankly, large asset managers with the broad capability that we have, we think, should be selling at a premium amount of discount because the some of the parts -- if the some of the parts isn't greater than the discrete parts than we failed, so why is that? If you look at -- starting with just our large partners clients, they are consolidating the number of firms to do business with and you have to have a broad breadth of capability to be able to make those lists. 
Number two, if you think about just what's happening today with technology and technology disruption, and I'll just start out with -- we talk about as an active manager. If you're not really good at leveraging data science and data analytics, ultimately, you're going to have a hard time competing in active management. And data is expensive. Our approach is at the center. We've created, for example, an investment data lake and our individual teams have data scientists in there so they can leverage that at their opt-in choice. But we can negotiate large vendor contracts and gain independent access to unique raw sources of data. Those types of advantages, if executed well at the core, become a massive opportunity. 
And then there are things back to that kind of partner point, when you have a broad breadth of assets, you can do things like we have the Franklin Templeton Academy, which we built for emerging markets and find that partners in the developed markets want access to that kind of capability to do training of their teams. Thought leadership with the institution or the institute -- the Franklin Templeton institute is something that's sought after by our large partners. And then, of course, just a massive global distribution footprint that no individual manager could ever support, that kind of capability. And so we think that, that brings a strong premium. 
On your point on solutions, yes, I mean you see what's happening in the insurance business. It's probably that model will continue. You'll see more of those kind of deals. So there's a limited number. Yes, if you have a good solutions team that can bring together and customize, that's an opportunity. And we look at where we can continue to grow that, but we also see it as an opportunity with our existing partners. And I know, Matt dying to add something here."

I wouldn't confuse the autonomy and independence of our teams with being a multi-affiliate asset management company. The brand strategy is because a number of our specialist investment managers are known very well for exactly what they do, and we don't want to dilute that in any way and that seems to resonate in the marketplace, both institutional and through other big distribution channels. That's number one. 
And number two, while the coordination and collaboration across the firm and some of the things that Jenny mentioned do not in any way dilute the independence autonomy of our specialized investment management companies, it is really good, the collaboration across the firm. And we're definitely seeing increased opportunities by that collaboration. And it's opt-in collaboration. We don't force it across the firm. And you're seeing in an increasingly capacitive environment across the industry that it's really energizing for the company and our specialist investment managers. 
One thing we will have in common is we all want to grow, and we want to compete and we want to win and we're finding that this is a good strategy for us to be. It doesn't mean that other models don't work really well. Also, we have tremendous respect for our colleagues that have slightly different versions of our model. In our opinion, we think of ourselves almost like as a hybrid of a model that you've referred to. 
And in terms of the insurance piece, we study these things pretty carefully. We have a pretty meaningful insurance angle ourselves, but it's an area that we're very interested in also. So it's one thing at a time, obviously, as we continue to build new opportunities for the company."

Just assume that to add in. So putting that aside, on a standalone basis for the first quarter first -- obviously, we're very early to give guidance for the year. But for the first quarter, excluding performance fees, we would expect our revenue to be approximately flat for the quarter and expenses to be down in the low single digits, let's say. Because as you know, we do have some run rate expenses rolling through from last year from the merger-related synergies. So we've got that happening. 
So I think I would say that all else remaining equal, if markets remain stable, we expect our adjusted operating level to remain at current levels and adjusted operating expenses to be down low single digits compared to the fourth quarter. This is all excluding performance fees. As you know, we have had elevated performance fees for the last 2 quarters with $102 million in the third quarter and $69 million in the fourth quarter, obviously, that does vary.

And if you think about the U.S. legacy, Franklin so much stronger in the regional and independent channel make stronger in the wires outside of the U.S., Franklin much stronger in retail banking in markets like Germany and Philly with Legg Mason having a better presence in private banking. Each of those business segments really operate separate platforms. So Legg had its product on 1 set of platforms, Franklin on the other. Often, it takes a little bit of effort and work and sometimes formal agreements to be able to participate on those platforms. 
Since we had the platforms, we were able, over this year, to execute a strategy where we brought on Legacy Franklin product on the Legg Mason platforms and vice versa. That means that we have far more funds in the U.S. than outside of the U.S. now available for sale.

The business has grown considerably since it was formed in 1994, and the opportunity through this partnership and structure with Franklin to broaden that ownership is really exciting for our employees. So I think this is -- for us the chance to have a really powerful and exceptional new partner and at the same time, really bet on ourselves and our ability to continue to perform for our LPs."

And then there is time-based payments on this also that we were very pleased to work on with the team. So we have $1 billion at closing, and we referenced $750 million over 3 years and that $750 million is split $250 million in the first year, $400 million at the end of the second year and $100 million at the end of the third year. And then the $338 million is pretty much even. It's a little bit different numbers, but very evenly split between the second year right through to the fifth year. So it's quite well balanced between 3 and 5 years."

And so that's built into all of our alternatives businesses. 
And then when we did the acquisition, I mean, there were things that we were able to do in the acquisition of Legg Mason to ensure that incentives are aligned with the parent company and that everybody is rowing the boat in the same direction. And as we talked about earlier, we've created an opt-in environment where we think there are some really good upsides to the teams by leveraging the core part of the business. And what we've seen is a real desire. 
We had recently a CIO forum where the heads of all of our different investment teams got together, and I got to tell you, the engagement was outstanding.

We think that's fairly conservative because already at Franklin standalone, we're probably at something like $700 million of management fees for 2021, for example and then plus the performance got us already quite close to $1 billion at that 40% margin that I mentioned to you. 
In terms of the tax rate, I would continue to use the 23% to 24% effective tax rate guidance on all of this. We realized that this quarter was unusual in terms of the reserve that we're able to release. So we do not expect any additional large reserves like that to happen, although I should point out on taxes that we've probably been able to benefit from about $150 million of the approximately $600 million of tax benefits obtained through the acquisition of Legg Mason, and we should be at a benefit from about another $200 million in favorable tax attributes over the next 2 years and then the rest will be over probably 7 years at that point, 6 or 7 years, something like that."

Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Franklin Templeton's results for our fourth quarter and fiscal year. We're also very excited to announce the acquisition of Lexington Partners, and I am delighted to extend our warmest welcome to such a talented team. 
Lexington's business provides us the exposure to a critical growth area in the alternative asset business, and we cannot be happier with this new partnership. We'll cover more on this transaction in a few minutes. 
Matthew Nicholls, our CFO; and Adam Spector, our Head of Global Distribution, are on the call with me today. We're also joined by Tom Gann, Head of Franklin Templeton Alternatives and Will Warren, President of Lexington Partners, who will be available for questions after our prepared remarks. 
I'll start by reviewing this year's milestones, then Matt will go through our financial results for the quarter and the fiscal year as well as spend some time discussing today's important transaction in greater detail. 
Throughout Franklin Templeton's history, we have invested in our business to build a truly diversified and resilient organization that performs across market cycles with a commitment to serving our clients, employees and shareholders. The results that we announced today represent the first full fiscal year since we closed the Legg Mason acquisition, a transformational transaction that created a more balanced business across asset classes, client mix and geographies. 
We are pleased to report that the strategic and financial benefits from our acquisition of Legg Mason exceeded our goals, and we have added important growth opportunities. Over the course of the year, we have created a management team consisting of key representation from Franklin Templeton, Legg Mason and our specialist investment managers. We have maintained our culture while invigorating collaboration and innovation across the firm. 
Through the hard work and dedication of our employees, we've successfully brought 2 firms together to maximize our collective potential, one that successfully combines the attributes of global strength with boutique specialization. We've made strong progress and yet in so many ways, we're just getting started. 
Turning to investment performance. There's been an improvement in performance across a broad base of investment strategies. Through September, 71%, 69%, 72% and 77% of strategy composites outperformed their respective benchmarks across the 4 key time periods. This quarter, we had 53% of mutual fund AUM in funds with 4- or 5-star ratings by Morningstar compared to 43% a year ago. 
During the year, we focused on updating our global distribution efforts by enhancing our generalist specialist model, reshaping client coverage and deepening relationships in each sales region, particularly with the largest global financial institutions. 
Fiscal year long-term inflows doubled to $365 billion from the prior year, notably the U.S., which is our largest sales region with over $1.1 trillion in AUM was net flow positive for the year. In terms of notable organic growth, we saw positive net flows in our core growth areas, including alternatives, SMAs, wealth management and ESG-specific strategies. We executed important acquisitions to further grow and diversify our business in alternative assets, customization and distribution of investment strategies. 
In terms of other accomplishments, our alternative asset strategies, an important area of focus for us, generated positive net flows in each quarter during the year and grew by 19% from the prior year to $145 billion in AUM with contributions from a diverse group of strategies, including real estate, infrastructure, private debt and hedge funds. 
Several years ago, we announced our intention to create a full suite of alternative strategies, and we have been very deliberate in building our capabilities. In 2018, the acquisition of Benefit Street Partners brought us a leading alternative credit manager. In 2020, we added a world-class real estate manager with Clarion Partners. This focus on alternatives led us to today's announcement of the acquisition of Lexington Partners, a leader in secondary private equity and co-investments. We now have top-tier specialist investment managers in all of the key alternative categories with Benefit Street Partners, Clarion Partners, Franklin Venture Partners, K2 and now Lexington Partners. 
Specifically with the Lexington Partners transaction, I'm excited that Franklin Templeton will be partnering with such an outstanding firm that is led by an experienced and talented team immediately bringing us scale and capabilities in an attractive and growing global market. There will be no changes to the team or its independent investment management product, and they will continue to operate autonomously as Lexington partners. 
Upon the close of this transaction, we expect our alternative AUM to approach approximately $200 billion and over $1 billion in revenue, excluding performance fees, Matt will review the additional details of the transaction shortly. 
Another core growth area is our separately managed account business. We are a top 3 provider in SMAs with $125 billion in assets under management, which is one of the fastest-growing segments in retail. Our SMA business grew by 23% in AUM year-over-year and generated positive net flows in each quarter during the fiscal year. 
Our recently announced acquisition of O'Shaughnessy Asset Management and its custom indexing platform, Canvas, will take our existing strengths in SMAs to the next level enhancing our tax management factor-based and ESG customization capabilities. Canvas was launched in late 2019 and has seen strong growth since its inception and now represents $1.9 billion of the firm's total AUM of $6.3 billion as of September 30. The transaction will bring compelling benefits to the clients that both companies serve across multiple channels. 
There's no question that investors are more focused on ESG goals than ever before. Increasingly, there are 3 dimensions to ESG that investors consider: ESG factors, as understood risks in a portfolio; how ESG contributes to overall returns and the overall impact of ESG considerations to society and the environment. 
As an active manager, approximately 95% of our AUM represents strategies that consider ESG factors as part of the investment process and ESG-specific strategies representing over $200 billion in AUM were net flow positive in each quarter this fiscal year. 
All this being said, none of our accomplishments this past year would be possible, if it weren't for our employees. We are extremely fortunate to have such dedicated colleagues who are focused on achieving investment excellence, fostering enduring relationships and delivering superior service to our broad range of investors around the globe.
Now I'd like to turn it over to our CFO, Matt Nicholls, who will review our financial results from the fourth quarter and fiscal year as well as take you through the specifics of the Lexington transaction. Matt?"

Fourth quarter long-term net outflows were $9.9 million (sic) [ $9.9 billion ], which were partially offset by the acquisition of Diamond Hill's high-yield focused U.S. corporate credit mutual funds, which added $3.5 billion in AUM and closed in July. 
This quarter included the previously disclosed $5.4 billion 529 plan redemption, which included $4.7 billion of long-term assets, a $2 billion fixed income institutional redemption that had minimal impact to revenue and $800 million of fixed income outflows from the nonmanagement fee earning India credit funds that are in the process of liquidation. 
Reinvested dividends were $2.3 billion this quarter, 1% higher average assets under management of $1.55 trillion compared to the prior quarter plus $69 million of performance fees generated $1.66 billion in adjusted revenue for the fourth quarter. Investment management fees, excluding performance fees, were [ 3% ] higher compared to the prior quarter. 
Adjusted operating expenses of $1.01 billion for the quarter were 3% lower due to lower compensation and lower G&A as a result of last quarter's upfront closed-end fund expenses. This led to an 8% increase in adjusted operating income of $647 million and an adjusted operating margin of 39%. 
Fourth quarter adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 31% to $645 million or $1.26 per share. These results include favorable discrete tax items of $155 million or $0.30 per share for the quarter. 
Turning to 2021 fiscal year financial results, which benefited from favorable market conditions and a full year of Legg Mason versus 2 months last year. For the full year, adjusted revenues were $6.32 billion and adjusted operating expenses were $3.94 billion, an increase of 63% and 65%, respectively. This led to fiscal year adjusted operating income of $2.38 billion, which was 60% higher compared to the prior year. Our adjusted operating margin was 37.7%. 
Compared to the prior year, fiscal year adjusted net income increased 46% to $1.92 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 43% to $3.74 per share, which included the impact of favorable discrete tax items of $175 million or $0.34 per share for the full year. 
As planned, we have achieved a run rate of 85% of our targeted merger-related cost synergies of $300 million this year. We anticipate that 100% of these synergies will be achieved by the end of fiscal year 2022. As a reminder, none of these cost efficiencies involved our specialist investment managers or investment teams.
Moving on to capital management. We believe our strong balance sheet continues to provide us with financial and strategic flexibility to evolve our business. For the fiscal year ended September 30, we returned $782 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. During the year, we also prefinanced a large portion of legacy Legg Mason debt with lower cost of debt, reflecting our credit profile. 
Specifically, we issued $850 million of 1.6% senior notes due 2030 and $350 million, 2.95% notes due 2051. We redeemed $250 million 6.38% Legg Mason junior subordinated notes due 2056 on March 15, 2021, and $500 million of 5.45% Legg Mason junior subordinated notes due 2056 on September 15, 2021. 
We ended the quarter with $6.93 billion of cash and investments. We will continue to prioritize our dividend and intend to repurchase enough shares to at least offset our employee equity grants. The remainder of our capacity will focus on continued investments in our business and acquisitions to further diversify and increase our sources of cash flow while positioning our -- and new growth opportunities as the industry continues to evolve. Consistent with this, we are excited to share the specifics on the acquisition of Lexington Partners that we announced this morning. 
As outlined in the transaction summary document, Lexington Partners is a global leader in secondary private equity and co-investments with current fee-based AUM of $34 billion. Since its founding in 1994, Lexington has raised over $55 billion in aggregate capital commitments and currently has a team of 135 (sic) [ 139 ] employees across 8 global offices. It is expected to generate revenue of approximately $350 million and EBITDA of approximately $150 million in 2022. 
With this acquisition, we now have strong and complementary capabilities in alternative credit, real estate, hedge fund solutions and PE-related activities. Given the overall size and growth of private equity and the likelihood of further private market expansion, having a specialist investment manager tied to this sector of alternative assets is a logical step in the diversification of our business. 
Furthermore, providing access diversified versions of higher returning investments will continue to increase in importance to meet savings and retirement goals of our broad group of clients. This could also be important in both our multi-asset solutions business and the continued development of our customization capabilities. 
As Jenny mentioned earlier, this transaction takes us one important step further in creating a larger and more diversified alternative asset business and will result in pro forma fiscal year 2022 alternative asset AUM of approximately $200 million (sic) [ $200 billion ], producing approximately $1 billion in annual management fee revenue excluding performance fees at a margin of approximately 40%. 
We intend to continue adding complementary business in both wealth management and asset management, including asset class and geographic expansion. This will be both organic investment through allocating capital into our existing specialist investment managers and fire acquisitions. 
Given our global reach, financial flexibility, business model and experience in execution, we're able to attract highly talented teams and partnerships looking for a combination of independence, support and collaboration on a global and local scale to create new growth opportunities in what is a very large and expanding segment of the asset management industry. 
Turning to financial terms of the transaction. We're acquiring 100% Lexington Partners for $1 billion in cash at closing plus a further $750 million in cash over the next 3 years. We have also structured this transaction to ensure continuity and strong alignment of interest with Lexington's clients, partners and employees over the long term. 
Consistent with this, we will be simultaneously issuing grants equal to 25% of Lexington to employees of Lexington, subject to 5 years vesting and establishing a performance-based cash retention pool of $338 million to be paid over the next 5 years. The transaction is expected to close by the end of our fiscal second quarter subject to customary approvals.

So obviously, one of the differences when you acquire alternative managers is there's a lot of things that traditional asset managers can be shared across investment teams that isn't the case. For example, an alternatives manager may want their own legal expertise as they're doing deals and things. And so there's a lot more of it sits within the independent specialized investment team in the alternatives world. 
And in one of the changes that we've made with the acquisition of Legg Mason is having more institutional salespeople within the investment groups. So that's already part of an alternatives manager. And what we are working hard to build as we believe the opportunity to democratize alternative assets in the more retail channel is that global distribution of alternatives.

One of the very attractive things about Lexington Partners is, frankly, they're very successful on their own. So the forward-looking growth of Lexington standalone is very attractive to us.

We've got plenty of incentives across the firm to make sure people collaborate and coordinate to create more value. The more that happens and that we create more revenue and EBITDA, the more Lexington will be worth in this case and the more Franklin will be worth.

I guess, other publicly traded multi-brand asset manager models command at discount. So some questions on this. So how does Franklin not get perpetually trapped into trading at a conglomerate or a multi-brand discount, particularly as you acquire more brands? 
And then to Glenn's question in your response about solutions being the point of differentiation and knitting together the various products. Can you flesh out more how you're thinking about solution-based products and services on the alt side? It looks like, for example, the bigger alternatives are buying insurance companies to leverage their diverse product offerings and create a solutions-based offering set. So more color, if you could, on the solutions road map."

So first of all, we look at it and say that, frankly, large asset managers with the broad capability that we have, we think, should be selling at a premium amount of discount because the some of the parts -- if the some of the parts isn't greater tha",415,"Yes. So first of all, we look at it and say that, frankly, large asset managers with the broad capability that we have, we think, should be selling at a premium amount of discount because the some of the parts -- if the some of the parts isn't greater than the discrete parts than we failed, so why is that? If you look at -- starting with just our large partners clients, they are consolidating the number of firms to do business with and you have to have a broad breadth of capability to be able to make those lists. 
Number two, if you think about just what's happening today with technology and technology disruption, and I'll just start out with -- we talk about as an active manager. If you're not really good at leveraging data science and data analytics, ultimately, you're going to have a hard time competing in active management. And data is expensive. Our approach is at the center. We've created, for example, an investment data lake and our individual teams have data scientists in there so they can leverage that at their opt-in choice. But we can negotiate large vendor contracts and gain independent access to unique raw sources of data. Those types of advantages, if executed well at the core, become a massive opportunity. 
And then there are things back to that kind of partner point, when you have a broad breadth of assets, you can do things like we have the Franklin Templeton Academy, which we built for emerging markets and find that partners in the developed markets want access to that kind of capability to do training of their teams. Thought leadership with the institution or the institute -- the Franklin Templeton institute is something that's sought after by our large partners. And then, of course, just a massive global distribution footprint that no individual manager could ever support, that kind of capability. And so we think that, that brings a strong premium. 
On your point on solutions, yes, I mean you see what's happening in the insurance business. It's probably that model will continue. You'll see more of those kind of deals. So there's a limited number. Yes, if you have a good solutions team that can bring together and customize, that's an opportunity. And we look at where we can continue to grow that, but we also see it as an opportunity with our existing partners. And I know, Matt dying to add something here."

I wouldn't confuse the autonomy and independence of our teams with being a multi-affiliate asset management company. The brand strategy is because a number of our specialist investment managers are known very well for exactly what they do, and we don't want to dilute that in any way and that seems to resonate in the marketplace, both institutional and through other big distribution channels. That's number one. 
And number two, while the coordination and collaboration across the firm and some of the things that Jenny mentioned do not in any way dilute the independence autonomy of our specialized investment management companies, it is really good, the collaboration across the firm. And we're definitely seeing increased opportunities by that collaboration. And it's opt-in collaboration. We don't force it across the firm. And you're seeing in an increasingly capacitive environment across the industry that it's really energizing for the company and our specialist investment managers. 
One thing we will have in common is we all want to grow, and we want to compete and we want to win and we're finding that this is a good strategy for us to be. It doesn't mean that other models don't work really well. Also, we have tremendous respect for our colleagues that have slightly different versions of our model. In our opinion, we think of ourselves almost like as a hybrid of a model that you've referred to. 
And in terms of the insurance piece, we study these things pretty carefully. We have a pretty meaningful insurance angle ourselves, but it's an area that we're very interested in also. So it's one thing at a time, obviously, as we continue to build new opportunities for the company."

Just assume that to add it in. So putting that aside, on a standalone basis for the first quarter first -- obviously, we're very early to give guidance for the year. But for the first quarter, excluding performance fees, we would expect our revenue to be approximately flat for the quarter and expenses to be down in the low single digits, let's say. Because as you know, we do have some run rate expenses rolling through from last year from the merger-related synergies. So we've got that happening. 
So I think I would say that all else remaining equal, if markets remain stable, we expect our adjusted operating level to remain at current levels and adjusted operating expenses to be down low single digits compared to the fourth quarter. This is all excluding performance fees. As you know, we have had elevated performance fees for the last 2 quarters with $102 million in the third quarter and $69 million in the fourth quarter, obviously, that does vary.

Each of those business segments really operate separate platforms. So Legg had its product on one set of platforms, Franklin on the other. Often, it takes a little bit of effort and work and sometimes formal agreements to be able to participate on those platforms. 
Since we had the platforms, we were able, over this year, to execute a strategy where we brought on Legacy Franklin product on the Legg Mason platforms and vice versa. That means that we have far more funds in the U.S. than outside of the U.S. now available for sale. That process took several quarters to execute, and we're now in a position where we think we can sell significantly more next year because we are able to do that."

A",190,"Well, so first of all, the nature of which individual investment team structure is often is related to some historical acquisition and the beauty of the alternatives business is because there's the carry in there, often itself is a great retention tool. And so that's built into all of our alternatives businesses. 
And then when we did the acquisition, I mean, there were things that we were able to do in the acquisition of Legg Mason to ensure that incentives are aligned with the parent company and that everybody is rowing the boat in the same direction. And as we talked about earlier, we've created an opt-in environment where we think there are some really good upsides to the teams by leveraging the core part of the business. And what we've seen is a real desire. 
We had recently a CIO forum where the heads of all of our different investment teams got together, and I got to tell you, the engagement was outstanding. Everybody really appreciated it and the conversations were very, very good. And so I think people recognized the benefit of being part of a greater organization."

That's the same sort of partnership structures we have with Lexington. And Benefit Street Partners, we have basically the accrual to growth units. It's not equity, but it's very close to equity. 
So in each -- and then in many other businesses, we have the same thing where you're basically, as Jenny mentioned, we're aligning interest. It doesn't always have to be with equity, it can be a combination of equity and cash in terms of how it relates to certain specific growth objectives for that particular business -- growth targets for that business. So it's really a combination of things that works well for the specific teams, what we work on with them and what works for the parent company to make sure we get the right growth going."

The billion  -- you asked -- well, I'll get to tax in a second. You asked about the $1 billion of management fees, and yes, that's tied to the $200 billion, frankly, is quite conservative probably. And that's only management fee revenue. It's not anything to carry or performance fees or anything like that. We think that's fairly conservative because already at Franklin standalone, we're probably at something like $700 million of management fees for 2021, for example and then plus the performance got us already quite close to $1 billion at that 40% margin that I mentioned to you. 
In terms of the tax rate, I would continue to use the 23% to 24% effective tax rate guidance on all of this. We realized that this quarter was unusual in terms of the reserve that we're able to release. So we do not expect any additional large reserves like that to happen, although I should point out on taxes that we've probably been able to benefit from about $150 million of the approximately $600 million of tax benefits obtained through the acquisition of Legg Mason, and we should be get a benefit from about another $200 billion in favorable tax attributes over the next 2 years and then the rest will be over probably 7 years at that point, 6 or 7 years, something like that."
