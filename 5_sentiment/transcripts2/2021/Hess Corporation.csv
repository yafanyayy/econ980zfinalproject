I would like to welcome everyone to our fourth quarter conference call. I hope you and your families are well and staying healthy during these challenging times.

I hope you and your families are well and staying healthy during these challenging times. Today, I will review our continued progress in executing our strategy. Then Greg Hill will discuss our operations; and John Rielly will review our financial performance. 
Our strategy has been and continues to be to grow our resource base, have a low-cost of supply and sustained cash flow growth. Our differentiated portfolio is balanced between short cycle and long cycle assets with our focus on the best rocks for the best returns. The Bakken, deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia, our cash engines and Guyana is our growth engine. Guyana becomes a significant cash engine as multiple phases of low-cost oil developments come online, which we believe will drive our company's breakeven price to under $40 per barrel Brent and provide industry-leading cash flow growth over the course of the decade. 
As our portfolio generates increasing free cash flow, we will first prioritize debt reduction and then increase cash returns to shareholders through dividend increases and opportunistic share repurchases.. Turning to 2020. We achieved strong operating results, overcoming difficult market conditions and the challenges of working safely in the pandemic. I am extremely proud of our workforce for delivering production in line with our original guidance despite a 40% reduction in our capital and exploratory expenditures. In response to the pandemic severe impact on oil prices, our priorities have been to preserve cash, preserve our operating capability and to preserve the long-term value of our assets. 
In terms of preserving cash, we came into 2020 with approximately 80% of our oil production hedged with put options for 130,000 barrels per day at $55 per barrel West Texas intermediate and 20,000 barrels per day at $60 per barrel Brent. To enhance cash flow and maximize the value of our production, last March and April, when U.S. oil storage was near capacity, we chartered 3 very large crude carriers of VLCCs to store approximately 2 million barrels each of May, June and July, Bakken crude oil production. The first VLCC cargo of 2.1 million barrels was sold in China at a premium to Brent in September. And the second and third VLCC cargoes have been sold at a premium to Brent for delivery in the first quarter of 2021. 
We reduced our capital and exploratory spend for 2020 by 40% from our original budget of $3 billion, down to $1.8 billion. The majority of this reduction came from dropping from a 6 rig program in the Bakken to 1 rig. We also reduced our 2020 cash operating costs by $275 million. In 2020, we strengthened the company's cash and liquidity position through a $1 billion 3-year term loan initially underwritten by JPMorgan Chase. In addition, we have an undrawn $3.5 billion revolving credit facility and no material debt maturities until 2023. 
During the fourth quarter, we closed on the sale of our 28% interest in the Shenzi field in the Gulf of Mexico for a total consideration of $505 million, bringing value forward in the low price environment. In terms of preserving capability, a key for us in 2020 was continuing to operate 1 rig in the Bakken. Greg Hill and our Bakken team have made tremendous progress over the past 10 years in lean manufacturing capabilities and innovative practices, which have delivered significant cost efficiencies and productivity improvements that we want to preserve for the future. 
In terms of preserving the long-term value of our assets, Guyana, with its low-cost of supply and industry-leading financial returns remains our top priority. On the Stabroek block, where Hess has a 30% interest and ExxonMobil is the operator, 2020 was another outstanding year. 3 oil discoveries during the year at Uaru, Redtail 1 and Yellowtail 2 brought total discoveries on the Stabroek block to 18. The estimate of gross discovered recoverable resources on the block was increased to approximately 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent, and we continue to see multibillion barrels of future exploration potential remaining. 
In December, production from Liza Phase 1 reached its full capacity of 120,000 gross barrels of oil per day. The Liza Phase 2 development is on track to achieve first oil in early 2022, and with a capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day. Another key 2020 milestone was the sanctioning of our third oil development on the Stabroek block in September at the Payara field. Payara will have a capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day and is expected to achieve first oil in 2024. 
Turning to our plans for 2021. To protect our cash flows, we have hedged 100,000 barrels per day with $45 per barrel WTI put options and 20,000 barrels per day with $50 per barrel Brent put options. Our 2021 capital and exploratory budget is $1.9 billion, of which, more than 80% will be allocated to Guyana and the Bakken. Our 3 sanctioned oil developments on the Stabroek block have breakeven Brent oil prices of between $25 and $35 per barrel, world-class by any measure. Front-end engineering and design work for a fourth development at the Yellowtail area is underway, and we hope to submit the development plan to the government for approval before year-end. 
We continue to see the potential for at least 5 FPSOs to produce more than 750,000 gross barrels of oil per day by 2026, and longer-term for up to 10 FPSOs to develop the current discovered recoverable resource base. We will continue to invest in an active exploration and appraisal program in Guyana in 2021, with 12 to 15 wells planned for the block. The Hassa number 1 exploration well recently encountered approximately 50 feet of oil-bearing reservoir in deeper geologic intervals. Although the well did not find oil in the primary shallower target areas, the Hasso well results confirm a working petroleum system and provide valuable information about the future exploration prospectivity for this part of the block. 
In the Bakken, we plan to add a second rig during the first quarter, which will allow us to sustain production in the range of 175,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, for several years and protect the long-term cash flow generation from this important asset. As we continue to execute our strategy, our Board, our leadership team and our employees, will be guided by our long-standing commitment to sustainability and the Hess values. We are proud to have been recognized throughout 2020 and by a number of third-party organizations for the quality of our environmental, social and governance performance and disclosure. In December, we achieved leadership status in CDP's annual global climate analysis for the 12th consecutive year, and earned a place on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for North America for the 11th consecutive year. 
In summary, our priorities will remain to preserve cash, preserve capability and preserve the long-term value of our assets by investing only in high-return low-cost opportunities we have built a differentiated portfolio of assets that we believe will provide industry-leading cash flow growth for over the course of the decade. As our free cash flow grows, we will first prioritize debt reduction and then return of capital to shareholders, both in terms of dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. 
I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update."
249841,700625915,2182134,"Hess Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2021",2021-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Hess Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. I also hope that everyone on the call as well and staying safe. 2020 marked another year of strong performance and strategic execution for Hess. Despite the challenging conditions on many fronts.

I also hope that everyone on the call as well and staying safe. 2020 marked another year of strong performance and strategic execution for Hess. Despite the challenging conditions on many fronts. In particular, I would like to call out several operational highlights from the year. First, across our company, we have implemented comprehensive COVID-19 health and safety measures, including health screenings and testing, extended work schedules at offshore platforms and social distancing initiatives. All based on government and public health agencies guidance. I'm truly grateful to our Hess response team and our global workforce for their commitment to keeping their colleagues and our communities safe during this pandemic. Second, in the Bakken, despite dropping from 6 rigs to 1 in May, our full year net production came in well above our original guidance for the year and 27% above that of 2019. These results reflect the strong performance of our plug and perf completions, increased natural gas capture and the quality of our acreage position. Third, in Guyana. We made significant advances on all 3 of our sanction developments on the Stabroek block with Liza Phase 1, reaching its full production capacity in December. Liza Phase 2 remaining on track for first oil early next year. And Payara sanctioned in September, with first oil expected in 2024. Continued exploration and appraisal success increased the gross recoverable resource estimate for the block to approximately 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent. 
Now turning to our operations. Proved reserves at the end of 2020 stood at 1.17 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Net proved reserve additions in 2020 and totaled 117 million barrels of oil equivalent, including negative net price revisions of 79 million barrels of oil equivalent, which resulted in overall 2020 production replacement ratio of 95% and a finding in the development cost of $15.25 per barrel of oil equivalent. Excluding price-related revisions, our production replacement ratio was 158%, with an F&D cost of $9.10 per barrel of oil equivalent. 
Turning to production. In the fourth quarter of 2020, company-wide net production averaged 309,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, above our guidance, of approximately 300,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, driven by higher natural gas capture in the Bakken and higher natural gas nominations in Southeast Asia. For the full year 2021, we forecast net production to average approximately 310,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. 
For the first quarter of 2021, we forecast net production to average approximately 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. In the Bakken, fourth quarter net production averaged 189,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of approximately 9% above the year ago quarter and above our guidance of 180,000 to 185,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
For the full year 2020, Bakken net production averaged 193,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of approximately 27% compared to 2019 and well above our original full year guidance of 180,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day despite dropping from 6 rigs to 1 in May. 
We have a robust inventory of more than 1,800 drilling locations in the Bakken that can generate attractive returns at current oil prices, representing approximately 60 rig years of activity. With WTI prices now in the range of $50 per barrel, we will add a second operated drilling rig during the first quarter. A 2-rig program will enable us to hold net production flat at approximately 175,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and will sustain strong long-term cash generation from this important asset. 
In 2020, our drilling and completion costs per Bakken well averaged $6.2 million, which was $600,000 or 9% lower than 2019. In 2021, we expect D&C cost to average below $6 million per well. Over the full year, we expect to drill 55 gross operated wells and bring approximately 45 new wells online. This compares to 71 wells drilled and 111 wells brought online in 2020. In the first quarter of 2021, we expect to drill approximately 10 wells and bring 4 new wells online. Bakken net production is forecast to average approximately 170,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for both the first quarter and for the full year 2021. 
Our full year forecast reflects the impact of a planned 45-day shutdown of the Tioga gas plant in the third quarter, which is expected to reduce full year net production by approximately 7,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, predominantly affecting natural gas production. During the shutdown, we will perform a turnaround and tying the plan expansion project completed in 2020, which will then increase capacity to 400 million cubic feet per day from the plant's current 250 million cubic feet per day capacity. 
Now moving to the offshore. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, net production averaged 32,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter and 56,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the full year 2020. Fourth quarter net production came in below our guidance of 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day due to the early closing of the Shenzi sale and extended to hurricane recovery downtime at 2 third-party operated production platforms. 
In 2021, no new wells are planned in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, and we forecast net production from our assets to average approximately 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This includes the impact of planned maintenance shutdowns in both the second and third quarters. The deepwater Gulf of Mexico remains a very important cash engine for the company as well as a platform for future growth. 
In Malaysia and the joint development area in the Gulf of Thailand, where Hess has a 50% interest, net production averaged 56,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter and 52,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the full year 2020. The fourth quarter production was above our guidance of 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day because of higher natural gas nominations. 
For the full year 2021, net production from Malaysia and the JDA is forecast to average approximately 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
Turning to Guyana, where Hess has a 30% interest in the Stabroek block and ExxonMobil is the operator. In 2020, we announced 3 new discoveries, bringing the total number of discoveries to 18 and increasing our estimate of gross discovered recoverable resources to approximately 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent, and we continue to see multibillion barrels of exploration upside on the Stabroek block and we are planning an active exploration program in 2021. In March, the operator will bring a fifth drillship the standard Dro Max into theater and in April, a sixth drillship, the Noble Sam Cross. We plan to drill 12 to 15 exploration and appraisal wells in 2021 and that will target a variety of prospects and play types. These will include lower risk wells near existing discoveries, higher risk step-outs and several penetrations that will test deeper lower campanian and Santonian intervals. This ramped up program will allow us to accelerate exploration of the block and enable optimum sequencing of future developments. 
In addition, the emerging deep play, which we believe has significant potential meets further drilling to determine its commerciality and ultimate value. Over the next several months, we will participate in 2 exploration wells and 2 appraisal wells on the Stabroek block. The next exploration well to be drilled is Co EB one, which is located approximately 16 miles northeast of Liza. This well will target Liza type campaign on aged reservoirs and is expected to spud in February using the Stena Carron drillship. In March, we expect to spud the long tail 3 appraisal well, which will provide additional data in the Turbot Longtail area, and we will drill a deeper section that will target lower campanian and Santonian and geologic intervals. The Panoramax will drill as well. Moving to April, we expect to spud the Uaru-2 appraisal well utilizing the Noble Don Taylor drillship. Success here and at Mako-2, which will be drilled later this year, could move the Mako Uaru area forward in the development queue. Then in May, we plan to spud the Whiptail One exploration well, located approximately 12 miles East of Liza. This well will test Campanian and Santonian aged reservoirs and will be drilled by the stand of Drillmax. 
Turning now to our Guyana developments. In mid-December, the Liza destiny floating production storage and offloading vessel achieved its nameplate capacity of 120,000 gross barrels of oil equivalent per day and since then, has been operating at that level or higher. During 2021, the operator intends to evaluate and pursue options to increase nameplate capacity. For 2021, we forecast net production from Guyana, will average approximately 30,000 barrels of oil per day with planned maintenance and optimization downtime being broadly offset by an increase in nameplate capacity. The Liza Phase 2 development remains on track for first oil in early 2022. The overall project, including the FPSO, drilling and subsea infrastructure is approximately 85% complete. We anticipate that the Liza Unity FPSO, which will have a capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day the sale from the Keppel Shipyard in Singapore to Guyana by midyear. 
               , third sanction development on the Stabroek block, will utilize an FPSO with a gross production capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day with first oil expected in 2024. The hole for the property FPSO is complete, topside construction activities are underway, and we expect the integration of the hole and top sides to begin at the Keppel yard in Singapore by year-end. Front-end engineering and design work is ongoing for a fourth development at Yellowtail. This work will continue through 2021, and we anticipate being ready to submit a plan of development to the government of Guyana for approval in the fourth quarter. 
In closing, our execution continues to be strong. The Bakken and our offshore assets in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia are performing well and continue to generate significant cash flow. And Guyana continues to get bigger and better, all of which positions us to deliver industry-leading cash flow growth and significant shareholder value over the course of the next decade. 
I will now turn the call over to John Rielly."

In my remarks today, I will compare results from the fourth quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2020 and provide guidance for 2021. We incurred a net loss of $97 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with a net loss of $243 mill",1024,"Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the fourth quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2020 and provide guidance for 2021. We incurred a net loss of $97 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with a net loss of $243 million in the third quarter of 2020. On an adjusted basis, which excludes items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, we incurred a net loss of $176 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to a net loss of $216 million in the previous quarter. Fourth quarter results include an after-tax gain of $79 million from the sale of our interest in the Shenzi field. 
Turning to E&P. On an adjusted basis, E&P incurred a net loss of $118 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to a net loss of $156 million in the previous quarter. The after-tax changes in adjusted E&P results between the fourth quarter and third quarter were as follows: higher realized selling prices improved results by $18 million; higher sales volumes improved results by $11 million; lower DD&A expense improved results by $40 million; lower exploration expenses improved results by $12 million; higher cash costs driven by workovers and hurricane-related maintenance costs in the Gulf of Mexico reduced results by $41 million; all other items reduced results by $2 million for an overall increase in fourth quarter results of $38 million. 
Our E&P operations were overlifted compared with production in the fourth quarter by approximately 1.6 million barrels, resulting in an increased after-tax income of approximately $15 million. 
Turning to midstream. The midstream segment had net income of $62 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to net income of $56 million in the previous quarter. Midstream EBITDA before noncontrolling interest amounted to $198 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $180 million in the previous quarter. 
Turning to corporate. After tax corporate and interest expenses were $120 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to an adjusted after-tax expense of $116 million in the previous quarter. 
Turning to our financial position. At quarter end, excluding midstream, cash and cash equivalents were approximately $1.74 billion, and our total liquidity was $5.4 billion including available committed credit facilities, while debt and finance lease obligations totaled $6.6 billion. 
Our fully undrawn $3.5 billion revolving credit facility is committed through May 2023. In November 2020, we completed the previously announced sale of our 28% working interest in the Shenzi field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico for net proceeds of $482 million. Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $532 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with $468 million in the previous quarter, primarily due to higher crude oil sales volumes. 
In the fourth quarter, net cash provided from operating activities after changes in working capital was $486 million compared with $136 million in the prior quarter. Proceeds from the September sale of the first VLCC cargo of 2.1 million barrels of oil were received in October. We have entered into agreements to sell the second and third VLCC cargoes totaling 4.2 million barrels of oil in the first quarter of 2021. We expect to recognize net income of approximately $60 million in the first quarter from these sales, including associated hedging gains and costs. 
First quarter 2021 net cash provided by operating activities after changes in working capital is expected to include approximately $150 million of cash flow from these sales. 
For calendar year 2021, we have purchased WTI put options for 100,000 barrels of oil per day that have an average monthly floor price of $45 per barrel and Brent put options for 20,000 barrels of oil per day that have an average monthly price floor price of $50 per barrel. 
Now turning to guidance. First, for E&P. We project E&P cash costs, excluding Libya, to be in the range of $10.50 to $11.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the first quarter and for the full year 2021. DD&A expense, excluding Libya, is forecast to be in the range of $12 to $13 per barrel of oil equivalent for the first quarter and for the full year 2021. This results in projected total E&P unit operating costs, excluding Libya, to be in the range of $22.50 to $24.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the first quarter and for the full year 2021. 
Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs, are expected to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million in the first quarter and $170 million to $180 million for the full year 2021. The midstream tariff is projected to be in the range of $265 million to $275 million in the first quarter and $1.09 billion to $1.12 billion for the full year 2021. E&P income tax expense, excluding Libya, is expected to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million for the first quarter and $80 million to $90 million for the full year 2021. 
As highlighted earlier, we have purchased crude oil hedge positions for calendar year 2021, we expect noncash option premium amortization, which will be reflected in our realized selling prices to reduce our results by approximately $37 million per quarter. Our E&P capital and exploratory expenditures are expected to be approximately $425 million in the first quarter and approximately $1.9 billion for the full year 2021. 
For midstream, we anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the midstream segment to be in the range of $70 million to $80 million in the first quarter and $280 million to $290 million for the full year 2021. Corporate expenses are estimated to be in the range of $35 million to $40 million for the first quarter and $130 million to $140 million for the full year 2021. Interest expense is estimated to be in the range of $95 million to $100 million for the first quarter and $380 million to $390 million for the full year 2021. 
This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator."

So basically, it's a free cash flow question and a balance sheet question for 2021."

So I think first, you were saying for the hedges themselves for our 100,000 barrels a day of WTI put options that we have at $45 and then the 20,000 barrels a day for Brent production that we have at $50. The amortization of that is going to be $37",484,"Sure. So I think first, you were saying for the hedges themselves for our 100,000 barrels a day of WTI put options that we have at $45 and then the 20,000 barrels a day for Brent production that we have at $50. The amortization of that is going to be $37 million per quarter. So we like it. We've got nice protection on the downside because, obviously, again, this is a big year for us just to kind of complete the development of Liza Phase 2. And as you know when Liza Phase 2 comes on, look, it's approximately 60,000 barrels a day of Brent-based production. The cash cost of that Lisa Phase 2 is going to be more around $10 pre any purchase of the FPSO versus the first 1 being at $12 just from the economy of scale. So you can put any type of Brent price in there and take out the $10 cash cost, and you can see there's going to be a significant inflection for us on cash flow once Phase 2 comes on. So for this year, Doug, from a cash flow stand, what were we looking to do? So the first thing we were looking to do was to get the hedges in place. So we have insurance on the downside. Coming into the year effectively, as I mentioned, we have $1.74 billion of cash at year-end. And as I said in my remarks, we're going to complete the sales of the 2 VLCCs, and it's going to give us cash flow of approximately $150 million in the first quarter. So on a pro forma basis, we basically have $1.9 billion of cash going into the year. 
So what I want to say, I mean, I don't want to guess on oil prices, but we've got the downside protected. We're coming in with a very strong cash balance, here from that standpoint. And therefore, at these higher prices, obviously, this helps with our funding program here for Guyana. So when Phase 2 comes on, depending on where prices are with our insurance now, we know we're going to have a nice cash cushion at that and then we're going to be in the significant inflection point of getting much higher cash flow. And depending on prices there, the portfolio can just continue to generate free cash flow or for some reason, prices go back down. In that period. As I said, Guyana will still be generating free cash flow even at very low prices. Once Phase 2 comes on, like $40 type prices. And then when Payara comes on, if it was really low prices, we'd still be generating free cash flow. So we've put ourselves in a good position with a very strong cash position hedges, protection should be a nice year with prices at this level and then a big inflection when Phase 2 starts."

And in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, as you heard Greg say earlier that we have no drilling planned for this year in the Deepwater Gulf. And it remains to be seen what he's going to say about existing acreage and drilling permits for the deepwater, but we have no drilling plan this year. 
I think the most important point here is that the administration as it makes these decisions to address climate change, that they have to be not only climate literate, but energy literate. And they have to realize that oil and gas are a strategic engine for the U.S. economy, especially at a time that we're trying to recover the economy from COVID. And that importance is in jobs. We have over 12 million direct and indirect jobs. In terms of low energy costs for working class families, our power costs, in large part because of shale gas are half what they are in Europe. And in terms of national security, where we're energy independent, in large part because of shale oil and shale gas. So it's just a question of finding the balance here. And hopefully, as the administration moves forward, they will extend the hand as well we define common ground to make sure we do everything we can to address climate change, but also that oil and gas play a key role in the economy's recovery.

As I mentioned, Liza Phase 2, actually, the cash cost will be approximately $10 per barrel, while the FPSO is being leased. And then it's going to drop to $7 to $8 per barrel post the purchase of the FPSO. So again, for us, every time an FPSO comes online, it's going to help our cash costs, and it's also, by the way, going to help our DD&A rates. So right now, Liza Phase 1, the current DD&A rate is below our portfolio average, again, due to the low F&D costs so when Liza Phase 2 comes on, ultimately, when it's up full and running here and you get to the full scale, again, that F&D is very low, and that's going to continue to drive our DD&A down. So again, we look forward for every FPSO to come on in Guyana."

So as part of our continued focus on sustainability, we want to drive that gas flaring as low as possible, obviously. So you will see us continue to add infrastructure with our partner in the midstream together as much gas as we possibly can. 
Now if we talk about the oil, so the decline in oil is purely related to the wells online. So in Q3, we had 22 wells online. In Q4, we had 12 wells online. And in Q1, we only added, in Q1 of this year, we will only put 4 wells online. So naturally, you're going to get some oil decline associated with that. However, as that second rig kicks in, which you really see the effects of in the second half of the year, that's when oil will begin to stabilize and be flat from then on with that second rig. So again, it's really just a mix issue of gas that changes your percentage on a total company basis. And then the oil is purely a function of the wells online.

So that's one of the reasons it's jumping forward in the queue and really being kind of the next cab off the ranking, if you will, because of very high-value development. Brian, I wanted to add one thing to my Bakken comment last time. Also remember, in the third quarter, we have the Tioga gas plant turnaround. So you will see a dip in production in the third quarter, but that's all gas, primarily, oil is going to be Rocketon just signed."

And as you mentioned, the operator now is conducting studies to put a project in place to further increase that capacity, plans are to do that in the third quarter. So we'll have a shutdown period to be able to do that. That's going to be piping changes and basically just kind of debottlenecking some tight spots that you might have in the facility. So that's why our forecasted volumes for the year 2021 or 30,000 barrels of oil net to us because you get some pickup from that optimization that the operator is planning to do, offset a little bit by the shutdown time required to do it.

Now assuming oil prices improve, in the future, what we'd like to do is eventually get the rig count to 4 in the Bakken. By getting the rig count to 4 will not only generate significant amount of cash flow, but we'll also be able to hold production in the Bakken broadly flat at around 200,000 barrels a day equivalent for almost 10 years. Why would we want to do that? Because we have 1,800 well locations left that at current prices, generate very high returns. 
Now then if I look at this year's program, in particular, remember, I'm going to bring 45 wells online this year. The program is very similar to last year at the IP180s will be the same as last year, $120,000 barrels of oil IP180, very good wells. And at current returns, if you look at the IRR of that program this year of those 45 wells, it's 95% rate of return. And so I've got another -- after this year, I'll have another 1,750 wells that are in those very high returns that, of course, I want to get -- I'd like to develop. But I think as we've said before, Paul, the role of the Bakken in the portfolio is to be a cash generator. So the rate at which we invest in the Bakken will be a function of corporate cash flow needs. But you can see the pent-up potential in the Bakken is very large, with some very good return opportunities."

The driver of this is the increase in our year-end 2020 proved developed reserves. So you saw our reserve replacement.

So you've got Bakken, obviously, proved developed reserves adds still net even after price revisions. You have Guyana, again, picking up proved, developed reserves here as as more and more wells and the performance from Phase 2. And then you've got a good amount of transfers from PUDs that moved into proved developed reserves, approximately 100 million barrels there. And it's offset, obviously, by current production. 
So it's really the driver of proved developed reserves increasing significantly from last year. And then you have a combination of year-over-year production mix. So as I mentioned, Guyana right now, it is below our portfolio average. And so Guyana's production is increasing. So that's going to overall drive down the DD&A rate. And again, Bakken's DD&A rate, while still higher, is coming down from 2020 just due to the proved developed adds. So again, a good year for reserve adds."

Of course, than Phase 1, and that's because all of the learnings, which were in the gas system, remember, all of the learnings have been applied to the gas system on Phase 2 because of very similar up equipment as in Phase 1.

I hope you and your families are well and staying healthy during these challenging times. Today, I will review our continued progress in executing our strategy. Then Greg Hill will discuss our operations and John Rielly will review our financial performance.  
Our strategy has been and continues to be to grow our resource base, have a low-cost of supply and sustained cash flow growth. Our differentiated portfolio is balanced between short cycle and long cycle assets with our focus on the best rocks for the best returns. The Bakken, deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia are our cash engines and Guyana is our growth engine. Guyana becomes a significant cash engine as multiple phases of low-cost oil developments come online, which we believe will drive our company's breakeven price to under $40 per barrel Brent and provide industry-leading cash flow growth over the course of the decade.  
As our portfolio generates increasing free cash flow, we will first prioritize debt reduction, and then increase cash returns to shareholders through dividend increases and opportunistic share repurchases. 
Turning to 2020, we achieved strong operating results, overcoming difficult market conditions and the challenges of working safely in the pandemic. I am extremely proud of our workforce for delivering production in line with our original guidance despite a 40% reduction in our capital and exploratory expenditures. 
In response to the pandemic's severe impact on oil prices, our priorities have been to preserve cash, preserve our operating capability and to preserve the long-term value of our assets.  
In terms of preserving cash, we came into 2020 with approximately 80% of our oil production hedged with put options for 130,000 barrels per day at $55 per barrel of West Texas Intermediate and 20,000 barrels per day at $60 per barrel of Brent. To enhance cash flow and maximize the value of our production, last March and April, when U.S. oil storage was near capacity, we chartered 3 very large crude carriers or VLCCs to store approximately 2 million barrels each of May, June and July Bakken crude oil production. The first VLCC cargo of 2.1 million barrels was sold in China at a premium to Brent in September. And the second and third VLCC cargoes have been sold at a premium to Brent for delivery in the first quarter of 2021.  
We reduced our capital and exploratory spend for 2020 by 40% from our original budget of $3 billion, down to $1.8 billion. The majority of this reduction came from dropping from a 6 rig program in the Bakken to 1 rig. We also reduced our 2020 cash operating costs by $275 million. 
In 2020, we strengthened the company's cash and liquidity position through a $1 billion 3-year term loan, initially underwritten by JPMorgan Chase. In addition, we have an undrawn $3.5 billion revolving credit facility and no material debt maturities until 2023.  
During the fourth quarter, we closed on the sale of our 28% interest in the Shenzi Field in the Gulf of Mexico for a total consideration of $505 million, bringing value forward in the low-price environment. In terms of preserving capability, a key for us in 2020 was continuing to operate 1 rig in the Bakken. Greg Hill and our Bakken team have made tremendous progress over the past 10 years in lean manufacturing capabilities and innovative practices, which have delivered significant cost efficiencies and productivity improvements that we want to preserve for the future.  
In terms of preserving the long-term value of our assets, Guyana, with its low-cost of supply and industry-leading financial returns, remains our top priority. On the Stabroek Block, where Hess has a 30% interest and ExxonMobil is the operator, 2020 was another outstanding year. 3 oil discoveries during the year at Uaru, Redtail-1 and Yellowtail-2 brought total discoveries on the Stabroek Block to 18. The estimate of gross discovered recoverable resources on the block was increased to approximately 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent, and we continue to see multibillion barrels of future exploration potential remaining.  
In December, production from Liza Phase 1 reached its full capacity of 120,000 gross barrels of oil per day. The Liza Phase 2 development is on track to achieve first oil in early 2022 with a capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day. 
Another key 2020 milestone was the sanctioning of our third oil development on the Stabroek Block in September at the Payara field. Payara will have a capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day and is expected to achieve first oil in 2024.  
Turning to our plans for 2021. To protect our cash flows, we have hedged 100,000 barrels per day, with $45 per barrel WTI put options and 20,000 barrels per day with $50 per barrel Brent put options. Our 2021 capital and exploratory budget is $1.9 billion, of which, more than 80% will be allocated to Guyana and the Bakken. 
Our 3 sanctioned oil developments on the Stabroek Block have breakeven Brent oil prices of between $25 and $35 per barrel, world-class by any measure. Front-end engineering and design work for a fourth development at the Yellowtail area is underway, and we hope to submit the development plan to the government for approval before year-end.  
We continue to see the potential for at least 5 FPSOs to produce more than 750,000 gross barrels of oil per day by 2026, and longer-term, for up to 10 FPSOs to develop the current discovered recoverable resource base. We will continue to invest in an active exploration and appraisal program in Guyana in 2021, with 12 to 15 wells planned for the block. The Hassa-1 exploration well recently encountered approximately 50 feet of oil-bearing reservoir in deeper geologic intervals. Although the well did not find oil in the primary shallower target areas, the Hassa well results confirm a working petroleum system and provide valuable information about the future exploration prospectivity for this part of the block.  
In the Bakken, we plan to add a second rig during the first quarter, which will allow us to sustain production in the range of 175,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for several years and protect the long-term cash flow generation from this important asset. 
As we continue to execute our strategy, our Board, our leadership team and our employees will be guided by our long-standing commitment to sustainability and the Hess values. We are proud to have been recognized throughout 2020 by a number of third-party organizations for the quality of our environmental, social and governance, performance and disclosure. In December, we achieved leadership status in CDP's annual global climate analysis for the 12th consecutive year, and earned a place on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for North America for the 11th consecutive year.  
In summary, our priorities will remain to preserve cash, preserve capability and preserve the long-term value of our assets. By investing only in high-return low-cost opportunities, we have built a differentiated portfolio of assets that we believe will provide industry-leading cash flow growth for over the course of the decade. As our free cash flow grows, we will first prioritize debt reduction and then return of capital to shareholders, both in terms of dividends and opportunistic share repurchases.  
I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update."
249841,700625915,2182264,"Hess Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2021",2021-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Hess Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. I also hope that everyone on the call is well and staying safe. 2020 marked another year of strong performance and strategic execution for Hess despite the challenging conditions on many fronts. In particular, I would like to call out severa",1714,"Thanks, John. I also hope that everyone on the call is well and staying safe. 2020 marked another year of strong performance and strategic execution for Hess despite the challenging conditions on many fronts. In particular, I would like to call out several operational highlights from the year. 
First, across our company, we have implemented comprehensive COVID-19 health and safety measures, including health screenings and testing, extended work schedules at offshore platforms and social distancing initiatives, all based on government and public health agencies' guidance. I'm truly grateful to our Hess response team and our global workforce for their commitment to keeping their colleagues and our communities safe during this pandemic. 
Second, in the Bakken, despite dropping from 6 rigs to 1 in May, our full year net production came in well above our original guidance for the year and 27% above that of 2019. These results reflect the strong performance of our plug-and-perf completions, increased natural gas capture and the quality of our acreage position. 
Third, in Guyana, we made significant advances on all 3 of our sanction developments on the Stabroek Block, with Liza Phase 1, reaching it's full production capacity in December, Liza Phase 2 remaining on track for first oil early next year, and Payara, sanctioned in September, with first oil expected in 2024. Continued exploration and appraisal success increased the gross recoverable resource estimate for the block to approximately 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent.  
Now turning to our operations. Proved reserves at the end of 2020 stood at 1.17 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Net proved reserve additions in 2020 totaled 117 million barrels of oil equivalent, including negative net price revisions of 79 million barrels of oil equivalent, which resulted in overall 2020 production replacement ratio of 95% and a finding and development cost of $15.25 per barrel of oil equivalent. Excluding price-related revisions, our production replacement ratio was 158%, with an F&D cost of $9.10 per barrel of oil equivalent.  
Turning to production. In the fourth quarter of 2020, company-wide net production averaged 309,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, above our guidance, of approximately 300,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, driven by higher natural gas capture in the Bakken and higher natural gas nominations in Southeast Asia. For the full year 2021, we forecast net production to average approximately 310,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. For the first quarter of 2021, we forecast net production to average approximately 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. 
In the Bakken, fourth quarter net production averaged 189,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of approximately 9% above the year ago quarter and above our guidance of 180,000 to 185,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day.  
For the full year 2020, Bakken net production averaged 193,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of approximately 27% compared to 2019 and well above our original full year guidance of 180,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, despite dropping from 6 rigs to 1 in May.  
We have a robust inventory of more than 1,800 drilling locations in the Bakken that can generate attractive returns at current oil prices, representing approximately 60 rig years of activity. With WTI prices now in the range of $50 per barrel, we will add a second operated drilling rig during the first quarter. A 2-rig program will enable us to hold net production flat at approximately 175,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and will sustain strong long-term cash generation from this important asset.  
In 2020, our drilling and completion cost per Bakken well averaged $6.2 million, which was $600,000 or 9% lower than 2019. In 2021, we expect D&C costs to average below $6 million per well. Over the full year, we expect to drill 55 gross operated wells and bring approximately 45 new wells online. This compares to 71 wells drilled and 111 wells brought online in 2020. In the first quarter of 2021, we expect to drill approximately 10 wells and bring 4 new wells online.
Bakken net production is forecast to average approximately 170,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for both the first quarter and for the full year 2021. Our full year forecast reflects the impact of a planned 45-day shutdown of the Tioga Gas Plant in the third quarter, which is expected to reduce full year net production by approximately 7,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, predominantly affecting natural gas production. During the shutdown, we will perform a turnaround and tie-in the plan expansion project completed in 2020, which will then increase capacity to 400 million cubic feet per day from the plant's current 250 million cubic feet per day capacity.  
Now moving to the offshore. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, net production averaged 32,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter and 56,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the full year 2020. Fourth quarter net production came in below our guidance of 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day due to the early closing of the Shenzi sale and extended to hurricane recovery downtime at 2 third-party operated production platforms.  
In 2021, no new wells are planned in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, and we forecast net production from our assets to average approximately 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This includes the impact of planned maintenance shutdowns in both the second and third quarters. The deepwater Gulf of Mexico remains a very important cash engine for the company as well as a platform for future growth.  
In Malaysia and the Joint Development Area in the Gulf of Thailand, where Hess has a 50% interest, net production averaged 56,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter and 52,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the full year 2020. Fourth quarter production was above our guidance of 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day because of higher natural gas nominations. For the full year 2021, net production from Malaysia and the JDA is forecast to average approximately 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.  
Turning to Guyana, where Hess has a 30% interest in the Stabroek Block and ExxonMobil is the operator. In 2020, we announced 3 new discoveries, bringing the total number of discoveries to 18 and increasing our estimate of gross discovered recoverable resources to approximately 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent. And we continue to see multibillion barrels of exploration upside on the Stabroek Block, and we are planning an active exploration program in 2021. 
In March, the operator will bring a fifth drillship, the Stena DrillMAX, into theater and in April, a sixth drillship, the Noble Sam Croft. We plan to drill 12 to 15 exploration and appraisal wells in 2021 that will target a variety of prospects and play types. These will include lower risk wells near existing discoveries, higher risk step outs and several penetrations that will test deeper Lower Campanian and Santonian intervals. This ramped up program will allow us to accelerate exploration of the block and enable optimum sequencing of future developments.  
In addition, the emerging deep play, which we believe has significant potential, needs further drilling to determine its commerciality and ultimate value. 
Over the next several months, we will participate in 2 exploration wells and 2 appraisal wells on the Stabroek Block. The next exploration well to be drilled is Koebi-1, which is located approximately 16 miles northeast of Liza. This well will target Liza-type Campanian aged reservoirs and is expected to spud in February using the Stena Carron drillship. 
In March, we expect to spud the Longtail-3 appraisal well, which will provide additional data in the Turbot/Longtail area, and we will drill a deeper section that will target lower Campanian and Santonian and geologic intervals. The Stena DrillMAX will drill this well. 
Moving to April, we expect to spud the Uaru-2 appraisal well utilizing the Noble Don Taylor drillship. Success here, and at Mako-2, which will be drilled later this year, could move the Mako/Uaru area forward in the development queue. 
Then in May, we plan to spud the Whiptail-1 exploration well, located approximately 12 miles east of Liza. This well will test Campanian and Santonian aged reservoirs and will be drilled by the Stena DrillMAX.  
Turning now to our Guyana developments. In mid-December, the Liza Destiny Floating Production Storage and Offloading vessel achieved its nameplate capacity of 120,000 gross barrels of oil equivalent per day. And since then, has been operating at that level or higher. During 2021, the operator intends to evaluate and pursue options to increase nameplate capacity. For 2021, we forecast net production from Guyana will average approximately 30,000 barrels of oil per day, with planned maintenance and optimization downtime being broadly offset by an increase in nameplate capacity. 
The Liza Phase 2 development remains on track for first oil in early 2022. The overall project, including the FPSO, drilling and subsea infrastructure, is approximately 85% complete. We anticipate that the Liza Unity FPSO, which will have a capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day, to sail from the Keppel Shipyard in Singapore to Guyana by midyear.  
Payara, our third sanctioned development on the Stabroek Block, will utilize an FPSO with a gross production capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day, with first oil expected in 2024. The hull for the Prosperity FPSO is complete, topside construction activities are underway, and we expect the integration of the hull and topsides to begin at the Keppel Yard in Singapore by year-end. 
Front-end engineering and design work is ongoing for a fourth development at Yellowtail. This work will continue through 2021, and we anticipate being ready to submit a plan of development to the government of Guyana for approval in the fourth quarter.  
In closing, our execution continues to be strong. The Bakken and our offshore assets in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia are performing well and continue to generate significant cash flow. And Guyana continues to get bigger and better, all of which positions us to deliver industry-leading cash flow growth and significant shareholder value over the course of the next decade.  
I will now turn the call over to John Rielly."

In my remarks today, I will compare results from the fourth quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2020 and provide guidance for 2021.We incurred a net loss of $97 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with a net loss of $243 mill",1024,"Thanks Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the fourth quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2020 and provide guidance for 2021.
We incurred a net loss of $97 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with a net loss of $243 million in the third quarter of 2020. On an adjusted basis, which excludes items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, we incurred a net loss of $176 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to a net loss of $216 million in the previous quarter. Fourth quarter results include an after-tax gain of $79 million from the sale of our interest in the Shenzi Field.  
Turning to E&P. On an adjusted basis, E&P incurred a net loss of $118 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to a net loss of $156 million in the previous quarter. The after-tax changes in adjusted E&P results between the fourth quarter and third quarter were as follows: higher realized selling prices improved results by $18 million; higher sales volumes improved results by $11 million; lower DD&A expense improved results by $40 million; lower exploration expenses improved results by $12 million; higher cash costs, driven by workovers and hurricane-related maintenance costs in the Gulf of Mexico reduced results by $41 million; all other items reduced results by $2 million, for an overall increase in fourth quarter results of $38 million.  
Our E&P operations were overlifted compared with production in the fourth quarter by approximately 1.6 million barrels, resulting in an increased after-tax income of approximately $15 million.  
Turning to Midstream. The Midstream segment had net income of $62 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to net income of $56 million in the previous quarter. Midstream EBITDA, before noncontrolling interests, amounted to $198 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $180 million in the previous quarter.  
Turning to corporate. After-tax corporate and interest expenses were $120 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to an adjusted after-tax expense of $116 million in the previous quarter.  
Turning to our financial position. At quarter end, excluding Midstream, cash and cash equivalents were approximately $1.74 billion, and our total liquidity was $5.4 billion including available committed credit facilities, while debt and finance lease obligations totaled $6.6 billion.  
Our fully undrawn $3.5 billion revolving credit facility is committed through May 2023. In November 2020, we completed the previously announced sale of our 28% working interest in the shenzi field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico for net proceeds of $482 million. 
Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $532 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with $468 million in the previous quarter, primarily due to higher crude oil sales volumes. In the fourth quarter, net cash provided from operating activities after changes in working capital was $486 million compared with $136 million in the prior quarter. 
Proceeds from the September sale of the first VLCC cargo of 2.1 million barrels of oil were received in October. We have entered into agreements to sell the second and third VLCC cargoes totaling 4.2 million barrels of oil in the first quarter of 2021. We expect to recognize net income of approximately $60 million in the first quarter from these sales, including associated hedging gains and costs. First quarter 2021 net cash provided by operating activities after changes in working capital is expected to include approximately $150 million of cash flow from these sales.  
For calendar year 2021, we have purchased WTI put options for 100,000 barrels of oil per day that have an average monthly floor price of $45 per barrel and Brent put options for 20,000 barrels of oil per day that have an average monthly price -- floor price of $50 per barrel.  
Now turning to guidance. First, for E&P., we project E&P cash costs, excluding Libya, to be in the range of $10.50 to $11.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the first quarter and for the full year 2021. DD&A expense, excluding Libya, is forecast to be in the range of $12 to $13 per barrel of oil equivalent for the first quarter and for the full year 2021. This results in projected total E&P unit operating costs, excluding Libya, to be in the range of $22.50 to $24.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the first quarter and for the full year 2021.  
Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs, are expected to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million in the first quarter and $170 million to $180 million for the full year 2021. The midstream tariff is projected to be in the range of $265 million to $275 million in the first quarter and $1.09 billion to $1.12 billion for the full year 2021. 
E&P income tax expense, excluding Libya, is expected to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million for the first quarter and $80 million to $90 million for the full year 2021.  
As highlighted earlier, we have purchased crude oil hedge positions for calendar year 2021. We expect noncash option premium amortization, which will be reflected in our realized selling prices to reduce our results by approximately $37 million per quarter. Our E&P capital and exploratory expenditures are expected to be approximately $425 million in the first quarter and approximately $1.9 billion for the full year 2021.  
For Midstream, we anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Midstream segment to be in the range of $70 million to $80 million in the first quarter and $280 million to $290 million for the full year 2021. 
Corporate expenses are estimated to be in the range of $35 million to $40 million for the first quarter and $130 million to $140 million for the full year 2021. Interest expense is estimated to be in the range of $95 million to $100 million for the first quarter and $380 million to $390 million for the full year 2021.  
This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator."

So I think first, you were saying, for the hedges themselves for our 100,000 barrels a day of WTI put options that we have at $45 and then the 20,000 barrels a day for Brent production that we have at $50, the amortization of that is going to be $37",484,"Sure. So I think first, you were saying, for the hedges themselves for our 100,000 barrels a day of WTI put options that we have at $45 and then the 20,000 barrels a day for Brent production that we have at $50, the amortization of that is going to be $37 million per quarter. So we like it. We've got nice protection on the downside because, obviously, again, this is a big year for us just to kind of complete the development of Liza Phase 2. 
And as you know, when Liza Phase 2 comes on, look, it's approximately 60,000 barrels a day of Brent-based production. The cash cost of that Liza Phase 2 is going to be more around $10 pre any purchase of the FPSO versus the first one being at $12 just from the economy of scale. So you can put any type of Brent price in there and take out the $10 cash cost, and you can see there's going to be a significant inflection for us on cash flow once Phase 2 comes on. 
So for this year, Doug, from a cash flow stand, what were we looking to do? So the first thing we were looking to do was to get the hedges in place, so we have insurance on the downside. Coming into the year effectively, as I mentioned, we have $1.74 billion of cash at year-end. And as I said in my remarks, we're going to complete the sales of the 2 VLCCs, and it's going to give us cash flow of approximately $150 million in the first quarter. So on a pro forma basis, we basically have $1.9 billion of cash going into the year. 
So what I want to say, I mean, I don't want to guess on oil prices, but we've got the downside protected. We're coming in with a very strong cash balance, here from that standpoint. And therefore, at these higher prices, obviously, this helps with our funding program here for Guyana. So when Phase 2 comes on, depending on where prices are with our insurance now, we know we're going to have a nice cash cushion at that, and then we're going to be in the significant inflection point of getting much higher cash flow. And depending on prices there, the portfolio can just continue to generate free cash flow. Or, for some reason, prices go back down in that period, as I said, Guyana will still be generating free cash flow, even at very low prices once Phase 2 comes on, like $40 type prices. And then when Payara comes on, if it was really low prices, we'd still be generating free cash flow. So we've put ourselves in a good position with a very strong cash position, hedges, protection. Should be a nice year with prices at this level, and then a big inflection when Phase 2 starts."

Obviously, we also understand the President will make an announcement later today on federal lands and also some points, I think about climate. I think it's important for everyone to realize that only about 2% of our Bakken acreage is on federal land. 
So this announcement will not have an impact on our Bakken activities. And in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, as you heard Greg say earlier that we have no drilling planned for this year in the deepwater Gulf. And it remains to be seen what he's going to say about existing acreage and drilling permits for the deepwater, but we have no drilling plan this year. 
I think the most important point here is that the administration, as it makes these decisions to address climate change, that they have to be not only climate literate, but energy literate. And they have to realize that oil and gas are a strategic engine for the U.S. economy, especially at a time that we're trying to recover the economy from COVID. And that importance is in jobs. We have over 12 million direct and indirect jobs. 
In terms of low energy costs for our working class families, our power costs, in large part because of shale gas are half what they are in Europe, and in terms of national security, where we're energy independent, in large part because of shale oil and shale gas. So it's just a question of finding the balance here. And hopefully, as the administration moves forward, they will extend the hand as well we define common ground to make sure we do everything we can to address climate change, but also that oil and gas play a key role in the economy's recovery. 
And John, you want to talk about the IDCs?"

As I mentioned, Liza Phase 2, actually, the cash cost will be approximately $10 per barrel while the FPSO is being leased. And then it's going to drop to $7 to $8 per barrel post the purchase of the FPSO. So again, for us, every time an FPSO comes online, it's going to help our cash costs, and it's also, by the way, going to help our DD&A rates. 
So right now, Liza Phase 1, the current DD&A rate is below our portfolio average, again, due to the low F&D costs. So when Liza Phase 2 comes on, ultimately, when it's up full and running here and you get to the full scale, again, that F&D is very low, and that's going to continue to drive our DD&A down.

So as part of our continued focus on sustainability, we want to drive that gas flaring as low as possible, obviously. So you will see us continue to add infrastructure with our partner in the Midstream together as much gas as we possibly can. 
Now if we talk about the oil, so the decline in oil is purely related to the wells online. So in Q3, we had 22 wells online. In Q4, we had 12 wells online. And in Q1, we only added -- in Q1 of this year, we will only put 4 wells online. So naturally, you're going to get some oil decline associated with that. 
However, as that second rig kicks in, which you really see the effects of in the second half of the year, that's when oil will begin to stabilize and be flat from then on with that second rig. 
So again, it's really just a mix issue of gas that changes your percentage on a total company basis. And then the oil is purely a function of the wells online. But that will stabilize, the company will stabilize 175,000 barrels a day flat for a number of years."

These are very good reservoirs, very high deliverability, very high-quality crude oil. That's why that breakeven is in between the two. It really comes down to just how much infrastructure will you need, but won't need as much as Payara. May need a little bit more than Phase 2."

Now assuming oil prices improve in the future, what we'd like to do is eventually get the rig count to 4 in the Bakken. By getting the rig count to 4 will not only generate significant amount of cash flow, but we'll also be able to hold production in the Bakken broadly flat at around 200,000 barrels a day equivalent for almost 10 years. Why would we want to do that? Because we have 1,800 well locations left that, at current prices, generate very high returns. 
Now then if I look at this year's program, in particular, remember, I'm going to bring 45 wells online this year. The program is very similar to last year at the IP180s will be the same as last year, 120,000 barrels of oil IP180, very good wells. And at current returns, if you look at the IRR of that program this year of those 45 wells, it's 95% rate of return. 
And so I've got another -- after this year, I'll have another 1,750 wells that are in those very high returns that, of course, I want to get -- I'd like to develop. But I think, as we've said before, Paul, the role of the Bakken in the portfolio is to be a cash generator. So the rate at which we invest in the Bakken will be a function of corporate cash flow needs. But you can see the pent-up potential in the Bakken is very large, with some very good return opportunities."

The driver of this is the increase in our year-end 2020 proved developed reserves. So you saw our reserve replacement. But I guess another aspect of this is that our proved developed reserves are up to about 70% of our proved reserves. So it's up 13% over -- year-on-year, excluding the asset sales. 
So you've got Bakken, obviously, proved developed reserves adds still net even after price revisions. You have Guyana, again, picking up proved developed reserves here as as more and more wells in the performance from Phase 2. And then you've got a good amount of transfers from puds that moved into proved developed reserves, approximately 100 million barrels there. And it's offset, obviously, by current production. 
So it's really the driver of proved developed reserves increasing significantly from last year. And then, you have a combination of year-over-year production mix. So as I mentioned, Guyana, right now, it is below our portfolio average. And so Guyana's production is increasing, so that's going to overall drive down the DD&A rate. And again, Bakken's DD&A rate, while still higher, is coming down from 2020 just due to the proved developed adds. So again, a good year for reserve adds."

Now the ramp, as I mentioned earlier, we anticipate that ramp will go much smoother of course, than Phase 1, and that's because all of the learnings, which were in the gas system, remember, all of the learnings have been applied to the gas system on Phase 2 because of very similar up equipment as in Phase 1. 
So very much expect the ramp broadly would occur over, say, a 3-month period because you're going to -- you bring things on and you measure dynamics. You've got vibration sensors everywhere. That's a pretty normal cadence to bring something like that on is over a 3-month period."

I hope you and your families are well and staying healthy during these challenging times. Today, I will review our continued progress in executing our strategy. Then Greg Hill will discuss our operations and John Rielly will review our financial performance. 
Our strategy has been and continues to be to grow our resource base, have a low-cost of supply and sustained cash flow growth. Our differentiated portfolio is balanced between short cycle and long cycle assets with our focus on the best rocks for the best returns. The Bakken, deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia are our cash engines and Guyana is our growth engine. Guyana becomes a significant cash engine as multiple phases of low-cost oil developments come online, which we believe will drive our company's breakeven price to under $40 per barrel Brent and provide industry-leading cash flow growth over the course of the decade. 
As our portfolio generates increasing free cash flow, we will first prioritize debt reduction, and then increase cash returns to shareholders through dividend increases and opportunistic share repurchases. 
Turning to 2020, we achieved strong operating results, overcoming difficult market conditions and the challenges of working safely in the pandemic. I am extremely proud of our workforce for delivering production in line with our original guidance despite a 40% reduction in our capital and exploratory expenditures. 
In response to the pandemic's severe impact on oil prices, our priorities have been to preserve cash, preserve our operating capability and to preserve the long-term value of our assets. 
In terms of preserving cash, we came into 2020 with approximately 80% of our oil production hedged with put options for 130,000 barrels per day at $55 per barrel of West Texas Intermediate and 20,000 barrels per day at $60 per barrel of Brent. To enhance cash flow and maximize the value of our production, last March and April, when U.S. oil storage was near capacity, we chartered 3 very large crude carriers or VLCCs to store approximately 2 million barrels each of May, June and July Bakken crude oil production. The first VLCC cargo of 2.1 million barrels was sold in China at a premium to Brent in September. And the second and third VLCC cargoes have been sold at a premium to Brent for delivery in the first quarter of 2021. 
We reduced our capital and exploratory spend for 2020 by 40% from our original budget of $3 billion, down to $1.8 billion. The majority of this reduction came from dropping from a 6 rig program in the Bakken to 1 rig. We also reduced our 2020 cash operating costs by $275 million. 
In 2020, we strengthened the company's cash and liquidity position through a $1 billion 3-year term loan, initially underwritten by JPMorgan Chase. In addition, we have an undrawn $3.5 billion revolving credit facility and no material debt maturities until 2023. 
During the fourth quarter, we closed on the sale of our 28% interest in the Shenzi Field in the Gulf of Mexico for a total consideration of $505 million, bringing value forward in the low-price environment. In terms of preserving capability, a key for us in 2020 was continuing to operate 1 rig in the Bakken. Greg Hill and our Bakken team have made tremendous progress over the past 10 years in lean manufacturing capabilities and innovative practices, which have delivered significant cost efficiencies and productivity improvements that we want to preserve for the future. 
In terms of preserving the long-term value of our assets, Guyana, with its low-cost of supply and industry-leading financial returns, remains our top priority. On the Stabroek Block, where Hess has a 30% interest and ExxonMobil is the operator, 2020 was another outstanding year. 3 oil discoveries during the year at Uaru, Redtail-1 and Yellowtail-2 brought total discoveries on the Stabroek Block to 18. The estimate of gross discovered recoverable resources on the block was increased to approximately 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent, and we continue to see multibillion barrels of future exploration potential remaining. 
In December, production from Liza Phase 1 reached its full capacity of 120,000 gross barrels of oil per day. The Liza Phase 2 development is on track to achieve first oil in early 2022 with a capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day. 
Another key 2020 milestone was the sanctioning of our third oil development on the Stabroek Block in September at the Payara field. Payara will have a capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day and is expected to achieve first oil in 2024. 
Turning to our plans for 2021. To protect our cash flows, we have hedged 100,000 barrels per day, with $45 per barrel WTI put options and 20,000 barrels per day with $50 per barrel Brent put options. Our 2021 capital and exploratory budget is $1.9 billion, of which, more than 80% will be allocated to Guyana and the Bakken. 
Our 3 sanctioned oil developments on the Stabroek Block have breakeven Brent oil prices of between $25 and $35 per barrel, world-class by any measure. Front-end engineering and design work for a fourth development at the Yellowtail area is underway, and we hope to submit the development plan to the government for approval before year-end. 
We continue to see the potential for at least 5 FPSOs to produce more than 750,000 gross barrels of oil per day by 2026, and longer term, for up to 10 FPSOs to develop the current discovered recoverable resource base. We will continue to invest in an active exploration and appraisal program in Guyana in 2021, with 12 to 15 wells planned for the block. The Hassa-1 exploration well recently encountered approximately 50 feet of oil-bearing reservoir in deeper geologic intervals. Although the well did not find oil in the primary shallower target areas, the Hassa well results confirm a working petroleum system and provide valuable information about the future exploration prospectivity for this part of the block. 
In the Bakken, we plan to add a second rig during the first quarter, which will allow us to sustain production in the range of 175,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for several years and protect the long-term cash flow generation from this important asset. 
As we continue to execute our strategy, our Board, our leadership team and our employees will be guided by our long-standing commitment to sustainability and the Hess values. We are proud to have been recognized throughout 2020 by a number of third-party organizations for the quality of our environmental, social and governance, performance and disclosure. In December, we achieved leadership status in CDP's annual global climate analysis for the 12th consecutive year, and earned a place on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for North America for the 11th consecutive year. 
In summary, our priorities will remain to preserve cash, preserve capability and preserve the long-term value of our assets. By investing only in high-return low-cost opportunities, we have built a differentiated portfolio of assets that we believe will provide industry-leading cash flow growth for over the course of the decade. As our free cash flow grows, we will first prioritize debt reduction and then return of capital to shareholders, both in terms of dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. 
I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update."

I also hope that everyone on the call is well and staying safe. 2020 marked another year of strong performance and strategic execution for Hess despite the challenging conditions on many fronts.

I also hope that everyone on the call is well and staying safe. 2020 marked another year of strong performance and strategic execution for Hess despite the challenging conditions on many fronts. In particular, I would like to call out several operational highlights from the year. 
First, across our company, we have implemented comprehensive COVID-19 health and safety measures, including health screenings and testing, extended work schedules at offshore platforms and social distancing initiatives, all based on government and public health agencies' guidance. I'm truly grateful to our Hess response team and our global workforce for their commitment to keeping their colleagues and our communities safe during this pandemic. 
Second, in the Bakken, despite dropping from 6 rigs to 1 in May, our full year net production came in well above our original guidance for the year and 27% above that of 2019. These results reflect the strong performance of our plug-and-perf completions, increased natural gas capture and the quality of our acreage position. 
Third, in Guyana, we made significant advances on all 3 of our sanction developments on the Stabroek Block, with Liza Phase 1, reaching it's full production capacity in December, Liza Phase 2 remaining on track for first oil early next year, and Payara, sanctioned in September, with first oil expected in 2024. Continued exploration and appraisal success increased the gross recoverable resource estimate for the block to approximately 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent. 
Now turning to our operations. Proved reserves at the end of 2020 stood at 1.17 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Net proved reserve additions in 2020 totaled 117 million barrels of oil equivalent, including negative net price revisions of 79 million barrels of oil equivalent, which resulted in overall 2020 production replacement ratio of 95% and a finding and development cost of $15.25 per barrel of oil equivalent. Excluding price-related revisions, our production replacement ratio was 158%, with an F&D cost of $9.10 per barrel of oil equivalent. 
Turning to production. In the fourth quarter of 2020, company-wide net production averaged 309,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, above our guidance, of approximately 300,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, driven by higher natural gas capture in the Bakken and higher natural gas nominations in Southeast Asia. For the full year 2021, we forecast net production to average approximately 310,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. For the first quarter of 2021, we forecast net production to average approximately 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. 
In the Bakken, fourth quarter net production averaged 189,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of approximately 9% above the year ago quarter and above our guidance of 180,000 to 185,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
For the full year 2020, Bakken net production averaged 193,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of approximately 27% compared to 2019 and well above our original full year guidance of 180,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, despite dropping from 6 rigs to 1 in May. 
We have a robust inventory of more than 1,800 drilling locations in the Bakken that can generate attractive returns at current oil prices, representing approximately 60 rig years of activity. With WTI prices now in the range of $50 per barrel, we will add a second operated drilling rig during the first quarter. A 2-rig program will enable us to hold net production flat at approximately 175,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and will sustain strong long-term cash generation from this important asset. 
In 2020, our drilling and completion cost per Bakken well averaged $6.2 million, which was $600,000 or 9% lower than 2019. In 2021, we expect D&C costs to average below $6 million per well. Over the full year, we expect to drill 55 gross operated wells and bring approximately 45 new wells online. This compares to 71 wells drilled and 111 wells brought online in 2020. In the first quarter of 2021, we expect to drill approximately 10 wells and bring 4 new wells online.
Bakken net production is forecast to average approximately 170,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for both the first quarter and for the full year 2021. Our full year forecast reflects the impact of a planned 45-day shutdown of the Tioga Gas Plant in the third quarter, which is expected to reduce full year net production by approximately 7,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, predominantly affecting natural gas production. During the shutdown, we will perform a turnaround and tie-in the plan expansion project completed in 2020, which will then increase capacity to 400 million cubic feet per day from the plant's current 250 million cubic feet per day capacity. 
Now moving to the offshore. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, net production averaged 32,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter and 56,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the full year 2020. Fourth quarter net production came in below our guidance of 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day due to the early closing of the Shenzi sale and extended to hurricane recovery downtime at 2 third-party operated production platforms. 
In 2021, no new wells are planned in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, and we forecast net production from our assets to average approximately 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This includes the impact of planned maintenance shutdowns in both the second and third quarters. The deepwater Gulf of Mexico remains a very important cash engine for the company as well as a platform for future growth. 
In Malaysia and the Joint Development Area in the Gulf of Thailand, where Hess has a 50% interest, net production averaged 56,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter and 52,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the full year 2020. Fourth quarter production was above our guidance of 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day because of higher natural gas nominations. For the full year 2021, net production from Malaysia and the JDA is forecast to average approximately 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
Turning to Guyana, where Hess has a 30% interest in the Stabroek Block and ExxonMobil is the operator. In 2020, we announced 3 new discoveries, bringing the total number of discoveries to 18 and increasing our estimate of gross discovered recoverable resources to approximately 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent. And we continue to see multibillion barrels of exploration upside on the Stabroek Block, and we are planning an active exploration program in 2021. 
In March, the operator will bring a fifth drillship, the Stena DrillMAX, into theater and in April, a sixth drillship, the Noble Sam Croft. We plan to drill 12 to 15 exploration and appraisal wells in 2021 that will target a variety of prospects and play types. These will include lower risk wells near existing discoveries, higher risk step outs and several penetrations that will test deeper Lower Campanian and Santonian intervals. This ramped up program will allow us to accelerate exploration of the block and enable optimum sequencing of future developments. 
In addition, the emerging deep play, which we believe has significant potential, needs further drilling to determine its commerciality and ultimate value. 
Over the next several months, we will participate in 2 exploration wells and 2 appraisal wells on the Stabroek Block. The next exploration well to be drilled is Koebi-1, which is located approximately 16 miles northeast of Liza. This well will target Liza-type Campanian aged reservoirs and is expected to spud in February using the Stena Carron drillship. 
In March, we expect to spud the Longtail-3 appraisal well, which will provide additional data in the Turbot/Longtail area, and we will drill a deeper section that will target lower Campanian and Santonian and geologic intervals. The Stena DrillMAX will drill this well. 
Moving to April, we expect to spud the Uaru-2 appraisal well utilizing the Noble Don Taylor drillship. Success here, and at Mako-2, which will be drilled later this year, could move the Mako/Uaru area forward in the development queue. 
Then in May, we plan to spud the Whiptail-1 exploration well, located approximately 12 miles east of Liza. This well will test Campanian and Santonian aged reservoirs and will be drilled by the Stena DrillMAX. 
Turning now to our Guyana developments. In mid-December, the Liza Destiny Floating Production Storage and Offloading vessel achieved its nameplate capacity of 120,000 gross barrels of oil equivalent per day. And since then, has been operating at that level or higher. During 2021, the operator intends to evaluate and pursue options to increase nameplate capacity. For 2021, we forecast net production from Guyana will average approximately 30,000 barrels of oil per day, with planned maintenance and optimization downtime being broadly offset by an increase in nameplate capacity. 
The Liza Phase 2 development remains on track for first oil in early 2022. The overall project, including the FPSO, drilling and subsea infrastructure, is approximately 85% complete. We anticipate that the Liza Unity FPSO, which will have a capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day, to sail from the Keppel Shipyard in Singapore to Guyana by midyear. 
Payara, our third sanctioned development on the Stabroek Block, will utilize an FPSO with a gross production capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day, with first oil expected in 2024. The hull for the Prosperity FPSO is complete, topside construction activities are underway, and we expect the integration of the hull and topsides to begin at the Keppel Yard in Singapore by year-end. 
Front-end engineering and design work is ongoing for a fourth development at Yellowtail. This work will continue through 2021, and we anticipate being ready to submit a plan of development to the government of Guyana for approval in the fourth quarter. 
In closing, our execution continues to be strong. The Bakken and our offshore assets in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia are performing well and continue to generate significant cash flow. And Guyana continues to get bigger and better, all of which positions us to deliver industry-leading cash flow growth and significant shareholder value over the course of the next decade. 
I will now turn the call over to John Rielly."

In my remarks today, I will compare results from the fourth quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2020 and provide guidance for 2021.We incurred a net loss of $97 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with a net loss of $243 mill",1024,"Thanks Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the fourth quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2020 and provide guidance for 2021.
We incurred a net loss of $97 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with a net loss of $243 million in the third quarter of 2020. On an adjusted basis, which excludes items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, we incurred a net loss of $176 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to a net loss of $216 million in the previous quarter. Fourth quarter results include an after-tax gain of $79 million from the sale of our interest in the Shenzi Field. 
Turning to E&P. On an adjusted basis, E&P incurred a net loss of $118 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to a net loss of $156 million in the previous quarter. The after-tax changes in adjusted E&P results between the fourth quarter and third quarter were as follows: higher realized selling prices improved results by $18 million; higher sales volumes improved results by $11 million; lower DD&A expense improved results by $40 million; lower exploration expenses improved results by $12 million; higher cash costs, driven by workovers and hurricane-related maintenance costs in the Gulf of Mexico reduced results by $41 million; all other items reduced results by $2 million, for an overall increase in fourth quarter results of $38 million. 
Our E&P operations were overlifted compared with production in the fourth quarter by approximately 1.6 million barrels, resulting in an increased after-tax income of approximately $15 million. 
Turning to Midstream. The Midstream segment had net income of $62 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to net income of $56 million in the previous quarter. Midstream EBITDA, before noncontrolling interests, amounted to $198 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $180 million in the previous quarter. 
Turning to corporate. After-tax corporate and interest expenses were $120 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to an adjusted after-tax expense of $116 million in the previous quarter. 
Turning to our financial position. At quarter end, excluding Midstream, cash and cash equivalents were approximately $1.74 billion, and our total liquidity was $5.4 billion including available committed credit facilities, while debt and finance lease obligations totaled $6.6 billion. 
Our fully undrawn $3.5 billion revolving credit facility is committed through May 2023. In November 2020, we completed the previously announced sale of our 28% working interest in the shenzi field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico for net proceeds of $482 million. 
Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $532 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with $468 million in the previous quarter, primarily due to higher crude oil sales volumes. In the fourth quarter, net cash provided from operating activities after changes in working capital was $486 million compared with $136 million in the prior quarter. 
Proceeds from the September sale of the first VLCC cargo of 2.1 million barrels of oil were received in October. We have entered into agreements to sell the second and third VLCC cargoes totaling 4.2 million barrels of oil in the first quarter of 2021. We expect to recognize net income of approximately $60 million in the first quarter from these sales, including associated hedging gains and costs. First quarter 2021 net cash provided by operating activities after changes in working capital is expected to include approximately $150 million of cash flow from these sales. 
For calendar year 2021, we have purchased WTI put options for 100,000 barrels of oil per day that have an average monthly floor price of $45 per barrel and Brent put options for 20,000 barrels of oil per day that have an average monthly price -- floor price of $50 per barrel. 
Now turning to guidance. First, for E&P., we project E&P cash costs, excluding Libya, to be in the range of $10.50 to $11.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the first quarter and for the full year 2021. DD&A expense, excluding Libya, is forecast to be in the range of $12 to $13 per barrel of oil equivalent for the first quarter and for the full year 2021. This results in projected total E&P unit operating costs, excluding Libya, to be in the range of $22.50 to $24.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the first quarter and for the full year 2021. 
Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs, are expected to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million in the first quarter and $170 million to $180 million for the full year 2021. The midstream tariff is projected to be in the range of $265 million to $275 million in the first quarter and $1.09 billion to $1.12 billion for the full year 2021. 
E&P income tax expense, excluding Libya, is expected to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million for the first quarter and $80 million to $90 million for the full year 2021. 
As highlighted earlier, we have purchased crude oil hedge positions for calendar year 2021. We expect noncash option premium amortization, which will be reflected in our realized selling prices to reduce our results by approximately $37 million per quarter. Our E&P capital and exploratory expenditures are expected to be approximately $425 million in the first quarter and approximately $1.9 billion for the full year 2021. 
For Midstream, we anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Midstream segment to be in the range of $70 million to $80 million in the first quarter and $280 million to $290 million for the full year 2021. 
Corporate expenses are estimated to be in the range of $35 million to $40 million for the first quarter and $130 million to $140 million for the full year 2021. Interest expense is estimated to be in the range of $95 million to $100 million for the first quarter and $380 million to $390 million for the full year 2021. 
This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator."

So I think first, you were saying, for the hedges themselves for our 100,000 barrels a day of WTI put options that we have at $45 and then the 20,000 barrels a day for Brent production that we have at $50, the amortization of that is going to be $37",484,"Sure. So I think first, you were saying, for the hedges themselves for our 100,000 barrels a day of WTI put options that we have at $45 and then the 20,000 barrels a day for Brent production that we have at $50, the amortization of that is going to be $37 million per quarter. So we like it. We've got nice protection on the downside because, obviously, again, this is a big year for us just to kind of complete the development of Liza Phase 2. 
And as you know, when Liza Phase 2 comes on, look, it's approximately 60,000 barrels a day of Brent-based production. The cash cost of that Liza Phase 2 is going to be more around $10 pre any purchase of the FPSO versus the first one being at $12 just from the economy of scale. So you can put any type of Brent price in there and take out the $10 cash cost, and you can see there's going to be a significant inflection for us on cash flow once Phase 2 comes on. 
So for this year, Doug, from a cash flow stand, what were we looking to do? So the first thing we were looking to do was to get the hedges in place, so we have insurance on the downside. Coming into the year effectively, as I mentioned, we have $1.74 billion of cash at year-end. And as I said in my remarks, we're going to complete the sales of the 2 VLCCs, and it's going to give us cash flow of approximately $150 million in the first quarter. So on a pro forma basis, we basically have $1.9 billion of cash going into the year. 
So what I want to say, I mean, I don't want to guess on oil prices, but we've got the downside protected. We're coming in with a very strong cash balance, here from that standpoint. And therefore, at these higher prices, obviously, this helps with our funding program here for Guyana. So when Phase 2 comes on, depending on where prices are with our insurance now, we know we're going to have a nice cash cushion at that, and then we're going to be in the significant inflection point of getting much higher cash flow. And depending on prices there, the portfolio can just continue to generate free cash flow. Or, for some reason, prices go back down in that period, as I said, Guyana will still be generating free cash flow, even at very low prices once Phase 2 comes on, like $40 type prices. And then when Payara comes on, if it was really low prices, we'd still be generating free cash flow. So we've put ourselves in a good position with a very strong cash position, hedges, protection. Should be a nice year with prices at this level, and then a big inflection when Phase 2 starts."

Obviously, we also understand the President will make an announcement later today on federal lands and also some points, I think about climate. I think it's important for everyone to realize that only about 2% of our Bakken acreage is on federal land. 
So this announcement will not have an impact on our Bakken activities. And in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, as you heard Greg say earlier that we have no drilling planned for this year in the deepwater Gulf. And it remains to be seen what he's going to say about existing acreage and drilling permits for the deepwater, but we have no drilling plan this year. 
I think the most important point here is that the administration, as it makes these decisions to address climate change, that they have to be not only climate literate, but energy literate. And they have to realize that oil and gas are a strategic engine for the U.S. economy, especially at a time that we're trying to recover the economy from COVID. And that importance is in jobs. We have over 12 million direct and indirect jobs. 
In terms of low energy costs for our working class families, our power costs, in large part because of shale gas are half what they are in Europe, and in terms of national security, where we're energy independent, in large part because of shale oil and shale gas. So it's just a question of finding the balance here. And hopefully, as the administration moves forward, they will extend the hand as well we define common ground to make sure we do everything we can to address climate change, but also that oil and gas play a key role in the economy's recovery.

So for Liza Phase 1, it's $12 per barrel basically, and now, we're at full capacity here.

That's the cash cost per barrel while we're in the rental period, and you're correct, we have it in our numbers for the whole year. Post an FPSO purchase, it will drop down into the $8 to $9 type range for Liza Phase 1. 
As I mentioned, Liza Phase 2, actually, the cash cost will be approximately $10 per barrel while the FPSO is being leased. And then it's going to drop to $7 to $8 per barrel post the purchase of the FPSO. So again, for us, every time an FPSO comes online, it's going to help our cash costs, and it's also, by the way, going to help our DD&A rates. 
So right now, Liza Phase 1, the current DD&A rate is below our portfolio average, again, due to the low F&D costs. So when Liza Phase 2 comes on, ultimately, when it's up full and running here and you get to the full scale, again, that F&D is very low, and that's going to continue to drive our DD&A down. So again, we look forward for every FPSO to come on in Guyana."

So as part of our continued focus on sustainability, we want to drive that gas flaring as low as possible, obviously. So you will see us continue to add infrastructure with our partner in the Midstream together as much gas as we possibly can. 
Now if we talk about the oil, so the decline in oil is purely related to the wells online. So in Q3, we had 22 wells online. In Q4, we had 12 wells online. And in Q1, we only added -- in Q1 of this year, we will only put 4 wells online. So naturally, you're going to get some oil decline associated with that. 
However, as that second rig kicks in, which you really see the effects of in the second half of the year, that's when oil will begin to stabilize and be flat from then on with that second rig. 
So again, it's really just a mix issue of gas that changes your percentage on a total company basis. And then the oil is purely a function of the wells online. But that will stabilize, the company will stabilize 175,000 barrels a day flat for a number of years."

And as you mentioned, the operator now is conducting studies to put a project in place to further increase some of that capacity. Plans are to do that in the third quarter, so we'll have a shutdown period to be able to do that. That's going to be piping changes and basically just kind of debottlenecking some tight spots that you might have in the facility.

Now assuming oil prices improve in the future, what we'd like to do is eventually get the rig count to 4 in the Bakken. By getting the rig count to 4 will not only generate significant amount of cash flow, but we'll also be able to hold production in the Bakken broadly flat at around 200,000 barrels a day equivalent for almost 10 years. Why would we want to do that? Because we have 1,800 well locations left that, at current prices, generate very high returns. 
Now then if I look at this year's program, in particular, remember, I'm going to bring 45 wells online this year. The program is very similar to last year at the IP180s will be the same as last year, 120,000 barrels of oil IP180, very good wells. And at current returns, if you look at the IRR of that program this year of those 45 wells, it's 95% rate of return. 
And so I've got another -- after this year, I'll have another 1,750 wells that are in those very high returns that, of course, I want to get -- I'd like to develop. But I think, as we've said before, Paul, the role of the Bakken in the portfolio is to be a cash generator.

The driver of this is the increase in our year-end 2020 proved developed reserves. So you saw our reserve replacement. But I guess another aspect of this is that our proved developed reserves are up to about 70% of our proved reserves. So it's up 13% over -- year-on-year, excluding the asset sales. 
So you've got Bakken, obviously, proved developed reserves adds still net even after price revisions. You have Guyana, again, picking up proved developed reserves here as as more and more wells in the performance from Phase 2. And then you've got a good amount of transfers from puds that moved into proved developed reserves, approximately 100 million barrels there. And it's offset, obviously, by current production. 
So it's really the driver of proved developed reserves increasing significantly from last year. And then, you have a combination of year-over-year production mix. So as I mentioned, Guyana, right now, it is below our portfolio average. And so Guyana's production is increasing, so that's going to overall drive down the DD&A rate. And again, Bakken's DD&A rate, while still higher, is coming down from 2020 just due to the proved developed adds. So again, a good year for reserve adds."

Now the ramp, as I mentioned earlier, we anticipate that ramp will go much smoother of course, than Phase 1, and that's because all of the learnings, which were in the gas system, remember, all of the learnings have been applied to the gas system on Phase 2 because of very similar up equipment as in Phase 1. 
So very much expect the ramp broadly would occur over, say, a 3-month period because you're going to -- you bring things on and you measure dynamics. You've got vibration sensors everywhere. That's a pretty normal cadence to bring something like that on is over a 3-month period."

I hope you and your families are well and staying healthy during these challenging times. Today, I will review our continued progress in executing our strategy. Then Greg Hill will discuss our operations and John Rielly will review our financial performance. 
Our strategy has been and continues to be to grow our resource base, have a low-cost of supply and sustained cash flow growth. Our differentiated portfolio is balanced between short cycle and long cycle assets with our focus on the best rocks for the best returns. The Bakken, deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia are our cash engines and Guyana is our growth engine. Guyana becomes a significant cash engine as multiple phases of low-cost oil developments come online, which we believe will drive our company's breakeven price to under $40 per barrel Brent and provide industry-leading cash flow growth over the course of the decade. 
As our portfolio generates increasing free cash flow, we will first prioritize debt reduction, and then increase cash returns to shareholders through dividend increases and opportunistic share repurchases. 
Turning to 2020, we achieved strong operating results, overcoming difficult market conditions and the challenges of working safely in the pandemic. I am extremely proud of our workforce for delivering production in line with our original guidance despite a 40% reduction in our capital and exploratory expenditures. 
In response to the pandemic's severe impact on oil prices, our priorities have been to preserve cash, preserve our operating capability and to preserve the long-term value of our assets. 
In terms of preserving cash, we came into 2020 with approximately 80% of our oil production hedged with put options for 130,000 barrels per day at $55 per barrel of West Texas Intermediate and 20,000 barrels per day at $60 per barrel of Brent. To enhance cash flow and maximize the value of our production, last March and April, when U.S. oil storage was near capacity, we chartered 3 very large crude carriers or VLCCs to store approximately 2 million barrels each of May, June and July Bakken crude oil production. The first VLCC cargo of 2.1 million barrels was sold in China at a premium to Brent in September. And the second and third VLCC cargoes have been sold at a premium to Brent for delivery in the first quarter of 2021. 
We reduced our capital and exploratory spend for 2020 by 40% from our original budget of $3 billion, down to $1.8 billion. The majority of this reduction came from dropping from a 6 rig program in the Bakken to 1 rig. We also reduced our 2020 cash operating costs by $275 million. 
In 2020, we strengthened the company's cash and liquidity position through a $1 billion 3-year term loan, initially underwritten by JPMorgan Chase. In addition, we have an undrawn $3.5 billion revolving credit facility and no material debt maturities until 2023. 
During the fourth quarter, we closed on the sale of our 28% interest in the Shenzi Field in the Gulf of Mexico for a total consideration of $505 million, bringing value forward in the low-price environment. In terms of preserving capability, a key for us in 2020 was continuing to operate 1 rig in the Bakken. Greg Hill and our Bakken team have made tremendous progress over the past 10 years in lean manufacturing capabilities and innovative practices, which have delivered significant cost efficiencies and productivity improvements that we want to preserve for the future. 
In terms of preserving the long-term value of our assets, Guyana, with its low-cost of supply and industry-leading financial returns, remains our top priority. On the Stabroek Block, where Hess has a 30% interest and ExxonMobil is the operator, 2020 was another outstanding year. 3 oil discoveries during the year at Uaru, Redtail-1 and Yellowtail-2 brought total discoveries on the Stabroek Block to 18. The estimate of gross discovered recoverable resources on the block was increased to approximately 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent, and we continue to see multibillion barrels of future exploration potential remaining. 
In December, production from Liza Phase 1 reached its full capacity of 120,000 gross barrels of oil per day. The Liza Phase 2 development is on track to achieve first oil in early 2022 with a capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day. 
Another key 2020 milestone was the sanctioning of our third oil development on the Stabroek Block in September at the Payara field. Payara will have a capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day and is expected to achieve first oil in 2024. 
Turning to our plans for 2021. To protect our cash flows, we have hedged 100,000 barrels per day, with $45 per barrel WTI put options and 20,000 barrels per day with $50 per barrel Brent put options. Our 2021 capital and exploratory budget is $1.9 billion, of which, more than 80% will be allocated to Guyana and the Bakken. 
Our 3 sanctioned oil developments on the Stabroek Block have breakeven Brent oil prices of between $25 and $35 per barrel, world-class by any measure. Front-end engineering and design work for a fourth development at the Yellowtail area is underway, and we hope to submit the development plan to the government for approval before year-end. 
We continue to see the potential for at least 5 FPSOs to produce more than 750,000 gross barrels of oil per day by 2026, and longer term, for up to 10 FPSOs to develop the current discovered recoverable resource base. We will continue to invest in an active exploration and appraisal program in Guyana in 2021, with 12 to 15 wells planned for the block. The Hassa-1 exploration well recently encountered approximately 50 feet of oil-bearing reservoir in deeper geologic intervals. Although the well did not find oil in the primary shallower target areas, the Hassa well results confirm a working petroleum system and provide valuable information about the future exploration prospectivity for this part of the block. 
In the Bakken, we plan to add a second rig during the first quarter, which will allow us to sustain production in the range of 175,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for several years and protect the long-term cash flow generation from this important asset. 
As we continue to execute our strategy, our Board, our leadership team and our employees will be guided by our long-standing commitment to sustainability and the Hess values. We are proud to have been recognized throughout 2020 by a number of third-party organizations for the quality of our environmental, social and governance, performance and disclosure. In December, we achieved leadership status in CDP's annual global climate analysis for the 12th consecutive year, and earned a place on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for North America for the 11th consecutive year. 
In summary, our priorities will remain to preserve cash, preserve capability and preserve the long-term value of our assets. By investing only in high-return low-cost opportunities, we have built a differentiated portfolio of assets that we believe will provide industry-leading cash flow growth for over the course of the decade. As our free cash flow grows, we will first prioritize debt reduction and then return of capital to shareholders, both in terms of dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. 
I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update."
249841,700625915,2252666,"Hess Corporation, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2021",2021-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Hess Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. I also hope that everyone on the call is well and staying safe. 2020 marked another year of strong performance and strategic execution for Hess despite the challenging conditions on many fronts. In particular, I would like to call out severa",1714,"Thanks, John. I also hope that everyone on the call is well and staying safe. 2020 marked another year of strong performance and strategic execution for Hess despite the challenging conditions on many fronts. In particular, I would like to call out several operational highlights from the year. 
First, across our company, we have implemented comprehensive COVID-19 health and safety measures, including health screenings and testing, extended work schedules at offshore platforms and social distancing initiatives, all based on government and public health agencies' guidance. I'm truly grateful to our Hess response team and our global workforce for their commitment to keeping their colleagues and our communities safe during this pandemic. 
Second, in the Bakken, despite dropping from 6 rigs to 1 in May, our full year net production came in well above our original guidance for the year and 27% above that of 2019. These results reflect the strong performance of our plug-and-perf completions, increased natural gas capture and the quality of our acreage position. 
Third, in Guyana, we made significant advances on all 3 of our sanction developments on the Stabroek Block, with Liza Phase 1, reaching it's full production capacity in December, Liza Phase 2 remaining on track for first oil early next year, and Payara, sanctioned in September, with first oil expected in 2024. Continued exploration and appraisal success increased the gross recoverable resource estimate for the block to approximately 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent. 
Now turning to our operations. Proved reserves at the end of 2020 stood at 1.17 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Net proved reserve additions in 2020 totaled 117 million barrels of oil equivalent, including negative net price revisions of 79 million barrels of oil equivalent, which resulted in overall 2020 production replacement ratio of 95% and a finding and development cost of $15.25 per barrel of oil equivalent. Excluding price-related revisions, our production replacement ratio was 158%, with an F&D cost of $9.10 per barrel of oil equivalent. 
Turning to production. In the fourth quarter of 2020, company-wide net production averaged 309,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, above our guidance, of approximately 300,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day, driven by higher natural gas capture in the Bakken and higher natural gas nominations in Southeast Asia. For the full year 2021, we forecast net production to average approximately 310,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. For the first quarter of 2021, we forecast net production to average approximately 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. 
In the Bakken, fourth quarter net production averaged 189,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of approximately 9% above the year ago quarter and above our guidance of 180,000 to 185,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
For the full year 2020, Bakken net production averaged 193,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, an increase of approximately 27% compared to 2019 and well above our original full year guidance of 180,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, despite dropping from 6 rigs to 1 in May. 
We have a robust inventory of more than 1,800 drilling locations in the Bakken that can generate attractive returns at current oil prices, representing approximately 60 rig years of activity. With WTI prices now in the range of $50 per barrel, we will add a second operated drilling rig during the first quarter. A 2-rig program will enable us to hold net production flat at approximately 175,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, and will sustain strong long-term cash generation from this important asset. 
In 2020, our drilling and completion cost per Bakken well averaged $6.2 million, which was $600,000 or 9% lower than 2019. In 2021, we expect D&C costs to average below $6 million per well. Over the full year, we expect to drill 55 gross operated wells and bring approximately 45 new wells online. This compares to 71 wells drilled and 111 wells brought online in 2020. In the first quarter of 2021, we expect to drill approximately 10 wells and bring 4 new wells online.
Bakken net production is forecast to average approximately 170,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for both the first quarter and for the full year 2021. Our full year forecast reflects the impact of a planned 45-day shutdown of the Tioga Gas Plant in the third quarter, which is expected to reduce full year net production by approximately 7,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day, predominantly affecting natural gas production. During the shutdown, we will perform a turnaround and tie-in the plan expansion project completed in 2020, which will then increase capacity to 400 million cubic feet per day from the plant's current 250 million cubic feet per day capacity. 
Now moving to the offshore. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, net production averaged 32,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter and 56,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the full year 2020. Fourth quarter net production came in below our guidance of 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day due to the early closing of the Shenzi sale and extended to hurricane recovery downtime at 2 third-party operated production platforms. 
In 2021, no new wells are planned in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, and we forecast net production from our assets to average approximately 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This includes the impact of planned maintenance shutdowns in both the second and third quarters. The deepwater Gulf of Mexico remains a very important cash engine for the company as well as a platform for future growth. 
In Malaysia and the Joint Development Area in the Gulf of Thailand, where Hess has a 50% interest, net production averaged 56,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the fourth quarter and 52,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day for the full year 2020. Fourth quarter production was above our guidance of 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day because of higher natural gas nominations. For the full year 2021, net production from Malaysia and the JDA is forecast to average approximately 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
Turning to Guyana, where Hess has a 30% interest in the Stabroek Block and ExxonMobil is the operator. In 2020, we announced 3 new discoveries, bringing the total number of discoveries to 18 and increasing our estimate of gross discovered recoverable resources to approximately 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent. And we continue to see multibillion barrels of exploration upside on the Stabroek Block, and we are planning an active exploration program in 2021. 
In March, the operator will bring a fifth drillship, the Stena DrillMAX, into theater and in April, a sixth drillship, the Noble Sam Croft. We plan to drill 12 to 15 exploration and appraisal wells in 2021 that will target a variety of prospects and play types. These will include lower risk wells near existing discoveries, higher risk step outs and several penetrations that will test deeper Lower Campanian and Santonian intervals. This ramped up program will allow us to accelerate exploration of the block and enable optimum sequencing of future developments. 
In addition, the emerging deep play, which we believe has significant potential, needs further drilling to determine its commerciality and ultimate value. 
Over the next several months, we will participate in 2 exploration wells and 2 appraisal wells on the Stabroek Block. The next exploration well to be drilled is Koebi-1, which is located approximately 16 miles northeast of Liza. This well will target Liza-type Campanian aged reservoirs and is expected to spud in February using the Stena Carron drillship. 
In March, we expect to spud the Longtail-3 appraisal well, which will provide additional data in the Turbot/Longtail area, and we will drill a deeper section that will target lower Campanian and Santonian and geologic intervals. The Stena DrillMAX will drill this well. 
Moving to April, we expect to spud the Uaru-2 appraisal well utilizing the Noble Don Taylor drillship. Success here, and at Mako-2, which will be drilled later this year, could move the Mako/Uaru area forward in the development queue. 
Then in May, we plan to spud the Whiptail-1 exploration well, located approximately 12 miles east of Liza. This well will test Campanian and Santonian aged reservoirs and will be drilled by the Stena DrillMAX. 
Turning now to our Guyana developments. In mid-December, the Liza Destiny Floating Production Storage and Offloading vessel achieved its nameplate capacity of 120,000 gross barrels of oil equivalent per day. And since then, has been operating at that level or higher. During 2021, the operator intends to evaluate and pursue options to increase nameplate capacity. For 2021, we forecast net production from Guyana will average approximately 30,000 barrels of oil per day, with planned maintenance and optimization downtime being broadly offset by an increase in nameplate capacity. 
The Liza Phase 2 development remains on track for first oil in early 2022. The overall project, including the FPSO, drilling and subsea infrastructure, is approximately 85% complete. We anticipate that the Liza Unity FPSO, which will have a capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day, to sail from the Keppel Shipyard in Singapore to Guyana by midyear. 
Payara, our third sanctioned development on the Stabroek Block, will utilize an FPSO with a gross production capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day, with first oil expected in 2024. The hull for the Prosperity FPSO is complete, topside construction activities are underway, and we expect the integration of the hull and topsides to begin at the Keppel Yard in Singapore by year-end. 
Front-end engineering and design work is ongoing for a fourth development at Yellowtail. This work will continue through 2021, and we anticipate being ready to submit a plan of development to the government of Guyana for approval in the fourth quarter. 
In closing, our execution continues to be strong. The Bakken and our offshore assets in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia are performing well and continue to generate significant cash flow. And Guyana continues to get bigger and better, all of which positions us to deliver industry-leading cash flow growth and significant shareholder value over the course of the next decade. 
I will now turn the call over to John Rielly."

In my remarks today, I will compare results from the fourth quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2020 and provide guidance for 2021.We incurred a net loss of $97 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with a net loss of $243 mill",1024,"Thanks Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the fourth quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2020 and provide guidance for 2021.
We incurred a net loss of $97 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with a net loss of $243 million in the third quarter of 2020. On an adjusted basis, which excludes items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, we incurred a net loss of $176 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to a net loss of $216 million in the previous quarter. Fourth quarter results include an after-tax gain of $79 million from the sale of our interest in the Shenzi Field. 
Turning to E&P. On an adjusted basis, E&P incurred a net loss of $118 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to a net loss of $156 million in the previous quarter. The after-tax changes in adjusted E&P results between the fourth quarter and third quarter were as follows: higher realized selling prices improved results by $18 million; higher sales volumes improved results by $11 million; lower DD&A expense improved results by $40 million; lower exploration expenses improved results by $12 million; higher cash costs, driven by workovers and hurricane-related maintenance costs in the Gulf of Mexico reduced results by $41 million; all other items reduced results by $2 million, for an overall increase in fourth quarter results of $38 million. 
Our E&P operations were overlifted compared with production in the fourth quarter by approximately 1.6 million barrels, resulting in an increased after-tax income of approximately $15 million. 
Turning to Midstream. The Midstream segment had net income of $62 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to net income of $56 million in the previous quarter. Midstream EBITDA, before noncontrolling interests, amounted to $198 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $180 million in the previous quarter. 
Turning to corporate. After-tax corporate and interest expenses were $120 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to an adjusted after-tax expense of $116 million in the previous quarter. 
Turning to our financial position. At quarter end, excluding Midstream, cash and cash equivalents were approximately $1.74 billion, and our total liquidity was $5.4 billion including available committed credit facilities, while debt and finance lease obligations totaled $6.6 billion. 
Our fully undrawn $3.5 billion revolving credit facility is committed through May 2023. In November 2020, we completed the previously announced sale of our 28% working interest in the shenzi field in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico for net proceeds of $482 million. 
Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $532 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with $468 million in the previous quarter, primarily due to higher crude oil sales volumes. In the fourth quarter, net cash provided from operating activities after changes in working capital was $486 million compared with $136 million in the prior quarter. 
Proceeds from the September sale of the first VLCC cargo of 2.1 million barrels of oil were received in October. We have entered into agreements to sell the second and third VLCC cargoes totaling 4.2 million barrels of oil in the first quarter of 2021. We expect to recognize net income of approximately $60 million in the first quarter from these sales, including associated hedging gains and costs. First quarter 2021 net cash provided by operating activities after changes in working capital is expected to include approximately $150 million of cash flow from these sales. 
For calendar year 2021, we have purchased WTI put options for 100,000 barrels of oil per day that have an average monthly floor price of $45 per barrel and Brent put options for 20,000 barrels of oil per day that have an average monthly price -- floor price of $50 per barrel. 
Now turning to guidance. First, for E&P., we project E&P cash costs, excluding Libya, to be in the range of $10.50 to $11.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the first quarter and for the full year 2021. DD&A expense, excluding Libya, is forecast to be in the range of $12 to $13 per barrel of oil equivalent for the first quarter and for the full year 2021. This results in projected total E&P unit operating costs, excluding Libya, to be in the range of $22.50 to $24.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the first quarter and for the full year 2021. 
Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs, are expected to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million in the first quarter and $170 million to $180 million for the full year 2021. The midstream tariff is projected to be in the range of $265 million to $275 million in the first quarter and $1.09 billion to $1.12 billion for the full year 2021. 
E&P income tax expense, excluding Libya, is expected to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million for the first quarter and $80 million to $90 million for the full year 2021. 
As highlighted earlier, we have purchased crude oil hedge positions for calendar year 2021. We expect noncash option premium amortization, which will be reflected in our realized selling prices to reduce our results by approximately $37 million per quarter. Our E&P capital and exploratory expenditures are expected to be approximately $425 million in the first quarter and approximately $1.9 billion for the full year 2021. 
For Midstream, we anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Midstream segment to be in the range of $70 million to $80 million in the first quarter and $280 million to $290 million for the full year 2021. 
Corporate expenses are estimated to be in the range of $35 million to $40 million for the first quarter and $130 million to $140 million for the full year 2021. Interest expense is estimated to be in the range of $95 million to $100 million for the first quarter and $380 million to $390 million for the full year 2021. 
This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator."

So I think first, you were saying, for the hedges themselves for our 100,000 barrels a day of WTI put options that we have at $45 and then the 20,000 barrels a day for Brent production that we have at $50, the amortization of that is going to be $37",484,"Sure. So I think first, you were saying, for the hedges themselves for our 100,000 barrels a day of WTI put options that we have at $45 and then the 20,000 barrels a day for Brent production that we have at $50, the amortization of that is going to be $37 million per quarter. So we like it. We've got nice protection on the downside because, obviously, again, this is a big year for us just to kind of complete the development of Liza Phase 2. 
And as you know, when Liza Phase 2 comes on, look, it's approximately 60,000 barrels a day of Brent-based production. The cash cost of that Liza Phase 2 is going to be more around $10 pre any purchase of the FPSO versus the first one being at $12 just from the economy of scale. So you can put any type of Brent price in there and take out the $10 cash cost, and you can see there's going to be a significant inflection for us on cash flow once Phase 2 comes on. 
So for this year, Doug, from a cash flow stand, what were we looking to do? So the first thing we were looking to do was to get the hedges in place, so we have insurance on the downside. Coming into the year effectively, as I mentioned, we have $1.74 billion of cash at year-end. And as I said in my remarks, we're going to complete the sales of the 2 VLCCs, and it's going to give us cash flow of approximately $150 million in the first quarter. So on a pro forma basis, we basically have $1.9 billion of cash going into the year. 
So what I want to say, I mean, I don't want to guess on oil prices, but we've got the downside protected. We're coming in with a very strong cash balance, here from that standpoint. And therefore, at these higher prices, obviously, this helps with our funding program here for Guyana. So when Phase 2 comes on, depending on where prices are with our insurance now, we know we're going to have a nice cash cushion at that, and then we're going to be in the significant inflection point of getting much higher cash flow. And depending on prices there, the portfolio can just continue to generate free cash flow. Or, for some reason, prices go back down in that period, as I said, Guyana will still be generating free cash flow, even at very low prices once Phase 2 comes on, like $40 type prices. And then when Payara comes on, if it was really low prices, we'd still be generating free cash flow. So we've put ourselves in a good position with a very strong cash position, hedges, protection. Should be a nice year with prices at this level, and then a big inflection when Phase 2 starts."

Obviously, we also understand the President will make an announcement later today on federal lands and also some points, I think about climate. I think it's important for everyone to realize that only about 2% of our Bakken acreage is on federal land. 
So this announcement will not have an impact on our Bakken activities. And in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, as you heard Greg say earlier that we have no drilling planned for this year in the deepwater Gulf. And it remains to be seen what he's going to say about existing acreage and drilling permits for the deepwater, but we have no drilling plan this year. 
I think the most important point here is that the administration, as it makes these decisions to address climate change, that they have to be not only climate literate, but energy literate. And they have to realize that oil and gas are a strategic engine for the U.S. economy, especially at a time that we're trying to recover the economy from COVID. And that importance is in jobs. We have over 12 million direct and indirect jobs. 
In terms of low energy costs for our working class families, our power costs, in large part because of shale gas are half what they are in Europe, and in terms of national security, where we're energy independent, in large part because of shale oil and shale gas. So it's just a question of finding the balance here. And hopefully, as the administration moves forward, they will extend the hand as well we define common ground to make sure we do everything we can to address climate change, but also that oil and gas play a key role in the economy's recovery. 
And John, you want to talk about the IDCs?"

So for Liza Phase 1, it's $12 per barrel basically, and now, we're at full capacity here.

That's the cash cost per barrel while we're in the rental period, and you're correct, we have it in our numbers for the whole year. Post an FPSO purchase, it will drop down into the $8 to $9 type range for Liza Phase 1. 
As I mentioned, Liza Phase 2, actually, the cash cost will be approximately $10 per barrel while the FPSO is being leased. And then it's going to drop to $7 to $8 per barrel post the purchase of the FPSO. So again, for us, every time an FPSO comes online, it's going to help our cash costs, and it's also, by the way, going to help our DD&A rates. 
So right now, Liza Phase 1, the current DD&A rate is below our portfolio average, again, due to the low F&D costs. So when Liza Phase 2 comes on, ultimately, when it's up full and running here and you get to the full scale, again, that F&D is very low, and that's going to continue to drive our DD&A down. So again, we look forward for every FPSO to come on in Guyana."

So as part of our continued focus on sustainability, we want to drive that gas flaring as low as possible, obviously. So you will see us continue to add infrastructure with our partner in the Midstream together as much gas as we possibly can. 
Now if we talk about the oil, so the decline in oil is purely related to the wells online. So in Q3, we had 22 wells online. In Q4, we had 12 wells online. And in Q1, we only added -- in Q1 of this year, we will only put 4 wells online. So naturally, you're going to get some oil decline associated with that. 
However, as that second rig kicks in, which you really see the effects of in the second half of the year, that's when oil will begin to stabilize and be flat from then on with that second rig. 
So again, it's really just a mix issue of gas that changes your percentage on a total company basis. And then the oil is purely a function of the wells online. But that will stabilize, the company will stabilize 175,000 barrels a day flat for a number of years."

Now for the last week, we've been operating at around 127,000 barrels a day, pretty steady in Phase 1. And as you mentioned, the operator now is conducting studies to put a project in place to further increase some of that capacity. Plans are to do that in the third quarter, so we'll have a shutdown period to be able to do that. That's going to be piping changes and basically just kind of debottlenecking some tight spots that you might have in the facility. 
So that's why our forecasted volumes for the year 2021 are 30,000 barrels of oil net to us because you get some pick up from that optimization that the operator is planning to do, offset a little bit by the shutdown time required to do it.

Now assuming oil prices improve in the future, what we'd like to do is eventually get the rig count to 4 in the Bakken. By getting the rig count to 4 will not only generate significant amount of cash flow, but we'll also be able to hold production in the Bakken broadly flat at around 200,000 barrels a day equivalent for almost 10 years. Why would we want to do that? Because we have 1,800 well locations left that, at current prices, generate very high returns. 
Now then if I look at this year's program, in particular, remember, I'm going to bring 45 wells online this year. The program is very similar to last year at the IP180s will be the same as last year, 120,000 barrels of oil IP180, very good wells. And at current returns, if you look at the IRR of that program this year of those 45 wells, it's 95% rate of return. 
And so I've got another -- after this year, I'll have another 1,750 wells that are in those very high returns that, of course, I want to get -- I'd like to develop. But I think, as we've said before, Paul, the role of the Bakken in the portfolio is to be a cash generator.

So you've got Bakken, obviously, proved developed reserves adds still net even after price revisions. You have Guyana, again, picking up proved developed reserves here as as more and more wells in the performance from Phase 2. And then you've got a good amount of transfers from puds that moved into proved developed reserves, approximately 100 million barrels there. And it's offset, obviously, by current production. 
So it's really the driver of proved developed reserves increasing significantly from last year. And then, you have a combination of year-over-year production mix. So as I mentioned, Guyana, right now, it is below our portfolio average. And so Guyana's production is increasing, so that's going to overall drive down the DD&A rate. And again, Bakken's DD&A rate, while still higher, is coming down from 2020 just due to the proved developed adds. So again, a good year for reserve adds."

So all going very well, as I said in my remarks, project is 85% complete. Vessel due to sail away early in the summer, get it on location and then do that very active hookup program that will put a square of little bit the first oil in the early part of 2022. 
Now the ramp, as I mentioned earlier, we anticipate that ramp will go much smoother of course, than Phase 1, and that's because all of the learnings, which were in the gas system, remember, all of the learnings have been applied to the gas system on Phase 2 because of very similar up equipment as in Phase 1. 
So very much expect the ramp broadly would occur over, say, a 3-month period because you're going to -- you bring things on and you measure dynamics. You've got vibration sensors everywhere. That's a pretty normal cadence to bring something like that on is over a 3-month period."

Welcome to our first quarter conference call. We hope you and your families are all well. Today, I will review our continued progress in executing our strategy. Then Greg Hill will discuss our operations. And John Rielly will then review",1189,"Thank you, Jay. Welcome to our first quarter conference call. We hope you and your families are all well. 
Today, I will review our continued progress in executing our strategy. Then Greg Hill will discuss our operations. And John Rielly will then review our financial performance. 
Let's begin with our strategy, which has been and continues to be to grow our resource base, have a low cost of supply and sustained cash flow growth. By investing only in high-return, low-cost opportunities, we have built a differentiated portfolio that is balanced between short-cycle and long-cycle assets, with Guyana as our growth engine and the Bakken, Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia as our cash engines. 
Guyana is positioned to become a significant cash engine as multiple phases of low-cost oil developments come online, which we expect will drive our portfolio breakeven Brent oil price below $40 per barrel by the middle of the decade. 
As our portfolio generates increasing free cash flow, we will first prioritize debt reduction and then cash returns to shareholders through dividend increases and opportunistic share repurchases. 
Even as we have seen oil prices recover since the beginning of this year, our priorities continue to be to preserve cash, preserve our operating capability and preserve the long-term value of our assets. 
In terms of preserving cash, at the end of March, we had [ 1 8 6 ] billion of cash on the balance sheet, a $3.5 billion revolving credit facility, which is undrawn and was recently extended by 1 year to 2024 and no debt maturities until 2023. 
We have maintained a disciplined capital and exploratory budget for 2021 of $1.9 billion. More than 80% of this year's capital spend is allocated to Guyana, where our 3 sanctioned oil developments have a breakeven oil price of between $25 and $35 per barrel, and to the Bakken, where we have a large inventory of future drilling locations that generate attractive financial returns at $50 per barrel WTI. 
To manage downside risks, in 2021, we have hedged 120,000 barrels of oil per day with $55 per barrel WTI put options and 30,000 barrels of oil per day with $60 per barrel Brent put options. 
To further optimize our portfolio and strengthen our cash and liquidity position, we recently announced 2 asset sales. 
In March, we entered into an agreement to sell our oil and gas interest in Denmark for a total consideration of $150 million effective January 1, 2021. This transaction is expected to close in the third quarter. 
On April 8, we announced the sale of our Little Knife and Murphy Creek nonstrategic acreage interest in the Bakken for a total consideration of $312 million, effective March 1, 2021. This acreage is located in the southernmost portion of our Bakken position and is connected to Hess Midstream infrastructure. The sale of this acreage, most of which we were not planning to drill before 2026, brings material value forward. This transaction is expected to close within the next few weeks. 
During the quarter, we also received $70 million in net proceeds from the public offering of a small portion of our Class A shares in Hess Midstream LP. 
The Bakken remains a core part of our portfolio. In February, as WTI oil prices moved above $50 per barrel, we added a second rig, which will allow us to sustain production and strong cash flow generation from our largest operated asset. 
In terms of preserving the long-term value of our assets, Guyana, with its low cost of supply and industry-leading financial returns, remains a top priority. 
On the Stabroek Block, where Hess has a 30% interest and ExxonMobil is the operator, we have made 18 significant discoveries to date, with gross discovered recoverable resources of approximately 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent and we continue to see multibillion barrels of future exploration potential remaining. 
We have an active exploration and appraisal program this year on the Stabroek Block. Yesterday, we announced the discovery at the Uaru-2 well with encouraging results that further define the large aerial extent of this accumulation, underpinning a potential future oil development. 
In addition, drilling activities are underway for appraisal at the Longtail-3 well and for exploration at the Koebi-1 prospect. 
Production [indiscernible] phase I ran at its full capacity of 120,000 gross barrels of oil per day during the first quarter. In mid-April, production was curtailed for several days after a minor leak was detected in the flash gas compressor discharge silencer. Production has since ramped back up and is expected to remain in the range of 100,000 to 110,000 gross barrels of oil per day until repairs to the discharge silencer are completed in approximately 3 months. Following this repair, production is expected to return to or above Liza Destiny's nameplate capacity of 120,000 barrels of oil per day. 
The Liza phase 2 development is on track to achieve first oil in early 2022, with a capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day. 
Our third oil development on the Stabroek Block at the Payara field is expected to achieve first oil in 2024, also with a capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day. 
Engineering work for Yellowtail, a fourth development on the Stabroek Block, is underway with anticipated start-up in 2025 pending government approvals and project sanctioning. We continue to see the potential for at least 6 FPSOs on the block by 2027 and longer-term for up to 10 FPSOs to develop the discovered resources on the block. 
As we execute our company strategy, we will continue to be guided by our long-standing commitment to sustainability and are proud to be an industry leader in this area. We support the aim of the Paris Agreement and also a global ambition to achieve net 0 emissions by 2050. 
As part of our sustainability commitment, our Board and our senior leadership have set aggressive targets for greenhouse gas emissions reduction. In 2020, we significantly surpassed our 5-year emission reduction targets, reducing the operated scope 1 and scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions intensity by approximately 40% and flaring intensity by approximately 60% compared to 2014 levels. 
We recently announced our new 5-year emission reduction targets for 2025, which are to reduce operated scope 1 and scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions intensity by approximately 44% and methane emissions intensity by approximately 50% from 2017 levels. 
In addition, we are investing in technological and scientific advances designed to reduce, capture and store carbon emissions, including groundbreaking work being conducted by the Salk Institute to develop plants with larger root systems that, according to the Salk Institute, are capable of absorbing and storing potentially billions of tons of carbon per year from the atmosphere. 
In summary, our company is executing our strategy that will deliver increasing financial returns, visible and low-risk production growth and accelerating cash flow growth well into this decade. As we generate increasing free cash flow, we will first prioritize debt reduction and then the return of capital to our shareholders through dividend increases and opportunistic share repurchases. 
I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update."
249841,710883154,2260594,"Hess Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2021",2021-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Hess Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. Overall, in the first quarter, we demonstrated strong execution and delivery across our portfolio. Company-wide net production averaged 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, which was in line with our guidance. The",1519,"Thanks, John. Overall, in the first quarter, we demonstrated strong execution and delivery across our portfolio. 
Company-wide net production averaged 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, which was in line with our guidance. 
The Bakken experienced extreme weather conditions and higher NGL prices during the quarter, both of which led to lower volumes. However, the higher NGL prices resulted in significantly higher net income and cash flows. 
Bakken net production in the first quarter averaged 158,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was below our guidance of approximately 170,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Of this shortfall, approximately 8,000 barrels per day was due to the significant increase in NGL prices in the quarter. 
Much of our third-party gas processing from our operated production is done under percent of proceeds or POP contracts, where we charge a fixed fee for processing wet gas but take NGL barrels as payment instead of cash. POP volumes from these contracts get reported as Hess net production. When NGL prices increase, as they did in the first quarter, it takes fewer barrels to cover our gas processing fees. Hence, our reported NGL production was reduced. But again, the higher NGL prices resulted in significantly higher earnings and cash flow. 
The other [indiscernible] Bakken production in the quarter was related to winter storm [ Yury, ] which brought power outages and average wind chill temperatures of minus 34 degrees Fahrenheit for 2 weeks in February. These extreme temperatures were below safe operating conditions for our crews and led to higher nonproductive time on our drilling rigs, significantly higher workover backlogs and lower non-operated production. 
As discussed in our January earnings call, we added a second rig in the Bakken in February. In the first quarter, we drilled 11 wells and brought 4 new wells online. In the second quarter, we expect to drill approximately 15 wells and bring approximately 10 new wells online. And for the full year 2021, we expect to drill approximately 55 wells and to bring approximately 45 new wells online. 
Thanks to the continued application of lean and technology, our drilling and completion costs are expected to average approximately $5.8 million per well in 2021, which represents a 6.5% reduction from $6.2 million in 2020 and a 15% reduction from $6.8 million in 2019. 
For the second quarter, we forecast that our Bakken net production will average approximately 155,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. And for the full year 2021, between 155,000 and 160,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This forecast reflects the residual weather impacts, higher NGL strip prices, the sale of our nonstrategic Bakken acreage and the planned turnaround of the Tioga gas plant in the third quarter. We expect net production to build in the second half of the year and forecast a 2021 exit rate of between 170,000 and 175,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
Moving to the offshore. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, first quarter net production averaged 56,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting strong operations following hurricane recovery in late 2020. In the second quarter, we forecast that the Gulf of Mexico net production will average approximately 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. For the full year 2021, we maintain our guidance for Gulf of Mexico net production to average approximately 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting planned maintenance downtime and natural field declines. 
In the Gulf of Thailand, net production in the first quarter was 64,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day as natural gas [ nominations ] continue to increase due to strong economic growth. Second quarter and full year 2021 net production are forecast to average approximately 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
Now turning to Guyana. Our discoveries and developments on the Stabroek Block are world-class in every respect and, with Brent breakeven oil prices of between $25 and $35 per barrel, represent some of the lowest project breakeven oil prices in the industry. 
Production from Liza Phase 1 averaged 121,000 gross barrels of oil per day or 31,000 barrels of oil per day net to Hess in the first quarter. As John mentioned, production at the Liza Destiny was curtailed for several days following the detection of a minor gas leak in the flash gas compressors discharge silencer on April 11. Production is currently averaging between 110,000 and 100,000 gross barrels of oil per day and is expected to stay in that range while repairs are made to the silencer. Upon reinstallation and restart of the flash gas compression system expected in approximately 3 months, production is expected to return to or above nameplate capacity of 120,000 barrels of oil per day. For the second quarter, we now forecast net production to average between 20,025 thousand barrels of oil per day and our full year 2021 net production to average approximately 30,000 barrels of oil per day. 
SBM Offshore has placed an order for an upgraded flash gas compression system, which is expected to be installed in the fourth quarter of 2021. Production optimization work is now planned in the fourth quarter, which will further increase the Liza Destiny progression capacity. 
I think it's important to note that the overall performance of the subsurface in Liza-1 has been outstanding. We have seen very strong reservoir and well performance that has met or exceeded our expectations. Once the flash gas compressor is replaced, we are confident that we will see a significant improvement in uptime reliability. 
At Liza Phase 2, the project is progressing to plan, with about 90% of the overall work completed and first oil remains on track for early 2022. The Liza Unity FPSO, with a production capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day, is preparing to sail from the Keppel yard in Singapore to Guyana mid-year. 
Our third development, Payara, is also progressing in plan, with about 38% of the overall work completed. The project will utilize the Liza Prosperity FPSO, which will have the capacity to produce up to 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day. 
The FPSO hole is complete and topsides construction activities have commenced in Singapore. First oil remains on track for 2024. 
Front-end engineering and design work continued for the fourth development on the Stabroek Block at Yellowtail. The operator expects to submit a plan of development to the government of Guyana in the second half of this year. Pending government approval and project sanctioning, the Yellowtail project is expected to achieve first oil in 2025. 
The Stabroek Block exploration program for the remainder of the year will focus on both Campanian, Liza-type reservoirs and on the deeper Santonian reservoirs. In addition, key appraisal activities will be targeted in the southeast portion of the Stabroek Block to inform future developments. 
In terms of drilling activity, as announced yesterday, the Uaru-2 well successfully appraised the Uaru [indiscernible] discovery and also made an incremental discovery in deeper intervals. The well encountered approximately 120 feet of high-quality, oil-bearing sandstone reservoir and was drilled 6.8 miles from the discovery well, implying a potentially large aerial extent. The [ standard drome AX ] is currently appraising the Longtail discovery, and additional appraisal is planned at Mako and in the Turbot area, which will help define our fifth and sixth developments on the block. 
The Sterna Carron has commenced exploration drilling at the Koebi-1 well and an exploration well at Whiptail is planned to spud in May. Further exploration and appraisal activities are planned for the second half of 2021 with a total of approximately 12 wells to be drilled this year. 
The Noble Tom Madden, the Noble Bob Douglas and the Noble Sam Croft, which recently joined the fleet, will be primarily focused on development drilling. 
Now shifting back to production. Company-wide second quarter net production is forecast to average between 290,000 and 295,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Full year 2021 net production is now also expected to average between 290,000 and 295,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to our previous forecast of approximately 310,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This reduction reflects the following: Approximately 7,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day due to lower entitlements resulting from the increase in NGL strip prices. Again, this will be accretive overall to earnings and cash flow. Second factor is approximately 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day was related to the sale of our interest in Denmark and nonstrategic acreage in North Dakota, for which we brought full value forward. The balance primarily reflects short-term weather impacts in the Bakken, from which we expect to catch back up over the course of the year and again forecast a 2021 Bakken exit rate of between 170,000 and 175,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
In closing, our team once again demonstrated strong execution and delivery across our asset base under challenging conditions. Our distinctive capabilities and world-class portfolio will enable us to deliver industry-leading performance and value to our shareholders for many years to come. 
I will now turn the call over to John Rielly."

In my remarks today, I will compare results from the first quarter of 2021 to the fourth quarter of 2020. 
We had net income of $252 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to an adjusted net loss of $176 million which excluded an after-tax gain of $79 million from an asset sale in the fourth quarter of 2020. 
Turning to E&P. E&P had net income of $308 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to an adjusted net loss of $118 million in the previous quarter. 
The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted E&P results between the first quarter of 2021 and  the fourth quarter of 2020 were as follows: Higher realized crude oil, NGL and natural gas selling prices increased earnings by $192 million. Higher sales volumes increased earnings by $99 million. Lower DD&A expense increased earnings by $88 million. Lower cash costs increased earnings by $39 million. All other items increased earnings by $8 million for an overall increase in first quarter earnings of $426 million. 
Excluding the 2 VLCC cargo sales, our E&P sales volumes were overlifted compared with production by approximately 300,000 barrels, which improved after-tax results by approximately $10 million. 
The sales from the 2 VLCC cargoes increased net income by approximately $70 million in the quarter. 
The impact of higher NGL prices improved first quarter earnings by approximately $55 million and reduced Bakken NGL volumes received on a percentage of proceeds or POP contracts by 9,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared with the fourth quarter of 2020. 
Now turning to Midstream. The Midstream segment had net income of $75 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $62 million in the prior quarter. Midstream EBITDA before noncontrolling interest amounted to $225 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $198 million in the previous quarter. In March, Hess received net proceeds of $70 million from the public offering of 3,450,000 Hess-owned Class A shares in Hess Midstream. 
Now turning to our financial position. At quarter end, excluding Midstream, cash and cash equivalents were approximately $1.86 billion, and our total liquidity was $5.5 billion, including available committed credit facilities, while debt and finance lease obligations totaled $6.6 billion. 
Our fully undrawn $3.5 billion revolving credit facility is now committed through May 2024 following the amendment executed earlier this month to extend the maturity date by 1 year. 
In the first quarter of 2021, net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $815 million compared with $532 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, primarily due to higher realized selling prices. 
In the first quarter, net cash provided from operating activities after changes in working capital was $591 million compared with $486 million in the prior quarter. 
The sale of our Little Knife and Murphy Creek acreage in the Bakken for total consideration of $312 million is expected to close within the next few weeks and the sale of our interest in Denmark for total consideration of $150 million is expected to close in the third quarter of this year. 
Now turning to guidance. Our E&P cash costs were $9.81 per barrel of oil equivalent including Libya, and $10.21 per barrel of oil equivalent excluding Libya, in the first quarter of 2021. 
We project E&P cash costs excluding Libya to be in the range of $12 to $13 per barrel of oil equivalent for the second quarter, primarily reflecting the timing of maintenance and workover spend. 
Full year E&P cash costs are expected to be in the range of $11 to $12 per barrel of oil equivalent, which is up from previous full year guidance of $10.50 to $11.50 per barrel of oil equivalent due to the impact of updated production guidance. 
DD&A expense was $11.83 per barrel of oil equivalent, including Libya, and $12.36 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding Libya, in the first quarter. 
DD&A expense, excluding Libya, is forecast to be in the range of $11.50 to $12.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the second quarter. And full year guidance of $12 to $13 per barrel of oil equivalent is unchanged. 
This results in projected total E&P unit operating costs, excluding Libya, to be in the range of $23.50 to $25.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the second quarter and $23 to $25 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year of 2021. 
Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs, are expected to be in the range of $40 million to $45 million in the second quarter and full year guidance of $170 million to $180 million is unchanged. 
The Midstream tariff is projected to be in the range of $260 million to $270 million for the second quarter and full year guidance of $1,090,000,000 to $1,115,000,000 is unchanged. 
E&P income tax expense, excluding Libya, is expected to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million for the second quarter and $105 million to $115 million for the full year, which is up from previous guidance of $80 million to $90 million, due to higher commodity prices. 
We expect noncash option premium amortization will be approximately $65 million for the second quarter and approximately $245 million for the full year, which is up from previous guidance of $205 million, reflecting additional premiums paid to increase the strike price on our crude oil hedging contracts. 
In the second quarter, we expect to sell two 1 million-barrel cargoes from Guyana, whereas we sold three 1 million-barrel cargoes in the first quarter and we expect to sell five 1 million-barrel cargoes over the second half of the year. 
Our E&P capital and exploratory expenditures are expected to be approximately $500 million in the second quarter, and the full year guidance of approximately $1.9 billion remains unchanged. 
For Midstream, we anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Midstream segment to be in the range of $60 million to $70 million for the second quarter, and the full year guidance of $280 million to $290 million remains unchanged. 
For corporate, corporate expenses are estimated to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million for the second quarter, and full year guidance of $130 million to $140 million is unchanged. 
Interest expense is estimated to be in the range of $95 million to $100 million for the second quarter, and full year guidance of $380 million to $390 million is unchanged.

A couple of points we'd like to make. Look, the world has 2 future challenges. One is how do we provide more energy supply, 20% more energy supply by 2040? And how do we get to net 0 emissions by 2050? I think the bes",339,"Yes. Great question, Neil. Thank you. A couple of points we'd like to make. Look, the world has 2 future challenges. One is how do we provide more energy supply, 20% more energy supply by 2040? And how do we get to net 0 emissions by 2050? I think the best resource to provide insights into these challenges is the world energy outlook of the International Energy Agency. And under their sustainable development scenario, which says that even if all the pledges of the Paris Climate Accord were met, oil and gas would still be 46% of the energy mix in 2040. So it's not just about climate literacy, it's also about energy literacy. Oil and gas is still going to be needed 20 years out. 
The key to all of this, because none of us can call an oil price, there's always going to be volatility, and some of the pressures you're talking about obviously are going to be a factor in that, the key will be having a low-cost of supply. And we believe that we're uniquely positioned in that regard with a growing resource, a low cost of supply, that positions our company with a differentiated portfolio of assets that we have, with a growing resource at low cost of supply, to deliver sustainable and industry-leading cash flow growth and financial returns for our shareholders. 
And when you talk about the longer term, I think it's important to realize that Guyana isn't as longer term. We're bringing it forward almost every year. First in 2022 with Liza-2, then in 2024 with Payara, then Yellowtail in 2025. The payouts are very quick and the returns are very high. 
So we are going to be bringing value forward, and you can look at a cadence most likely of bringing on one of these low-cost developments about every year thereafter. 
So we are bringing the value forward. And with low cost of supply, we think we're going to be uniquely positioned to provide sustainable and industry-leading cash flow growth."

So first, let's talk about the flash gas compressor. As John and I both mentioned in our opening remarks, we had a couple of days of downtime associated with that where production was curtailed for a couple of days. That flash gas compressor is now back in Houston, being torn down, looked at, with the expectation that it will be restored within the next 3 months, right? So once that happens, then we'll get back to that 120,000 barrels a day plus. So say that's July. 
Then the next increment, as you mentioned, is the debottlenecking project, which now is going to occur in the fourth quarter. And that will take Liza Phase I up another [ incremental production ]. Now they're still in final engineering phase of that. So I can't give you an exact number as to what that's going to be. But that will come in the fourth quarter. 
Also in the fourth quarter, Exxon is going to replace the existing flash gas compressor with some of the components that have been redesigned. 
So that -- that shutdown in the fourth quarter, about 14 days, will accomplish those 2 things. It will be the debottlenecking and also the installation of a new redesigned flash gas compressor for Phase 1."

So we can give more color as the engineering of that project gets done. 
Now regarding the Bakken, again, the primary role of the Bakken in our portfolio is to be a cash engine. And so as such, the decision to add any rigs in the Bakken is going to be driven by corporate returns and corporate cash flow needs. 
Now if prices remain strong in the second half of this year, we're considering the addition of a third rig in the fourth quarter of 2021. 
And then as you indicated, our medium-term or long-term objective, again going to be driven by returns and driven by corporate cash flow, would be to get the Bakken back to 200,000 barrels a day. That would probably require a fourth rig. And by doing so, at $60 WTI, the Bakken would be $1 billion a year free cash flow generator at 200,000 barrels a day. 
The other nice thing about the 200,000 barrels a day is it optimizes efficient use of the infrastructure that we have built up there. So it's sort of the ultimate sweet spot for the Bakken.

So there's really 3 objectives of the exploration appraisal program this year with the 3 drilling rigs. The first one is to appraise existing discoveries, and that's really to underpin the fifth and the sixth ship in Guyana. So Uaru was first cab off the rank, if you will. Longtail's next. Turbot will be after that. We'll also do Mako as well. So we want to get those understood with appraisal wells and some DSTs to really inform where ship 5 and where ship 6 is going to go since Yellowtail is #4. 
The second objective is to continue to explore the Campanian, to really fill out that patchwork quilt of prospectivity, if you will, between Turbot and Liza. And you'll see in our investor pack, there was a number of polygons there that we'd like to get drilled this year as well. 
And then the third objective was -- is, can we get some deeper penetrations in the Santonian. Certainly, the Santonian has the potential to be a very large addition to the recoverable resources in Guyana. And I'll remind everyone, we've had 4 penetrations, coupled with Apache's results, we see that as very positive. But we've got a lot more drilling to do to understand it. And that is another key objective this year, to get some more penetrations in that so we can begin to piece the puzzle together on the Santonian."

The oil resource is going to be needed in the next 20 years. Key is having a low cost of supply. And putting ourselves in a position to generate sustainable and industry-leading cash flow growth. That's -- that's how we're going to make -- maximize returns and value for our shareholders. 
Having said that, climate change is real, the greatest scientific challenge of the 21st century. I'd recommend everybody to read Bill Gates' book, how do we avoid a climate disaster, because it really talks about the technological challenges ahead of us, the innovation needed. There are no easy answers. The energy transition is going to take a long time, costs a lot of money and need technological breakthroughs to be able to provide more energy to the world, as I talked about before, but also get on a track to net 0 emissions, greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. 
And one way that we are going to lead in that and be part of that is, obviously, get our own carbon footprint down for scope 1 and scope 2 emissions. The targets that we've set for 2025 actually get us on a trajectory better and superior to the GOCI or the oil industry standards that have been set, number one. 
And number two, we are looking at groundbreaking research, and we think nature offers that opportunity to really make a difference and the work we're doing at Salk Institute, we're very enthusiastic about, where most people don't realize, but there's more carbon in the soil than there is in the atmosphere. And if we can figure out by supporting the great research at the Salk Institute to capture and store carbon in the soil at a much higher rate and a much higher density than currently is being done, that could be a potential game changer and contribute to getting us to net 0 carbon emissions. 
So we're trying to play our role, but the first, second and third priority is to maximize value for our shareholders."

So the Gulf of Mexico, like the Bakken, remains an important cash engine and a platform for higher return opportunities for Hess. So our -- our minimum objective is to hold it flat. And we have an inventory of tieback opportunities that we believe we can hold it flat in the short term, 3 to 4 years probably, once we get back to work with some of the tieback opportunities. 
First, these high-return opportunities, Llano-6, which we're currently evaluating with Shell, and if we sanction that, it could quickly add production, with expected first oil 4 months from the spud. 
And then we also have a large number of exploration blocks. So during the downturn, as you recall, when everybody was focused on the Permian, we stayed focused on the offshore, and we acquired 60 new leases in the Gulf, existing leases, so they won't be affected by the Biden moratorium potentially on new leases. And in that, we see some very good hub class opportunities as well, both in the Miocene and the emerging Cretaceous [indiscernible] play. 
So we'd like to get back to work on a hub class opportunity. The first 1 is likely going to be a well called Heron, which is a very large Miocene opportunity. 
So we've got the inventory to, as a minimum, hold it flat and then potentially even grow it. But like the Bakken, investment in the Gulf of Mexico is going to be a function of returns and cash flow needs of the corporation. But we certainly got the inventory to do it and would like to get back to work as soon as we can."

And so the wells that we are drilling this year have been the same. They've been 1.2 million barrel recoverable IP 80s of about 120, which was the same as last year. And I think importantly, IRRs averaging nearly 90% at current oil prices.

Today, I will review our continued progress in executing our strategy. Then Greg Hill will discuss our operations. And John Rielly will then review our financial performance.  
Let's begin with our strategy, which has been and continues to be to grow our resource base, have a low cost of supply and sustain cash flow growth. By investing only in high-return, low-cost opportunities, we have built a differentiated portfolio that is balanced between short-cycle and long-cycle assets, with Guyana as our growth engine and the Bakken, Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia as our cash engines.  
Guyana is positioned to become a significant cash engine as multiple phases of low-cost oil developments come online, which we expect will drive our portfolio breakeven Brent oil price below $40 per barrel by the middle of the decade.  
As our portfolio generates increasing free cash flow, we will first prioritize debt reduction and then cash returns to shareholders through dividend increases and opportunistic share repurchases.  
Even as we have seen oil prices recover since the beginning of this year, our priorities continue to be to preserve cash, preserve our operating capability and preserve the long-term value of our assets.  
In terms of preserving cash, at the end of March, we had $1.86 billion of cash on the balance sheet, a $3.5 billion revolving credit facility, which is undrawn and was recently extended by 1 year to 2024 and no debt maturities until 2023.  
We have maintained a disciplined capital and exploratory budget for 2021 of $1.9 billion. More than 80% of this year's capital spend is allocated to Guyana, where our 3 sanctioned oil developments have a breakeven oil price of between $25 and $35 per barrel, and to the Bakken, where we have a large inventory of future drilling locations that generate attractive financial returns at $50 per barrel WTI.  
To manage downside risks, in 2021, we have hedged 120,000 barrels of oil per day with $55 per barrel WTI put options and 30,000 barrels of oil per day with $60 per barrel Brent put options.  
To further optimize our portfolio and strengthen our cash and liquidity position, we recently announced 2 asset sales. In March, we entered into an agreement to sell our oil and gas interest in Denmark for a total consideration of $150 million effective January 1, 2021. This transaction is expected to close in the third quarter.  
On April 8, we announced the sale of our Little Knife and Murphy Creek nonstrategic acreage interest in the Bakken for a total consideration of $312 million, effective March 1, 2021. This acreage is located in the southernmost portion of our Bakken position and is not connected to Hess Midstream infrastructure. The sale of this acreage, most of which we were not planning to drill before 2026, brings material value forward. This transaction is expected to close within the next few weeks.  
During the quarter, we also received $70 million in net proceeds from the public offering of a small portion of our Class A shares in Hess Midstream LP.  
The Bakken remains a core part of our portfolio. In February, as WTI oil prices moved above $50 per barrel, we added a second rig, which will allow us to sustain production and strong cash flow generation from our largest operated asset.  
In terms of preserving the long-term value of our assets, Guyana, with its low cost of supply and industry-leading financial returns, remains a top priority.  
On the Stabroek Block, where Hess has a 30% interest and ExxonMobil is the operator, we have made 18 significant discoveries to date, with gross discovered recoverable resources of approximately 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent and we continue to see multibillion barrels of future exploration potential remaining.  
We have an active exploration and appraisal program this year on the Stabroek Block. Yesterday, we announced the discovery at the Uaru-2 well with encouraging results that further define the large aerial extent of this accumulation, underpinning a potential future oil development.  
In addition, drilling activities are underway for appraisal at the Longtail-3 well and for exploration at the Koebi-1 prospect.  
Production from the Phase 1 ran at its full capacity of 120,000 gross barrels of oil per day during the first quarter. In mid-April, production was curtailed for several days after a minor leak was detected in the flash gas compressor discharge silencer. Production has since ramped back up and is expected to remain in the range of 100,000 to 110,000 gross barrels of oil per day until repairs to the discharge silencer are completed in approximately 3 months. Following this repair, production is expected to return to or above Liza Destiny's nameplate capacity of 120,000 barrels of oil per day.  
The Liza Phase 2 development is on track to achieve first oil in early 2022, with a capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day.  
Our third oil development on the Stabroek Block at the Payara field is expected to achieve first oil in 2024, also with a capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day.  
Engineering work for Yellowtail, a fourth development on the Stabroek Block, is underway with anticipated start-up in 2025 pending government approvals and project sanctioning. We continue to see the potential for at least 6 FPSOs on the block by 2027 and longer-term for up to 10 FPSOs to develop the discovered resources on the block.  
As we execute our company strategy, we will continue to be guided by our long-standing commitment to sustainability and are proud to be an industry leader in this area. We support the aim of the Paris Agreement and also a global ambition to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.  
As part of our sustainability commitment, our Board and our senior leadership have set aggressive targets for greenhouse gas emissions reduction. In 2020, we significantly surpassed our 5-year emission reduction targets, reducing the operated Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions intensity by approximately 40% and flaring intensity by approximately 60% compared to 2014 levels.  
We recently announced our new 5-year emission reduction targets for 2025, which are to reduce operated Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions intensity by approximately 44% and methane emissions intensity by approximately 50% from 2017 levels.  
In addition, we are investing in technological and scientific advances designed to reduce, capture and store carbon emissions, including groundbreaking work being conducted by the Salk Institute to develop plants with larger root systems that, according to the Salk Institute, are capable of absorbing and storing potentially billions of tons of carbon per year from the atmosphere.  
In summary, our company is executing our strategy that will deliver increasing financial returns, visible and low-risk production growth and accelerating cash flow growth well into this decade. As we generate increasing free cash flow, we will first prioritize debt reduction and then the return of capital to our shareholders through dividend increases and opportunistic share repurchases.  
I will now turn the call over to Greg for an operational update."
249841,710883154,2260807,"Hess Corporation, Q1 2021 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2021",2021-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Hess Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. Overall, in the first quarter, we demonstrated strong execution and delivery across our portfolio.  Company-wide net production averaged 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, which was in line with our guidance.  Th",1512,"Thanks, John. Overall, in the first quarter, we demonstrated strong execution and delivery across our portfolio.  
Company-wide net production averaged 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, which was in line with our guidance.  
The Bakken experienced extreme weather conditions and higher NGL prices during the quarter, both of which led to lower volumes. However, the higher NGL prices resulted in significantly higher net income and cash flows.  
Bakken net production in the first quarter averaged 158,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was below our guidance of approximately 170,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Of this shortfall, approximately 8,000 barrels per day was due to the significant increase in NGL prices in the quarter.  
Much of our third-party gas processing from our operated production is done under percent of proceeds or POP contracts, where we charge a fixed fee for processing wet gas but take NGL barrels as payment instead of cash. POP volumes from these contracts get reported as Hess net production. When NGL prices increase, as they did in the first quarter, it takes fewer barrels to cover our gas processing fees. Hence, our reported NGL production was reduced. But again, the higher NGL prices resulted in significantly higher earnings and cash flow.  
The other factor that Bakken production in the quarter was related to winter storm Uri, which brought power outages and average wind chill temperatures of minus 34 degrees Fahrenheit for 2 weeks in February. These extreme temperatures were below safe operating conditions for our crews and led to higher nonproductive time on our drilling rigs, significantly higher workover backlogs and lower non-operated production.  
As discussed in our January earnings call, we added a second rig in the Bakken in February. In the first quarter, we drilled 11 wells and brought 4 new wells online. In the second quarter, we expect to drill approximately 15 wells and bring approximately 10 new wells online. And for the full year 2021, we expect to drill approximately 55 wells and to bring approximately 45 new wells online.  
Thanks to the continued application of lean technology, our drilling and completion costs are expected to average approximately $5.8 million per well in 2021, which represents a 6.5% reduction from $6.2 million in 2020 and a 15% reduction from $6.8 million in 2019.  
For the second quarter, we forecast that our Bakken net production will average approximately 155,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. And for the full year 2021, between 155,000 and 160,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This forecast reflects the residual weather impacts, higher NGL strip prices, the sale of our nonstrategic Bakken acreage and the planned turnaround of the Tioga gas plant in the third quarter. We expect net production to build in the second half of the year and forecast a 2021 exit rate of between 170,000 and 175,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.  
Moving to the offshore. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, first quarter net production averaged 56,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting strong operations following hurricane recovery in late 2020. In the second quarter, we forecast that the Gulf of Mexico net production will average approximately 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. For the full year 2021, we maintain our guidance for Gulf of Mexico net production to average approximately 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting planned maintenance downtime and natural fuel declines.  
In the Gulf of Thailand, net production in the first quarter was 64,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day as natural gas nominations continue to increase due to strong economic growth. Second quarter and full year 2021 net production are forecast to average approximately 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.  
Now turning to Guyana. Our discoveries and developments on the Stabroek Block are world-class in every respect. And with Brent breakeven oil prices of between $25 and $35 per barrel, represent some of the lowest project breakeven oil prices in the industry.  
Production from Liza Phase 1 averaged 121,000 gross barrels of oil per day or 31,000 barrels of oil per day net to Hess in the first quarter. As John mentioned, production at the Liza Destiny was curtailed for several days following the detection of a minor gas leak in the flash gas compressor's discharge silencer on April 11. Production is currently averaging between 110,000 and 100,000 gross barrels of oil per day and is expected to stay in that range while repairs are made to the silencer. Upon reinstallation and restart of the flash gas compression system expected in approximately 3 months, production is expected to return to or above nameplate capacity of 120,000 barrels of oil per day. For the second quarter, we now forecast net production to average between 20,000 and 25,000 barrels of oil per day and our full year 2021 net production to average approximately 30,000 barrels of oil per day.  
SBM Offshore has placed an order for an upgraded flash gas compression system, which is expected to be installed in the fourth quarter of 2021. Production optimization work is now planned in the fourth quarter, which will further increase the Liza Destiny production capacity.  
I think it's important to note that the overall performance of the subsurface in Liza-1 has been outstanding. We have seen very strong reservoir and well performance that has met or exceeded our expectations. Once the flash gas compressor is replaced, we are confident that we will see a significant improvement in uptime reliability.  
At Liza Phase 2, the project is progressing to plan, with about 90% of the overall work completed and first oil remains on track for early 2022. The Liza Unity FPSO, with a production capacity of 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day, is preparing to sail from the Keppel yard in Singapore to Guyana mid-year.  
Our third development, Payara, is also progressing in plan, with about 38% of the overall work completed. The project will utilize the Liza Prosperity FPSO, which will have the capacity to produce up to 220,000 gross barrels of oil per day.  
The FPSO hole is complete and topsides construction activities have commenced in Singapore. First oil remains on track for 2024.  
Front-end engineering and design work continues for the fourth development on the Stabroek Block at Yellowtail. The operator expects to submit a plan of development to the government of Guyana in the second half of this year. Pending government approval and project sanctioning, the Yellowtail project is expected to achieve first oil in 2025.  
The Stabroek Block exploration program for the remainder of the year will focus on both Campanian, Liza-type reservoirs and on the deeper Santonian reservoirs. In addition, key appraisal activities will be targeted in the southeast portion of the Stabroek Block to inform future developments.  
In terms of drilling activity, as announced yesterday, the Uaru-2 well successfully appraised the Uaru-1 discovery and also made an incremental discovery in deeper intervals. The well encountered approximately 120 feet of high-quality, oil-bearing sandstone reservoir and was drilled 6.8 miles from the discovery well, implying a potentially large aerial extent. The Stena DrillMax is currently appraising the Longtail discovery, and additional appraisal is planned at Mako and in the Turbot area, which will help define our fifth and sixth developments on the block.  
The Sterna Carron has commenced exploration drilling at the Koebi-1 well and an exploration well at Whiptail is planned to spud in May. Further exploration and appraisal activities are planned for the second half of 2021 with a total of approximately 12 wells to be drilled this year.  
The Noble Tom Madden, the Noble Bob Douglas and the Noble Sam Croft, which recently joined the fleet, will be primarily focused on development drilling.  
Now shifting back to production. Company-wide second quarter net production is forecast to average between 290,000 and 295,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Full year 2021 net production is now also expected to average between 290,000 and 295,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to our previous forecast of approximately 310,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This reduction reflects the following: approximately 7,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day due to lower entitlements resulting from the increase in NGL strip prices. Again, this will be accretive overall to earnings and cash flow. Second factor is approximately 6,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day was related to the sale of our interest in Denmark and nonstrategic acreage in North Dakota, for which we brought full value forward. The balance primarily reflects short-term weather impacts in the Bakken, from which we expect to catch back up over the course of the year and again forecast a 2021 Bakken exit rate of between 170,000 and 175,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.  
In closing, our team once again demonstrated strong execution and delivery across our asset base under challenging conditions. Our distinctive capabilities and world-class portfolio will enable us to deliver industry-leading performance and value to our shareholders for many years to come.  
I will now turn the call over to John Rielly."

In my remarks today, I will compare results from the first quarter of 2021 to the fourth quarter of 2020.  
We had net income of $252 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to an adjusted net loss of $176 million which excluded an after-tax gain of $79 million from an asset sale in the fourth quarter of 2020.  
Turning to E&P. E&P had net income of $308 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to an adjusted net loss of $118 million in the previous quarter.  
The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted E&P results between the first quarter of 2021 and  the fourth quarter of 2020 were as follows: higher realized crude oil, NGL and natural gas selling prices increased earnings by $192 million. Higher sales volumes increased earnings by $99 million. Lower DD&A expense increased earnings by $88 million. Lower cash costs increased earnings by $39 million. All other items increased earnings by $8 million for an overall increase in first quarter earnings of $426 million.  
Excluding the 2 VLCC cargo sales, our E&P sales volumes were overlifted compared with production by approximately 300,000 barrels, which improved after-tax results by approximately $10 million.  
The sales from the 2 VLCC cargoes increased net income by approximately $70 million in the quarter.  
The impact of higher NGL prices improved first quarter earnings by approximately $55 million and reduced Bakken NGL volumes received on a percentage of proceeds or POP contracts by 9,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared with the fourth quarter of 2020.  
Now turning to Midstream. The Midstream segment had net income of $75 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $62 million in the prior quarter. Midstream EBITDA before noncontrolling interest amounted to $225 million in the first quarter of 2021 compared to $198 million in the previous quarter. In March, Hess received net proceeds of $70 million from the public offering of 3,450,000 Hess-owned Class A shares in Hess Midstream.  
Now turning to our financial position. At quarter end, excluding Midstream, cash and cash equivalents were approximately $1.86 billion, and our total liquidity was $5.5 billion, including available committed credit facilities, while debt and finance lease obligations totaled $6.6 billion.  
Our fully undrawn $3.5 billion revolving credit facility is now committed through May 2024 following the amendment executed earlier this month to extend the maturity date by 1 year.  
In the first quarter of 2021, net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $815 million compared with $532 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, primarily due to higher realized selling prices.  
In the first quarter, net cash provided from operating activities after changes in working capital was $591 million compared with $486 million in the prior quarter.  
The sale of our Little Knife and Murphy Creek acreage in the Bakken for total consideration of $312 million is expected to close within the next few weeks, and the sale of our interest in Denmark for total consideration of $150 million is expected to close in the third quarter of this year.  
Now turning to guidance. Our E&P cash costs were $9.81 per barrel of oil equivalent, including Libya, and $10.21 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding Libya, in the first quarter of 2021. We project E&P cash costs, excluding Libya, to be in the range of $12 to $13 per barrel of oil equivalent for the second quarter, primarily reflecting the timing of maintenance and workover spend.  
Full year E&P cash costs are expected to be in the range of $11 to $12 per barrel of oil equivalent, which is up from previous full year guidance of $10.50 to $11.50 per barrel of oil equivalent due to the impact of updated production guidance.  
DD&A expense was $11.83 per barrel of oil equivalent, including Libya, and $12.36 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding Libya, in the first quarter.  
DD&A expense, excluding Libya, is forecast to be in the range of $11.50 to $12.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the second quarter. And full year guidance of $12 to $13 per barrel of oil equivalent is unchanged.  
This results in projected total E&P unit operating costs, excluding Libya, to be in the range of $23.50 to $25.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the second quarter and $23 to $25 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year of 2021.  
Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs, are expected to be in the range of $40 million to $45 million in the second quarter and full year guidance of $170 million to $180 million is unchanged.  
The Midstream tariff is projected to be in the range of $260 million to $270 million for the second quarter and full year guidance of $1,090,000,000 to $1,115,000,000 is unchanged.  
E&P income tax expense, excluding Libya, is expected to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million for the second quarter and $105 million to $115 million for the full year, which is up from previous guidance of $80 million to $90 million, due to higher commodity prices.  
We expect noncash option premium amortization will be approximately $65 million for the second quarter and approximately $245 million for the full year, which is up from previous guidance of $205 million, reflecting additional premiums paid to increase the strike price on our crude oil hedging contracts.  
In the second quarter, we expect to sell two 1 million-barrel cargoes from Guyana, whereas we sold three 1 million-barrel cargoes in the first quarter and we expect to sell five 1 million-barrel cargoes over the second half of the year.  
Our E&P capital and exploratory expenditures are expected to be approximately $500 million in the second quarter and the full year guidance of approximately $1.9 billion remains unchanged.  
For Midstream, we anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Midstream segment to be in the range of $60 million to $70 million for the second quarter, and the full year guidance of $280 million to $290 million remains unchanged.  
For corporate, corporate expenses are estimated to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million for the second quarter, and full year guidance of $130 million to $140 million is unchanged.  
Interest expense is estimated to be in the range of $95 million to $100 million for the second quarter, and full year guidance of $380 million to $390 million is unchanged.  
This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator."

So the first thing that we're going to do with excess cash flow is pay down the $1 billion term loan.  
Once we have that paid off and that increased EBITDA from Phase 2, we will be under 2x our debt-to-EBITDA for our balance sheet. And then we'll be in that position to start increasing returns to shareholders.  
And we've been consistent about it. What the first thing we'll do is increase our dividend. We'll start to increase the dividends.

A couple of points we'd like to make. Look, the world has 2 future challenges. One is how do we provide more energy supply, 20% more energy supply by 2040, and how do we get to net 0 emissions by 2050. I think the bes",340,"Yes. Great question, Neil. Thank you. A couple of points we'd like to make. Look, the world has 2 future challenges. One is how do we provide more energy supply, 20% more energy supply by 2040, and how do we get to net 0 emissions by 2050. I think the best resource to provide insights into these challenges is the world energy outlook of the International Energy Agency. And under their sustainable development scenario, which says that even if all the pledges of the Paris Climate Accord were met, oil and gas would still be 46% of the energy mix in 2040. So it's not just about climate literacy, it's also about energy literacy. Oil and gas is still going to be needed 20 years out.  
The key to all of this, because none of us can call an oil price, there's always going to be volatility, and some of the pressures you're talking about obviously are going to be a factor in that, the key will be having a low cost of supply. And we believe that we're uniquely positioned in that regard with a growing resource, a low cost of supply, that positions our company with a differentiated portfolio of assets that we have, with a growing resource at low cost of supply, to deliver sustainable and industry-leading cash flow growth and financial returns for our shareholders.  
So when you talk about the longer term, I think it's important to realize that Guyana isn't as longer term. We're bringing it forward almost every year, first in 2022 with Liza-2, then in 2024 with Payara, then Yellowtail in 2025. The payouts are very quick and the returns are very high.  
So we are going to be bringing value forward, and you can look at a cadence most likely of bringing on one of these low-cost developments about every year thereafter.  
So we are bringing the value forward. And with low cost of supply, we think we're going to be uniquely positioned to provide sustainable and industry-leading cash flow growth."

So first, let's talk about the flash gas compressor. As John and I both mentioned in our opening remarks, we had a couple of days of downtime associated with that where production was curtailed for a couple of days. That flash gas compressor is now back in Houston, being torn down, looked at, with the expectation that it will be restored within the next 3 months, right? So once that happens, then we'll get back to that 120,000 barrels a day plus. So say that's July.  
Then the next increment, as you mentioned, is the debottlenecking project, which now is going to occur in the fourth quarter. And that will take Liza Phase 1 up another increment of production. Now they're still in final engineering phase of that. So I can't give you an exact number as to what that's going to be. But that will come in the fourth quarter.  
Also in the fourth quarter, Exxon is going to replace the existing flash gas compressor with some of the components that have been redesigned.  
So that -- that shutdown in the fourth quarter, about 14 days, will accomplish those 2 things.  It will be the debottlenecking and also the installation of a new redesigned flash gas compressor for Phase 1."

So the basic driver of the $220 million draw was an increase in receivables of $150 million, which we're happy to have. Obviously, oil price is going up, so our receivables went up from that standpoint. 
And then we did have -- you saw the lower cash cost, the lower capital numbers, so we did have a reduction in payables of $70 million.  So that $150 million and $70 million was the draw in working capital. 
We did have 2 nonrecurring items. One was the -- as we increased the strike prices on our hedges, so we had premiums paid there, but we also had the reduction in inventory from our VLCC sales. So they net against each other.

So we can give more color as the engineering of that project gets done. 
Now regarding the Bakken, again, the primary role of the Bakken in our portfolio is to be a cash engine. And so as such, the decision to add any rigs in the Bakken is going to be driven by corporate returns and corporate cash flow needs. 
Now if prices remain strong in the second half of this year, we're considering the addition of a third rig in the fourth quarter of 2021. 
And then as you indicated, our medium-term or long-term objective, again going to be driven by returns and driven by corporate cash flow, would be to get the Bakken back to 200,000 barrels a day. That would probably require a fourth rig. And by doing so, at $60 WTI, the Bakken would be $1 billion a year free cash flow generator at 200,000 barrels a day. 
The other nice thing about the 200,000 barrels a day is it optimizes efficient use of the infrastructure that we have built up there. So it's sort of the ultimate sweet spot for the Bakken.

And then the third objective was -- is, can we get some deeper penetrations in the Santonian. Certainly, the Santonian has the potential to be a very large addition to the recoverable resources in Guyana. And I'll remind everyone, we've had 4 penetrations, coupled with Apache's results, we see that as very positive. But we've got a lot more drilling to do to understand it.

And one way that we are going to lead in that and be part of that is, obviously, get our own carbon footprint down for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. The targets that we've set for 2025 actually get us on a trajectory better and superior to the OGCI or the oil industry standards that have been set, number one. 
And number two, we are looking at groundbreaking research, and we think nature offers that opportunity to really make a difference in the work we're doing at the Salk Institute. We're very enthusiastic about where most people don't realize, but there's more carbon in the soil than there is in the atmosphere. And if we can figure out by supporting the great research at the Salk Institute to capture and store carbon in the soil at a much higher rate and a much higher density than currently is being done, that could be a potential game changer and contribute to getting us to net 0 carbon emissions. 
So we're trying to play our role, but the first, second and third priority is to maximize value for our shareholders."

So the Gulf of Mexico, like the Bakken, remains an important cash engine and a platform for higher return opportunities for Hess. So our -- our minimum objective is to hold it flat. And we have an inventory of tieback opportunities that we believe we can hold it flat in the short term, 3 to 4 years probably, once we get back to work with some of the tieback opportunities. 
First, these high-return opportunities, Llano-6, which we're currently evaluating with Shell, and if we sanction that, it could quickly add production, with expected first oil 4 months from the spud. 
And then we also have a large number of exploration blocks. So during the downturn, as you recall, when everybody was focused on the Permian, we stayed focused on the offshore, and we acquired 60 new leases in the Gulf, existing leases, so they won't be affected by the Biden moratorium potentially on new leases. And in that, we see some very good Hub-class opportunities as well, both in the Miocene and the emerging Cretaceous per foot play. 
So we'd like to get back to work on a Hub-class opportunity. The first one is likely going to be a well called [ Heron ], which is a very large Miocene opportunity. 
So we've got the inventory to, as a minimum, hold it flat and then potentially even grow it. But like the Bakken, investment in the Gulf of Mexico is going to be a function of returns and cash flow needs of the corporation. But we certainly got the inventory to do it and would like to get back to work as soon as we can."

And so the wells that we are drilling this year have been the same. They've been 1.2 million barrel recoverable, IP180s of about 120, which was the same as last year. And I think importantly, IRRs averaging nearly 90% at current oil prices.

Today, I will review our continued progress in executing our strategy and our long-standing commitment to sustainability. Greg Hill will then discuss our operations, and John Rielly will cover our financial results. 
Our strategy is to grow our resource base, have a low cost of supply and sustain cash flow growth. Executing this strategy has positioned our company to deliver industry-leading cash flow growth over the next decade and has made our portfolio increasingly resilient in a low oil price environment. Our strategy aligns with the world's growing need for affordable, reliable and cleaner energy that is necessary for human prosperity and global economic development. We recognize that climate change is the greatest scientific challenge of the 21st century and support the aim of the Paris Agreement and a global ambition to achieve net 0 emissions by 2050. The world faces a dual challenge of needing 20% more energy by 2040 and reaching net 0 carbon emissions by 2050. In the International Energy Agency's rigorous sustainable development scenario, which assumes that all pledges of the Paris Agreement are met, oil and gas will be 46% of the energy mix in 2040 compared with approximately 53% today. 
In the IEA's newest net 0 scenario, oil and gas will still be 29% of the energy mix in 2040. In either scenario, oil and gas will be needed for decades to come, and will require significantly more global investment over the next 10 years on an annual basis than the $300 billion spent last year. The key for our company is to have a low cost of supply by investing only in high-return cost opportunities, the best for the best returns. We have built a differentiated and focused portfolio that is balanced between short-cycle and long-cycle assets. Guyana is our growth engine and the Bakken, Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia are our cash engines. Guyana is positioned to become a significant cash engine in the coming years as multiple phases of low-cost oil developments come online, which we expect will drive our portfolio breakeven Brent oil price below $40 per barrel by the middle of the decade. 
Based on the most recent third-party estimates, our cash flow is estimated to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 42% between 2020 and 2023, which is 75% above our peers and puts us in the top 5% of the S&P 500, with a line of sight for up to 10 FPSOs to develop the discovered resources in Guyana. This industry-leading cash flow growth rate is expected to continue through the end of the decade. Investors want durability and growth in cash flow. We have both. We are pleased to announce today that in July, we paid down $500 million of our $1 billion term loan maturing in March 2023. Depending upon market conditions, we plan to repay the remaining $500 million in 2022. This debt reduction, combined with the start-up of Liza Phase I early next year, is expected to drive our debt-to-EBITDAX ratio under 2 next year. Once this debt is paid off and our portfolio generates increasing free cash flow, we plan to return the majority to our shareholders, first, through dividend increases, and then opportunistic share repurchases. 
In addition, we announced this morning that Hess Midstream will buy back $750 million of its Class B units from its sponsors, Hess Corporation and Global Infrastructure Partners to be completed in the third quarter. We expect to receive approximately $375 million in proceeds, and our ownership in Hess Midstream on a consolidated basis will be approximately 45% compared with 46% prior to the transaction. On April 30, we completed the sale of our Little Knife and Murphy Creek nonstrategic acreage interest in the Bakken for a total consideration of $312 million, effective March 1, 2021. This acreage, most of which we were not planning to drill before 2026 was located in the southernmost portion of our Bakken position and was not connected as Midstream infrastructure. The Midstream transaction and the sale of the Little Knife and Murphy Creek acreage bring material value forward and further strengthen our cash and liquidity position. The Bakken remains a core part of our portfolio and our largest operated asset. We have a large inventory of future drilling locations that generate attractive financial returns at $50 per barrel WTI. 
In February, when WT oil prices moved above $50 per barrel, we added a second rig. Given the continued strength in oil prices, we are now planning to add a third rig in the Bakken in September, which is expected to strengthen free cash flow generation in the years ahead. Key to our long-term strategy is Guyana, with its low cost of supply and industry-leading financial returns. We have an active exploration and appraisal program this year on the Stabroek Block, where Hess has a 30% interest and ExxonMobil is the operator. We see the potential for at least 6 FPSOs on the Block by 2027, and up to 10 FPSOs to develop the discovered resources on the Block. And we continue to see multibillion barrels of future exploration potential remaining. 
Earlier today, we announced a significant new oil discovery at Whiptail. The Whiptail #1 well encountered 246 feet of net pay. And the Whiptail #2 well, which is located 3 miles northeast of Whiptail 1 encountered 167 feet of net pay in high-quality oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs. Drilling continues at both wells to test deeper targets. The Whiptail discovery could form the basis for our future oil development in the Southeast area of the Stabroek Block and will add to the previous recoverable resource estimate of approximately 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent. In June, we also announced a discovery at the Longtail 3 well, which encountered approximately 230 feet of pay, including newly identified high-quality hydrocarbon-bearing reservoirs below the original Longtail 1 discovery intervals. In addition, the successful Mako 2 well, together with the well, which encountered approximately 120 feet of high-quality oil-bearing sandstone reservoir will potentially unpin a fifth oil development in the area east of the Liza complex. In terms of Guyana developments, the Liza FPSO with a gross capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day, is expected to sail from Singapore to Guyana in late August, and the Liza 2 development is on track to achieve first oil in early 2022. Our third oil development on the Stabroek Block at the Payara field is expected to achieve first oil in 2024, also with a gross capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day. 
Engineering work for our fourth development on the Stabroek Block at Yellowtail is underway with preliminary plans for our gross capacity in the range of 220,000 to 250,000 barrels of oil per day and anticipated start-up in 2025, pending government approvals and project sanctioning. Our 3 sanctioned oil developments have a breakeven Brent oil price of between $25 and $35 per barrel. And according to a recent data from Wood Mackenzie, our Guyana developments are the highest margin, lowest carbon intensity oil and gas assets globally. Last week, we announced publication of our 24th Annual Sustainability Report, which details our environmental, social and governance or ESG strategy and performance. In 2020, we significantly surpassed our 5-year emission reduction targets, reducing Scope 1 and 2 operated greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 46% and flaring intensity by 59% compared to 2014 levels. 
Our 5-year operated emission reduction targets for 2025, which are detailed in the sustainability report exceed the 22% reduction in carbon intensity by 2030 in the International Energy Agency's sustainable development scenario, which is consistent with the Paris Agreement's ambition to hold the rise in global average temperature low 2 degree Centigrade. We are also contributing to groundbreaking research being done by the Institute to develop plants with larger root systems that are capable of absorbing and storing potentially of tons of carbon per year from the atmosphere. We continue to be recognized as industry leader for the quality of our ESG performance and disclosure. In May, Hess was named the 100 Best Corporate Citizens list for the 14th consecutive year based upon an independent assessment by ISS ESG. And we were the only oil and gas company to earn a place on the 2021 list. In summary, oil and gas are going to be needed for decades to come. By continuing to successfully execute our strategy and achieve strong operational performance, our company is uniquely positioned to deliver industry-leading cash flow growth over the next decade. As our term loan is paid off and our portfolio generates increasing free cash flow, the maturity will be returned to our shareholders, first, through dividend increases and then opportunistic share repurchases. 
I will now turn the call over to Greg Hill for an operational update."

In the second quarter, we continued to deliver strong operational performance. Company-wide net production averaged 307,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, above our guidance of 290,000 to 295,000 barrels of oil equivalen",1134,"Thanks, John. In the second quarter, we continued to deliver strong operational performance. Company-wide net production averaged 307,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, above our guidance of 290,000 to 295,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, driven by good performance across the portfolio. In the third quarter, we expect company-wide production to average approximately 265,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, which reflects the Tioga gas plant turnaround in the Bakken and planned maintenance in the Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia. For full year 2021, we now forecast net production to average approximately 295,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, compared to our previous forecast of between 290,000 and 295,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. So we're now forecasting to be at the top of the range. 
Turning to the Bakken. Second quarter net production averaged 159,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This was above our guidance of approximately 155,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, primarily reflecting increased gas capture, which has allowed us to drive flaring to under 5%, well below the state's 9% limit. For the third quarter, we expect Bakken net production to average approximately 145,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which reflects the planned 45-day maintenance turnaround and expansion tie-in at the Tioga Gas Plant. For the full year 2021, we maintain our Bakken net production forecast of 155,000 to 160,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
In the second quarter, we drilled 17 wells and brought 9 new wells online. In the third quarter, we expect to drill approximately 15 wells and to bring approximately 20 new wells online. And for the full year 2021, we now expect to drill approximately 65 wells and to bring approximately 50 new wells online. In terms of drilling and completion costs, although we have experienced some cost inflation, we are confident that we can offset the increases through technology and lean manufacturing efficiency gains and are, therefore, maintaining our full year average forecast of $5.8 million per well in 2021. We've been operating 2 rigs since February. But given the improvement in oil prices and our robust inventory of high-return drilling locations, we plan to add a third rig in September. Moving to a 3-rig program will allow us to grow cash flow and production, better optimize our in-basin infrastructure and drive further reductions in our unit cash costs. 
Now moving to the offshore. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, second quarter net production averaged 52,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to our guidance of approximately 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the third quarter, we forecast Gulf of Mexico net production to average between 35,000 and 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting planned maintenance downtime as well as some hurricane contingency. For the full year 2021, our forecast for Gulf of Mexico net production remains approximately 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In Southeast Asia, net production in the second quarter was 66,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, above our guidance of approximately 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
Third quarter net production is forecast to average between 50,000 and 55,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting planned maintenance at North Malay Basin and the JDA as well as Phase 3 installation work at North Malay Basin. Full year 2021 net production is forecast to average approximately 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Now turning to Guyana. In the second quarter, gross production from Liza Phase 1 averaged 101,000 barrels of oil per day or 26,000 barrels of oil per day net The repaired flash gas compression system has been installed on the Liza Destiny FPSO and is under test. The operator is evaluating the test data to optimize performance and is safely managing production in the range of 120,000 to 125,000 barrels of oil per day. 
Replacement of the flash gas compression system with a modified design and production optimization work are planned for the fourth quarter, which will result in higher production capacity and reliability. Net production from Liza Phase 1 is forecast to average approximately 30,000 barrels of oil per day in the third quarter and for the full year 2021. Liza Phase 2 development will utilize the 220,000 barrels of oil per day Unity FPSO, which is scheduled to sail away from Singapore at the end of August and first oil remains on track for early 2022. Turning to our third development, Payara. The Prosperity FPSO is complete and will enter the Keppel yard in Singapore following the sail away of the Liza Unity. Topsides fabrication has commenced at and development drilling began in June. The overall project is approximately 45% completed. The Prosperity will have a gross production capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day and is on track to achieve first oil in 2024. 
As for our fourth development at Yellowtail, the joint venture anticipates submitting the plan of development to the government of Guyana in the fourth quarter with first oil targeted for 2025, pending government approvals and project sanctioning. During the second quarter, the Mako 2 appraisal well on the Stabroek Block confirmed the quality, thickness and aerial extent of the reservoir. When integrated with the previously announced discovery at Uaru-2, the data supports a potential fifth development in the area east of the Liza Complex. As John mentioned, this morning, we announced a discovery at Whiptail located approximately 4 miles southeast of Uaru-1. Drilling continues at both wells to test deeper targets. 
In terms of other drilling activity in the second half of 2021, after Whiptail 2, the Noble Don Taylor will drill the Pinktail 1 exploration well, which is located 5 miles southeast of Yellowtail 1, followed by the Tripletail 2 appraisal well located 5 miles south of Tripletail 1. The Noble Tom Madden will spud the exploration well located 4.5 miles southeast of the Turbot 1 discovery in early August. 
Then in the fourth quarter, we will drill our first dedicated test of the deep potential at the located 9 miles northwest of Liza 1. In the third quarter, the Noble Sam Croft will drill the Turbot 2 appraisal well, then transition to development drilling operations for the remainder of the year. The Sterna Carron will conduct a series of appraisal drill stem tests at Uaru-1, then Mako 2 and then Longtail 2. 
In closing, we continue to deliver strong operational performance across our portfolio. Our offshore assets are generating strong free cash flow. The Bakken is on a capital-efficient growth trajectory, and Guyana keeps getting bigger and better, all of which positions us to deliver industry-leading returns, material cash flow generation and significant shareholder value. I will now turn the call over to John Reilly."
249841,1673535248,2352798,"Hess Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2021",2021-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Hess Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the second quarter of 2021 to the first quarter of 2021. Adjusted net income was $74 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to net income of $252 million in the first quarter of 2021.",1337,"Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the second quarter of 2021 to the first quarter of 2021. Adjusted net income was $74 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to net income of $252 million in the first quarter of 2021. Turning to E&P. E&P adjusted net income was $122 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to net income of $308 million in the previous quarter. The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted E&P results between the second quarter and first quarter of 2021 were as follows: Lower sales volumes reduced earnings by $126 million, higher cat costs reduced earnings by $48 million, higher exploration expenses reduced earnings by $10 million, all other items reduced earnings by $2 million for an overall decrease in second quarter earnings of $186 million. 
Second quarter sales volumes were lower, primarily due to Guyana having two 1 million-barrel liftings of oil compared with three 1 million-barrel liftings in the first quarter, and first quarter sales volumes included nonrecurring sales of 2 VLCC cargoes totaling 4.2 million barrels of Bakken crude oil, which contributed approximately $70 million of net income. In the second quarter, our E&P sales volumes were underlifted compared with production by approximately 785,000 barrels, which reduced our after-tax results by approximately $18 million. Cash costs for the second quarter came in at the lower end of guidance and reflect higher planned maintenance and workover activity in the first quarter. In June, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court approved the bankruptcy plan for Fieldwood Energy, which includes transferring abandonment obligations of Fieldwood to predecessors entitled of certain of its assets who are jointly and severally liable for the obligations. As a result of the bankruptcy, Hess is one of the predecessors entitled and 7 shallow water West Delta 786 leases held by Fieldwood is responsible for the abandonment of the facilities on the leases. 
Second quarter E&P results include an after-tax charge of $147 million, representing the estimated gross abandonment obligation for West Delta 7986 without taking into account potential recoveries from other previous owners. Within the next 9 months, we expect to receive an order from the regulator requiring us along with other predecessors entitled to decommission the facilities. The timing of these decommissioning activities will be discussed and agreed upon with the regulator, and we anticipate the cost will be incurred over the next several years. Turning to Midstream. The Midstream segment had net income of $76 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $75 million in the prior quarter. Midstream EBITDA, before noncontrolling interest, amounted to $229 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $225 million in the previous quarter. 
Now turning to our financial position. At quarter end, excluding Midstream, cash and cash equivalents were $2.42 billion, which includes receipt of net proceeds of $297 million from the sale of our Little Knife and Murphy Creek acreage in the Bakken. Total liquidity was $6.1 billion, including available committed credit facilities, while debt and finance lease obligations totaled $6.6 billion. 
Our fully undrawn $3.5 billion revolving credit facility is committed through May 2024, and we have no material near-term debt maturities aside from the $1 billion term loan which matures in March 2023. In July, we repaid $500 million of the term loan. Earlier today, Hess Midstream announced an agreement to repurchase approximately 31 million Class B units of Hess Midstream held by GIP and us for approximately $750 million. We expect to receive net proceeds of approximately $375 million from the sale in the third quarter. In addition, we expect to receive proceeds in the third quarter from the sale of our interest in Denmark for a total consideration of $150 million with an effective date of January 1, 2021. 
In the second quarter of 2021, net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $659 million compared with $815 million in the first quarter, primarily due to lower sales volumes. In the second quarter, net cash provided by operating activities after changes in working capital was $785 million compared with $591 million in the first quarter. Changes in operating assets and liabilities during the second quarter of 2021 increased cash flow from operating activities by $126 million, primarily driven by an increase in payables that we expect to reverse in the third quarter. 
Now turning to guidance. First, for E&P. Our E&P cash costs were $11.63 per barrel of oil equivalent, including Libya, and $12.16 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding Libya, in the second quarter of 2021. We project E&P cash costs, excluding Libya, to be in the range of $13 to $14 per barrel of oil equivalent for the third quarter, which reflects the impact of lower production volumes resulting from the Tioga gas plant turnaround. Full year cash cost guidance of $11 to $12 per barrel of oil equivalent remains unchanged. DD&A expense was $11.55 per barrel of oil equivalent, including Libya, and $12.13 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding Libya, in the second quarter. 
DD&A expense, excluding Libya, is forecast to be in the range of $12 to $13 per barrel of oil equivalent for the third quarter and full year guidance of $12 to $13 per barrel of oil equivalent remains unchanged. This results in projected total E&P unit operating costs, excluding Libya, to be in the range of $25 to $27 per barrel of oil equivalent for the third quarter and $23 to $25 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year of 2021. Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs, are expected to be in the range of $40 million to $45 million in the third quarter and full year guidance is expected to be in the range of $160 million to $170 million, which is down from previous guidance of $170 million to $180 million. 
The Midstream tariff is projected to be in the range of $265 million to $275 million for the third quarter, and full year guidance is projected to be in the range of $1.08 billion to $1.1 billion, which is down from the previous guidance of $1.09 billion to $1.115 billion. E&P income tax expense, excluding Libya, is expected to be in the range of $35 million to $40 million for the third quarter and full year guidance is expected to be in the range of $125 million to $135 million, which is updated from the previous guidance of $105 million to $115 million, reflecting higher commodity prices. We expect noncash option premium amortization will be approximately $65 million for the third quarter and full year guidance of approximately $245 million remains unchanged. 
During the third quarter, we expect to sell three 1 million-barrel cargoes of oil from Guyana. Our E&P capital and exploratory expenditures are expected to be approximately $575 million in the third quarter. Full year guidance, which now includes increasing drilling rigs in Bakken to 3 from 2 in September remains unchanged from prior guidance at approximately $1.9 billion. Turning to Midstream. We anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Midstream segment to be in the range of $50 million to $60 million for the third quarter and full year guidance is projected to be in the range of $275 million to $285 million, which is down from the previous guidance of $280 million to $290 million. Turning to corporate. Corporate expenses are estimated to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million for the third quarter and full year guidance of $130 million to $140 million remains unchanged. 
Interest expense is estimated to be in the range of $95 million to $100 million for the third quarter and approximately $380 million for the full year which is at the lower end of our previous guidance of $380 million to $390 million, reflecting the $500 million reduction in the term loan. This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. 
I will now turn the call over to the operator."

Whiptail adds to our queue of high-value potential oil developments in Guyana. Uaru and Mako, as Greg talked about, have the potential to be our fifth FPSO. Whiptail has the potential to be another oil development. And since evaluations, work is still going underway. It's a little premature to talk about a resource side. But definitely, what we're seeing is a foundation for potentially another oil development with Whiptail. And then to remind everybody, we still have a very active exploration and appraisal program on the Stabroek Block the remainder of this year, which should provide even more definition for future development investment opportunities. So the queue of high-value potential oil development is growing, and we're going to optimize it as we continue to get more data and well results to further get clarity on what the queue will be."

So we do get a pickup on capital there. Same thing for our work in Southeast Asia, is more ramping up. Greg had mentioned the Phase 3 installation that's going on.

So the first thing you do is you get it out there, spin it up, run it at full operating conditions, then and only then after you get that dynamic data can you understand where your potential pinch points or bottlenecks are. And so that's why typically these optimization projects don't come until, I'll say, the first year of operation. But I think 15% to 20% is not atypical. It will vary boat by boat depending on the dynamic conditions, but I would think that you could get some additional upside from Phase I and Phase II and beyond."

So from the Bakken exit rate standpoint, the addition of the third rig when we're starting in September really is not going to add any wells in for production this year. And what we had said in the prior quarter was that we were exiting somewhere at the 170 to 175 type level as we ended the year. Now what we are seeing is higher propane prices than we saw back in April, so which we like, right, what we see from the NGL price is actually to increase our cash flow in the third quarter maybe $35 million to $40 million based on these higher propane prices. But with those higher propane prices, if you remember, that means we get less volumes under our percentage of proceeds contracts or our POP contracts. So right now, based on what we're seeing on the propane prices, I'd say the exit rate overall will be in the 165 to 170 range. I think Greg, I'll hand it over to you for the fourth rig."

So I think just 1 -- couple of more comments on the third rig. So with that third rig, we'll drill 10 more wells. So that's why we increased our drilling well count from 55 to 65.

So that's why we increased our drilling well count from 55 to 65. And then we'll also bring 5 more wells online with that third rig. So that's why we raised the wells online count from 45 to 50. But as John said, those wells come on right at the end of the year. So the impact of that will be seen in 2022's volumes. The fourth rig as we've always talked about, the primary role of the Bakken in our portfolio is to be a cash engine. So that's its #1 role. So any decision to add any rigs in the Bakken is going to be driven by returns and corporate cash flow needs. Now having said that, assuming oil prices stay high into next year, then we'd consider adding a fourth rig at the end of next year. Why is it at the end because you build all your locations in the summertime. And then by doing so, that would allow us to take Bakken production up to around 200,000 barrels a day. And that level really optimize our in-basin infrastructure. But again, that's going to be a function of oil price, a function of corporate cash flow needs, how much cash do we need the Bakken to deliver for the corporation. That's going to be the primary driver of whether or not we have that fourth rig or not. I will say, The fourth rig would be the last rig. So the highest we would go is 4 rigs, and we could maintain that 200,000 barrels a day with 4 rigs for nearly a decade given the extensive inventory of high-return wells that we have."

Yes, as I said in my opening remarks, we are seeing some minor inflation in the Bakken. At the first half of the year, it was all tubulars. However, recall we pre-bought all of our tubulars for the program this year. So we're covered on that. Commodity-based chemicals obviously have gone up. But it really doesn't matter because we're able to cover that through technology and lean manufacturing gains. And that's why we held our well cost forecast for the year, still at 5.8, even though we're feeling some single-digit kind of levels of inflation. Now if I turn to the offshore, yes, industry is seeing cost increases there as well. Day rates on deepwater rigs are up modestly. They're nowhere near what they were in the days of, say, 5 years ago. But remember, almost all of our offshore investment is in Guyana. And we operate under EPC contracts there, so that largely insulates us from cost increases after the contract is signed. And then I've got to say ExxonMobil is doing an extraordinary job of utilizing this Design One Build Many strategy to deliver a large amount of efficiencies from that project. So certainly, now and in the very near term, I wouldn't expect any cost issues there. And of course, because of the PSC, if your costs do creep up, that's all covered under cost recovery."

John Riley, I don't want to press too much on this debt issue, but 2 things has a different number at 50 and 70. So I just wonder if I could ask you what your thinking is on the absolute level of debt that you want to get to because if Guyana is self-funding from next year, which I believe it is to, the potential to generate a ton of free cash flow is obviously there, and I'm giving you unhedged on the upside.

So I'd love your perspective, especially given that you spent a lot of time with market participants there. And then the related question is just on Hess' hedging strategy for 2022.

We think demand is running right now at about 98 million barrels a day. Remember, pre-COVID, globally, it was running 100 million barrels a day. I think demand is well supported with people getting back to work, data in the United States, certainly, jet fuel is almost a pre-COVID levels of demand. Obviously, international travel is still down. Gasoline in the United States, demand as well as gas oil demand is back at pre-COVID levels. So demand is pretty strong. I think the financial stimulus programs of the U.S. government and other governments across the world as well as accommodative monetary policies with the central banks are really turbocharging the consumer, turbocharging the economy and supporting oil demand. So we see demand growth continuing into next year. We think we will get by the end of the year, about 100 million barrels a day of global oil demand. We see that being stronger going into next year. So I think that's a key part that you have to get grounded in to answer your question, what's the demand assumption and where we take the overhead is going to continue to be strong going into next year through the year. Supply, you look at shale. Shale is no longer the swing supplier. It's gone from a business that's focused on production growth to one that's focused on return of capital, financial discipline appropriately so. So if you can grow a little bit, but generally free cash according to the oil environment, that's what the investor discipline wants. That's what the company discipline wants. So we see the rig count, maybe it gets up to 500 in the United States, but shale will not be growing at the level that it was growing at the last 5 years for what it's going to be growing in the next 3 or 4 years. I think U.S. production in the range of crude for, let's say, 11 million barrels a day, it's going to be hard to get into pre-COVID levels of 13 million barrels a day, probably for the next 3 or 4 years. So shale will play a role, but it's going to have a back seat in terms of being the swing supplier. The swing supplier going forward and really the Federal Reserve of oil prices is going to be OPEC led by or OPEC Plus led by Saudi Arabia, Russia and the other members. And I think they've been very disciplined, very wise and being very tempered about bringing their spare capacity back. They just made a, I think, a very historic agreement that says we'll bring on 400,000 barrels a day month by month. We'll look at it if something happens in the variance, something happens with the rain coming on, we may curtail that. But basically, that 5.8 a day of excess capacity will be whittled down 400 a day each month as it goes out. They'll meet every month to check on that. But basically, that will be sort of that cushion that you need to keep supply up with demand. But in that scenario, the market is in deficit. So that should keep prices well supported. And the other key point is I'd say, we're at pre-COVID inventory levels now where the glut of 1.2 billion barrels of oil excess supply a year ago April now has been whittled down to where the market is really back in balance at pre-COVID level. So looking forward, the macro, I think, is very supportive, demand growing faster than supply, inventory of pre-COVID levels and the oil price should be well supported in that environment."

But I was just wondering if we could get a sense for the potential for acceleration on any of the moving parts here. The first would be, would debt pay down potentially be accelerated even faster than what you've talked about the term loan? If not, would we potentially see faster cash return to shareholders, so a quicker decision to raise the dividend? Is that a potential? Or I guess the alternative would be that you just increased cash on the balance sheet? And then operationally, I guess, it's a little bit longer term, but could the pace of Guyana development be accelerated, do you think? Or is it a fairly set and predictable path here? And what I'm really wondering is, as you mentioned, the ExxonMobil buy one -- build one -- design one, build many strategy. I wonder if that has the potential to accelerate if we look forward 2 to 3 to 5 to 7 years. And finally, whether or not you would increase spending in a very strong that you have here, in the Bakken or the deepwater Gulf of Mexico or anywhere else, if that was another potential outlet for the success you're enjoying?"

There are always always potential to accelerate. It's a function of market conditions, obviously. But I think the key thing is we do want to keep a strong cash position as a cushion for downturns in the oil market. It certainly served us well last year, and it's serving us well this year. Obviously, very different markets between last year and this year. And in terms of what our assumptions are going forward, we want to keep that strong cash position. And with current prices where they are, we think it's prudent to go into next year with a strong cash position so we can fund the high-value projects that we have in Guyana, in the Bakken and obviously in our other 2 asset areas. So I think it's good planning assumption to assume that it will be -- given market conditions, we would pay that $500 million off next year. Always have the flexibility to move it forward. But we want to keep the strong cash position, and we just think that's a financial prudent strategy. In terms of Guyana, Exxon is doing, as Greg said, a great job, managing a world-class project, both in terms of cost and in terms of timing. And this idea of design one, build many and pretty much getting in a cadence of one of these major FPSOs being built one a year, one a year, that cadence is probably as aggressive as any ever done in the industry. And ExxonMobil often talks about leakage, leakage meaning capital inefficiency. This pace of bringing on 1 ship a year is probably as accelerated as you want to get, and it's a pretty darn good one."

But the Bakken is becoming a major free cash flow generator on its way, let's say, to 200,000 barrels a day equivalent and plateauing. So there'll be obviously increase with rigs. John talks about it in the range of about $200 million per rig. And then you have the different developments that we have. But we're going to stay very focused on keeping a tight string on our capital investments, so we can grow the free cash flow wedge and really compound that free cash flow wedge over the next 5 to 6 years."

So it's going to have sustained low leverage and ample balance sheet capacity. So they really did this to optimize its capital structure.

And then as I said before, these have the potential to be a very large addition to the recoverable resource base in Guyana. If successful, as I mentioned previously, they could be exploited through a combination of tiebacks to existing hubs and/or stand-alone developments, if they're big enough. So we've had 8 penetrations to date in the deeper plays. And then if you couple that with the success in Suriname, which is we understand the better part over there, again, don't have the data, but this is just what we're hearing from others in the industry, appears to be kind of the lower Campanian in Santonian and interval as well. So there's been a number of penetrations. So that's why we're encouraged. Now we've got a lot more drilling to do to fully understand the potential of this play. So in the second half, we've got several more deep targets that are planned. Three will be what I call deepening. So there'll be deep tails on Campanian targets. Two of which John mentioned in his script, which are Whiptail. So both Whiptail 1 and Whiptail 2 will be deepened down into the Santonian. The next one after that is and then also Pinktail. We'll have a 1 as well. And then as I just discussed with Mr.  there will be a deep stand-alone called So just on the Stabroek Block, by the end of the year, will have 13 total penetrations in the deeper stratigraphy. So we'll begin to now understand better how it's all put together, where we think the hydrocarbons are, et cetera, et cetera.

Today, I will review our continued progress in executing our strategy and our long-standing commitment to sustainability. Greg Hill will then discuss our operations, and John Rielly will cover our financial results.
Our strategy is to grow our resource base, have a low cost of supply and sustain cash flow growth. Executing this strategy has positioned our company to deliver industry-leading cash flow growth over the next decade and has made our portfolio increasingly resilient in a low oil price environment. Our strategy aligns with the world's growing need for affordable, reliable and cleaner energy that is necessary for human prosperity and global economic development. We recognize that climate change is the greatest scientific challenge of the 21st century and support the aim of the Paris Agreement and a global ambition to achieve net 0 emissions by 2050. The world faces a dual challenge of needing 20% more energy by 2040 and reaching net 0 carbon emissions by 2050.
In the International Energy Agency's rigorous sustainable development scenario, which assumes that all pledges of the Paris Agreement are met, oil and gas will be 46% of the energy mix in 2040 compared with approximately 53% today. In the IEA's newest net 0 scenario, oil and gas will still be 29% of the energy mix in 2040. In either scenario, oil and gas will be needed for decades to come and will require significantly more global investment over the next 10 years on an annual basis than the $300 billion spent last year. The key for our company is to have a low cost of supply by investing only in high-return, low-cost opportunities; the best rocks for the best returns.
We have built a differentiated and focused portfolio that is balanced between short-cycle and long-cycle assets. Guyana is our growth engine and the Bakken, Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia are our cash engines. Guyana is positioned to become a significant cash engine in the coming years as multiple phases of low-cost oil developments come online, which we expect will drive our portfolio breakeven Brent oil price below $40 per barrel by the middle of the decade.
Based on the most recent third-party estimates, our cash flow is estimated to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 42% between 2020 and 2023, which is 75% above our peers and puts us in the top 5% of the S&P 500, with a line of sight for up to 10 FPSOs to develop the discovered resources in Guyana. This industry-leading cash flow growth rate is expected to continue through the end of the decade. Investors want durability and growth in cash flow. We have both.
We are pleased to announce today that in July, we paid down $500 million of our $1 billion term loan maturing in March 2023. Depending upon market conditions, we plan to repay the remaining $500 million in 2022. This debt reduction, combined with the start-up of Liza Phase I early next year, is expected to drive our debt-to-EBITDAX ratio under 2 next year. Once this debt is paid off and our portfolio generates increasing free cash flow, we plan to return the majority to our shareholders, first, through dividend increases and then opportunistic share repurchases.
In addition, we announced this morning that Hess Midstream will buy back $750 million of its Class B units from its sponsors, Hess Corporation and Global Infrastructure Partners to be completed in the third quarter. We expect to receive approximately $375 million in proceeds, and our ownership in Hess Midstream on a consolidated basis will be approximately 45% compared with 46% prior to the transaction. On April 30, we completed the sale of our Little Knife and Murphy Creek nonstrategic acreage interest in the Bakken for a total consideration of $312 million, effective March 1, 2021. This acreage, most of which we were not planning to drill before 2026, was located in the southernmost portion of our Bakken position and was not connected as Midstream infrastructure. The Midstream transaction and the sale of the Little Knife and Murphy Creek acreage bring material value forward and further strengthen our cash and liquidity position.
The Bakken remains a core part of our portfolio and our largest operated asset. We have a large inventory of future drilling locations that generate attractive financial returns at $50 per barrel WTI. In February, when WTI oil prices moved above $50 per barrel, we added a second rig. Given the continued strength in oil prices, we are now planning to add a third rig in the Bakken in September, which is expected to strengthen free cash flow generation in the years ahead.
Key to our long-term strategy is Guyana, with its low cost of supply and industry-leading financial returns. We have an active exploration and appraisal program this year on the Stabroek Block, where Hess has a 30% interest and ExxonMobil is the operator. We see the potential for at least 6 FPSOs on the Block by 2027, and up to 10 FPSOs to develop the discovered resources on the Block. And we continue to see multibillion barrels of future exploration potential remaining.
Earlier today, we announced a significant new oil discovery at Whiptail. The Whiptail #1 well encountered 246 feet of net pay. And the Whiptail #2 well, which is located 3 miles northeast of Whiptail-1 encountered 167 feet of net pay in high-quality oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs. Drilling continues at both wells to test deeper targets. The Whiptail discovery could form the basis for our future oil development in the Southeast area of the Stabroek Block and will add to the previous recoverable resource estimate of approximately 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent.
In June, we also announced a discovery at the Longtail-3 well, which encountered approximately 230 feet of net pay, including newly identified high-quality hydrocarbon-bearing reservoirs below the original Longtail-1 discovery intervals. In addition, the successful Mako-2 well, together with the Uaru-2 well, which encountered approximately 120 feet of high-quality oil-bearing sandstone reservoir will potentially underpin a fifth oil development in the area east of the Liza complex.
In terms of Guyana developments, the Liza Unity FPSO with a gross capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day, is expected to sail from Singapore to Guyana in late August, and the Liza-2 development is on track to achieve first oil in early 2022. Our third oil development on the Stabroek Block at the Payara field is expected to achieve first oil in 2024, also with a gross capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day.
Engineering work for our fourth development on the Stabroek Block at Yellowtail is underway with preliminary plans for our gross capacity in the range of 220,000 to 250,000 barrels of oil per day and anticipated start-up in 2025, pending government approvals and project sanctioning. Our 3 sanctioned oil developments have a breakeven Brent oil price of between $25 and $35 per barrel. And according to a recent data from Wood Mackenzie, our Guyana developments are the highest margin, lowest carbon intensity oil and gas assets globally.
Last week, we announced publication of our 24th Annual Sustainability Report, which details our environmental, social and governance, or ESG, strategy and performance. In 2020, we significantly surpassed our 5-year emission reduction targets, reducing Scope 1 and 2 operated greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 46% and flaring intensity by 59% compared to 2014 levels.
Our 5-year operated emission reduction targets for 2025, which are detailed in the sustainability report, exceed the 22% reduction in carbon intensity by 2030 in the International Energy Agency's sustainable development scenario, which is consistent with the Paris Agreement's ambition to hold the rise in global average temperature to well below 2 degrees Centigrade. We are also contributing to groundbreaking research being done by the Salk Institute to develop plants with larger root systems that are capable of absorbing and storing potentially billion of tons of carbon per year from the atmosphere.
We continue to be recognized as an industry leader for the quality of our ESG performance and disclosure. In May, Hess was named to the 100 Best Corporate Citizens list for the 14th consecutive year based upon an independent assessment by ISS-ESG. And we were the only oil and gas company to earn a place on the 2021 list.
In summary, oil and gas are going to be needed for decades to come. By continuing to successfully execute our strategy and achieve strong operational performance, our company is uniquely positioned to deliver industry-leading cash flow growth over the next decade. As our term loan is paid off and our portfolio generates increasing free cash flow, the majority will be returned to our shareholders, first, through dividend and increases and then opportunistic share repurchases.
I will now turn the call over to Greg Hill for an operational update."

In the second quarter, we continued to deliver strong operational performance. Company-wide net production averaged 307,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, above our guidance of 290,000 to 295,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, driven by good performance across the portfolio. In the third quarter, we expect company-wide net production to average approximately 265,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, which reflects the Tioga Gas Plant turnaround in the Bakken and planned maintenance in the Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia. For full year 2021, we now forecast net production to average approximately 295,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, compared to our previous forecast of between 290,000 and 295,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. So we're now forecasting to be at the top of the range.
Turning to the Bakken. Second quarter net production averaged 159,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This was above our guidance of approximately 155,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, primarily reflecting increased gas capture, which has allowed us to drive flaring to under 5%, well below the state's 9% limit. For the third quarter, we expect Bakken net production to average approximately 145,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which reflects the planned 45-day maintenance turnaround and expansion tie-in at the Tioga Gas Plant. For the full year 2021, we maintain our Bakken net production forecast of 155,000 to 160,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
In the second quarter, we drilled 17 wells and brought 9 new wells online. In the third quarter, we expect to drill approximately 15 wells and to bring approximately 20 new wells online. And for the full year 2021, we now expect to drill approximately 65 wells and to bring approximately 50 new wells online. In terms of drilling and completion costs, although we have experienced some cost inflation, we are confident that we can offset the increases through technology and lean manufacturing efficiency gains and are, therefore, maintaining our full year average forecast of $5.8 million per well in 2021. We've been operating 2 rigs since February, but given the improvement in oil prices and our robust inventory of high-return drilling locations, we plan to add a third rig in September. Moving to a 3-rig program will allow us to grow cash flow and production, better optimize our in-basin infrastructure and drive further reductions in our unit cash costs.
Now moving to the offshore. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, second quarter net production averaged 52,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to our guidance of approximately 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the third quarter, we forecast Gulf of Mexico net production to average between 35,000 and 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting planned maintenance downtime as well as some hurricane contingency. For the full year 2021, our forecast for Gulf of Mexico net production remains approximately 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In Southeast Asia, net production in the second quarter was 66,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, above our guidance of approximately 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
Third quarter net production is forecast to average between 50,000 and 55,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting planned maintenance at North Malay Basin and the JDA as well as Phase 3 installation work at North Malay Basin. Full year 2021 net production is forecast to average approximately 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
Now turning to Guyana. In the second quarter, gross production from Liza Phase 1 averaged 101,000 barrels of oil per day or 26,000 barrels of oil per day net to Hess. The repaired flash gas compression system has been installed on the Liza Destiny FPSO and is under test. The operator is evaluating the test data to optimize performance and is safely managing production in the range of 120,000 to 125,000 barrels of oil per day. Replacement of the flash gas compression system with a modified design and production optimization work are planned for the fourth quarter, which will result in higher production capacity and reliability.
Net production from Liza Phase 1 is forecast to average approximately 30,000 barrels of oil per day in the third quarter and for the full year 2021. The Liza Phase 2 development will utilize the 220,000 barrels of oil per day Unity FPSO, which is scheduled to sail away from Singapore at the end of August and first oil remains on track for early 2022.
Turning to our third development, Payara. The Prosperity FPSO hole is complete and will enter the Keppel yard in Singapore following sail away of the Liza Unity. Topsides fabrication has commenced at Dyna-Mac and development drilling began in June. The overall project is approximately 45% completed. The Prosperity will have a gross production capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day and is on track to achieve first oil in 2024.
As for our fourth development at Yellowtail, the joint venture anticipates submitting the plan of development to the government of Guyana in the fourth quarter with first oil targeted for 2025, pending government approvals and project sanctioning. During the second quarter, the Mako-2 appraisal well on the Stabroek Block confirmed the quality, thickness and aerial extent of the reservoir. When integrated with the previously announced discovery at Uaru-2, the data supports a potential fifth development in the area east of the Liza Complex. As John mentioned, this morning, we announced a discovery at Whiptail, located approximately 4 miles southeast of Uaru-1. Drilling continues at both wells to test deeper targets.
In terms of other drilling activity in the second half of 2021, after Whiptail-2, the Noble Don Taylor will drill the Pinktail-1 exploration well, which is located 5 miles southeast of Yellowtail-1, followed by the Tripletail-2 appraisal well located 5 miles south of Tripletail-1. The Noble Tom Madden will spud the Cataback-1 exploration well located 4.5 miles southeast of the Turbot-1 discovery in early August. Then in the fourth quarter, we will drill our first dedicated test of the deep potential at the Fangtooth prospect located 9 miles northwest of Liza-1.
In the third quarter, the Noble Sam Croft will drill the Turbot-2 appraisal well, then transition to development drilling operations for the remainder of the year. The Stena Carron will conduct a series of appraisal drill stem tests at Uaru-1, then Mako-2 and then Longtail-2.
In closing, we continue to deliver strong operational performance across our portfolio. Our offshore assets are generating strong free cash flow, the Bakken is on a capital-efficient growth trajectory, and Guyana keeps getting bigger and better, all of which positions us to deliver industry-leading returns, material cash flow generation and significant shareholder value.
I will now turn the call over to John Rielly."
249841,1673535248,2352996,"Hess Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2021",2021-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Hess Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the second quarter of 2021 to the first quarter of 2021. Adjusted net income was $74 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to net income of $252 million in the first quarter of 2021.",1337,"Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the second quarter of 2021 to the first quarter of 2021. Adjusted net income was $74 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to net income of $252 million in the first quarter of 2021.
Turning to E&P. E&P adjusted net income was $122 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to net income of $308 million in the previous quarter. The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted E&P results between the second quarter and first quarter of 2021 were as follows: Lower sales volumes reduced earnings by $126 million, higher cash costs reduced earnings by $48 million, higher exploration expenses reduced earnings by $10 million, all other items reduced earnings by $2 million for an overall decrease in second quarter earnings of $186 million.
Second quarter sales volumes were lower, primarily due to Guyana having two 1 million-barrel liftings of oil compared with three 1 million-barrel liftings in the first quarter, and first quarter sales volumes included nonrecurring sales of 2 VLCC cargoes totaling 4.2 million barrels of Bakken crude oil, which contributed approximately $70 million of net income. In the second quarter, our E&P sales volumes were underlifted compared with production by approximately 785,000 barrels, which reduced our after-tax results by approximately $18 million.
Cash costs for the second quarter came in at the lower end of guidance and reflect higher planned maintenance and workover activity in the first quarter. In June, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court approved the bankruptcy plan for Fieldwood Energy, which includes transferring abandonment obligations of Fieldwood to predecessors entitled of certain of its assets who are jointly and severally liable for the obligations. As a result of the bankruptcy, Hess as one of the predecessors entitled in 7 shallow-water West Delta 79/86 leases held by Fieldwood is responsible for the abandonment of the facilities on the leases.
Second quarter E&P results include an after-tax charge of $147 million, representing the estimated gross abandonment obligation for West Delta 79/86 without taking into account potential recoveries from other previous owners. Within the next 9 months, we expect to receive an order from the regulator requiring us along with other predecessors entitled to decommission the facilities. The timing of these decommissioning activities will be discussed and agreed upon with the regulator, and we anticipate the cost will be incurred over the next several years.
Turning to Midstream. The Midstream segment had net income of $76 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $75 million in the prior quarter. Midstream EBITDA, before noncontrolling interest, amounted to $229 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $225 million in the previous quarter.
Now turning to our financial position. At quarter end, excluding Midstream, cash and cash equivalents were $2.42 billion, which includes receipt of net proceeds of $297 million from the sale of our Little Knife and Murphy Creek acreage in the Bakken. Total liquidity was $6.1 billion, including available committed credit facilities, while debt and finance lease obligations totaled $6.6 billion.
Our fully undrawn $3.5 billion revolving credit facility is committed through May 2024, and we have no material near-term debt maturities aside from the $1 billion term loan which matures in March 2023. In July, we repaid $500 million of the term loan. Earlier today, Hess Midstream announced an agreement to repurchase approximately 31 million Class B units of Hess Midstream held by GIP and us for approximately $750 million. We expect to receive net proceeds of approximately $375 million from the sale in the third quarter. In addition, we expect to receive proceeds in the third quarter from the sale of our interest in Denmark for a total consideration of $150 million with an effective date of January 1, 2021.
In the second quarter of 2021, net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $659 million compared with $815 million in the first quarter, primarily due to lower sales volumes. In the second quarter, net cash provided by operating activities after changes in working capital was $785 million compared with $591 million in the first quarter. Changes in operating assets and liabilities during the second quarter of 2021 increased cash flow from operating activities by $126 million, primarily driven by an increase in payables that we expect to reverse in the third quarter.
Now turning to guidance. First, for E&P. Our E&P cash costs were $11.63 per barrel of oil equivalent, including Libya, and $12.16 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding Libya, in the second quarter of 2021. We project E&P cash costs, excluding Libya, to be in the range of $13 to $14 per barrel of oil equivalent for the third quarter, which reflects the impact of lower production volumes resulting from the Tioga Gas Plant turnaround. Full year cash cost guidance of $11 to $12 per barrel of oil equivalent remains unchanged.
DD&A expense was $11.55 per barrel of oil equivalent, including Libya, and $12.13 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding Libya, in the second quarter. DD&A expense, excluding Libya, is forecast to be in the range of $12 to $13 per barrel of oil equivalent for the third quarter and full year guidance of $12 to $13 per barrel of oil equivalent remains unchanged. This results in projected total E&P unit operating costs, excluding Libya, to be in the range of $25 to $27 per barrel of oil equivalent for the third quarter and $23 to $25 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year of 2021.
Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs, are expected to be in the range of $40 million to $45 million in the third quarter and full year guidance is expected to be in the range of $160 million to $170 million, which is down from previous guidance of $170 million to $180 million.
The Midstream tariff is projected to be in the range of $265 million to $275 million for the third quarter and full year guidance is projected to be in the range of $1.08 billion to $1.1 billion, which is down from the previous guidance of $1.09 billion to $1.115 billion. E&P income tax expense, excluding Libya, is expected to be in the range of $35 million to $40 million for the third quarter and full year guidance is expected to be in the range of $125 million to $135 million, which is updated from the previous guidance of $105 million to $115 million, reflecting higher commodity prices. We expect noncash option premium amortization will be approximately $65 million for the third quarter and full year guidance of approximately $245 million remains unchanged.
During the third quarter, we expect to sell three 1 million-barrel cargoes of oil from Guyana. Our E&P capital and exploratory expenditures are expected to be approximately $575 million in the third quarter. Full year guidance, which now includes increasing drilling rigs in the Bakken to 3 from 2 in September, remains unchanged from prior guidance at approximately $1.9 billion.
Turning to Midstream. We anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Midstream segment to be in the range of $50 million to $60 million for the third quarter and full year guidance is projected to be in the range of $275 million to $285 million, which is down from the previous guidance of $280 million to $290 million.
Turning to corporate. Corporate expenses are estimated to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million for the third quarter and full year guidance of $130 million to $140 million remains unchanged. Interest expense is estimated to be in the range of $95 million to $100 million for the third quarter and approximately $380 million for the full year which is at the lower end of our previous guidance of $380 million to $390 million, reflecting the $500 million reduction in the term loan.
This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator."

Whiptail adds to our queue of high-value potential oil developments in Guyana, Uaru and Mako, as Greg talked about, have the potential to be our fifth FPSO. Whiptail has the potential to be another oil development. And since evaluations, work is still going underway. It's a little premature to talk about a resource side. But definitely, what we're seeing is a foundation for potentially another oil development with Whiptail.
And then to remind everybody, we still have a very active exploration and appraisal program on the Stabroek Block the remainder of this year, which should provide even more definition for future development investment opportunities. So the queue of high-value potential oil developments is growing, and we're going to optimize it as we continue to get more data and well results to further get clarity on what the queue will be."

As for the $1.9 billion, we do, as you said, expect to ramp up. It's normal for us in the Bakken, when you get into the summer season, building infrastructure pads, things like that. So we do get a pickup on capital there. Same thing for our work in Southeast Asia, is more ramping up. Greg had mentioned the Phase 3 installation that's going on. So I do expect to be spending right around that $1.9 billion, and we'll get that pick up. But again, we have been a little bit lower, and that's why we can add that Bakken rig and stay at $1.9 billion."

Sure, Arun. So we are on track for first oil in early 2022. So no change to that first oil date that we talked about before.
In regards to debottlenecking, look, my experience with these FPSOs is, yes, there will be some additional capacity that can be rung out of the vessel. The sequence is important, though. So the first thing you do is you get it out there, spin it up, run it at full operating conditions, then and only then after you get that dynamic data can you understand where your potential pinch points or bottlenecks are. And so that's why typically these optimization projects don't come until, I'll say, the first year of operation. But I think 15% to 20% is not atypical. It will vary boat by boat depending on the dynamic conditions, but I would think that you could get some additional upside from Phase II and Phase III and beyond."

So from the Bakken exit rate standpoint, the addition of the third rig when we're starting in September really is not going to add any wells in for production this year. And what we had said in the prior quarter was that we were exiting somewhere at the 170,000 to 175,000 type level as we ended the year. Now what we are seeing is higher propane prices than we saw back in April, so -- which we like, right, that the -- what we see from the NGL price is actually to increase our cash flow in the third quarter maybe $35 million to $40 million based on these higher propane prices. But with those higher propane prices, if you remember, that means we get less volumes under our percentage of proceeds contracts or our POP contracts. So right now, based on what we're seeing on the propane prices, I'd say the exit rate overall will be in the 165,000 to 170,000 range. I think, Greg, I'll hand it over to you for the fourth rig."

So that's why we increased our drilling well count from 55 to 65. And then we'll also bring 5 more wells online with that third rig. So that's why we raised the wells online count from 45 to 50. But as John said, those wells come on right at the end of the year. So the impact of that will be seen in 2022's volumes.
The fourth rig, as we've always talked about, the primary role of the Bakken in our portfolio is to be a cash engine. So that's its #1 role. So any decision to add any rigs in the Bakken is going to be driven by returns and corporate cash flow needs. Now having said that, assuming oil prices stay high into next year, then we'd consider adding a fourth rig at the end of next year. Why is it at the end? Because you build all your locations in the summertime. And then by doing so, that would allow us to take Bakken production up to around 200,000 barrels a day. And that level really optimizes our in-basin infrastructure.
But again, that's going to be a function of oil price, a function of corporate cash flow needs, how much cash do we need the Bakken to deliver for the corporation. That's going to be the primary driver of whether or not we add that fourth rig or not. I will say, the fourth rig would be the last rig. So the highest we would go is 4 rigs, and we could maintain that 200,000 barrels a day with 4 rigs for nearly a decade given the extensive inventory of high-return wells that we have."

Yes, as I said in my opening remarks, we are seeing some minor inflation in the Bakken. At the first half of the year, it was all tubulars. However, recall we pre-bought all of our tubulars for the program this year. So we're covered on that. Commodity-based chemicals, obviously, have gone up. But it really doesn't matter because we're able to cover that through technology and lean manufacturing gains. And that's why we held our well cost forecast for the year still at $5.8 million, even though we're feeling some single-digit kind of levels of inflation.
Now if I turn to the offshore, yes, industry is seeing cost increases there as well. Day rates on deepwater rigs are up modestly. They're nowhere near what they were in the halcyon days of, say, 5 years ago. But remember, almost all of our offshore investment is in Guyana. And we operate under EPC contracts there, so that largely insulates us from cost increases after the contract is signed. And then I've got to say ExxonMobil is doing an extraordinary job of utilizing this ""design one, build many"" strategy to deliver a large amount of efficiencies from that project. So certainly, now and in the very near term, I wouldn't expect any cost issues there. And of course, because of PSC, if your costs do creep up, that's all covered under cost recovery."

One of the reasons we drilled the wells concurrently is because we did have good seismic response, as you intimated, on Whiptail. We were well calibrated with that because, of course, it was a sandwich between Yellowtail and Uaru. And so by drilling both of these wells concurrently, obviously, we accelerated the evaluation and appraisal of this highly prospective area. We've got more appraisal work to do and some deepening to do in and around these areas. But we're very pleased with the results, but I think it's just too early to speculate on. Is this big enough stand-alone by itself or what? So just give us some time to evaluate our well results."

We're still drilling, still evaluating the results, but certainly, we're very encouraged that this could underpin on its own future oil development. The foundation is there. More work needs to be done to get that definition, but it certainly has the potential to provide a foundation for future oil development. And you also got to remember on Yellowtail as we got more evaluation work in, that obviously turned out to be a much bigger resource, which is why the ship for Yellowtail is being sized between 220,000 and 250,000 barrels a day, which is bigger than the 2 ships that proceeded at 220,000 barrels a day. So let's get more drilling, let's get more evaluation, but obviously, initial results are very encouraging."

I think these hubs -- all hubs, frankly, will have a long plateau and longer than would be typical in a deepwater environment, and that's simply because of the resource density of how much is in the Guyana Basin in and around these existing hubs. So not only is there additional tieback opportunity in the Campanian, i.e., is Liza class reservoirs, but as we go deeper in the Santonian, let's say that works out as a technical commercial success, then you could see where you could tie back Santonian into some existing Campanian hubs. So if you step back and look at all the prospectivity in the Campanian, all the prospectivity in the Santonian, it's pretty easy to see that these hubs will be full for a long time."

The oil market is definitely rebalancing. It's 3 factors: demand, supply, inventories. We think demand is running right now at about 98 million barrels a day. Remember, pre-COVID, globally, it was running 100 million barrels a da",626,"Thanks for the questions. The oil market is definitely rebalancing. It's 3 factors: demand, supply, inventories. We think demand is running right now at about 98 million barrels a day. Remember, pre-COVID, globally, it was running 100 million barrels a day. I think demand is well supported with people getting back to work, mobility data in the United States. Certainly, jet fuel is almost at pre-COVID levels of demand. Obviously, international travel is still down. Gasoline in the United States demand as well as gas oil demand is back at pre-COVID levels. So demand is pretty strong. I think the financial stimulus programs of the U.S. government and other governments across the world as well as accommodative monetary policies with the central banks are really turbocharging the consumer, turbocharging the economy and supporting oil demand. So we see demand growth continuing into next year. We think we will get by the end of the year, about 100 million barrels a day of global oil demand. We see that being stronger going into next year.
So I think that's a key part that you have to get grounded in to answer your question, what's the demand assumption and where -- we take it over that demand is going to continue to be strong going into next year through the year. Supply, you look at shale. Shale is no longer the swing supplier. It's gone from a business that's focused on production growth to one that's focused on return of capital, financial discipline, appropriately so. So if you can grow a little bit, but generally free cash according to the oil environment, that's what the investor discipline wants. That's what the company discipline wants.
So we see the rig count, maybe it gets up to 500 in the United States, but shale will not be growing at the level that it was growing at the last 5 years for what it's going to be growing in the next 3 or 4 years. I think U.S. production in the range of crude for, let's say, 11 million barrels a day, it's going to be hard to get into pre-COVID levels of 13 million barrels a day, probably for the next 3 or 4 years. So shale will play a role, but it's going to have a back seat in terms of being the swing supplier. The swing supplier going forward and really the Federal Reserve of oil prices is going to be OPEC led by -- or OPEC+ led by Saudi Arabia, Russia and the other members.
And I think they've been very disciplined, very wise and being very tempered about bringing their spare capacity back. They just made, I think, a very historic agreement that says we'll bring on 400,000 barrels a day month by month. We'll look at it if something happens in the variant, something happens with Iran coming on, we may curtail that. But basically, that 5.8 million barrels a day of excess capacity will be whittled down 400,000 a day each month as it goes out. They'll meet every month to check on that. But basically, that will be sort of that cushion that you need to keep supply up with demand. But in that scenario, the market is in deficit. So that should keep prices well supported.
And the other key point is I'd say, we're at pre-COVID inventory levels now where the glut of 1.2 billion barrels of oil excess supply a year ago April now has been whittled down to where the market is really back in balance at pre-COVID level. So looking forward, the macro, I think, is very supportive, demand growing faster than supply, inventory of pre-COVID levels and the oil price should be well supported in that environment."

But I was just wondering if we could get a sense for the potential for acceleration on any of the moving parts here. The first would be, would debt pay down potentially be accelerated even faster than what you've talked about the term loan? If not, would we potentially see faster cash return to shareholders, so a quicker decision to raise the dividend? Is that a potential? Or I guess the alternative would be that you just increase cash on the balance sheet?
And then operationally, I guess, it's a little bit longer term, but could the pace of Guyana development be accelerated, do you think? Or is it a fairly set and predictable path here? And what I'm really wondering is, as you mentioned, the ExxonMobil buy one -- build one -- ""design one, build many"" strategy, I wonder if that has the potential to accelerate if we look forward 2 to 3 to 5 to 7 years. And finally, whether or not you would increase spending in a very strong story that you have here, in the Bakken or the deepwater Gulf of Mexico or anywhere else, if that was another potential outlet for the success you're enjoying?"

There are always, always potential to accelerate. It's a function of market conditions, obviously. But I think the key thing is we do want to keep a strong cash position as a cushion for downturns in the oil market. It certainly served us well last year, and it's serving us well this year. Obviously, very different markets between last year and this year.
And in terms of what our assumptions are going forward, we want to keep that strong cash position. And with current prices where they are, we think it's prudent to go into next year with a strong cash position so we can fund the high-value projects that we have in Guyana, in the Bakken and obviously, in our other 2 asset areas. So I think it's good planning assumption to assume that it will be -- given market conditions, we would pay that $500 million off next year. Always have the flexibility to move it forward. But we want to keep the strong cash position, and we just think that's a financial prudent strategy.
In terms of Guyana, Exxon is doing, as Greg said, a great job, managing a world-class project, both in terms of cost and in terms of timing. And this idea of ""design one, build many"" and pretty much getting in a cadence of one of these major FPSOs being built one a year, come on one a year, that cadence is probably as aggressive as any  ever done in the industry. And ExxonMobil often talks about leakage. Leakage meaning capital inefficiency. This pace of bringing on 1 ship a year is probably as accelerated as you want to get, and it's a pretty darn good one."

But the Bakken is becoming a major free cash flow generator and on its way, let's say, to 200,000 barrels a day equivalent and plateauing. So there'll be, obviously, increase with rigs. John talks about it in the range of about $200 million per rig. And then you have the different developments that we have.

So it's going to have sustained low leverage and ample balance sheet capacity. So they really did this to optimize its capital structure.

So when I talk about deeper plays, I'm really talking about the bottom of the Campanian, the lower Campanian and then down into the Santonian. And as I said before, these have the potential to be a very large addition to the recoverable resource base in Guyana. And if successful, as I mentioned previously, they could be exploited through a combination of tiebacks to existing hubs and/or stand-alone developments, if they're big enough. So we've had 8 penetrations to date in the deeper plays. And then if you couple that with the success in Suriname, which is we understand the better part over there, again, don't have the data, but this is just what we're hearing from others in the industry, appears to be kind of the lower Campanian-Santonian interval as well. So there's been a number of penetrations. So that's why we're encouraged.
Now, we've got a lot more drilling to do to fully understand the potential of this play. So in the second half, we've got several more deep targets that are planned. Three will be what I call deepening. So there'll be deep tails on Campanian targets, two of which John mentioned in his script, which are Whiptail. So both Whiptail-1 and Whiptail-2 will be deepened down into the Santonian. The next one after that is Cataback and then also Pinktail will have a deep tail on it as well. And then as I just discussed with Mr. Brackett, there will be a deep stand-alone called Fangtooth. So just on the Stabroek Block, by the end of the year, we'll have 13 total penetrations in the deeper stratigraphy. So we'll begin to now understand better how it's all put together, where we think the hydrocarbons are, et cetera, et cetera. So keep watching this space, evolving story, but -- very exciting, but again, we need more drilling to figure out where and what we have."

Today, I will review our continued progress in executing our strategy and our long-standing commitment to sustainability. Greg Hill will then discuss our operations, and John Rielly will cover our financial results.
Our strategy is to grow our resource base, have a low cost of supply and sustain cash flow growth. Executing this strategy has positioned our company to deliver industry-leading cash flow growth over the next decade and has made our portfolio increasingly resilient in a low oil price environment. Our strategy aligns with the world's growing need for affordable, reliable and cleaner energy that is necessary for human prosperity and global economic development. We recognize that climate change is the greatest scientific challenge of the 21st century and support the aim of the Paris Agreement and a global ambition to achieve net 0 emissions by 2050. The world faces a dual challenge of needing 20% more energy by 2040 and reaching net 0 carbon emissions by 2050.
In the International Energy Agency's rigorous sustainable development scenario, which assumes that all pledges of the Paris Agreement are met, oil and gas will be 46% of the energy mix in 2040 compared with approximately 53% today. In the IEA's newest net 0 scenario, oil and gas will still be 29% of the energy mix in 2040. In either scenario, oil and gas will be needed for decades to come and will require significantly more global investment over the next 10 years on an annual basis than the $300 billion spent last year. The key for our company is to have a low cost of supply by investing only in high-return, low-cost opportunities; the best rocks for the best returns.
We have built a differentiated and focused portfolio that is balanced between short-cycle and long-cycle assets. Guyana is our growth engine and the Bakken, Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia are our cash engines. Guyana is positioned to become a significant cash engine in the coming years as multiple phases of low-cost oil developments come online, which we expect will drive our portfolio breakeven Brent oil price below $40 per barrel by the middle of the decade.
Based on the most recent third-party estimates, our cash flow is estimated to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 42% between 2020 and 2023, which is 75% above our peers and puts us in the top 5% of the S&P 500, with a line of sight for up to 10 FPSOs to develop the discovered resources in Guyana. This industry-leading cash flow growth rate is expected to continue through the end of the decade. Investors want durability and growth in cash flow. We have both.
We are pleased to announce today that in July, we paid down $500 million of our $1 billion term loan maturing in March 2023. Depending upon market conditions, we plan to repay the remaining $500 million in 2022. This debt reduction, combined with the start-up of Liza Phase 2 early next year, is expected to drive our debt to EBITDAX ratio under 2 next year. Once this debt is paid off and our portfolio generates increasing free cash flow, we plan to return the majority to our shareholders, first, through dividend increases and then opportunistic share repurchases.
In addition, we announced this morning that Hess Midstream will buy back $750 million of its Class B units from its sponsors, Hess Corporation and Global Infrastructure Partners to be completed in the third quarter. We expect to receive approximately $375 million in proceeds, and our ownership in Hess Midstream on a consolidated basis will be approximately 45% compared with 46% prior to the transaction. 
On April 30, we completed the sale of our Little Knife and Murphy Creek nonstrategic acreage interest in the Bakken for a total consideration of $312 million, effective March 1, 2021. This acreage, most of which we were not planning to drill before 2026, was located in the southernmost portion of our Bakken position and was not connected to Hess Midstream infrastructure. The midstream transaction and the sale of the Little Knife and Murphy Creek acreage bring material value forward and further strengthen our cash and liquidity position.
The Bakken remains a core part of our portfolio and our largest operated asset. We have a large inventory of future drilling locations that generate attractive financial returns at $50 per barrel WTI. In February, when WTI oil prices moved above $50 per barrel, we added a second rig. Given the continued strength in oil prices, we are now planning to add a third rig in the Bakken in September, which is expected to strengthen free cash flow generation in the years ahead.
Key to our long-term strategy is Guyana, with its low cost of supply and industry-leading financial returns. We have an active exploration and appraisal program this year on the Stabroek Block, where Hess has a 30% interest and ExxonMobil is the operator. We see the potential for at least 6 FPSOs on the block by 2027, and up to 10 FPSOs to develop the discovered resources on the block. And we continue to see multibillion barrels of future exploration potential remaining.
Earlier today, we announced a significant new oil discovery at Whiptail. The Whiptail #1 well encountered 246 feet of net pay. And the Whiptail #2 well, which is located 3 miles northeast of Whiptail-1 encountered 167 feet of net pay in high-quality oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs. Drilling continues at both wells to test deeper targets. The Whiptail discovery could form the basis for our future oil development in the southeast area of the Stabroek Block and will add to the previous recoverable resource estimate of approximately 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent.
In June, we also announced a discovery at the Longtail-3 well, which encountered approximately 230 feet of net pay, including newly identified high-quality hydrocarbon-bearing reservoirs below the original Longtail-1 discovery intervals. In addition, the successful Mako-2 well, together with the Uaru-2 well, which encountered approximately 120 feet of high-quality oil-bearing sandstone reservoir will potentially underpin a fifth oil development in the area east of the Liza complex.
In terms of Guyana developments, the Liza Unity FPSO with a gross capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day, is expected to sail from Singapore to Guyana in late August, and the Liza-2 development is on track to achieve first oil in early 2022. Our third oil development on the Stabroek Block at the Payara Field is expected to achieve first oil in 2024, also with a gross capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day.
Engineering work for our fourth development on the Stabroek Block at Yellowtail is underway with preliminary plans for our gross capacity in the range of 220,000 to 250,000 barrels of oil per day and anticipated start-up in 2025, pending government approvals and project sanctioning. Our 3 sanctioned oil developments have a breakeven Brent oil price of between $25 and $35 per barrel. And according to a recent data from Wood Mackenzie, our Guyana developments are the highest margin, lowest carbon intensity oil and gas assets globally.
Last week, we announced publication of our 24th Annual Sustainability Report, which details our environmental, social and governance, or ESG strategy and performance. In 2020, we significantly surpassed our 5-year emission reduction targets, reducing Scope 1 and 2 operated greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 46% and flaring intensity by 59% compared to 2014 levels.
Our 5-year operated emission reduction targets for 2025, which are detailed in the sustainability report, exceed the 22% reduction in carbon intensity by 2030 in the International Energy Agency's sustainable development scenario, which is consistent with the Paris Agreement's ambition to hold the rise in global average temperature to well below 2 degrees centigrade. We are also contributing to groundbreaking research being done by the Salk Institute to develop plants with larger root systems that are capable of absorbing and storing potentially billions of tons of carbon per year from the atmosphere.
We continue to be recognized as an industry leader for the quality of our ESG performance and disclosure. In May, Hess was named to the 100 Best Corporate Citizens list for the 14th consecutive year based upon an independent assessment by ISS-ESG. And we were the only oil and gas company to earn a place on the 2021 list.
In summary, oil and gas are going to be needed for decades to come. By continuing to successfully execute our strategy and achieve strong operational performance, our company is uniquely positioned to deliver industry-leading cash flow growth over the next decade. As our term loan is paid off and our portfolio generates increasing free cash flow, the majority will be returned to our shareholders, first, through dividend and increases and then opportunistic share repurchases.
I will now turn the call over to Greg Hill for an operational update."

Companywide net production averaged 307,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, above our guidance of 290,000 to 295,000 barrels of oil equivalent",1131,"Thanks, John. In the second quarter, we continued to deliver strong operational performance. Companywide net production averaged 307,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, above our guidance of 290,000 to 295,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, driven by good performance across the portfolio. 
In the third quarter, we expect companywide net production to average approximately 265,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, which reflects the Tioga gas plant turnaround in the Bakken and planned maintenance in the Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia. For full year 2021, we now forecast net production to average approximately 295,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, compared to our previous forecast of between 290,000 and 295,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. So we're now forecasting to be at the top of the range.
Turning to the Bakken. Second quarter net production averaged 159,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This was above our guidance of approximately 155,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, primarily reflecting increased gas capture, which has allowed us to drive flaring to under 5%, well below the state's 9% limit. 
For the third quarter, we expect Bakken net production to average approximately 145,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which reflects the planned 45-day maintenance turnaround and expansion tie-in at the Tioga gas plant. For the full year 2021, we maintain our Bakken net production forecast of 155,000 to 160,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
In the second quarter, we drilled 17 wells and brought 9 new wells online. In the third quarter, we expect to drill approximately 15 wells and to bring approximately 20 new wells online. And for the full year 2021, we now expect to drill approximately 65 wells and to bring approximately 50 new wells online. 
In terms of drilling and completion costs, although we have experienced some cost inflation, we are confident that we can offset the increases through technology and lean manufacturing efficiency gains and are therefore maintaining our full year average forecast of $5.8 million per well in 2021. 
We've been operating 2 rigs since February, but given the improvement in oil prices and our robust inventory of high-return drilling locations, we plan to add a third rig in September. Moving to a 3-rig program will allow us to grow cash flow and production, better optimize our in-basin infrastructure and drive further reductions in our unit cash costs.
Now moving to the offshore. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, second quarter net production averaged 52,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to our guidance of approximately 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the third quarter, we forecast Gulf of Mexico net production to average between 35,000 and 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting planned maintenance downtime as well as some hurricane contingency. For the full year 2021, our forecast for Gulf of Mexico net production remains approximately 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
In Southeast Asia, net production in the second quarter was 66,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, above our guidance of approximately 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Third quarter net production is forecast to average between 50,000 and 55,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting planned maintenance at North Malay Basin and the JDA as well as Phase 3 installation work at North Malay Basin. Full year 2021 net production is forecast to average approximately 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
Now turning to Guyana. In the second quarter, gross production from Liza Phase 1 averaged 101,000 barrels of oil per day or 26,000 barrels of oil per day net to Hess. The repaired flash gas compression system has been installed on the Liza Destiny FPSO and is under test. The operator is evaluating the test data to optimize performance and is safely managing production in the range of 120,000 to 125,000 barrels of oil per day. Replacement of the flash gas compression system with a modified design and production optimization work are planned for the fourth quarter, which will result in higher production capacity and reliability.
Net production from Liza Phase 1 is forecast to average approximately 30,000 barrels of oil per day in the third quarter and for the full year 2021. The Liza Phase 2 development will utilize the 220,000 barrels of oil per day Unity FPSO, which is scheduled to sail away from Singapore at the end of August and first oil remains on track for early 2022.
Turning to our third development, Payara. The Prosperity FPSO hull is complete and will enter the Keppel yard in Singapore following sail away of the Liza Unity. Topsides fabrication has commenced at Dyna-Mac and development drilling began in June. The overall project is approximately 45% completed. The Prosperity will have a gross production capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day and is on track to achieve first oil in 2024.
As for our fourth development at Yellowtail, the joint venture anticipates submitting the plan of development to the government of Guyana in the fourth quarter with first oil targeted for 2025, pending government approvals and project sanctioning. 
During the second quarter, the Mako-2 appraisal well on the Stabroek Block confirmed the quality, thickness and aerial extent of the reservoir. When integrated with the previously announced discovery at Uaru-2, the data supports a potential fifth development in the area east of the Liza Complex. As John mentioned, this morning, we announced a discovery at Whiptail, located approximately 4 miles southeast of Uaru-1. Drilling continues at both wells to test deeper targets.
In terms of other drilling activity in the second half of 2021, after Whiptail-2, the Noble Don Taylor will drill the Pinktail-1 exploration well, which is located 5 miles southeast of Yellowtail-1, followed by the Tripletail-2 appraisal well located 5 miles south of Tripletail-1. The Noble Tom Madden will spud the Cataback-1 exploration well located 4.5 miles southeast of the Turbot-1 discovery in early August. Then in the fourth quarter, we will drill our first dedicated test of the deep potential at the Fangtooth prospect located 9 miles northwest of Liza-1.
In the third quarter, the Noble Sam Croft will drill the Turbot-2 appraisal well, then transition to development drilling operations for the remainder of the year. The Stena Carron will conduct a series of appraisal drill stem tests at Uaru-1, then Mako-2 and then Longtail-2.
In closing, we continue to deliver strong operational performance across our portfolio. Our offshore assets are generating strong free cash flow, the Bakken is on a capital-efficient growth trajectory, and Guyana keeps getting bigger and better, all of which positions us to deliver industry-leading returns, material cash flow generation and significant shareholder value.
I will now turn the call over to John Rielly."
249841,1673535248,2383847,"Hess Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2021",2021-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Hess Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the second quarter of 2021 to the first quarter of 2021. Adjusted net income was $74 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to net income of $252 million in the first quarter of 2021.",1337,"Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the second quarter of 2021 to the first quarter of 2021. Adjusted net income was $74 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to net income of $252 million in the first quarter of 2021.
Turning to E&P. E&P adjusted net income was $122 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to net income of $308 million in the previous quarter. The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted E&P results between the second quarter and first quarter of 2021 were as follows: Lower sales volumes reduced earnings by $126 million, higher cash costs reduced earnings by $48 million, higher exploration expenses reduced earnings by $10 million, all other items reduced earnings by $2 million for an overall decrease in second quarter earnings of $186 million.
Second quarter sales volumes were lower, primarily due to Guyana having two 1 million-barrel liftings of oil compared with three 1 million-barrel liftings in the first quarter, and first quarter sales volumes included nonrecurring sales of 2 VLCC cargos totaling 4.2 million barrels of Bakken crude oil, which contributed approximately $70 million of net income. In the second quarter, our E&P sales volumes were underlifted compared with production by approximately 785,000 barrels, which reduced our after-tax results by approximately $18 million.
Cash costs for the second quarter came in at the lower end of guidance and reflect higher planned maintenance and workover activity in the first quarter. In June, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court approved the bankruptcy plan for Fieldwood Energy, which includes transferring abandonment obligations of Fieldwood to predecessors entitled of certain of its assets who are jointly and severally liable for the obligations. As a result of the bankruptcy, Hess as one of the predecessors entitled in 7 shallow-water West Delta 79/86 leases held by Fieldwood is responsible for the abandonment of the facilities on the leases.
Second quarter E&P results include an after-tax charge of $147 million, representing the estimated gross abandonment obligation for West Delta 79/86 without taking into account potential recoveries from other previous owners. Within the next 9 months, we expect to receive an order from the regulator requiring us along with other predecessors entitled to decommission the facilities. The timing of these decommissioning activities will be discussed and agreed upon with the regulator, and we anticipate the cost will be incurred over the next several years.
Turning to Midstream. The Midstream segment had net income of $76 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $75 million in the prior quarter. Midstream EBITDA, before noncontrolling interest, amounted to $229 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $225 million in the previous quarter.
Now turning to our financial position. At quarter end, excluding Midstream, cash and cash equivalents were $2.42 billion, which includes receipt of net proceeds of $297 million from the sale of our Little Knife and Murphy Creek acreage in the Bakken. Total liquidity was $6.1 billion, including available committed credit facilities, while debt and finance lease obligations totaled $6.6 billion.
Our fully undrawn $3.5 billion revolving credit facility is committed through May 2024, and we have no material near-term debt maturities aside from the $1 billion term loan which matures in March 2023. In July, we repaid $500 million of the term loan. Earlier today, Hess Midstream announced an agreement to repurchase approximately 31 million Class B units of Hess Midstream held by GIP and us for approximately $750 million. We expect to receive net proceeds of approximately $375 million from the sale in the third quarter. In addition, we expect to receive proceeds in the third quarter from the sale of our interest in Denmark for a total consideration of $150 million with an effective date of January 1, 2021.
In the second quarter of 2021, net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $659 million compared with $815 million in the first quarter, primarily due to lower sales volumes. In the second quarter, net cash provided by operating activities after changes in working capital was $785 million compared with $591 million in the first quarter. Changes in operating assets and liabilities during the second quarter of 2021 increased cash flow from operating activities by $126 million, primarily driven by an increase in payables that we expect to reverse in the third quarter.
Now turning to guidance. First, for E&P. Our E&P cash costs were $11.63 per barrel of oil equivalent, including Libya, and $12.16 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding Libya, in the second quarter of 2021. We project E&P cash costs, excluding Libya, to be in the range of $13 to $14 per barrel of oil equivalent for the third quarter, which reflects the impact of lower production volumes resulting from the Tioga gas plant turnaround. Full year cash cost guidance of $11 to $12 per barrel of oil equivalent remains unchanged.
DD&A expense was $11.55 per barrel of oil equivalent, including Libya, and $12.13 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding Libya, in the second quarter. DD&A expense, excluding Libya, is forecast to be in the range of $12 to $13 per barrel of oil equivalent for the third quarter and full year guidance of $12 to $13 per barrel of oil equivalent remains unchanged. This results in projected total E&P unit operating costs, excluding Libya, to be in the range of $25 to $27 per barrel of oil equivalent for the third quarter and $23 to $25 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year of 2021.
Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs, are expected to be in the range of $40 million to $45 million in the third quarter and full year guidance is expected to be in the range of $160 million to $170 million, which is down from previous guidance of $170 million to $180 million.
The midstream tariff is projected to be in the range of $265 million to $275 million for the third quarter and full year guidance is projected to be in the range of $1.080 billion to $1.100 billion, which is down from the previous guidance of $1.090 billion to $1.115 billion. E&P income tax expense, excluding Libya, is expected to be in the range of $35 million to $40 million for the third quarter and full year guidance is expected to be in the range of $125 million to $135 million, which is updated from the previous guidance of $105 million to $115 million, reflecting higher commodity prices. We expect noncash option premium amortization will be approximately $65 million for the third quarter and full year guidance of approximately $245 million remains unchanged.
During the third quarter, we expect to sell three 1 million-barrel cargoes of oil from Guyana. Our E&P capital and exploratory expenditures are expected to be approximately $575 million in the third quarter. Full year guidance, which now includes increasing drilling rigs in the Bakken to 3 from 2 in September, remains unchanged from prior guidance at approximately $1.9 billion.
Turning to Midstream. We anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Midstream segment to be in the range of $50 million to $60 million for the third quarter and full year guidance is projected to be in the range of $275 million to $285 million, which is down from the previous guidance of $280 million to $290 million.
Turning to corporate. Corporate expenses are estimated to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million for the third quarter and full year guidance of $130 million to $140 million remains unchanged. Interest expense is estimated to be in the range of $95 million to $100 million for the third quarter and approximately $380 million for the full year which is at the lower end of our previous guidance of $380 million to $390 million, reflecting the $500 million reduction in the term loan.
This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator."

Whiptail adds to our queue of high-value potential oil developments in Guyana, Uaru and Mako, as Greg talked about, have the potential to be our fifth FPSO. Whiptail has the potential to be another oil development. And since evaluations work is still going underway, it's a little premature to talk about resource size. But definitely, what we're seeing is a foundation for potentially another oil development with Whiptail.
And then to remind everybody, we still have a very active exploration and appraisal program on the Stabroek Block the remainder of this year, which should provide even more definition for future development investment opportunities. So the queue of high-value potential oil developments is growing, and we're going to optimize it as we continue to get more data and well results to further get clarity on what the queue will be."

As for the $1.9 billion, we do, as you said, expect to ramp up. It's normal for us in the Bakken, when you get into the summer season, building infrastructure pads, things like that. So we do get a pickup on capital there. Same thing for our work in Southeast Asia, is more ramping up. Greg had mentioned the Phase 3 installation that's going on. So I do expect to be spending right around that $1.9 billion, and we'll get that pick up. But again, we have been a little bit lower, and that's why we can add that Bakken rig and stay at $1.9 billion."

And what we had said in the prior quarter was that we were exiting somewhere at the 170,000 to 175,000 type level as we ended the year. Now what we are seeing is higher propane prices than we saw back in April, so -- which we like, right, that the -- what we see from the NGL price is actually to increase our cash flow in the third quarter maybe $35 million to $40 million based on these higher propane prices. But with those higher propane prices, if you remember, that means we get less volumes under our percentage of proceeds contracts or our POP contracts. So right now, based on what we're seeing on the propane prices, I'd say the exit rate overall will be in the 165,000 to 170,000 range. I think, Greg, I'll hand it over to you for the fourth rig."

So I think just 1 -- couple of more comments on the third rig. So with that third rig, we'll drill 10 more wells. So that's why we increased our drilling well count from 55 to 65.

So that's why we increased our drilling well count from 55 to 65. And then we'll also bring 5 more wells online with that third rig. So that's why we raised the wells online count from 45 to 50. But as John said, those wells come on right at the end of the year. So the impact of that will be seen in 2022's volumes.
The fourth rig, as we've always talked about, the primary role of the Bakken in our portfolio is to be a cash engine. So that's its #1 role. So any decision to add any rigs in the Bakken is going to be driven by returns and corporate cash flow needs. Now having said that, assuming oil prices stay high into next year, then we'd consider adding a fourth rig at the end of next year. Why is it at the end? Because you build all your locations in the summertime. And then by doing so, that would allow us to take Bakken production up to around 200,000 barrels a day. And that level really optimizes our in-basin infrastructure.
But again, that's going to be a function of oil price, a function of corporate cash flow needs, how much cash do we need the Bakken to deliver for the corporation. That's going to be the primary driver of whether or not we add that fourth rig or not. I will say, the fourth rig would be the last rig. So the highest we would go is 4 rigs, and we could maintain that 200,000 barrels a day with 4 rigs for nearly a decade given the extensive inventory of high-return wells that we have."

Yes, as I said in my opening remarks, we are seeing some minor inflation in the Bakken. At the first half of the year, it was all tubulars. However, recall we prebought all of our tubulars for the program this year. So we're covered on that. Commodity-based chemicals, obviously, have gone up. But it really doesn't matter because we're able to cover that through technology and lean manufacturing gains. And that's why we held our well cost forecast for the year still at $5.8 million, even though we're feeling some single-digit kind of levels of inflation.
Now if I turn to the offshore, yes, industry is seeing cost increases there as well. Day rates on deepwater rigs are up modestly. They're nowhere near what they were in the halcyon days of, say, 5 years ago. But remember, almost all of our offshore investment is in Guyana. And we operate under EPC contracts there, so that largely insulates us from cost increases after the contract is signed. And then I've got to say ExxonMobil is doing an extraordinary job of utilizing this ""design one, build many"" strategy to deliver a large amount of efficiencies from that project. So certainly, now and in the very near term, I wouldn't expect any cost issues there. And of course, because of PSC, if your costs do creep up, that's all covered under cost recovery."

And we're going to be in a position, again, as I mentioned with these FPSOs coming on that we can set that, have a better yield and withstand lower commodity prices. So we'll test it at lower commodity prices. But again, due to the uniqueness of the Guyana cash flows that will be coming in, we can do that. So that's the initial guidance I would look at is that we're going to have our yield better than that S&P 500."

The oil market is definitely rebalancing. It's 3 factors: demand, supply, inventories. We think demand is running right now at about 98 million barrels a day.

We think demand is running right now at about 98 million barrels a day. Remember, pre-COVID, globally, it was running 100 million barrels a day. I think demand is well supported with people getting back to work, mobility data in the United States. Certainly, jet fuel is almost at pre-COVID levels of demand. Obviously, international travel is still down. Gasoline in the United States demand as well as gas oil demand is back at pre-COVID levels. So demand is pretty strong. I think the financial stimulus programs of the U.S. government and other governments across the world as well as accommodative monetary policies with the central banks are really turbocharging the consumer, turbocharging the economy and supporting oil demand. So we see demand growth continuing into next year. We think we will get by the end of the year, about 100 million barrels a day of global oil demand. We see that being stronger going into next year.
So I think that's a key part that you have to get grounded in to answer your question, what's the demand assumption and where -- we take it over that demand is going to continue to be strong going into next year through the year. Supply, you look at shale. Shale is no longer the swing supplier. It's gone from a business that's focused on production growth to one that's focused on return of capital, financial discipline, appropriately so. So if you can grow a little bit, but generally free cash according to the oil environment, that's what the investor discipline wants. That's what the company discipline wants.
So we see the rig count, maybe it gets up to 500 in the United States, but shale will not be growing at the level that it was growing at the last 5 years for what it's going to be growing in the next 3 or 4 years. I think U.S. production in the range of crude for, let's say, 11 million barrels a day, it's going to be hard to get into pre-COVID levels of 13 million barrels a day, probably for the next 3 or 4 years. So shale will play a role, but it's going to have a back seat in terms of being the swing supplier. The swing supplier going forward and really the Federal Reserve of oil prices is going to be OPEC led by -- or OPEC+ led by Saudi Arabia, Russia and the other members.
And I think they've been very disciplined, very wise and being very tempered about bringing their spare capacity back. They just made, I think, a very historic agreement that says we'll bring on 400,000 barrels a day month by month. We'll look at it if something happens in the variant, something happens with Iran coming on, we may curtail that. But basically, that 5.8 million barrels a day of excess capacity will be whittled down 400,000 a day each month as it goes out. They'll meet every month to check on that. But basically, that will be sort of that cushion that you need to keep supply up with demand. But in that scenario, the market is in deficit. So that should keep prices well supported.
And the other key point is I'd say, we're at pre-COVID inventory levels now where the glut of 1.2 billion barrels of oil excess supply a year ago April now has been whittled down to where the market is really back in balance at pre-COVID level. So looking forward, the macro, I think, is very supportive, demand growing faster than supply, inventory of pre-COVID levels and the oil price should be well supported in that environment."

If not, would we potentially see faster cash return to shareholders, so a quicker decision to raise the dividend? Is that a potential? Or I guess the alternative would be that you just increase cash on the balance sheet?
And then operationally, I guess, it's a little bit longer term, but could the pace of Guyana development be accelerated, do you think? Or is it a fairly set and predictable path here? And what I'm really wondering is, as you mentioned, the ExxonMobil buy one -- build one -- ""design one, build many"" strategy, I wonder if that has the potential to accelerate if we look forward 2 to 3 to 5 to 7 years.

But I think the key thing is we do want to keep a strong cash position as a cushion for downturns in the oil market. It certainly served us well last year, and it's serving us well this year. Obviously, very different markets between last year and this year.
And in terms of what our assumptions are going forward, we want to keep that strong cash position. And with current prices where they are, we think it's prudent to go into next year with a strong cash position so we can fund the high-value projects that we have in Guyana, in the Bakken and obviously, in our other 2 asset areas. So I think it's good planning assumption to assume that it will be -- given market conditions, we would pay that $500 million off next year. Always have the flexibility to move it forward. But we want to keep the strong cash position, and we just think that's a financial prudent strategy.
In terms of Guyana, Exxon is doing, as Greg said, a great job, managing a world-class project, both in terms of cost and in terms of timing. And this idea of ""design one, build many"" and pretty much getting in a cadence of one of these major FPSOs being built one a year, come on one a year, that cadence is probably as aggressive as any ever done in the industry. And ExxonMobil often talks about leakage. Leakage meaning capital inefficiency. This pace of bringing on 1 ship a year is probably as accelerated as you want to get, and it's a pretty darn good one."

But the Bakken is becoming a major free cash flow generator and on its way, let's say, to 200,000 barrels a day equivalent and plateauing. So there'll be, obviously, increase with rigs. John talks about it in the range of about $200 million per rig. And then you have the different developments that we have.

So when I talk about deeper plays, I'm really talking about the bottom of the Campanian, the lower Campanian and then down into the Santonian. And as I said before, these have the potential to be a very large addition to the recoverable resource base in Guyana. And if successful, as I mentioned previously, they could be exploited through a combination of tiebacks to existing hubs and/or stand-alone developments, if they're big enough. So we've had 8 penetrations to date in the deeper plays. And then if you couple that with the success in Suriname, which is we understand the better part over there, again, don't have the data, but this is just what we're hearing from others in the industry, appears to be kind of the lower Campanian-Santonian interval as well. So there's been a number of penetrations. So that's why we're encouraged.
Now we've got a lot more drilling to do to fully understand the potential of this play. So in the second half, we've got several more deep targets that are planned. Three will be what I call deepening. So there'll be deep tails on Campanian targets, 2 of which John mentioned in his script, which are Whiptail. So both Whiptail-1 and Whiptail-2 will be deepened down into the Santonian. The next one after that is Cataback and then also Pinktail will have a deep tail on it as well. And then as I just discussed with Mr. Brackett, there will be a deep stand-alone called Fangtooth. So just on the Stabroek Block, by the end of the year, we'll have 13 total penetrations in the deeper stratigraphy. So we'll begin to now understand better how it's all put together, where we think the hydrocarbons are, et cetera, et cetera. So keep watching this space, evolving story, but -- very exciting, but again, we need more drilling to figure out where and what we have."

Today, I will review our continued progress in executing our strategy and our long-standing commitment to sustainability. Greg Hill will then discuss our operations, and John Rielly will cover our financial results.
Our strategy is to grow our resource base, have a low cost of supply and sustain cash flow growth. Executing this strategy has positioned our company to deliver industry-leading cash flow growth over the next decade and has made our portfolio increasingly resilient in a low oil price environment. Our strategy aligns with the world's growing need for affordable, reliable and cleaner energy that is necessary for human prosperity and global economic development. We recognize that climate change is the greatest scientific challenge of the 21st century and support the aim of the Paris Agreement and a global ambition to achieve net 0 emissions by 2050. The world faces a dual challenge of needing 20% more energy by 2040 and reaching net 0 carbon emissions by 2050.
In the International Energy Agency's rigorous sustainable development scenario, which assumes that all pledges of the Paris Agreement are met, oil and gas will be 46% of the energy mix in 2040 compared with approximately 53% today. In the IEA's newest net 0 scenario, oil and gas will still be 29% of the energy mix in 2040. In either scenario, oil and gas will be needed for decades to come and will require significantly more global investment over the next 10 years on an annual basis than the $300 billion spent last year. The key for our company is to have a low cost of supply by investing only in high-return, low-cost opportunities; the best rocks for the best returns.
We have built a differentiated and focused portfolio that is balanced between short-cycle and long-cycle assets. Guyana is our growth engine and the Bakken, Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia are our cash engines. Guyana is positioned to become a significant cash engine in the coming years as multiple phases of low-cost oil developments come online, which we expect will drive our portfolio breakeven Brent oil price below $40 per barrel by the middle of the decade.
Based on the most recent third-party estimates, our cash flow is estimated to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 42% between 2020 and 2023, which is 75% above our peers and puts us in the top 5% of the S&P 500, with a line of sight for up to 10 FPSOs to develop the discovered resources in Guyana. This industry-leading cash flow growth rate is expected to continue through the end of the decade. Investors want durability and growth in cash flow. We have both.
We are pleased to announce today that in July, we paid down $500 million of our $1 billion term loan maturing in March 2023. Depending upon market conditions, we plan to repay the remaining $500 million in 2022. This debt reduction, combined with the start-up of Liza Phase 2 early next year, is expected to drive our debt to EBITDAX ratio under 2 next year. Once this debt is paid off and our portfolio generates increasing free cash flow, we plan to return the majority to our shareholders, first, through dividend increases and then opportunistic share repurchases.
In addition, we announced this morning that Hess Midstream will buy back $750 million of its Class B units from its sponsors, Hess Corporation and Global Infrastructure Partners to be completed in the third quarter. We expect to receive approximately $375 million in proceeds, and our ownership in Hess Midstream on a consolidated basis will be approximately 45% compared with 46% prior to the transaction. 
On April 30, we completed the sale of our Little Knife and Murphy Creek nonstrategic acreage interest in the Bakken for a total consideration of $312 million, effective March 1, 2021. This acreage, most of which we were not planning to drill before 2026, was located in the southernmost portion of our Bakken position and was not connected to Hess Midstream infrastructure. The midstream transaction and the sale of the Little Knife and Murphy Creek acreage bring material value forward and further strengthen our cash and liquidity position.
The Bakken remains a core part of our portfolio and our largest operated asset. We have a large inventory of future drilling locations that generate attractive financial returns at $50 per barrel WTI. In February, when WTI oil prices moved above $50 per barrel, we added a second rig. Given the continued strength in oil prices, we are now planning to add a third rig in the Bakken in September, which is expected to strengthen free cash flow generation in the years ahead.
Key to our long-term strategy is Guyana, with its low cost of supply and industry-leading financial returns. We have an active exploration and appraisal program this year on the Stabroek Block, where Hess has a 30% interest and ExxonMobil is the operator. We see the potential for at least 6 FPSOs on the block by 2027, and up to 10 FPSOs to develop the discovered resources on the block. And we continue to see multibillion barrels of future exploration potential remaining.
Earlier today, we announced a significant new oil discovery at Whiptail. The Whiptail #1 well encountered 246 feet of net pay. And the Whiptail #2 well, which is located 3 miles northeast of Whiptail-1 encountered 167 feet of net pay in high-quality oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs. Drilling continues at both wells to test deeper targets. The Whiptail discovery could form the basis for our future oil development in the southeast area of the Stabroek Block and will add to the previous recoverable resource estimate of approximately 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent.
In June, we also announced a discovery at the Longtail-3 well, which encountered approximately 230 feet of net pay, including newly identified high-quality hydrocarbon-bearing reservoirs below the original Longtail-1 discovery intervals. In addition, the successful Mako-2 well, together with the Uaru-2 well, which encountered approximately 120 feet of high-quality oil-bearing sandstone reservoir will potentially underpin a fifth oil development in the area east of the Liza complex.
In terms of Guyana developments, the Liza Unity FPSO with a gross capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day, is expected to sail from Singapore to Guyana in late August, and the Liza-2 development is on track to achieve first oil in early 2022. Our third oil development on the Stabroek Block at the Payara Field is expected to achieve first oil in 2024, also with a gross capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day.
Engineering work for our fourth development on the Stabroek Block at Yellowtail is underway with preliminary plans for our gross capacity in the range of 220,000 to 250,000 barrels of oil per day and anticipated start-up in 2025, pending government approvals and project sanctioning. Our 3 sanctioned oil developments have a breakeven Brent oil price of between $25 and $35 per barrel. And according to a recent data from Wood Mackenzie, our Guyana developments are the highest margin, lowest carbon intensity oil and gas assets globally.
Last week, we announced publication of our 24th Annual Sustainability Report, which details our environmental, social and governance, or ESG strategy and performance. In 2020, we significantly surpassed our 5-year emission reduction targets, reducing Scope 1 and 2 operated greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 46% and flaring intensity by 59% compared to 2014 levels.
Our 5-year operated emission reduction targets for 2025, which are detailed in the sustainability report, exceed the 22% reduction in carbon intensity by 2030 in the International Energy Agency's sustainable development scenario, which is consistent with the Paris Agreement's ambition to hold the rise in global average temperature to well below 2 degrees centigrade. We are also contributing to groundbreaking research being done by the Salk Institute to develop plants with larger root systems that are capable of absorbing and storing potentially billions of tons of carbon per year from the atmosphere.
We continue to be recognized as an industry leader for the quality of our ESG performance and disclosure. In May, Hess was named to the 100 Best Corporate Citizens list for the 14th consecutive year based upon an independent assessment by ISS-ESG. And we were the only oil and gas company to earn a place on the 2021 list.
In summary, oil and gas are going to be needed for decades to come. By continuing to successfully execute our strategy and achieve strong operational performance, our company is uniquely positioned to deliver industry-leading cash flow growth over the next decade. As our term loan is paid off and our portfolio generates increasing free cash flow, the majority will be returned to our shareholders, first, through dividend and increases and then opportunistic share repurchases.
I will now turn the call over to Greg Hill for an operational update."

In the second quarter, we continued to deliver strong operational performance. Companywide net production averaged 307,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, above our guidance of 290,000 to 295,000 barrels of oil equivalent",1131,"Thanks, John. In the second quarter, we continued to deliver strong operational performance. Companywide net production averaged 307,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, above our guidance of 290,000 to 295,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, driven by good performance across the portfolio. 
In the third quarter, we expect companywide net production to average approximately 265,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, which reflects the Tioga gas plant turnaround in the Bakken and planned maintenance in the Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia. For full year 2021, we now forecast net production to average approximately 295,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, compared to our previous forecast of between 290,000 and 295,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. So we're now forecasting to be at the top of the range.
Turning to the Bakken. Second quarter net production averaged 159,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This was above our guidance of approximately 155,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, primarily reflecting increased gas capture, which has allowed us to drive flaring to under 5%, well below the state's 9% limit. 
For the third quarter, we expect Bakken net production to average approximately 145,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which reflects the planned 45-day maintenance turnaround and expansion tie-in at the Tioga gas plant. For the full year 2021, we maintain our Bakken net production forecast of 155,000 to 160,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
In the second quarter, we drilled 17 wells and brought 9 new wells online. In the third quarter, we expect to drill approximately 15 wells and to bring approximately 20 new wells online. And for the full year 2021, we now expect to drill approximately 65 wells and to bring approximately 50 new wells online. 
In terms of drilling and completion costs, although we have experienced some cost inflation, we are confident that we can offset the increases through technology and lean manufacturing efficiency gains and are therefore maintaining our full year average forecast of $5.8 million per well in 2021. 
We've been operating 2 rigs since February, but given the improvement in oil prices and our robust inventory of high-return drilling locations, we plan to add a third rig in September. Moving to a 3-rig program will allow us to grow cash flow and production, better optimize our in-basin infrastructure and drive further reductions in our unit cash costs.
Now moving to the offshore. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, second quarter net production averaged 52,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to our guidance of approximately 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In the third quarter, we forecast Gulf of Mexico net production to average between 35,000 and 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting planned maintenance downtime as well as some hurricane contingency. For the full year 2021, our forecast for Gulf of Mexico net production remains approximately 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
In Southeast Asia, net production in the second quarter was 66,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, above our guidance of approximately 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Third quarter net production is forecast to average between 50,000 and 55,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting planned maintenance at North Malay Basin and the JDA as well as Phase 3 installation work at North Malay Basin. Full year 2021 net production is forecast to average approximately 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.
Now turning to Guyana. In the second quarter, gross production from Liza Phase 1 averaged 101,000 barrels of oil per day or 26,000 barrels of oil per day net to Hess. The repaired flash gas compression system has been installed on the Liza Destiny FPSO and is under test. The operator is evaluating the test data to optimize performance and is safely managing production in the range of 120,000 to 125,000 barrels of oil per day. Replacement of the flash gas compression system with a modified design and production optimization work are planned for the fourth quarter, which will result in higher production capacity and reliability.
Net production from Liza Phase 1 is forecast to average approximately 30,000 barrels of oil per day in the third quarter and for the full year 2021. The Liza Phase 2 development will utilize the 220,000 barrels of oil per day Unity FPSO, which is scheduled to sail away from Singapore at the end of August and first oil remains on track for early 2022.
Turning to our third development, Payara. The Prosperity FPSO hull is complete and will enter the Keppel yard in Singapore following sail away of the Liza Unity. Topsides fabrication has commenced at Dyna-Mac and development drilling began in June. The overall project is approximately 45% completed. The Prosperity will have a gross production capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day and is on track to achieve first oil in 2024.
As for our fourth development at Yellowtail, the joint venture anticipates submitting the plan of development to the government of Guyana in the fourth quarter with first oil targeted for 2025, pending government approvals and project sanctioning. 
During the second quarter, the Mako-2 appraisal well on the Stabroek Block confirmed the quality, thickness and aerial extent of the reservoir. When integrated with the previously announced discovery at Uaru-2, the data supports a potential fifth development in the area east of the Liza Complex. As John mentioned, this morning, we announced a discovery at Whiptail, located approximately 4 miles southeast of Uaru-1. Drilling continues at both wells to test deeper targets.
In terms of other drilling activity in the second half of 2021, after Whiptail-2, the Noble Don Taylor will drill the Pinktail-1 exploration well, which is located 5 miles southeast of Yellowtail-1, followed by the Tripletail-2 appraisal well located 5 miles south of Tripletail-1. The Noble Tom Madden will spud the Cataback-1 exploration well located 4.5 miles southeast of the Turbot-1 discovery in early August. Then in the fourth quarter, we will drill our first dedicated test of the deep potential at the Fangtooth prospect located 9 miles northwest of Liza-1.
In the third quarter, the Noble Sam Croft will drill the Turbot-2 appraisal well, then transition to development drilling operations for the remainder of the year. The Stena Carron will conduct a series of appraisal drill stem tests at Uaru-1, then Mako-2 and then Longtail-2.
In closing, we continue to deliver strong operational performance across our portfolio. Our offshore assets are generating strong free cash flow, the Bakken is on a capital-efficient growth trajectory, and Guyana keeps getting bigger and better, all of which positions us to deliver industry-leading returns, material cash flow generation and significant shareholder value.
I will now turn the call over to John Rielly."
249841,1673535248,2383849,"Hess Corporation, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2021",2021-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Hess Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the second quarter of 2021 to the first quarter of 2021. Adjusted net income was $74 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to net income of $252 million in the first quarter of 2021.",1337,"Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the second quarter of 2021 to the first quarter of 2021. Adjusted net income was $74 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to net income of $252 million in the first quarter of 2021.
Turning to E&P. E&P adjusted net income was $122 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to net income of $308 million in the previous quarter. The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted E&P results between the second quarter and first quarter of 2021 were as follows: Lower sales volumes reduced earnings by $126 million, higher cash costs reduced earnings by $48 million, higher exploration expenses reduced earnings by $10 million, all other items reduced earnings by $2 million for an overall decrease in second quarter earnings of $186 million.
Second quarter sales volumes were lower, primarily due to Guyana having two 1 million-barrel liftings of oil compared with three 1 million-barrel liftings in the first quarter, and first quarter sales volumes included nonrecurring sales of 2 VLCC cargos totaling 4.2 million barrels of Bakken crude oil, which contributed approximately $70 million of net income. In the second quarter, our E&P sales volumes were underlifted compared with production by approximately 785,000 barrels, which reduced our after-tax results by approximately $18 million.
Cash costs for the second quarter came in at the lower end of guidance and reflect higher planned maintenance and workover activity in the first quarter. In June, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court approved the bankruptcy plan for Fieldwood Energy, which includes transferring abandonment obligations of Fieldwood to predecessors entitled of certain of its assets who are jointly and severally liable for the obligations. As a result of the bankruptcy, Hess as one of the predecessors entitled in 7 shallow-water West Delta 79/86 leases held by Fieldwood is responsible for the abandonment of the facilities on the leases.
Second quarter E&P results include an after-tax charge of $147 million, representing the estimated gross abandonment obligation for West Delta 79/86 without taking into account potential recoveries from other previous owners. Within the next 9 months, we expect to receive an order from the regulator requiring us along with other predecessors entitled to decommission the facilities. The timing of these decommissioning activities will be discussed and agreed upon with the regulator, and we anticipate the cost will be incurred over the next several years.
Turning to Midstream. The Midstream segment had net income of $76 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $75 million in the prior quarter. Midstream EBITDA, before noncontrolling interest, amounted to $229 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to $225 million in the previous quarter.
Now turning to our financial position. At quarter end, excluding Midstream, cash and cash equivalents were $2.42 billion, which includes receipt of net proceeds of $297 million from the sale of our Little Knife and Murphy Creek acreage in the Bakken. Total liquidity was $6.1 billion, including available committed credit facilities, while debt and finance lease obligations totaled $6.6 billion.
Our fully undrawn $3.5 billion revolving credit facility is committed through May 2024, and we have no material near-term debt maturities aside from the $1 billion term loan which matures in March 2023. In July, we repaid $500 million of the term loan. Earlier today, Hess Midstream announced an agreement to repurchase approximately 31 million Class B units of Hess Midstream held by GIP and us for approximately $750 million. We expect to receive net proceeds of approximately $375 million from the sale in the third quarter. In addition, we expect to receive proceeds in the third quarter from the sale of our interest in Denmark for a total consideration of $150 million with an effective date of January 1, 2021.
In the second quarter of 2021, net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $659 million compared with $815 million in the first quarter, primarily due to lower sales volumes. In the second quarter, net cash provided by operating activities after changes in working capital was $785 million compared with $591 million in the first quarter. Changes in operating assets and liabilities during the second quarter of 2021 increased cash flow from operating activities by $126 million, primarily driven by an increase in payables that we expect to reverse in the third quarter.
Now turning to guidance. First, for E&P. Our E&P cash costs were $11.63 per barrel of oil equivalent, including Libya, and $12.16 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding Libya, in the second quarter of 2021. We project E&P cash costs, excluding Libya, to be in the range of $13 to $14 per barrel of oil equivalent for the third quarter, which reflects the impact of lower production volumes resulting from the Tioga gas plant turnaround. Full year cash cost guidance of $11 to $12 per barrel of oil equivalent remains unchanged.
DD&A expense was $11.55 per barrel of oil equivalent, including Libya, and $12.13 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding Libya, in the second quarter. DD&A expense, excluding Libya, is forecast to be in the range of $12 to $13 per barrel of oil equivalent for the third quarter and full year guidance of $12 to $13 per barrel of oil equivalent remains unchanged. This results in projected total E&P unit operating costs, excluding Libya, to be in the range of $25 to $27 per barrel of oil equivalent for the third quarter and $23 to $25 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year of 2021.
Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs, are expected to be in the range of $40 million to $45 million in the third quarter and full year guidance is expected to be in the range of $160 million to $170 million, which is down from previous guidance of $170 million to $180 million.
The midstream tariff is projected to be in the range of $265 million to $275 million for the third quarter and full year guidance is projected to be in the range of $1.080 billion to $1.100 billion, which is down from the previous guidance of $1.090 billion to $1.115 billion. E&P income tax expense, excluding Libya, is expected to be in the range of $35 million to $40 million for the third quarter and full year guidance is expected to be in the range of $125 million to $135 million, which is updated from the previous guidance of $105 million to $115 million, reflecting higher commodity prices. We expect noncash option premium amortization will be approximately $65 million for the third quarter and full year guidance of approximately $245 million remains unchanged.
During the third quarter, we expect to sell three 1 million-barrel cargoes of oil from Guyana. Our E&P capital and exploratory expenditures are expected to be approximately $575 million in the third quarter. Full year guidance, which now includes increasing drilling rigs in the Bakken to 3 from 2 in September, remains unchanged from prior guidance at approximately $1.9 billion.
Turning to Midstream. We anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Midstream segment to be in the range of $50 million to $60 million for the third quarter and full year guidance is projected to be in the range of $275 million to $285 million, which is down from the previous guidance of $280 million to $290 million.
Turning to corporate. Corporate expenses are estimated to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million for the third quarter and full year guidance of $130 million to $140 million remains unchanged. Interest expense is estimated to be in the range of $95 million to $100 million for the third quarter and approximately $380 million for the full year which is at the lower end of our previous guidance of $380 million to $390 million, reflecting the $500 million reduction in the term loan.
This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator."

Whiptail has the potential to be another oil development. And since evaluations work is still going underway, it's a little premature to talk about resource size. But definitely, what we're seeing is a foundation for potentially another oil development with Whiptail.
And then to remind everybody, we still have a very active exploration and appraisal program on the Stabroek Block the remainder of this year, which should provide even more definition for future development investment opportunities. So the queue of high-value potential oil developments is growing, and we're going to optimize it as we continue to get more data and well results to further get clarity on what the queue will be."

As for the $1.9 billion, we do, as you said, expect to ramp up. It's normal for us in the Bakken, when you get into the summer season, building infrastructure pads, things like that. So we do get a pickup on capital there. Same thing for our work in Southeast Asia, is more ramping up. Greg had mentioned the Phase 3 installation that's going on. So I do expect to be spending right around that $1.9 billion, and we'll get that pick up. But again, we have been a little bit lower, and that's why we can add that Bakken rig and stay at $1.9 billion."

So the first thing you do is you get it out there, spin it up, run it at full operating conditions, then and only then after you get that dynamic data can you understand where your potential pinch points or bottlenecks are. And so that's why typically these optimization projects don't come until, I'll say, the first year of operation. But I think 15% to 20% is not atypical. It will vary boat by boat depending on the dynamic conditions, but I would think that you could get some additional upside from Phase II and Phase III and beyond."

So from the Bakken exit rate standpoint, the addition of the third rig when we're starting in September really is not going to add any wells in for production this year. And what we had said in the prior quarter was that we were exiting somewhere at the 170,000 to 175,000 type level as we ended the year. Now what we are seeing is higher propane prices than we saw back in April, so -- which we like, right, that the -- what we see from the NGL price is actually to increase our cash flow in the third quarter maybe $35 million to $40 million based on these higher propane prices. But with those higher propane prices, if you remember, that means we get less volumes under our percentage of proceeds contracts or our POP contracts. So right now, based on what we're seeing on the propane prices, I'd say the exit rate overall will be in the 165,000 to 170,000 range. I think, Greg, I'll hand it over to you for the fourth rig."

So I think just 1 -- couple of more comments on the third rig. So with that third rig, we'll drill 10 more wells. So that's why we increased our drilling well count from 55 to 65.

So that's why we increased our drilling well count from 55 to 65. And then we'll also bring 5 more wells online with that third rig. So that's why we raised the wells online count from 45 to 50. But as John said, those wells come on right at the end of the year. So the impact of that will be seen in 2022's volumes.
The fourth rig, as we've always talked about, the primary role of the Bakken in our portfolio is to be a cash engine. So that's its #1 role. So any decision to add any rigs in the Bakken is going to be driven by returns and corporate cash flow needs. Now having said that, assuming oil prices stay high into next year, then we'd consider adding a fourth rig at the end of next year. Why is it at the end? Because you build all your locations in the summertime. And then by doing so, that would allow us to take Bakken production up to around 200,000 barrels a day. And that level really optimizes our in-basin infrastructure.
But again, that's going to be a function of oil price, a function of corporate cash flow needs, how much cash do we need the Bakken to deliver for the corporation. That's going to be the primary driver of whether or not we add that fourth rig or not. I will say, the fourth rig would be the last rig. So the highest we would go is 4 rigs, and we could maintain that 200,000 barrels a day with 4 rigs for nearly a decade given the extensive inventory of high-return wells that we have."

Yes, as I said in my opening remarks, we are seeing some minor inflation in the Bakken. At the first half of the year, it was all tubulars. However, recall we prebought all of our tubulars for the program this year. So we're covered on that. Commodity-based chemicals, obviously, have gone up. But it really doesn't matter because we're able to cover that through technology and lean manufacturing gains. And that's why we held our well cost forecast for the year still at $5.8 million, even though we're feeling some single-digit kind of levels of inflation.
Now if I turn to the offshore, yes, industry is seeing cost increases there as well. Day rates on deepwater rigs are up modestly. They're nowhere near what they were in the halcyon days of, say, 5 years ago. But remember, almost all of our offshore investment is in Guyana. And we operate under EPC contracts there, so that largely insulates us from cost increases after the contract is signed. And then I've got to say ExxonMobil is doing an extraordinary job of utilizing this ""design one, build many"" strategy to deliver a large amount of efficiencies from that project. So certainly, now and in the very near term, I wouldn't expect any cost issues there. And of course, because of PSC, if your costs do creep up, that's all covered under cost recovery."

So our target and what I always say it's a maximum target is a 2x debt-to-EBITDAX target. So as you said, when we pay off this term loan next year and we have Phase 2 coming online, we're going to drive under that 2x. So there's -- and what",215,"Thanks, Paul. So our target and what I always say it's a maximum target is a 2x debt-to-EBITDAX target. So as you said, when we pay off this term loan next year and we have Phase 2 coming online, we're going to drive under that 2x. So there's -- and what I expect here because I think as we mentioned earlier, we really don't have any material near-term debt maturity. So what we'll do is we'll pay off that term loan, we have small amounts in 2024, and it's not until 2027 that we have our next big maturity. So we'll just pay off the small maturities as we have, and we'll continue to let our EBITDAX grow. Basically, you're going to get Phase 2, then Payara, then Yellowtail, then Uaru-2. So we're going to have significant growth in EBITDA and our balance sheet is just going to get stronger and stronger from that standpoint.
So what I would say is we'd hold that absolute debt level flat and decrease it for the maturities that come about. And then as John mentioned, we're going to start driving significant free cash flow generation. And once that term loan is paid off, we'll start with dividend increases, and then we'll move on to the opportunistic share repurchases."

The oil market is definitely rebalancing. It's 3 factors: demand, supply, inventories. We think demand is running right now at about 98 million barrels a day. Remember, pre-COVID, globally, it was running 100 million barrels a da",626,"Thanks for the questions. The oil market is definitely rebalancing. It's 3 factors: demand, supply, inventories. We think demand is running right now at about 98 million barrels a day. Remember, pre-COVID, globally, it was running 100 million barrels a day. I think demand is well supported with people getting back to work, mobility data in the United States. Certainly, jet fuel is almost at pre-COVID levels of demand. Obviously, international travel is still down. Gasoline in the United States demand as well as gas oil demand is back at pre-COVID levels. So demand is pretty strong. I think the financial stimulus programs of the U.S. government and other governments across the world as well as accommodative monetary policies with the central banks are really turbocharging the consumer, turbocharging the economy and supporting oil demand. So we see demand growth continuing into next year. We think we will get by the end of the year, about 100 million barrels a day of global oil demand. We see that being stronger going into next year.
So I think that's a key part that you have to get grounded in to answer your question, what's the demand assumption and where -- we take it over that demand is going to continue to be strong going into next year through the year. Supply, you look at shale. Shale is no longer the swing supplier. It's gone from a business that's focused on production growth to one that's focused on return of capital, financial discipline, appropriately so. So if you can grow a little bit, but generally free cash according to the oil environment, that's what the investor discipline wants. That's what the company discipline wants.
So we see the rig count, maybe it gets up to 500 in the United States, but shale will not be growing at the level that it was growing at the last 5 years for what it's going to be growing in the next 3 or 4 years. I think U.S. production in the range of crude for, let's say, 11 million barrels a day, it's going to be hard to get into pre-COVID levels of 13 million barrels a day, probably for the next 3 or 4 years. So shale will play a role, but it's going to have a back seat in terms of being the swing supplier. The swing supplier going forward and really the Federal Reserve of oil prices is going to be OPEC led by -- or OPEC+ led by Saudi Arabia, Russia and the other members.
And I think they've been very disciplined, very wise and being very tempered about bringing their spare capacity back. They just made, I think, a very historic agreement that says we'll bring on 400,000 barrels a day month by month. We'll look at it if something happens in the variant, something happens with Iran coming on, we may curtail that. But basically, that 5.8 million barrels a day of excess capacity will be whittled down 400,000 a day each month as it goes out. They'll meet every month to check on that. But basically, that will be sort of that cushion that you need to keep supply up with demand. But in that scenario, the market is in deficit. So that should keep prices well supported.
And the other key point is I'd say, we're at pre-COVID inventory levels now where the glut of 1.2 billion barrels of oil excess supply a year ago April now has been whittled down to where the market is really back in balance at pre-COVID level. So looking forward, the macro, I think, is very supportive, demand growing faster than supply, inventory of pre-COVID levels and the oil price should be well supported in that environment."

If not, would we potentially see faster cash return to shareholders, so a quicker decision to raise the dividend? Is that a potential? Or I guess the alternative would be that you just increase cash on the balance sheet?
And then operationally, I guess, it's a little bit longer term, but could the pace of Guyana development be accelerated, do you think? Or is it a fairly set and predictable path here? And what I'm really wondering is, as you mentioned, the ExxonMobil buy one -- build one -- ""design one, build many"" strategy, I wonder if that has the potential to accelerate if we look forward 2 to 3 to 5 to 7 years.

There are always, always potential to accelerate. It's a function of market conditions, obviously. But I think the key thing is we do want to keep a strong cash position as a cushion for downturns in the oil market. It certainly served us well last year, and it's serving us well this year. Obviously, very different markets between last year and this year.
And in terms of what our assumptions are going forward, we want to keep that strong cash position. And with current prices where they are, we think it's prudent to go into next year with a strong cash position so we can fund the high-value projects that we have in Guyana, in the Bakken and obviously, in our other 2 asset areas. So I think it's good planning assumption to assume that it will be -- given market conditions, we would pay that $500 million off next year. Always have the flexibility to move it forward. But we want to keep the strong cash position, and we just think that's a financial prudent strategy.
In terms of Guyana, Exxon is doing, as Greg said, a great job, managing a world-class project, both in terms of cost and in terms of timing. And this idea of ""design one, build many"" and pretty much getting in a cadence of one of these major FPSOs being built one a year, come on one a year, that cadence is probably as aggressive as any ever done in the industry.

So it actually strengthens our free cash flow even though in the year of the investment, you go up a notch. But the Bakken is becoming a major free cash flow generator and on its way, let's say, to 200,000 barrels a day equivalent and plateauing. So there'll be, obviously, increase with rigs. John talks about it in the range of about $200 million per rig. And then you have the different developments that we have. But we're going to stay very focused on keeping a tight string on our capital investments, so we can grow the free cash flow wedge and really compound that free cash flow wedge over the next 5 to 6 years."

So just starting, Paul, at the high level, both GIP and us remain committed to the long-term value.
And so with this transaction, like pro forma for the transaction, Hess Midstream maintains a strong credit position. It's at 3x debt-to-EBITDA. And then it has continuing free cash flow after distributions as it moves forward. So that debt-to-EBITDA will come back down from 3. So it's going to have sustained low leverage and ample balance sheet capacity. So they really did this to optimize its capital structure. And then with this ample balance sheet capacity, it can support future growth or incremental return to shareholders, including Hess. And that can be this type of buyback or increased distribution."

So when I talk about deeper plays, I'm really talking about the bottom of the Campanian, the lower Campanian and then down into the Santonian. And as I said before, these have the potential to be a very large addition to the recoverable resource base in Guyana. And if successful, as I mentioned previously, they could be exploited through a combination of tiebacks to existing hubs and/or stand-alone developments, if they're big enough. So we've had 8 penetrations to date in the deeper plays. And then if you couple that with the success in Suriname, which is we understand the better part over there, again, don't have the data, but this is just what we're hearing from others in the industry, appears to be kind of the lower Campanian-Santonian interval as well. So there's been a number of penetrations. So that's why we're encouraged.
Now we've got a lot more drilling to do to fully understand the potential of this play. So in the second half, we've got several more deep targets that are planned. Three will be what I call deepening. So there'll be deep tails on Campanian targets, 2 of which John mentioned in his script, which are Whiptail. So both Whiptail-1 and Whiptail-2 will be deepened down into the Santonian. The next one after that is Cataback and then also Pinktail will have a deep tail on it as well. And then as I just discussed with Mr. Brackett, there will be a deep stand-alone called Fangtooth. So just on the Stabroek Block, by the end of the year, we'll have 13 total penetrations in the deeper stratigraphy. So we'll begin to now understand better how it's all put together, where we think the hydrocarbons are, et cetera, et cetera. So keep watching this space, evolving story, but -- very exciting, but again, we need more drilling to figure out where and what we have."

With [ COP 26 ] beginning this Sunday, it is appropriate to address the energy transition. Climate change is the greatest scientific undertaking of the 21st century. The world has two challenges: To grow our global energy supply by about 20% in the next 20 years, and to reach net 0 emissions by 2050. The International Energy Agency published its latest World Energy outlook earlier this month, which provides four scenarios to shed light on these challenges. It is important to remember that these are scenarios, not forecast to help guide policymakers and business leaders in their decision-making. In all four scenarios, oil and gas will still be needed in the decades to come. Significantly more investment will be required to meet the world's growing energy needs, much more in renewables and much more in oil and gas. A reasonable estimate for global oil and gas investment from these IEA scenarios is at least [ $400 billion each ] year over the next 10 years. Last year, that number was $300 billion. This year's estimate is $340 billion to ensure a successful and orderly energy transition. We need to have climate literacy, energy literacy and economic literacy. 
Our strategy is to grow our resource base, have a low cost of supply and sustained cash flow growth, while delivering industry-leading environmental, social and governance performance and disclosure. By investing only in high-return low-cost opportunities, we have built a differentiated and focused portfolio that is balanced between short-cycle and long-cycle assets. Our cash engines are the Bakken, the Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia, where we have competitively advantaged assets and operating capabilities. Guyana is our growth engine and is on track to become a significant cash engine in the coming years as multiple phases of low-cost oil developments come online. Also, by adding a third rig in the Bakken in September and completing the turnaround and expansion of the Tioga gas plant, the Bakken is expected to generate significant free cash flow in the years ahead. 
By successfully executing our strategy, our company is positioned to deliver strong and durable cash flow growth through the end of the decade. Based upon the most recent sell-side consensus estimates, our cash flow is estimated to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 42% between 2020 and 2023, which is 50% above our peers and puts us in the top 5% of the [ S&P500 ]. As our portfolio generates increasing free cash flow, we will first prioritize debt reduction, and then cash returns to shareholders through dividend increases and opportunistic share repurchases. 
We have continued to maintain financial strength as well as managing for risk. As of September 30, we had $2.4 billion of cash on the balance sheet. In July, we prepaid half of our $1 billion term loan maturing in March 2023 and we plan to repay the remaining $500 million in 2022. This debt reduction, combined with the start-up of Liza Phase II early next year, is expected to drive our debt-to-EBITDAX ratio under 2 and also enable us to consider increasing cash returns to shareholders. 
In August, we completed the sale of our interest in Denmark for a total consideration of $150 million, effective January 1, 2021, and received $375 million in proceeds from Hess Midstream's buyback of Class B units from its sponsors, Hess Corporation and Global Infrastructure Partners. Earlier this month, our company also received net proceeds of $108 million from the public offering of Hess owned Class A shares of Hess Midstream. The Denmark sale and these midstream monetizations brought material value forward and further strengthened our cash and liquidity position. 
Key to our long-term strategy is Guyana, one of the industry's best investments. On the Stabroek Block, where Hess has a 30% interest and ExxonMobil is the operator, we announced the 19th and 20th significant discoveries during the third quarter Whiptail and Pinktail. And on October 7, we announced the 21st significant discovery on the block at [indiscernible]. These discoveries will underpin our Q of future low-cost oil developments. We see the potential for at least 6 FPSOs on the Stabroek Block, producing more than 1 million gross barrels of oil per day in 2027 and up to 10 FPSOs to develop the discovered resources on the block. On October 7, we increased the gross discovered recoverable resource estimate for the block to approximately 10 billion barrels of oil equivalent, up from the previous estimate of more than 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent, and we continue to see multibillion barrels of future exploration potential remaining. 
In terms of our current Guyana developments, gross production from the Liza Phase 1 complex averaged 124,000 barrels of oil per day in the third quarter. The Liza Phase 2 development is on track for startup in early 2022 with a gross production capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day, and the Liza unit FPSO arrived in Guyana on Monday. Our third development on the Stabroek Block at the Payara field is on track to achieve first oil in 2024, also with a gross capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day. Our three sanctioned oil developments have a breakeven Brent oil price of between $25 and $35 per barrel. The plan of development for our fourth development on the block at Yellowtail was recently submitted to the government of Guyana for approval Pending government approvals, the project is envisioned to have a gross capacity of approximately 250,000 barrels of oil per day, with first oil in 2025. 
Turning to sustainability. We are proud to be recognized as an industry leader in our environmental, social and governance performance and disclosure. Earlier this month, our company received a AAA rating in the MSCI ESG ratings for 2021 after earning a ratings for the previous 10 consecutive years. The AAA rating designates Hess as a leader in managing industry-specific ESG risks relative to peers and reflects our strong management practices to reduce carbon emissions as well as our top quartile performance in areas such as biodiversity and land use, reduction of air and water emissions and waste and making a positive impact on the communities where we operate. 
In summary, we remain focused on executing our strategy and achieving strong operational and ESG performance. Our company is uniquely positioned to deliver cash flow growth over the next decade, that is not only industry, but which we believe will rank among the best in the S&P 500. After our term loan is paid off and our portfolio generates increasing free cash flow, we will prioritize return of capital to our shareholders through dividend increases and [indiscernible] share repurchases. Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Greg Hill for an operational update."
249841,1684898606,2414154,"Hess Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2021",2021-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Hess Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. In the third quarter, we continued to deliver strong operational performance, meeting our production targets despite extended hurricane-related downtime in the Gulf of Mexico and safely executing a major turnaround at our Tioga gas plant in",1073,"Thanks, John. In the third quarter, we continued to deliver strong operational performance, meeting our production targets despite extended hurricane-related downtime in the Gulf of Mexico and safely executing a major turnaround at our Tioga gas plant in North Dakota. Company-wide net production averaged 265,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, in line with our guidance. In the fourth quarter and for the full year 2021, we expect company-wide net production to average approximately 295,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya. 
Turning to the Bakken. Third quarter net production averaged 148,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This was above our guidance of approximately 145,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and primarily reflected strong execution of the Tioga gas plant turnaround and expansion. No small task in a COVID environment that required strict adherence to extensive safety protocols to keep more than 650 workers safe. For the fourth quarter, we expect Bakken net production to average between 155,000 and 160,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. For the full year 2021, we forecast our Bakken net production to average approximately 155,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to our previous guidance range of 155,000 to 160,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This guidance reflects an increase in NGL prices, which reduces volumes under our percentage of proceeds contracts but significantly increases this year's earnings and cash flow. 
In the third quarter, we drilled 18 wells and brought 19 new wells online. In the fourth quarter, we expect to drill approximately 19 wells and to bring approximately 18 new wells online. And for the full year 2021, we continue to expect to drill approximately 65 wells and to bring approximately 50 new wells online. In terms of drilling and completion costs, although we have experienced some cost inflation, we are maintaining our full year average forecast of $5.8 million per well in 2021. Since February, we've been operating two rigs. But given the improvement in oil prices and our robust inventory of high-return drilling locations, we added a third rig in September. Moving to a 3-year -- 3-rig program will allow us to grow cash flow and production, better optimize our in-basin infrastructure and drive further reductions in our unit cash costs. 
Now moving to the offshore. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, third quarter net production averaged 32,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to our guidance range of 35,000 to 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our results reflected an extended period of recovery following Hurricane [indiscernible], which caused power outages at transportation and processing facilities downstream of our platforms. Production was restored at all of our facilities by the end of September. In the fourth quarter, we forecast Gulf of Mexico net production to average between 40,000 and 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. For the full year 2021, our forecast for Gulf of Mexico net production remains approximately 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
In Southeast Asia, net production in the third quarter was 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, in line with our guidance of 50,000 to 55,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting the impact of planned maintenance shutdowns and lower nominations due to COVID. Fourth quarter net production is forecast to average approximately 65,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and our full year 2021 net production forecast remains at approximately 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. 
Now turning to Guyana. In the third quarter, gross production from Liza Phase 1 averaged 124,000 barrels of oil per day or 32,000 barrels of oil per day net to Hess. Replacement of the flash gas compression system on the Liza Destiny with a modified design is planned for the fourth quarter and production optimization work is now planned to take place in the first quarter of 2022. These two projects are expected to result in higher production capacity and reliability. Net production from Liza Phase 1 is forecast to average approximately 30,000 barrels of oil per day in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2021. The Liza Phase 2 development will utilize the 220,000 barrels of oil per day Unity FPSO, which arrived in Guyana Monday evening. Next steps will be more in line installation and umbilical and riser hookup. First oil remains on track for first quarter 2022. 
Turning to our third development at Payara, the Prosperity FPSO hull entered the Keppel Yard in Singapore on August 1. The topside fabrication at Dyna-Mac and development drilling are underway. The overall project is approximately 60% complete. The prosperity will have a gross production capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day and is on track to achieve first oil in 2024. As for our fourth development in Yellowtail, earlier this month, the joint venture submitted a plan of development to the government of Guyana. Pending government approvals and project sanctioning the Yellowtail project will utilize an FPSO with a gross capacity of approximately 250,000 barrels of oil per day. First oil is targeted for 2025. 
As John mentioned, we announced three discoveries since July. In July, we announced that the Whiptail-1 and 2 wells encountered 246 feet and 167 feet of high-quality oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs, respectively. This discovery is located approximately 4 miles southeast of Uaru 1 and three miles west of Yellowtail. In September, we announced that the Pinktail-1 well located approximately 22 miles southeast of Liza 1, encountered 220 feet of high-quality oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs. And finally, earlier this month, we announced a discovery at Cataback located approximately 4 miles east of Turbine. The well encountered 23 feet of high-quality hydrocarbon-bearing reservoirs, of which approximately 102 feet was oil-bearing. These discoveries further underpin future developments and contributed to the increase of estimated gross discovered recoverable resources on the Stabroek block to approximately 10 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Exploration and appraisal activities in the fourth quarter will include drilling the Fangtooth-1 exploration well, located approximately 11 miles northwest of Liza 1. This well is a significant step-out test that will target deeper Campanion and Santonian aged reservoirs. Appraisal activities in the fourth quarter will include drill stem test at Longtail-2 and Whiptail-2 as well as drilling the Tripletail-2 well. 
In closing, we have once again demonstrated strong execution and delivery and are well positioned to deliver significant value to our shareholders. I will now turn the call over to John Rielly."

In my remarks today, I will compare results from the third quarter of 2021 to the second quarter of 2021. We had net income of $115 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared with a net loss of $73 million in the second quarter of 2021. O",1285,"Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the third quarter of 2021 to the second quarter of 2021. We had net income of $115 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared with a net loss of $73 million in the second quarter of 2021. On an adjusted basis, which excludes items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, we had net income of $86 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared to net income of $74 million in the second quarter of 2021. Third quarter earnings include an after-tax gain of $29 million from the sale of our interest in Denmark. 
Turning to E&P. On an adjusted basis, E&P had net income of $149 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared to net income of $122 million in the previous quarter. The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted E&P results between the third quarter and second quarter of 2021 were as follows: Higher realized crude oil NGL and natural gas selling prices increased earnings by $110 million; lower sales volumes reduced earnings by $147 million; lower DD&A expense increased earnings by $37 million; [ total ] cash cost increased earnings by $14 million; lower exploration expenses increased earnings by $10 million; all other items increased earnings by $3 million for an overall increase in third quarter earnings of $27 million. 
Sales volumes in the third quarter were lower than the second quarter, primarily due to hurricane-related downtime in the Gulf of Mexico, planned maintenance downtime and lower nominations in Malaysia and lower sales in the Bakken, resulting from the planned Tioga gas plant maintenance turnaround. In Guyana, we sold three 1 million-barrel cargoes of oil in the third quarter, up from two 1 million-barrel cargoes of oil sold in the second quarter. For the third quarter, our E&P sales volumes were underlifted compared with production by approximately 175,000 barrels, which had an insignificant impact on our after-tax results for the quarter. 
Turning to Midstream. The Midstream segment had net income of $61 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared with $76 million in the prior quarter. Third quarter results included costs related to the Tioga gas plant maintenance turnaround that was safely and successfully completed. Midstream EBITDA, before noncontrolling interest, amounted to $203 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared with $229 million in the previous quarter. 
Turning to our financial position. At quarter end, excluding Midstream, cash and cash equivalents were $2.41 billion and total liquidity was $6 billion, including available committed credit facilities, while debt and finance lease obligations totaled $6.1 billion. During the third quarter, we received net proceeds of $375 million from the sale of $15.6 million Hess-owned [indiscernible] Midstream and proceeds of approximately $130 million from the sale of our interest in Denmark. In July, we prepaid $500 million of our $1 billion term loan, and we plan to repay the remaining $500 million in 2022. 
In October, we received net proceeds of approximately $108 million from the public offering of 4.3 million Hess-owned Class A shares of Hess Midstream. Our ownership in Hess Midstream, on a consolidated basis, is approximately 44% compared with 46% prior to these two recent transactions. In the third quarter, net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $631 million compared with $659 million in the second quarter. In the third quarter, net cash provided by operating activities after changes in operating assets and liabilities was $615 million compared with $785 million in the second quarter. Changes in operating assets and liabilities during the third quarter decreased net cash provided in operating activities by $16 million compared with an increase of $126 million in the second quarter. 
Now turning to guidance. First, for E&P. Our E&P cash costs were $12.76 per barrel of oil equivalent, including Libya, and $13.45 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding Libya, in the third quarter of 2021. We project E&P cash costs, excluding Libya, to be in the range of $12 to $12.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the fourth quarter, and $11.75 to $12 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year compared to previous full year guidance of $11 to $12 per barrel of oil equivalent. The updated guidance reflects the impact of higher realized selling prices in 2021, with significantly improved cash flow but reduced volumes received under percentage of proceeds contracts and increased production taxes in the Bakken. DD&A expense was $11.77 per barrel of oil equivalent, including Libya, and $12.38 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding Libya, in the third quarter. DD&A expense, excluding Libya, is forecast to be in the range of $13 to $13.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the fourth quarter and the full year is expected to be in the range of $12.50 to $13 per barrel of oil equivalent. This results in projected total E&P unit operating costs, excluding Libya, to be in the range of $25 to $26 per barrel of oil equivalent for the fourth quarter and $24.25 to $25 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year of 2021.
Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs, are expected to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million in the fourth quarter and approximately $160 million for the full year, which is at the lower end of our previous full year guidance of $160 million to $170 million. The midstream tariff is projected to be approximately $295 million for the fourth quarter and approximately [ $1.095 billion ] for the full year. E&P income tax expense, excluding Libya, is expected to be in the range of $35 million to $40 million for the fourth quarter and the full year is expected to be in the range of $135 million to $140 million, which is up from previous guidance of $125 million to $135 million, reflecting higher commodity prices. We expect noncash option premium amortization will be approximately $65 million for the fourth quarter. For the year 2022, we have purchased WTI collars for 90,000 barrels of oil per day with a floor price of $60 per barrel and a ceiling price of $90 per barrel. We have also entered into Brent collars for 60,000 barrels of oil per day with a floor price of $65 per barrel and a ceiling price of $95 per barrel. The cost of this 2022 hedge program is $161 million, which will be amortized ratably over 2022. 
During the fourth quarter, we expect to sell two 1 million-barrel cargoes of oil from Guyana. Our E&P capital and exploratory expenditures are expected to be approximately $650 million in the fourth quarter. Full year guidance remains unchanged at approximately $1.9 billion. For midstream, we anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Midstream segment to be approximately $70 million for the fourth quarter and the full year is projected to be approximately $280 million, which is at the midpoint of our previous guidance of $275 million to $285 million. 
Turning to corporate. Corporate expenses are estimated to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million for the fourth quarter the full year is expected to be in the range of $125 million to $130 million which is down from our previous guidance of $130 million to $140 million. Interest expense is estimated to be in the range of $90 million to $95 million for the fourth quarter and the full year is expected to be in the range of $375 million to $380 million compared to our previous guidance of approximately $380 million. This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator."

And then ExxonMobil is doing an extraordinary job, I think, of utilizing this design one, build many strategy. to deliver efficiencies. Now on the Yellowtail, we still don't have the final numbers. So once that project is sanctioned, we'll give the market color on what the costs are. I do think it's important to remember the nature of the PSC though. So by the time you get the Yellowtail, the efficiency of the PSC is so rapid that any cost increases rapidly get recovered. So the impact on overall project return is not very much at all, right, because of that superefficient PSC. And the breakevens for Yellowtail, we project even with some cost increases, we'll be in the -- firmly in the $25 to $32 barrel range. So one of the best projects on the planet even with some potential cost increases. Great project."

Now you know, obviously, we will finalize that, and we'll give our full guidance in January. But from a directional standpoint, let's start with the Bakken. We've added a rig there. R",454,"Doug, let me start with just giving some color on our capital for 2022. Now you know, obviously, we will finalize that, and we'll give our full guidance in January. But from a directional standpoint, let's start with the Bakken. We've added a rig there. Rule of thumb when we add a rig, it's approximately $200 million when we add a rig in the Bakken. We're also -- to your point, with the higher prices, we're seeing more ballots for nonoperated wells. So for that, we could see an increase of approximately $50 million in our [ non-op JV ] wells next year. So if you're looking at Bakken, approximately $250 million of a capital increase as we look at next year, obviously, with a pickup in production and an increasing cash flow, though also as well coming from Bakken. In Guyana, we expect our development spend. So we went into the year with guide with $780 million for our development spend in Guyana. We're going to come in under that. And so let me just say we'll probably be approximately $750 million on our Guyana development spend this year. So with Liza Phase 2 and a continued development on Payara and we'll begin spending on Yellowtail, we think it's approximately $1 billion will be the Guyana capital for the developments next year. So approximately, again, another $250 million there. The other areas then are Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia. So on the Gulf of Mexico, we're basically not spending much much money at all this year in the Gulf of Mexico. And we typically spend $150 million to $200 million. And we do plan to drill a tieback well and one exploration well next year. And in Southeast Asia, we're looking to complete our Phase 3 and Phase 4 developments in North Malay Basin. So we'll have some increase there. So I'd say combined, those will be about $200 million. So I've got $500 million from Bakken and Guyana, $200 million Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia. But I have to remind everyone, we'll have Liza Phase 2 coming online. And so I'll just do I always do that simple math when Liza Phase 2 comes on in full and we have our share of 220,000 barrels of oil per day were basically, and I'm just going to use a $60 Brent price and about a $10 cash cost. We pick up $1 billion of additional cash flow from Liza Phase 2 alone when that comes on. And then obviously, you have Payara and Yellowtail. So we'll get much more cash flow as each FPSO comes on. So that's a directional. We'll update in January. John, you want to talk on Yellowtail?"

And while its cost will be higher, the resource we are developing is significantly higher. And this development has simply outstanding financial returns, some of the best in the industry, as Greg mentioned, and a breakeven cost between $25 and $32 per barrel Brent. So it's outstanding economics. Yes, the costs are higher, but the resource we're recovering as much higher, and these are some of the best economics in the industry."

So -- but there are studies going on because remember, the highest value of the gas is pressure maintenance of these reservoirs significantly increase recovery.

And our debt to EBITDAX will be below 2 at that point, and we'll begin increasing returns to shareholders. What we're going to do first with the returns is increase our dividend. We'll start there. And then obviously, as each FPSO comes on, we get significant -- as I mentioned earlier, another $1 billion with IR, another $1 billion with Yellowtail will have an increasing free cash flow. We will still progressively increase the dividend. But when we have that free cash flow, the majority of that will go back to shareholders. And that point, we'll be looking at opportunistic share repurchases."

So the offerings we did, we had the secondary in Q1 and earlier this month, they were designed to increase the float, as midstream get their liquidity up there. And the Q3 buyback actually helped test midstream optimize its capital structure, getting to that 3x leverage position. So proforma for these transactions, Hess Midstream, it maintains a strong credit position and it has continuing free cash flow after distributions. So it will continue to have that low leverage and ample balance sheet capacity because the free cash flow, we'll continue to drive that leverage down.

We can do that by adding a fourth rig and depending on market conditions next year, we would consider adding that fourth rig at the end of next year. And I think the other thing that's important to remember is 4 rigs is the maximum we will run in the Bakken. That's sort of the efficient frontier, if you will, to just take the Bakken to 200,000 barrels a day, plus or minus, and then just hold it with that inventory we have for nearly a decade at 200,000 barrels a day. And at that point, depending on oil price, it generates between $750 million and $1 billion of free cash flow. So it just becomes this massive cash annuity for a very long time.

With COP26 beginning this Sunday, it is appropriate to address the energy transition. Climate change is the greatest scientific undertaking of the 21st century. The world has two challenges: To grow our global energy supply by about 20% in the next 20 years; and to reach net 0 emissions by 2050. The International Energy Agency published its latest World Energy outlook earlier this month, which provides four scenarios to shed light on these challenges. It is important to remember that these are scenarios, not forecasts, to help guide policymakers and business leaders in their decision-making. In all four scenarios, oil and gas will still be needed in the decades to come. Significantly more investment will be required to meet the world's growing energy needs, much more in renewables and much more in oil and gas. A reasonable estimate for global oil and gas investment from these IEA scenarios is at least $400 billion each year over the next 10 years. Last year, that number was $300 billion. This year's estimate is $340 billion to ensure a successful and orderly energy transition. We need to have climate literacy, energy literacy and economic literacy.  
Our strategy is to grow our resource base, have a low cost of supply and sustained cash flow growth, while delivering industry-leading environmental, social and governance performance and disclosure. By investing only in high-return low-cost opportunities, we have built a differentiated and focused portfolio that is balanced between short-cycle and long-cycle assets. Our cash engines are the Bakken, the Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia, where we have competitively advantaged assets and operating capabilities. Guyana is our growth engine and is on track to become a significant cash engine in the coming years as multiple phases of low-cost oil developments come online. Also, by adding a third rig in the Bakken in September and completing the turnaround and expansion of the Tioga Gas Plant, the Bakken is expected to generate significant free cash flow in the years ahead.  
By successfully executing our strategy, our company is positioned to deliver strong and durable cash flow growth through the end of the decade. Based upon the most recent sell-side consensus estimates, our cash flow is estimated to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 42% between 2020 and 2023, which is 50% above our peers and puts us in the top 5% of the S&P 500. As our portfolio generates increasing free cash flow, we will first prioritize debt reduction, and then cash returns to shareholders through dividend increases and opportunistic share repurchases.  
We have continued to maintain financial strength as well as managing for risk. As of September 30, we had $2.4 billion of cash on the balance sheet. In July, we prepaid half of our $1 billion term loan maturing in March 2023 and we plan to repay the remaining $500 million in 2022. This debt reduction, combined with the start-up of Liza Phase 2 early next year, is expected to drive our debt to EBITDAX ratio under 2 and also enable us to consider increasing cash returns to shareholders.  
In August, we completed the sale of our interest in Denmark for a total consideration of $150 million, effective January 1, 2021, and received $375 million in proceeds from Hess Midstream's buyback of Class B units from its sponsors, Hess Corporation and Global Infrastructure Partners. Earlier this month, our company also received net proceeds of $108 million from the public offering of Hess owned Class A shares of Hess Midstream. The Denmark sale and these midstream monetizations brought material value forward and further strengthened our cash and liquidity position.  
Key to our long-term strategy is Guyana, one of the industry's best investments. On the Stabroek Block, where Hess has a 30% interest and ExxonMobil is the operator, we announced the 19th and 20th significant discoveries during the third quarter at Whiptail and Pinktail. And on October 7, we announced the 21st significant discovery on the block at Cataback. These discoveries will underpin our queue of future low-cost oil developments. We see the potential for at least 6 FPSOs on the Stabroek Block, producing more than 1 million gross barrels of oil per day in 2027 and up to 10 FPSOs to develop the discovered resources on the block. On October 7, we increased the gross discovered recoverable resource estimate for the block to approximately 10 billion barrels of oil equivalent, up from the previous estimate of more than 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent, and we continue to see multibillion barrels of future exploration potential remaining.  
In terms of our current Guyana developments, gross production from the Liza Phase 1 complex averaged 124,000 barrels of oil per day in the third quarter. The Liza Phase 2 development is on track for startup in early 2022 with a gross production capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day, and the Liza Unity FPSO arrived in Guyana on Monday. Our third development on the Stabroek Block at the Payara field is on track to achieve first oil in 2024, also with a gross capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day. Our three sanctioned oil developments have a breakeven Brent oil price of between $25 and $35 per barrel. The plan of development for our fourth development on the block at Yellowtail was recently submitted to the government of Guyana for approval. Pending government approvals, the project is envisioned to have a gross capacity of approximately 250,000 barrels of oil per day, with first oil in 2025.  
Turning to sustainability. We are proud to be recognized as an industry leader in our environmental, social and governance performance and disclosure. Earlier this month, our company received a AAA rating in the MSCI ESG ratings for 2021 after earning a ratings for the previous 10 consecutive years. The AAA rating designates Hess as a leader in managing industry-specific ESG risks relative to peers and reflects our strong management practices to reduce carbon emissions as well as our top quartile performance in areas such as biodiversity and land use, reduction of air and water emissions and waste and making a positive impact on the communities where we operate.  
In summary, we remain focused on executing our strategy and achieving strong operational and ESG performance. Our company is uniquely positioned to deliver cash flow growth over the next decade, that is not only industry-leading, but which we believe will rank among the best in the S&P 500. After our term loan is paid off and our portfolio generates increasing free cash flow, we will prioritize return of capital to our shareholders through dividend increases and opportunistic share repurchases. Thank you, and I will now turn the call over to Greg Hill for an operational update."

In the third quarter, we continued to deliver strong operational performance, meeting our production targets despite extended hurricane-related downtime in the Gulf of Mexico and safely executing a major turnaround at our Tioga Gas Plant in",1070,"Thanks, John. In the third quarter, we continued to deliver strong operational performance, meeting our production targets despite extended hurricane-related downtime in the Gulf of Mexico and safely executing a major turnaround at our Tioga Gas Plant in North Dakota. Company-wide net production averaged 265,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya, in line with our guidance.  
In the fourth quarter and for the full year 2021, we expect company-wide net production to average approximately 295,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, excluding Libya.  
Turning to the Bakken. Third quarter net production averaged 148,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This was above our guidance of approximately 145,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and primarily reflected strong execution of the Tioga Gas Plant turnaround and expansion. No small task in a COVID environment that required strict adherence to extensive safety protocols to keep more than 650 workers safe. For the fourth quarter, we expect Bakken net production to average between 155,000 and 160,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. For the full year 2021, we forecast our Bakken net production to average approximately 155,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to our previous guidance range of 155,000 to 160,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This guidance reflects an increase in NGL prices, which reduces volumes under our percentage of proceeds contracts but significantly increases this year's earnings and cash flow.  
In the third quarter, we drilled 18 wells and brought 19 new wells online. In the fourth quarter, we expect to drill approximately 19 wells and to bring approximately 18 new wells online. And for the full year 2021, we continue to expect to drill approximately 65 wells and to bring approximately 50 new wells online. In terms of drilling and completion costs, although we have experienced some cost inflation, we are maintaining our full year average forecast of $5.8 million per well in 2021. Since February, we've been operating two rigs. But given the improvement in oil prices and our robust inventory of high-return drilling locations, we added a third rig in September. Moving to a 3-year -- 3-rig program will allow us to grow cash flow and production, better optimize our in-basin infrastructure and drive further reductions in our unit cash costs.  
Now moving to the offshore. In the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, third quarter net production averaged 32,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day compared to our guidance range of 35,000 to 40,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Our results reflected an extended period of recovery following Hurricane Ida, which caused power outages at transportation and processing facilities downstream of our platforms. Production was restored at all of our facilities by the end of September. In the fourth quarter, we forecast Gulf of Mexico net production to average between 40,000 and 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. For the full year 2021, our forecast for Gulf of Mexico net production remains approximately 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.  
In Southeast Asia, net production in the third quarter was 50,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, in line with our guidance of 50,000 to 55,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, reflecting the impact of planned maintenance shutdowns and lower nominations due to COVID. Fourth quarter net production is forecast to average approximately 65,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and our full year 2021 net production forecast remains at approximately 60,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.  
Now turning to Guyana. In the third quarter, gross production from Liza Phase 1 averaged 124,000 barrels of oil per day or 32,000 barrels of oil per day net to Hess. Replacement of the flash gas compression system on the Liza Destiny with a modified design is planned for the fourth quarter and production optimization work is now planned to take place in the first quarter of 2022. These two projects are expected to result in higher production capacity and reliability. Net production from Liza Phase 1 is forecast to average approximately 30,000 barrels of oil per day in the fourth quarter and for the full year 2021. The Liza Phase 2 development will utilize the 220,000 barrels of oil per day Unity FPSO, which arrived in Guyana Monday evening. Next steps will be more in line installation and umbilical and riser hookup. First oil remains on track for first quarter 2022.  
Turning to our third development at Payara, the Prosperity FPSO hull entered the Keppel yard in Singapore on August 1. The topside fabrication at Dyna-Mac and development drilling are underway. The overall project is approximately 60% complete. The prosperity will have a gross production capacity of 220,000 barrels of oil per day and is on track to achieve first oil in 2024. As for our fourth development in Yellowtail, earlier this month, the joint venture submitted a plan of development to the government of Guyana. Pending government approvals and project sanctioning, the Yellowtail project will utilize an FPSO with a gross capacity of approximately 250,000 barrels of oil per day. First oil is targeted for 2025.  
As John mentioned, we announced three discoveries since July. In July, we announced that the Whiptail-1 and 2 wells encountered 246 feet and 167 feet of high-quality oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs, respectively. This discovery is located approximately 4 miles southeast of Uaru-1 and 3 miles west of Yellowtail. In September, we announced that the Pinktail-1 well located approximately 22 miles southeast of Liza-1, encountered 220 feet of high-quality oil-bearing sandstone reservoirs. And finally, earlier this month, we announced a discovery at Cataback located approximately 4 miles east of Turbot-1. The well encountered 243 feet of high-quality hydrocarbon-bearing reservoirs, of which approximately 102 feet was oil-bearing. These discoveries further underpin future developments and contributed to the increase of estimated gross discovered recoverable resources on the Stabroek block to approximately 10 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Exploration and appraisal activities in the fourth quarter will include drilling the Fangtooth-1 exploration well, located approximately 11 miles northwest of Liza-1. This well is a significant step-out test that will target deeper Campanion and Santonian aged reservoirs. Appraisal activities in the fourth quarter will include drill stem tests at Longtail-2 and Whiptail-2 as well as drilling the Tripletail-2 well.  
In closing, we have once again demonstrated strong execution and delivery and are well positioned to deliver significant value to our shareholders. I will now turn the call over to John Rielly."
249841,1684898606,2414481,"Hess Corporation, Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2021",2021-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Hess Corporation","Executives","Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the third quarter of 2021 to the second quarter of 2021. We had net income of $115 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared with a net loss of $73 million in the second quarter of 2021. O",1285,"Thanks, Greg. In my remarks today, I will compare results from the third quarter of 2021 to the second quarter of 2021. We had net income of $115 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared with a net loss of $73 million in the second quarter of 2021. On an adjusted basis, which excludes items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, we had net income of $86 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared to net income of $74 million in the second quarter of 2021. Third quarter earnings include an after-tax gain of $29 million from the sale of our interest in Denmark. 
Turning to E&P. On an adjusted basis, E&P had net income of $149 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared to net income of $122 million in the previous quarter. The changes in the after-tax components of adjusted E&P results between the third quarter and second quarter of 2021 were as follows: Higher realized crude oil, NGL and natural gas selling prices increased earnings by $110 million; lower sales volumes reduced earnings by $147 million; lower DD&A expense increased earnings by $37 million; [indiscernible] cost increased earnings by $14 million; lower exploration expenses increased earnings by $10 million; all other items increased earnings by $3 million for an overall increase in third quarter earnings of $27 million. 
Sales volumes in the third quarter were lower than the second quarter, primarily due to hurricane-related downtime in the Gulf of Mexico, planned maintenance downtime and lower nominations in Malaysia and lower sales in the Bakken, resulting from the planned Tioga gas plant maintenance turnaround. In Guyana, we sold three 1 million-barrel cargoes of oil in the third quarter, up from two 1 million-barrel cargoes of oil sold in the second quarter. For the third quarter, our E&P sales volumes were underlifted compared with production by approximately 175,000 barrels, which had an insignificant impact on our after-tax results for the quarter. 
Turning to Midstream. The Midstream segment had net income of $61 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared with $76 million in the prior quarter. Third quarter results included costs related to the Tioga Gas Plant maintenance turnaround that was safely and successfully completed. Midstream EBITDA, before noncontrolling interest, amounted to $203 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared with $229 million in the previous quarter. 
Turning to our financial position. At quarter end, excluding Midstream, cash and cash equivalents were $2.41 billion and total liquidity was $6 billion, including available committed credit facilities, while debt and finance lease obligations totaled $6.1 billion. During the third quarter, we received net proceeds of $375 million from the sale of $15.6 million Hess-owned Class B units of Hess Midstream and proceeds of approximately $130 million from the sale of our interest in Denmark. In July, we prepaid $500 million of our $1 billion term loan, and we plan to repay the remaining $500 million in 2022. 
In October, we received net proceeds of approximately $108 million from the public offering of 4.3 million Hess-owned Class A shares of Hess Midstream. Our ownership in Hess Midstream, on a consolidated basis, is approximately 44% compared with 46% prior to these two recent transactions. In the third quarter, net cash provided by operating activities before changes in working capital was $631 million compared with $659 million in the second quarter. In the third quarter, net cash provided by operating activities after changes in operating assets and liabilities was $615 million compared with $785 million in the second quarter. Changes in operating assets and liabilities during the third quarter decreased net cash provided in operating activities by $16 million compared with an increase of $126 million in the second quarter. 
Now turning to guidance. First, for E&P. Our E&P cash costs were $12.76 per barrel of oil equivalent, including Libya, and $13.45 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding Libya, in the third quarter of 2021. We project E&P cash costs, excluding Libya, to be in the range of $12 to $12.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the fourth quarter, and $11.75 to $12 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year compared to previous full year guidance of $11 to $12 per barrel of oil equivalent. The updated guidance reflects the impact of higher realized selling prices in 2021, with significantly improved cash flow but reduced volumes received under percentage of proceeds contracts and increased production taxes in the Bakken. DD&A expense was $11.77 per barrel of oil equivalent, including Libya, and $12.38 per barrel of oil equivalent, excluding Libya, in the third quarter. DD&A expense, excluding Libya, is forecast to be in the range of $13 to $13.50 per barrel of oil equivalent for the fourth quarter and the full year is expected to be in the range of $12.50 to $13 per barrel of oil equivalent. This results in projected total E&P unit operating costs, excluding Libya, to be in the range of $25 to $26 per barrel of oil equivalent for the fourth quarter and $24.25 to $25 per barrel of oil equivalent for the full year of 2021.
Exploration expenses, excluding dry hole costs, are expected to be in the range of $50 million to $55 million in the fourth quarter and approximately $160 million for the full year, which is at the lower end of our previous full year guidance of $160 million to $170 million. The midstream tariff is projected to be approximately $295 million for the fourth quarter and approximately $1.095 billion for the full year. E&P income tax expense, excluding Libya, is expected to be in the range of $35 million to $40 million for the fourth quarter and the full year is expected to be in the range of $135 million to $140 million, which is up from previous guidance of $125 million to $135 million, reflecting higher commodity prices. We expect noncash option premium amortization will be approximately $65 million for the fourth quarter. For the year 2022, we have purchased WTI collars for 90,000 barrels of oil per day with a floor price of $60 per barrel and a ceiling price of $90 per barrel. We have also entered into Brent collars for 60,000 barrels of oil per day with a floor price of $65 per barrel and a ceiling price of $95 per barrel. The cost of this 2022 hedge program is $161 million, which will be amortized ratably over 2022. 
During the fourth quarter, we expect to sell two 1 million-barrel cargoes of oil from Guyana. Our E&P capital and exploratory expenditures are expected to be approximately $650 million in the fourth quarter. Full year guidance remains unchanged at approximately $1.9 billion. For Midstream, we anticipate net income attributable to Hess from the Midstream segment to be approximately $70 million for the fourth quarter and the full year is projected to be approximately $280 million, which is at the midpoint of our previous guidance of $275 million to $285 million. 
Turning to corporate. Corporate expenses are estimated to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million for the fourth quarter and the full year is expected to be in the range of $125 million to $130 million, which is down from our previous guidance of $130 million to $140 million. Interest expense is estimated to be in the range of $90 million to $95 million for the fourth quarter and the full year is expected to be in the range of $375 million to $380 million compared to our previous guidance of approximately $380 million. This concludes my remarks. We will be happy to answer any questions. I will now turn the call over to the operator."

First of all, for the first 3 phases, which you mentioned, those are under existing EPC contracts. So we're basically insulated from cost increases on those EPC contracts? And then ExxonMobil is doing an extraordinary job, I think, of utilizing this ""design one, build many"" strategy, to deliver efficiencies. Now on the Yellowtail, we still don't have the final numbers. So once that project is sanctioned, we'll give the market color on what the costs are. I do think it's important to remember the nature of the PSC though. So by the time you get the Yellowtail, the efficiency of the PSC is so rapid that any cost increases rapidly get recovered. So the impact on overall project return is not very much at all, right, because of that superefficient PSC. And the breakevens for Yellowtail, we project even with some cost increases, we'll be in the -- firmly in the $25 to $32 barrel range. So one of the best projects on the planet even with some potential cost increases. Great project."

R",453,"Doug, let me start with just giving some color on our capital for 2022. Now you know, obviously, we will finalize that, and we'll give our full guidance in January. But from a directional standpoint, let's start with the Bakken. We've added a rig there. Rule of thumb when we add a rig, it's approximately $200 million when we add a rig in the Bakken. We're also -- to your point, with the higher prices, we're seeing more ballots for nonoperated wells. So for that, we could see an increase of approximately $50 million in our non-op JV wells next year. So if you're looking at Bakken, approximately $250 million of a capital increase as we look at next year, obviously, with a pickup in production and an increasing cash flow, though also as well coming from Bakken. In Guyana, we expect our development spend. So we went into the year with the guide with $780 million for our development spend in Guyana. We're going to come in under that. And so let me just say we'll probably be approximately $750 million on our Guyana development spend this year. So with Liza Phase 2 and a continued development on Payara and we'll begin spending on Yellowtail, we think it's approximately $1 billion will be the Guyana capital for the developments next year. So approximately, again, another $250 million there. The other areas then are Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia. So on the Gulf of Mexico, we're basically not spending much money at all this year in the Gulf of Mexico. And we typically spend $150 million to $200 million. And we do plan to drill a tieback well and one exploration well next year. And in Southeast Asia, we're looking to complete our Phase 3 and Phase 4 developments in North Malay Basin. So we'll have some increase there. So I'd say combined, those will be about $200 million. So I've got $500 million from Bakken and Guyana, $200 million Gulf of Mexico and Southeast Asia. But I have to remind everyone, we'll have Liza Phase 2 coming online. And so I'll just do I always do that simple math when Liza Phase 2 comes on in full and we have our share of 220,000 barrels of oil per day, we're basically -- and I'm just going to use a $60 Brent price and about a $10 cash cost, we pick up $1 billion of additional cash flow from Liza Phase 2 alone when that comes on. And then obviously, you have Payara and Yellowtail. So we'll get much more cash flow as each FPSO comes on. So that's a directional. We'll update in January. John, you want to talk on Yellowtail?"

And while its cost will be higher, the resource we are developing is significantly higher. And this development has simply outstanding financial returns, some of the best in the industry, as Greg mentioned, and a breakeven cost between $25 and $32 per barrel Brent. So it's outstanding economics. Yes, the costs are higher, but the resource we're recovering as much higher, and these are some of the best economics in the industry."

So the offerings we did, we had the secondary in Q1 and earlier this month, they were designed to increase the float, as Midstream get their liquidity up there. And the Q3 buyback actually helped test Midstream optimize its capital structure, getting to that 3x leverage position. So proforma for these transactions, Hess Midstream, it maintains a strong credit position and it has continuing free cash flow after distributions. So it will continue to have that low leverage and ample balance sheet capacity because with the free cash flow, we'll continue to drive that leverage down.

We can do that by adding a fourth rig and depending on market conditions next year, we would consider adding that fourth rig at the end of next year. And I think the other thing that's important to remember is 4 rigs is the maximum we will run in the Bakken. That's sort of the efficient frontier, if you will, to just take the Bakken to 200,000 barrels a day, plus or minus, and then just hold it with that inventory we have for nearly a decade at 200,000 barrels a day. And at that point, depending on oil price, it generates between $750 million and $1 billion of free cash flow. So it just becomes this massive cash annuity for a very long time.
