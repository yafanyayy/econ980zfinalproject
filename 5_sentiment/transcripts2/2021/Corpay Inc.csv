Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q4 earnings call. Upfront here, I'll plan to cover 4 subjects: First, I'll provide my take on our Q4 finish; second, I'll put a bow on full year 2020; third, I'll share our 2021 outlook; and lastly, provide a bit of an update on our transformation plan, which is intended to accelerate the company's growth. 
Okay. Let me turn to our Q4 results. So today, we reported revenue of $617 million. That's down 12%. And cash EPS of $3.01, that's down 5% versus last year. These results are both better than anticipated. Volume recovered a bit more in the quarter than we forecasted, and we did manage our operating expenses down 14% against the prior year. 
Organic revenue growth overall, minus 8%. But most importantly, are the trends in Q4, really quite good sales strengthened to over 90% of last year's level, same-store sales or client volume softness improved to minus 6%. And credit loss of $6 million, although helped by a reserve release, and retention continued steady at 92%. 
We did have a fantastic beyond highlight in Brazil in the quarter. We added 175,000 new urban or city users in Q4. That represents 30% of all the new tags we sold in the quarter. So demonstrates there's real demand among the non toll segment in Brazil for this RFID purchasing network, including fueling, parking and now even fast food locations. 
So look, the conclusion of Q4 is really in the sequential trends of the business. If you look at Page 7 of our earnings supplement, you can see that every Q4 metric is improving from the Q2 low: Revenue up from $525 million to $617 million; cash EPS up $2.28 to $3.01; sales up from 55% to now over 90% of last year's level; same-store sales volume getting better from minus 17% to minus 6%; credit losses from $21 million to $6 million; and then lastly, retention holding steady at 92%. So to us, evidence that the business continues to recover from the earlier year lows. 
Okay. Over to 2020. So from a financial perspective, 2020, not our best year. Revenue finished at approximately $2.4 billion. That's down 10% versus '19 and cash EPS finishing at $11.09, down 6% against 2019. 
COVID and the shutdowns did manage to vanquish over $400 million of revenue that we planned in 2020, really in 3 ways. So first, client softness, we had a number of COVID impacted clients that use less of our services. COVID reset the macro environment in Q2, driving down fuel prices and weakening international currencies. And then third, for a while COVID reduced our 2020 new sales, mostly due to the market being distracted. 
The good news is despite the fact that COVID is going on that, we're still living with COVID, is the financial impacts on us appear to be lessening. So we've now recovered in Q4 about half of the clients' softness revenue loss that we experienced in Q2, so half of it back already. Post the macro reset, we've seen relative stability in fuel prices and FX rates. And lastly, the demand for our services, clearly recovering as sales reached 90% at prior year levels. 
So despite not having the greatest financial performance in 2020, we did manage to accomplish a few things. So credit, I'm just delighted with our credit performance in 2020. Expenses, tough times, but we did manage expenses down over 10% in Q2, 3 and 4. We signed 4 acquisitions in 2020. Our guys ran IT exceptionally well, had the best overall system uptime in the history of the company. And lastly, we were able to replan the business in the second half. We conducted a replanning exercise in the summer, and the actuals came in a smidge better than the replan. So reminds us again that fleets of business you can plan. 
I really do want to give a shout out to all FLEETCOR people who hung in there and kept the company going through very unsettling times. 
Okay, let me make the turn to 2021 and I'll outline our initial guidance for the year, along with the assumptions behind it. Clearly, a higher beta in our 2021 numbers. But we'd say that our setup is generally positive. So first, volume and revenue trends strengthening through 2020, so the potential to continue that into '21. Sales production improving, thus the amount we expect to get the [ India ] revenue from new business. And as I mentioned a bit ago, very solid client retention and credit trends. 
We're also hopeful that we'll get additional client softness recovery in '21, although we're the first to admit that, that's hard to forecast. So in our guidance, we're planning to recover about 1/3 of our Q4 exit revenue softness that's still outstanding now. So if we get that, that recovery would provide about 4% to 5% of incremental revenue lift in the second half. 
So with that, our guidance for '21 would be as follows: revenue of $2.65 billion at the midpoint that reflects an 11% increase; overall, organic revenue in the same range, kind of 9% to 13%, but I do want to emphasize that, that assumes 3% to 4% of softness recovery from today's level; we're anticipating significant sales growth over 30% this year, which would be a record level of sales for the company; and profit guide at the midpoint, $12.40 of cash EPS for the core business. We are planning about $0.10 of dilution from the [ Roger ] acquisition, so that would put our consolidated number at $12.30 at the midpoint; lastly, assuming now a May 1 close for the AFX acquisition -- accretion could be approximately $0.20 for the year. So if that happens on time, that could take consolidated cash EPS to $12.50. 
Chuck will speak further about how the guidance rolls out across the quarters. But I do want to point out that our guidance outlooks, Q2, 3 and 4, revenue and profit growth to be back into the high teens. 
Okay. Let me transition now of my last subject, which is the company's transformation plan. So really, our transformation plan is intended to accelerate growth by doing 2 things: So first, the portfolio -- deciding what businesses we want to be in and not be in and constantly reworking that to have a more diverse set of faster-growing businesses; but the second way we transform the company is through our Beyond strategy, which we do utilize in all 4 of our major existing businesses. 
So in this Beyond strategy, we're really trying to do 2 things: First, identify new segments of the market that we can extend the business into; so we ask who else can we serve; and then second, we identify additional or adjacent services that we can cross-sell back to the client base. So if you look at Page 11 of our earnings supplement, you'll see the current Beyond initiatives for each of our 4 businesses. 
We do continue to make progress against our Beyond strategy. Just an example to call out, in our lodging business in 2020, we now settled 25% of all proprietary hotel payments with our virtual card in which we earn interchange. So that's up from -- literally from 0 a few years ago. But today, we begin implementation of maybe our most exciting Beyond initiative of all with the acquisition of Roger. So this begins the move of our corporate payments business down market into the SMB space, along with the opportunity to offer full online bill pay to our global SMB fuel car base. You can see that on Pages 11 and 12 of our supplement. 
So this single bill pay initiative has the potential to dramatically accelerate growth rates in both our corporate pay and fuel card businesses. We feel like it's a pretty unique position that we're in because of the special set of assets that we have. So a large global SMB client base numbering in the hundreds of thousands. We've got working SMB sales channels that historically have acquired 30,000 new clients per quarter. We've got scale virtual card processing capability. We generated over $30 billion in annualized spend last year. We've got a very large merchant database that allows us to monetize virtual card. And now we've got some modern cloud software to provide the bill pay functionality along with a pretty cool user interface. 
So look, in conclusion today, I'm hoping to provide just a few takeaways. So Q4, again, not our best quarter from an absolute perspective, but clear evidence of improving trends in the business. 2020, we did manage to perform better as the year went on and certainly learned some new tricks around how to manage credit, expenses, IT, even sales in a remote environment. '21, again our setup, we think, looks pretty good. Only a slightly unfavorable macro to deal with, but improving trends coming into the year. And certainly, the wildcard that I mentioned of what happens with the incremental softness recovery. 
And lastly, transformation. Our Beyond strategy now progressing -- providing some traction. But today's online SMB bill pay initiative may be the biggest of them all. 
So with that, let me turn the call back over to Chuck to provide some additional details on the quarter and our outlook. Chuck?"

For the fourth quarter of 2020, we reported revenue of $617 million, down 12%, GAAP net income down 11% to $210 million and GAAP net income per diluted share down 6% to $2.44. The quarter was again affected by COVID-related business slowdowns",1534,"Thanks, Ron. For the fourth quarter of 2020, we reported revenue of $617 million, down 12%, GAAP net income down 11% to $210 million and GAAP net income per diluted share down 6% to $2.44. The quarter was again affected by COVID-related business slowdowns, although we showed improvement over last quarter in most of our businesses. 
Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2020 decreased 10% to $258 million and adjusted net income per diluted share decreased 5% to $3.01. We continue to manage expenses in line with revenue performance. Please see exhibit 1 of our press release for a reconciliation of all non-GAAP financial metrics. 
Organic revenue in the quarter was down 8% overall, primarily due to same-store sales being down 6% year-over-year. Organic revenue neutralizes the impact of year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates, fuel prices and fuel spreads, and includes pro forma results for acquisitions closed mid period. 
Our fuel category was down organically about 10% versus Q4 last year. Our domestic fuel businesses were stable to improving in the quarter, whereas the international fuel businesses were affected by the renewed COVID-related closures, especially in Western Europe. 
The corporate payments category was down approximately 6% in the fourth quarter. Approximately 6 points of decline was again driven by the 100 most affected customers we discussed last quarter. Lower spending on our T&E product drove another 2 points of organic drag. 
Virtual card volumes were up 12% for the quarter, which was an improvement from flat last quarter as continued political spend and the benefit of new customers offset the drag from the highly affected customers. Cross-border or FX-related volumes were down 1% as payment volumes are still being affected by lower invoice levels, specifically in manufacturing and wholesale trade. 
Full AP continued to perform very well with volume up 14%. New sales of full AP were very strong as full year 2020 sales were more than double 2019's results. We continue to invest here and have enabled 10 new ERP integrations in 2020, with plans for another 10 or so in 2021. 
Tolls continued to be our most resilient business and grew organically 7% in the fourth quarter, up 4% from last quarter. Active toll tags were up 6% in the quarter, with urban tags accounting for 25% of all new tags sold during 2020. 
The lodging category was down 25% organically in the fourth quarter, with 20 points of drag caused by the inclusion of acquired airline lodging businesses in the year ago period. Our workforce lodging business has improved, with volumes down in the mid-single digits. Airline lodging volumes have also improved in line with flight activity, but still remain well below last year's levels. 
Looking further down the income statement. Our total operating expenses were down 14% for the fourth quarter of 2020 to $323 million. We performed in line with the high end of our target reduction compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower volume-related costs, lower employee-related costs, including headcount, sales commissions, bonuses and stock compensation. We also saw lower T&E expenses in addition to the impact of foreign exchange rates. 
As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses were approximately 52.4%, a roughly 240 basis point improvement from last quarter. Bad debt expense in the fourth quarter of 2020 was $6 million or 2 basis points, which includes a reserve release of $5 million. Bad debt was only 4 basis points, excluding the reserve release. Our bad debt levels continue to be good, and our aging roll rates remain very favorable. There is still uncertainty around the timing, level and duration of government stimulus and various responses to increasing COVID cases around the world. So that's still a consideration on our reserve. 
Interest expense decreased 13% to $30.3 million, driven primarily by decreases in LIBOR related to the unhedged portion of our debt. This was partially offset by the impact of additional borrowing for share buybacks earlier in the year. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 20.3%, with a reduction from last year, driven primarily by incremental excess tax benefit on stock option exercises. 
Now turning to the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2020, we have approximately $1.9 billion of total liquidity, consisting of available cash on the balance sheet and our undrawn revolver at quarter end. We ended the quarter just shy of $1.5 billion in total cash, of which approximately $542 million is restricted and consists primarily of customer deposits. We had $3.6 billion outstanding on our credit facilities and $700 million borrowed in our securitization facility. We remain committed to a consistent program of capital allocation, using our free cash flow for acquisitions and buybacks. 
In the quarter, we repurchased roughly 181,000 shares in connection with employee sales. In total, for 2020, we spent $850 million on share buybacks. We believe that we have ample liquidity to pursue any near-term M&A opportunities while still opportunistically buying back shares when it makes sense. 
For the quarter, we had approximately $23.4 million of capital expenditures, and we finished with a leverage ratio of 2.67x trailing 12-month EBITDA as of December 31. 
Now let me share some thoughts on our outlook. Looking ahead, we're expecting Q1 2020 adjusted net income per share to be between $2.60 and $2.80, which at the midpoint is approximately $0.31 or 10% lower than what we reported in Q4 of 2020. About half of the difference is attributable to revenue seasonality. You see, while some of our businesses, like Gift, had seasonally strong fourth quarters, most of our businesses had seasonally weak first quarters. Of course, volume-related expenses will slightly offset this revenue seasonality impact. 
Roughly 1/3 of the difference is due to the normalization of certain expenses. For example, in Q4 of 2020, we released $5 million of our bad debt reserve, which we do not expect to repeat in Q1. As sales performance has continued to recover throughout 2020, we expect bad debt to gradually increase sequentially as those customers' balances age. Additionally, when the impact of the COVID-related shutdowns became clearer in 2020, we proactively reduced our annual incentive target payouts by 50% and accrued to those lower targets for the remainder of the year. As our business has recovered meaningfully, we plan to return incentive targets to 2021 to normal levels.  We also expect our effective tax rate in Q1 of 2021 to be about 80 to 100 basis points higher than the rate we reported in Q4 of 2020. 
Lastly, the acquisition of Roger and incremental sales and marketing investments are slightly dilutive to the quarter sequentially. 
Now looking beyond Q1 to full year 2021, we feel it's important to help you understand how we're thinking about the outlook and providing some ranges around possible outcomes, even though those ranges are a bit wider than what they have been in the past. For 2021, we're guiding revenues to be between $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion, and adjusted net income per diluted share to be between $11.90 and $12.70, inclusive of the Roger acquisition. We're still faced with substantial uncertainty regarding the pace of economic recovery and the impact it will have on our financial performance. That said, we've developed a 2021 budget, which incorporates everything we know now, including revenue and expense run rates, current macro environmental factors, planned sales contributions and expected attrition impacts. 
In addition, our guidance assumes a continued rollout of the vaccines that will allow gradual volume and revenue improvement in the first half of the year with an acceleration in the back half of the year as client softness and new sales performance improve sequentially. As I mentioned earlier, we expect several expense lines to normalize higher in 2021 compared with 2020. 
As our business recovers, stock and bonus accruals as well as sales commission expenses will be higher. T&E will rise, as our salespeople get back on the road and volume-related expenses will also rise with increased business activity. Bad debt expense is expected to normalize as we've reopened credit and our sales performance continues to improve. 
We're also making incremental investments in sales, marketing and IT to support our growth aspirations and to deliver a 2021 sales production plan that's more than 30% higher than 2020's results. We're extremely excited with the Roger acquisition and a disproportionate share of our incremental sales and marketing investments will be directed towards that business. As such, the fully loaded acquisition will be an estimated $0.10 drag to adjusted net income per diluted share in 2021. 
As we've demonstrated time and again, we do take a balanced approach on expenses, and we'll adjust accordingly if we see revenues begin to deviate from our expectations. 
And lastly, we continue to work through the approvals on Apex, which have been slowed by Brexit and virus-related shutdowns. While we still expect the deal to be accretive in 2021, we now believe it is more likely to close in Q2 versus our original expectation of Q1. And just for clarity, Apex is not included in the guidance ranges I provided earlier. 
And now, operator, we'd like to open the line for questions."

In terms of the contribution for next year, I'd say we haven't fully modeled it yet, but it's probably going to be still a little dilutive to kind of flat until we fully scale the channels. So we want to obviously see what works before we pour too much in. 
But nonetheless, I'd say that the thing is about -- it's a very small acquisition, $1 million-some-odd, a couple of million in terms of revenue. So it's got a long way to go. But we're pouring a lot of sales and marketing kind of upfront to get it going. 
It's a real bet for us. It was a real deal. We're investing to retain the people that are there because they've helped to build this product, and we're going to need their help to continue. So we've built some extra cost in there as well. So in terms of the magnitude of what it could be next year, it's really going to depend on how much more we pour into the investments."

Clearly, corporate pay would be one, and two would be -- 2 because of the size of the business, but it's still 40%, 50% of the company. 
In lodging, the one thing I would say is, remember, our FLEETCOR lodging business is workforce: Translation, blue collar, utility guys going to a new city, tree cutters clean it up. And so that thing is way back. I mean, I looked at the January volume numbers earlier today, and I believe, month-to-month, that thing is down 3% to 5% now year-over-year. And so that lodging business looks completely different than the kind of lodging business we people on this call are thinking about. 
So the airline part of that is a completely different call. To your point, that thing is running kind of 50% of volumes of a year ago. But that's the one, I'd say, has the snap, bounce back possibility. So we've got -- took a ton of money out of that business, particularly out of the airline portion of the business to kind of wait here, to see if it's going to snap back. 
But it would be number three, but we still like it. I think we lay out on that Page 11, there's a couple of interesting verticals beyond workforce and beyond airline that we're looking at, that we like a lot to leverage everything we have, the systems, the network and stuff. So I want to be clear, we like that business, and we will keep investing and we may buy some additional things in the business. 
Let me be clear. It's not white collar, T&E kind of a lodging business."

So the thing happened, we kind of pulled pretty far back which clearly reduced revenue. We even pull back on existing accounts, right, trimming lines, accelerating payment terms and stuff. So we went at it pretty hard. And now we've reported out for the year. And I think Chuck even mentioned the forward roll rates. So we've got the, I think, the lowest credit loss, as low as I can remember, and certainly as the basis against spend. And so we rotated back. 
I'd say in the fuel card business, we are 100% back. So whatever credit policies. We had pre-COVID, I'd say, if you look at our fuel card businesses, we are right back to fully open, still balanced, but fully open. 
I'd say the one place where we're still being a little cautious is in the corporate pay. And the reason is the spend per client there is so significant, if you think about it. And so we're still being careful. The certain industry sitting in the corporate pay space that have been pretty impacted. So I'd say we've moved that one back, but still not all the way back because it's more high line, what we call internally, high line risk of a couple of BKs for some significant amount of money. So I think there's still upside as we roll through '21, as those 3 or 4 industries we're cautious on, kind of come back."

I think inside of that, the T&E, which is now shrunk down, is probably in the mid- to high-single digits.

That line of business that plastics or multicard. I think the last time I look is down to about 20% of it now being white, call it, T&E, like us. And so fortunately, kind of 80% of that business is kind of okay. It's buying fuels, buying supplies, it's paying vendors. And so it's not going to decline, if you will.

And so, I don't know where we're at, 60% now I guess. So we're moving anyway. 
But I said a little bit in the call the last time on the EV thing that our perspective on the thing is: a, it's way father out, even if the acceleration of EV sales is pretty dramatic because of the size of the installed base and the useful life -- our models show the same number of commercial vehicles, the combustion engine vehicles in 10 years here in the U.S. and in the U.K., our 2 biggest markets in 10 years as today, because of the growth rate of sales, and again, on the like; but the more important point I mentioned last time is, it's less about the fuel -- the high fuel, the FLEETCOR buying electricity. I think what we're learning, particularly in Europe and in the U.K. is we're getting paid by our clients as they move to some EV. They're paying us card fees, for example, for the EV vehicle the same way. And this new opportunity of -- we're going from, call it, 150,000 gas stations in the United States to having millions of charging points at employees' homes. And so the employers look like they want us to play a role in the hardware and software and measuring of all of those new charge points and all the reimbursement. 
And so it's early days. But I'd say to you guys that doing what we do of measuring and helping pay and reimburse employee expenditures in and around vehicles, we think we're still going to get paid a fair amount of money, both in the transition to mixed fleet and even when people get over to EV. So we're going to have a little bit of a teach-in, maybe in 90 days on this subject, with the takeaway, hopefully being: A, it's way long or out there for the old combustion engine; and b, what FLEETCOR's economics may look like even in a pure EV world."

So one of the attractive things about the SMB bill pay is what you said, it's the instamatic sale and sign up and get going. In the current business that we have today, which is in the middle market, has a pretty prolonged kind of implementation cycle. It's almost like a project to get a $200 million company to connect with you and get the merchants in place and all that -- and all that kind of stuff. 
And so the first good news is that sales and revenue will be more connected to the SMB corporate pay business than they are in the middle market. And I think the point that the question you asked, the point that we make, which is a super good one, which is the missing capability, I think Napoli asked me this in the last call, I couldn't tell them, ""Hey, Ron, what are you missing to really be a gorilla here in corporate pay? And I didn't want to say the answer is killer software app that works with a little company because we have the rest of the stuff. We acquire tons of clients with our sales channels. We've got capital. We've got processing capability. We've got the merchant networks to monetize. 
So we close clients to sell thing to that will listen to us. And so unlike Rogers, I met the principals there who are kind of on the road of a super good product kind of hanging out on the road, you take their super good product and you embed it into these sets of things we have. I mean, we are -- I said it past getting remarks, that this could be kind of the biggest deal of all because, finally, we have a product that matches up with some of our capabilities. I mean, no one ever asked me before, but how funny that FLEETCOR built the corporate payments business in the middle market when the whole company was an SMB company. And so it just took us a while to pare up the corporate payments business with the business that we built over the last 20 years. 
And so the headline is, we've arrived. We have it. So I think without getting way over the [indiscernible] here that this is a super big deal, directionally, for the company over the next 3 to 5 years of just building this thing out where both walk-around plastic and payables sit inside the same client, where we stitch together effectively our fuel card business and our corporate payments business in the same client. It's not a small idea in our mind. It's a big idea."

And I'd say the second part is it does come in a couple of forms. It comes in: A, the old fashion form of just more scale. So more outbound phone callers, more field people, more digital, Google search keywords. But I'd say that the nuance that's different is we're going to make more investment kind of in digital, kind of at the top of the funnel. So we're going to spend more money to create more engagement as we have this broader product set now. 
And so having more things to sell, I think, allows us to spend some money earlier in people's decision cycle than at the end. So we tested that in Q4 last year, and it's working. And so that's some decent part of the step-up in '21, kind of a different kind of spend for us than historically."

There's kind of like a re-level set in this Q1 and then moving forward from there. So that's part of it. 
To your point, though, when the volume does come back, it's COVID-related, and that revenue does pour in, it will come in at a higher-margin level. But offsetting that are some of these incremental investments that Ron mentioned, right? We're layering in more sales and marketing for our core products. We're hiring in a lot of sales and marketing for Roger and our cross sell efforts. 
So I'd say it's going to be pretty balanced in my view as we go through the quarters of the year."

Which my guess is that I'm hoping to hear a year from today, Trevor, that's not what we do, to your point, in the next 12 months. But since those 2 decisions are in the future, we plan what we know, which is to pay down debt."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q4 earnings call. Upfront here, I'll plan to cover 4 subjects: First, I'll provide my take on our Q4 finish; second, I'll put a bow on full year 2020; third, I'll share our 2021 outlook; and lastly, provide a bit of an update on our transformation plan, which is intended to accelerate the company's growth.  
Okay. Let me turn to our Q4 results. So today, we reported revenue of $617 million, that's down 12%, and cash EPS of $3.01, that's down 5% versus last year. These results, both better than anticipated. Volume recovered a bit more in the quarter than we forecasted, and we did manage our operating expenses down 14% against the prior year. Organic revenue growth overall, minus 8%. But most importantly are the trends in Q4, really quite good sales strengthened to over 90% of last year's level. Same-store sales or client volume softness improved to minus 6%. Credit loss of $6 million, although helped by a reserve release, and retention continued steady at 92%.  
We did have a fantastic beyond highlight in Brazil in the quarter. We added 175,000 new urban or city users in Q4. That represents 30% of all the new tags we sold in the quarter. So it demonstrates there's real demand among the non-toll segment in Brazil for this RFID purchasing network, including fueling, parking and now even fast-food locations.  
So look, the conclusion of Q4 is really in the sequential trends of the business. If you look at Page 7 of our earnings supplement, you can see that every Q4 metric is improving from the Q2 low: Revenue up from $525 million to $617 million; cash EPS up $2.28 to $3.01; sales up from 55% to now over 90% of last year's level; same-store sales volume getting better from minus 17% to minus 6%; credit losses from $21 million to $6 million; and then lastly, retention holding steady at 92%. So to us, evidence that the business continues to recover from the earlier year lows.  
Okay. Over to 2020. So from a financial perspective, 2020, not our best year. Revenue finished at approximately $2.4 billion, that's down 10% versus '19, and cash EPS finishing at $11.09, down 6% against 2019. COVID and the shutdowns did manage to vanquish over $400 million of revenue that we planned in 2020 really in 3 ways. So first, client softness, we had a number of COVID-impacted clients that used less of our services. COVID reset the macro environment in Q2, driving down fuel prices and weakening international currencies. And then third, for a while, COVID reduced our 2020 new sales mostly due to the market being distracted.  
The good news is despite the fact that COVID is going on, that we're still living with COVID, is the financial impacts on us appear to be lessening. So we've now recovered in Q4 about half of the clients' softness, revenue loss that we experienced in Q2, so half of it back already. Post the macro reset, we've seen relative stability in fuel prices and FX rates. And lastly, the demand for our services, clearly recovering as sales reached 90% of prior year levels. 
So despite not having the greatest financial performance in 2020, we did manage to accomplish a few things. So credit, I'm just delighted with our credit performance in 2020. Expenses, tough times, but we did manage expenses down over 10% in Q2, 3 and 4. We signed 4 acquisitions in 2020. Our guys ran IT exceptionally well, had the best overall system uptime in the history of the company. And lastly, we were able to replan the business in the second half. We conducted a replanning exercise in the summer, and the actuals came in a smidge better than the replan. So reminds us again that fleet's a business you can plan. I really do want to give a shout-out to all FLEETCOR people who hung in there and kept the company going through very unsettling times. 
Okay. Let me make the turn to 2021 and outline our initial guidance for the year, along with the assumptions behind it. Clearly, a higher beta in our 2021 numbers. But we'd say that our setup is generally positive. So first, volume and revenue trends strengthening through 2020, so the potential to continue that into '21. Sales production improving, thus the amount we expect to get of the in-year revenue from new business. And as I mentioned a bit ago, very solid client retention and credit trends. We're also hopeful that we'll get additional client softness recovery in '21, although we're the first to admit that, that's hard to forecast. So in our guidance, we're planning to recover about 1/3 of our Q4 exit revenue softness that's still outstanding now. So if we get that, that recovery would provide about 4% to 5% of incremental revenue lift in the second half.  
So with that, our guidance for '21 would be as follows. Revenue of $2.650 billion at the midpoint, that reflects an 11% increase. Overall organic revenue in the same range, kind of 9% to 13%. But I do want to emphasize that, that assumes 3% to 4% of softness recovery from today's level. We're anticipating significant sales growth, over 30% this year, which would be a record level of sales for the company. And profit guide at the midpoint, $12.40 of cash EPS for the core business. We are planning about $0.10 of dilution from the Roger acquisition. So that would put our consolidated number at $12.30 at the midpoint. Lastly, assuming now a May 1 close for the AFEX acquisition, accretion could be approximately $0.20 for the year. So if that happens on time, that could take consolidated cash EPS to $12.50. Chuck will speak further about how the guidance rolls out across the quarters. But I do want to point out that our guidance outlooks Q2, 3 and 4, revenue and profit growth to be back into the high teens.  
Okay. Let me transition now to my last subjects, which is the company's transformation plan. So really, our transformation plan is intended to accelerate growth by doing 2 things. So first, the portfolio, deciding what businesses we want to be in and not be in and constantly reworking that to have a more diverse set of faster-growing businesses. But the second way we transform the company is through our Beyond strategy, which we do utilize in all 4 of our major existing businesses. So in this Beyond strategy, we're really trying to do 2 things. First, identify new segments of the market that we can extend the business into. So we ask who else can we serve. And then second, we identify additional or adjacent services that we can cross-sell back to the client base. So if you look at Page 11 of our earnings supplement, you'll see the current Beyond initiatives for each of our 4 businesses. 
We do continue to make progress against our Beyond strategy. Just an example to call out, in our lodging business in 2020, we now settled 25% of all proprietary hotel payments with our virtual card in which we earn interchange. So that's up from -- literally from 0 a few years ago. But today, we begin implementation of maybe our most exciting Beyond initiative of all with the acquisition of Roger. So this begins the move of our corporate payments business down market into the SMB space, along with the opportunity to offer full online bill pay to our global SMB fuel car base. You can see that on Pages 11 and 12 of our supplement.  
So this single bill pay initiative has the potential to dramatically accelerate growth rates in both our corporate pay and fuel card businesses. We feel like it's a pretty unique position that we're in because of the special set of assets that we have. So a large global SMB client base numbering in the hundreds of thousands. We've got working SMB sales channels that historically have acquired 30,000 new clients per quarter. We've got scaled virtual card processing capability. We generated over $30 billion in annualized spend last year. We've got a very large merchant database that allows us to monetize virtual card, and now we've got some modern cloud software to provide the bill pay functionality along with a pretty cool user interface.  
So look, in conclusion today, I'm hoping to provide just a few takeaways. So Q4, again, not our best quarter from an absolute perspective, but clear evidence of improving trends in the business. 2020, we did manage to perform better as the year went on and certainly learned some new tricks around how to manage credit, expenses, IT, even sales in a remote environment. '21, again, our setup, we think, looks pretty good, only a slightly unfavorable macro to deal with, but improving trends coming into the year. And certainly, the wildcard that I mentioned of what happens with the incremental softness recovery. And lastly, transformation, our Beyond strategy now progressing -- providing some traction. But today's online SMB bill pay initiative may be the biggest of them all.  
So with that, let me turn the call back over to Chuck to provide some additional details on the quarter and our outlook. Chuck?"

For the fourth quarter of 2020, we reported revenue of $617 million, down 12%, GAAP net income down 11% to $210 million and GAAP net income per diluted share down 6% to $2.44. The quarter was again affected by COVID-related business slowdowns",1534,"Thanks, Ron. For the fourth quarter of 2020, we reported revenue of $617 million, down 12%, GAAP net income down 11% to $210 million and GAAP net income per diluted share down 6% to $2.44. The quarter was again affected by COVID-related business slowdowns, although we showed improvement over last quarter in most of our businesses. Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2020 decreased 10% to $258 million, and adjusted net income per diluted share decreased 5% to $3.01. We continue to manage expenses in line with revenue performance. Please see Exhibit 1 of our press release for a reconciliation of all non-GAAP financial metrics.  
Organic revenue in the quarter was down 8% overall, primarily due to same-store sales being down 6% year-over-year. Organic revenue neutralizes the impact of year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates, fuel prices and fuel spreads and includes pro forma results for acquisitions closed mid-period. Our fuel category was down organically about 10% versus Q4 last year. Our domestic fuel businesses were stable to improving in the quarter, whereas the international fuel businesses were affected by the renewed COVID-related closures, especially in Western Europe.  
The corporate payments category was down approximately 6% in the fourth quarter. Approximately 6 points of decline was again driven by the 100 most affected customers we discussed last quarter. Lower spending on our T&E product drove another 2 points of organic drag. 
Virtual card volumes were up 12% for the quarter, which was an improvement from flat last quarter as continued political spend and the benefit of new customers offset the drag from the highly affected customers. Cross-border or FX-related volumes were down 1% as payment volumes are still being affected by lower invoice levels, specifically in manufacturing and wholesale trade. Full AP continued to perform very well with volume up 14%. New sales of full AP were very strong as full year 2020 sales were more than double 2019's results. We continue to invest here and have enabled 10 new ERP integrations in 2020 with plans for another 10 or so in 2021. 
Tolls continued to be our most resilient business and grew organically 7% in the fourth quarter, up 4% from last quarter. Active toll tags were up 6% in the quarter, with urban tags accounting for 25% of all new tags sold during 2020. The lodging category was down 25% organically in the fourth quarter, with 20 points of drag caused by the inclusion of acquired airline lodging businesses in the year ago period. Our workforce lodging business has improved with volumes down in the mid-single digits. Airline lodging volumes have also improved in line with flight activity but still remain well below last year's levels.  
Looking further down the income statement. Our total operating expenses were down 14% for the fourth quarter of 2020 to $323 million. We performed in line with the high end of our target reduction compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower volume-related costs, lower employee-related costs, including head count, sales commissions, bonuses and stock compensation. We also saw lower T&E expenses in addition to the impact of foreign exchange rates. As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses were approximately 52.4%, a roughly 240 basis point improvement from last quarter. 
Bad debt expense in the fourth quarter of 2020 was $6 million or 2 basis points, which includes a reserve release of $5 million. Bad debt was only 4 basis points, excluding the reserve release. Our bad debt levels continue to be good, and our aging roll rates remain very favorable. There is still uncertainty around the timing, level and duration of government stimulus and various responses to increasing COVID cases around the world. So that's still a consideration on our reserve.  
Interest expense decreased 13% to $30.3 million, driven primarily by decreases in LIBOR related to the unhedged portion of our debt. This was partially offset by the impact of additional borrowing for share buybacks earlier in the year. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 20.3% with a reduction from last year driven primarily by incremental excess tax benefit on stock option exercises. 
Now turning to the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2020, we have approximately $1.9 billion of total liquidity, consisting of available cash on the balance sheet and our undrawn revolver at quarter end. We ended the quarter just shy of $1.5 billion in total cash, of which approximately $542 million is restricted and consists primarily of customer deposits. We had $3.6 billion outstanding on our credit facilities and $700 million borrowed in our securitization facility. We remain committed to a consistent program of capital allocation, using our free cash flow for acquisitions and buybacks. 
In the quarter, we repurchased roughly 181,000 shares in connection with employee sales. In total for 2020, we spent $850 million on share buybacks. We believe that we have ample liquidity to pursue any near-term M&A opportunities while still opportunistically buying back shares when it makes sense. For the quarter, we had approximately $23.4 million of capital expenditures, and we finished with a leverage ratio of 2.67x trailing 12-month EBITDA as of December 31.  
Now let me share some thoughts on our outlook. Looking ahead, we're expecting Q1 2020 adjusted net income per share to be between $2.60 and $2.80, which at the midpoint is approximately $0.31 or 10% lower than what we reported in Q4 of 2020. About half of the difference is attributable to revenue seasonality. You see, while some of our businesses, like gift, have seasonally strong fourth quarters, most of our businesses have seasonally weak first quarters. Of course, volume-related expenses will slightly offset this revenue seasonality impact. 
Roughly 1/3 of the difference is due to the normalization of certain expenses. For example, in Q4 of 2020, we released $5 million of our bad debt reserve, which we do not expect to repeat in Q1. As sales performance has continued to recover throughout 2020, we expect bad debt to gradually increase sequentially as those customers' balances age. Additionally, when the impact of the COVID-related shutdowns became clearer in 2020, we proactively reduced our annual incentive target payouts by 50% and accrued to those lower targets for the remainder of the year. As our business has recovered meaningfully, we plan to return incentive targets to 2021 to normal levels.  We also expect our effective tax rate in Q1 of 2021 to be about 80 to 100 basis points higher than the rate we reported in Q4 of 2020. Lastly, the acquisition of Roger and incremental sales and marketing investments are slightly dilutive to the quarter sequentially.  
Now looking beyond Q1 to full year 2021, we feel it's important to help you understand how we're thinking about the outlook and providing some ranges around possible outcomes, even though those ranges are a bit wider than what they had been in the past. For 2021, we're guiding revenues to be between $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion and adjusted net income per diluted share to be between $11.90 and $12.70, inclusive of the Roger acquisition. We're still faced with substantial uncertainty regarding the pace of economic recovery and the impact it will have on our financial performance. That said, we've developed a 2021 budget which incorporates everything we know now, including revenue and expense run rates, current macro environmental factors, planned sales contributions and expected attrition impacts. In addition, our guidance assumes a continued rollout of the vaccines that will allow gradual volume and revenue improvement in the first half of the year with an acceleration in the back half of the year, as client softness and new sales performance improve sequentially. 
As I mentioned earlier, we expect several expense lines to normalize higher in 2021 compared with 2020. As our business recovers, stock and bonus accruals as well as sales commission expenses will be higher. T&E will rise as our salespeople get back on the road, and volume-related expenses will also rise with increased business activity. Bad debt expense is expected to normalize as we've reopened credit and our sales performance continues to improve. We're also making incremental investments in sales, marketing and IT to support our growth aspirations and to deliver a 2021 sales production plan that's more than 30% higher than 2020's results. 
We're extremely excited with the Roger acquisition, and a disproportionate share of our incremental sales and marketing investments will be directed towards that business. As such, the fully loaded acquisition will be an estimated $0.10 drag to adjusted net income per diluted share in 2021. As we've demonstrated time and again, we do take a balanced approach on expenses, and we'll adjust accordingly if we see revenues begin to deviate from our expectations. 
And lastly, we continue to work through the approvals on AFEX, which have been slowed by Brexit and virus-related shutdowns. While we still expect the deal to be accretive in 2021, we now believe it is more likely to close in Q2 versus our original expectation of Q1. And just for clarity, AFEX is not included in the guidance ranges I provided earlier.  
And now, operator, we'd like to open the line for questions."

In terms of the contribution for next year, I'd say we haven't fully modeled it yet. But it's probably going to be still a little dilutive to kind of flat until we fully scale the channels. So we want to obviously see what works before we pour too much in. But nonetheless, I'd say that the things about -- it is a very small acquisition, $1 million-some-odd, a couple of million in terms of revenue. So it's got a long way to go, but we're pouring a lot of sales and marketing kind of upfront to get it going. 
It's a real bet for us. It was a real deal. We're investing to retain the people that are there because they've helped to build this product, and we're going to need their help to continue. So we've built some extra cost in there as well. So in terms of the magnitude of what it could be next year, it's really going to depend on how much more we pour into the investments."

Clearly, corporate pay would be one, and toll would be 2 because of the size of the business, but it's still 40%, 50% of the company. 
In lodging, the one thing I would say is, remember, our FLEETCOR lodging business is workforce: Translation, blue-collar utility guys going to a new city, tree cutters cleaning up. And so that thing is way back. I mean, I looked at the January volume numbers earlier today, and I believe month-to-month, that thing is down 3% to 5% now year-over-year. And so that lodging business looks completely different than the kind of lodging business we people on this call are thinking about. 
So the airline part of that is a completely different call. To your point, that thing is running kind of 50% of volumes of a year ago. But that's the one, I'd say, has the snap, bounce back possibility. So we've cut -- took a ton of money out of that business, particularly out of the airline portion of the business, to kind of wait here to see if it's going to snap back. But it would be number three, but we still like it. I think we lay out on that Page 11, there's a couple of interesting verticals beyond workforce and beyond airline that we're looking at that we like a lot, that leverage everything we have, the systems, the network and stuff. 
So I want to be clear, we like that business, and we will keep investing. And we may buy some additional things in the business. Let me be clear: It's not white-collar T&E kind of a lodging business."

And I think Chuck even mentioned the forward roll rates, so we've got the, I think, the lowest credit loss, as low as I can remember, and certainly as the base is against spend. And so we rotated back. 
I'd say in the fuel card business, we are 100% back. So whatever credit policies we had pre-COVID, I'd say, if you look at our fuel card businesses, we are right back to fully open, still balanced, but fully open.  
I'd say the one place where we're still being a little cautious is in the corporate pay. And the reason is the spend per client there is so significant, if you think about it. And so we're still being careful. There's certain industries sitting in the corporate pay space that have been pretty impacted. So I'd say we've moved that one back but still not all the way back because it's more high line, what we call internally, high-line risk of a couple of BKs for some significant amount of money. So I think there's still upside as we roll through '21, as those 3 or 4 industries we're cautious on kind of come back."

And so fortunately, kind of 80% of that business is kind of okay. It's buying fuels. It's buying supplies. It's paying vendors. And so it's not going to decline, if you will. It's not going to drag down really the growth rate as much because it shrunk down in 2020. So fortunately, it will have less impact on the total corporate pay business this year."

So we've kept the capital plan kind of up a bit, $15 million, $20 million, Chuck, I think, over the prior year. And then second, we made a decision, Pete, to pour more money into, what we call, IT transformation or modernization, whatever the word is. So we're pretty hard on the trail of consolidating some of the apps, updating obviously some of the hardware and software and stuff. And so we're pouring money into simplifying kind of our technology footprint, while we're obviously still making investments in digital and things like Roger, new analytics packages, new mobile interfaces. So we're spending money on things that we should be but also on the transformation side."

I mean, I think, Pete, a bit, I think we've been on for all kinds of reasons, not only EV but just TAM and growth rate and long-term potential of the company of diversifying things that we do that share the same model. And so I don't know where we're at, 60% now, I guess. So we're moving anyway. But I said a little bit in the call the last time on the EV thing that our perspective on the thing is: a, it's way farther out, even if the acceleration of EV sales is pretty dramatic because of the size of the installed base and the useful life. Our models show the same number of commercial vehicles, the combustion engine vehicles in 10 years here in the U.S. and in the U.K., our 2 biggest markets in 10 years as today because of the growth rate of sales and again over the life. 
But the more important point I mentioned last time is, it's less about the fuel card buying fuel or the fleet card buying electricity. I think what we're learning, particularly in Europe and in the U.K., is we're getting paid by our clients as they move to some EV. They're paying us card fees, for example, for the EV vehicle the same way. And there's this new opportunity of, we're going from, call it, 150,000 gas stations in the United States to having millions of charging points at employees' homes. And so the employers look like they want us to play a role in the hardware and software and the measuring of all of those new charge points and all the reimbursement. 
And so it's early days. But I'd say to you guys that doing what we do of measuring and helping pay and reimburse employee expenditures in and around vehicles, we think we're still going to get paid a fair amount of money both in the transition to mixed fleet and even when people get over to EV. So we're going to have a little bit of a teach-in maybe in 90 days on this subject, with the takeaway hopefully being: a, it's way long or out there for the old combustion engine; and b, what FLEETCOR's economics may look like even in a pure EV world."

My question was on the sales front, pretty good acceleration there, going back to 92%. You called out full AP sales doubled. I was wondering if you can also talk about the sales growth in other segments. And also, as we think about next year on a 30% -- expectation for a 30% higher sales compared to this year, areas where we can see more strength. I guess SMB bill pay will definitely be one of the areas, but any incremental color will be helpful."

So they were well up -- well above, call it, 15-or-so-percent above last year. There's still a couple of the businesses that are lagging a bit. And particularly, our North America fuel business is still catching up. It's on an upward swing, but it just hasn't recovered quite as quickly. Our lodging business has actually come in kind of right around last year. So that's performed okay. 
So it's mixed, I'd say. But nonetheless, they've all kind of come back from Q2 through Q3 and exiting Q4 at a better place. And looking forward to next year, we've got pretty robust ambitions and plans. We're going to have the -- we have the biggest sales plan in the company's history, and we're planning to be up 30% versus where we finished this year. So we've got a lot to do.

And then, b, of course, we're going to invest more, more FTEs, more digital spend. We've got some new products that we've talked about. So we're super excited. I mean, first of all, we've got super soft comps in Q2 when sales almost closed down. 
And so to Chuck's point, this is a super big deal for '22. I know most people on the call are interested in this year, in '21. But my headline to you guys is that if we make the sales plan, which is super big, both against the prior year and absolute, it's -- that will pour all kinds of revenue into '22, which is part of the softness that we're dealing with here in '21, right, that we basically took a quarter and half out of selling. And so you don't get the same wave of revenue rolling into the forward year. So I just don't want people to miss the importance of the sales plan for next year."

And so we're investing ahead of that. And I think that's also putting a little pressure on our forward guidance in terms of earnings, right? Because we're making sales investments again in a big way. So I think we should be mindful of that."

You obviously have a very warm lead, which positions you much better. But can you just talk about how long are those sales cycles, implementation times? And how do you plan to leverage your existing sales force and the warm leads that you have to maybe accelerate and double down on that opportunity?"

Ashish, another super good question. So one of the attractive things about the SMB bill pay is what you said, it's the -- its thematic sale and sign up and get going in the current business that we have today, which is in the middle market, it has a pretty prolonged kind of implementation cycle. It's almost like a project to get a $200 million company to connect with you and get the merchants in place and all that kind of stuff. And so the first good news is that sales and revenue will be more connected in the SMB corporate pay business than they are in the middle market. 
And I think the point that -- the question you asked, the point that we make is a super good one, which is the missing capability, I think Napoli asked me this in the last call, but I couldn't tell them, ""Hey, Ron, what are you missing to really be a gorilla here in corporate pay?"" And I didn't want to say, the answer is an SMB killer software app that works for the little company because we have the rest of the stuff. We acquire tons of clients with our sales channels. We've got capital. We've got processing capability. We've got the merchant networks to monetize. So we -- obviously, clients, to sell, they do listen to us. 
And so unlike Roger, when I met the principals there who were kind of on the road with a super good product kind of hanging out on their own, you take their super good product and you embed it into these sets of things we have. I mean, we are -- I said it, half kiddingly, remarks that this could be kind of the biggest deal of all because finally, we have a product that matches up with some of our capabilities. I mean, no one ever asked me before, but how funny that FLEETCOR built the corporate payments business in the middle market when the whole company was an SMB company. And so it just took us a while to pair up the corporate payments business with the business that we built over the last 20 years. 
And so the headline is, we've arrived. We have it. So I think without getting way over the skis here that this is a super big deal directionally for the company over the next 3 to 5 years of just building this thing out, where both walk-around plastic and payables sit inside the same client, where we stitch together effectively our fuel card business and our corporate payments business in the same client. It's not a small idea in our mind. It's a big idea."

And I'd say the second part is it does come in a couple of forms. It comes in: a, the old fashion form of just more scale, so more outbound phone callers, more field people, more digital, Google search keywords. But I'd say that the nuance that's different is we're going to make more investments kind of in digital, kind of at the top of the funnel. So we're going to spend more money to create more engagement as we have this broader product set now. And so having more things to sell, I think, allows us to spend some money earlier in people's decision cycle than at the end. So we tested that in Q4 last year, and it's working. And so that's some decent part of the step-up in '21, kind of a different kind of spend, Bob, for us than historically."

There's kind of like a relevel set in this Q1 and then moving forward from there. So that's part of it.  
To your point, though, when the volume does come back that's COVID-related and that revenue does pour in, it will come in at a higher margin level. But offsetting that are some of these incremental investments that Ron mentioned, right? We're layering in more sales and marketing for our core products.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q4 earnings call. Upfront here, I'll plan to cover 4 subjects: First, I'll provide my take on our Q4 finish; second, I'll put a bow on full year 2020; third, I'll share our 2021 outlook; and lastly, provide a bit of an update on our transformation plan, which is intended to accelerate the company's growth. 
Okay. Let me turn to our Q4 results. So today, we reported revenue of $617 million, that's down 12%, and cash EPS of $3.01, that's down 5% versus last year. These results, both better than anticipated. Volume recovered a bit more in the quarter than we forecasted, and we did manage our operating expenses down 14% against the prior year. Organic revenue growth overall, minus 8%. But most importantly are the trends in Q4, really quite good sales strengthened to over 90% of last year's level. Same-store sales or client volume softness improved to minus 6%. Credit loss of $6 million, although helped by a reserve release, and retention continued steady at 92%. 
We did have a fantastic beyond highlight in Brazil in the quarter. We added 175,000 new urban or city users in Q4. That represents 30% of all the new tags we sold in the quarter. So it demonstrates there's real demand among the non-toll segment in Brazil for this RFID purchasing network, including fueling, parking and now even fast-food locations. 
So look, the conclusion of Q4 is really in the sequential trends of the business. If you look at Page 7 of our earnings supplement, you can see that every Q4 metric is improving from the Q2 low: Revenue up from $525 million to $617 million; cash EPS up $2.28 to $3.01; sales up from 55% to now over 90% of last year's level; same-store sales volume getting better from minus 17% to minus 6%; credit losses from $21 million to $6 million; and then lastly, retention holding steady at 92%. So to us, evidence that the business continues to recover from the earlier year lows. 
Okay. Over to 2020. So from a financial perspective, 2020, not our best year. Revenue finished at approximately $2.4 billion, that's down 10% versus '19, and cash EPS finishing at $11.09, down 6% against 2019. 
COVID and the shutdowns did manage to vanquish over $400 million of revenue that we planned in 2020 really in 3 ways. So first, client softness, we had a number of COVID-impacted clients that used less of our services. COVID reset the macro environment in Q2, driving down fuel prices and weakening international currencies. And then third, for a while, COVID reduced our 2020 new sales mostly due to the market being distracted. 
The good news is despite the fact that COVID is going on, that we're still living with COVID, is the financial impacts on us appear to be lessening. So we've now recovered in Q4 about half of the client softness, revenue loss that we experienced in Q2, so half of it back already. Post the macro reset, we've seen relative stability in fuel prices and FX rates. And lastly, the demand for our services, clearly recovering as sales reach 90% of prior year levels. 
So despite not having the greatest financial performance in 2020, we did manage to accomplish a few things. So credit, I'm just delighted with our credit performance in 2020. Expenses, tough times, but we did manage expenses down over 10% in Q2, 3 and 4. We signed 4 acquisitions in 2020. Our guys ran IT exceptionally well, had the best overall system uptime in the history of the company. 
And lastly, we were able to replan the business in the second half. We conducted a replanning exercise in the summer, and the actuals came in a smidge better than the replan. So reminds us again that fleet's a business you can plan. I really do want to give a shout-out to all FLEETCOR people who hung in there and kept the company going through very unsettling times. 
Okay. Let me make the turn to 2021 and outline our initial guidance for the year, along with the assumptions behind it. Clearly, a higher beta in our 2021 numbers. But we'd say that our setup is generally positive. So first, volume and revenue trends strengthening through 2020, so the potential to continue that into '21. Sales production improving, thus the amount we expect to get of the in-year revenue from new business. And as I mentioned a bit ago, very solid client retention and credit trends. 
We're also hopeful that we'll get additional client softness recovery in '21, although we're the first to admit that, that's hard to forecast. So in our guidance, we're planning to recover about 1/3 of our Q4 exit revenue softness that's still outstanding now. So if we get that, that recovery would provide about 4% to 5% of incremental revenue lift in the second half. 
So with that, our guidance for '21 would be as follows. Revenue of $2.650 billion at the midpoint, that reflects an 11% increase. Overall organic revenue in the same range, kind of 9% to 13%. But I do want to emphasize that, that assumes 3% to 4% of softness recovery from today's level. We're anticipating significant sales growth, over 30% this year, which would be a record level of sales for the company. And profit guide at the midpoint, $12.40 of cash EPS for the core business. We are planning about $0.10 of dilution from the Roger acquisition. So that would put our consolidated number at $12.30 at the midpoint. Lastly, assuming now a May 1 close for the AFEX acquisition, accretion could be approximately $0.20 for the year. So if that happens on time, that could take consolidated cash EPS to $12.50. Chuck will speak further about how the guidance rolls out across the quarters. But I do want to point out that our guidance outlooks Q2, 3 and 4, revenue and profit growth to be back into the high teens. 
Okay. Let me transition now to my last subjects, which is the company's transformation plan. So really, our transformation plan is intended to accelerate growth by doing 2 things. So first, the portfolio, deciding what businesses we want to be in and not be in and constantly reworking that to have a more diverse set of faster-growing businesses. But the second way we transform the company is through our Beyond strategy, which we do utilize in all 4 of our major existing businesses. So in this Beyond strategy, we're really trying to do 2 things. First, identify new segments of the market that we can extend the business into. So we ask who else can we serve. 
And then second, we identify additional or adjacent services that we can cross-sell back to the client base. So if you look at Page 11 of our earnings supplement, you'll see the current Beyond initiatives for each of our 4 businesses. 
We do continue to make progress against our Beyond strategy. Just an example to call out, in our lodging business in 2020, we now settled 25% of all proprietary hotel payments with our virtual card in which we earn interchange. So that's up from -- literally from 0 a few years ago. But today, we begin implementation of maybe our most exciting Beyond initiative of all with the acquisition of Roger. So this begins the move of our corporate payments business down market into the SMB space, along with the opportunity to offer full online bill pay to our global SMB fuel car base. You can see that on Pages 11 and 12 of our supplement. 
So this single bill pay initiative has the potential to dramatically accelerate growth rates in both our corporate pay and fuel card businesses. We feel like it's a pretty unique position that we're in because of the special set of assets that we have. So a large global SMB client base numbering in the hundreds of thousands. We've got working SMB sales channels that historically have acquired 30,000 new clients per quarter. We've got scaled virtual card processing capability. We generated over $30 billion in annualized spend last year. We've got a very large merchant database that allows us to monetize virtual card, and now we've got some modern cloud software to provide the bill pay functionality along with a pretty cool user interface. 
So look, in conclusion today, I'm hoping to provide just a few takeaways. So Q4, again, not our best quarter from an absolute perspective, but clear evidence of improving trends in the business. 2020, we did manage to perform better as the year went on and certainly learned some new tricks around how to manage credit, expenses, IT, even sales in a remote environment. '21, again, our setup, we think, looks pretty good, only a slightly unfavorable macro to deal with, but improving trends coming into the year. And certainly, the wildcard that I mentioned of what happens with the incremental softness recovery. And lastly, transformation, our Beyond strategy now progressing -- providing some traction. But today's online SMB bill pay initiative may be the biggest of them all. 
So with that, let me turn the call back over to Chuck to provide some additional details on the quarter and our outlook. Chuck?"

For the fourth quarter of 2020, we reported revenue of $617 million, down 12%, GAAP net income down 11% to $210 million and GAAP net income per diluted share down 6% to $2.44. The quarter was again affected by COVID-related business slowdowns",1532,"Thanks, Ron. For the fourth quarter of 2020, we reported revenue of $617 million, down 12%, GAAP net income down 11% to $210 million and GAAP net income per diluted share down 6% to $2.44. The quarter was again affected by COVID-related business slowdowns, although we showed improvement over last quarter in most of our businesses. Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2020 decreased 10% to $258 million, and adjusted net income per diluted share decreased 5% to $3.01. We continue to manage expenses in line with revenue performance. Please see Exhibit 1 of our press release for a reconciliation of all non-GAAP financial metrics. 
Organic revenue in the quarter was down 8% overall, primarily due to same-store sales being down 6% year-over-year. Organic revenue neutralizes the impact of year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates, fuel prices and fuel spreads and includes pro forma results for acquisitions closed mid-period. Our fuel category was down organically about 10% versus Q4 last year. Our domestic fuel businesses were stable to improving in the quarter, whereas the international fuel businesses were affected by the renewed COVID-related closures, especially in Western Europe. 
The corporate payments category was down approximately 6% in the fourth quarter. Approximately 6 points of decline was again driven by the 100 most affected customers we discussed last quarter. Lower spending on our T&E product drove another 2 points of organic drag. 
Virtual card volumes were up 12% for the quarter, which was an improvement from flat last quarter as continued political spend and the benefit of new customers offset the drag from the highly affected customers. Cross-border or FX-related volumes were down 1% as payment volumes are still being affected by lower invoice levels, specifically in manufacturing and wholesale trade. Full AP continued to perform very well with volume up 14%. New sales of full AP were very strong as full year 2020 sales were more than double 2019's results. We continue to invest here and have enabled 10 new ERP integrations in 2020 with plans for another 10 or so in 2021. 
Tolls continued to be our most resilient business and grew organically 7% in the fourth quarter, up 4% from last quarter. Active toll tags were up 6% in the quarter, with urban tags accounting for 25% of all new tags sold during 2020. The lodging category was down 25% organically in the fourth quarter, with 20 points of drag caused by the inclusion of acquired airline lodging businesses in the year ago period. Our workforce lodging business has improved with volumes down in the mid-single digits. Airline lodging volumes have also improved in line with flight activity but still remain well below last year's levels. 
Looking further down the income statement. Our total operating expenses were down 14% for the fourth quarter of 2020 to $323 million. We performed in line with the high end of our target reduction compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower volume-related costs, lower employee-related costs, including head count, sales commissions, bonuses and stock compensation. We also saw lower T&E expenses in addition to the impact of foreign exchange rates. As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses were approximately 52.4%, a roughly 240-basis-point improvement from last quarter. 
Bad debt expense in the fourth quarter of 2020 was $6 million or 2 basis points, which includes a reserve release of $5 million. Bad debt was only 4 basis points, excluding the reserve release. Our bad debt levels continue to be good, and our aging roll rates remain very favorable. There is still uncertainty around the timing, level and duration of government stimulus and various responses to increasing COVID cases around the world. So that's still a consideration on our reserve. 
Interest expense decreased 13% to $30.3 million, driven primarily by decreases in LIBOR related to the unhedged portion of our debt. This was partially offset by the impact of additional borrowing for share buybacks earlier in the year. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 20.3% with a reduction from last year driven primarily by incremental excess tax benefit on stock option exercises. 
Now turning to the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2020, we have approximately $1.9 billion of total liquidity, consisting of available cash on the balance sheet and our undrawn revolver at quarter end. We ended the quarter just shy of $1.5 billion in total cash, of which approximately $542 million is restricted and consists primarily of customer deposits. We had $3.6 billion outstanding on our credit facilities and $700 million borrowed in our securitization facility. We remain committed to a consistent program of capital allocation, using our free cash flow for acquisitions and buybacks. 
In the quarter, we repurchased roughly 181,000 shares in connection with employee sales. In total for 2020, we spent $850 million on share buybacks. We believe that we have ample liquidity to pursue any near-term M&A opportunities while still opportunistically buying back shares when it makes sense. For the quarter, we had approximately $23.4 million of capital expenditures, and we finished with a leverage ratio of 2.67x trailing 12-month EBITDA as of December 31. 
Now let me share some thoughts on our outlook. Looking ahead, we're expecting Q1 2020 adjusted net income per share to be between $2.60 and $2.80, which, at the midpoint, is approximately $0.31 or 10% lower than what we reported in Q4 of 2020. About half of the difference is attributable to revenue seasonality. You see, while some of our businesses like gift have seasonally strong fourth quarters, most of our businesses have seasonally weak first quarters. Of course, volume-related expenses will slightly offset this revenue seasonality impact. 
Roughly 1/3 of the difference is due to the normalization of certain expenses. For example, in Q4 of 2020, we released $5 million of our bad debt reserve, which we do not expect to repeat in Q1. As sales performance has continued to recover throughout 2020, we expect bad debt to gradually increase sequentially as those customers' balances age. Additionally, when the impact of the COVID-related shutdowns became clearer in 2020, we proactively reduced our annual incentive target payouts by 50% and accrued to those lower targets for the remainder of the year. As our business has recovered meaningfully, we plan to return incentive targets to 2021 to normal levels. We also expect our effective tax rate in Q1 of 2021 to be about 80 to 100 basis points higher than the rate we reported in Q4 of 2020. Lastly, the acquisition of Roger and incremental sales and marketing investments are slightly dilutive to the quarter sequentially. 
Now looking beyond Q1 to full year 2021, we feel it's important to help you understand how we're thinking about the outlook and providing some ranges around possible outcomes, even though those ranges are a bit wider than what they had been in the past. For 2021, we're guiding revenues to be between $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion and adjusted net income per diluted share to be between $11.90 and $12.70, inclusive of the Roger acquisition. We're still faced with substantial uncertainty regarding the pace of economic recovery and the impact it will have on our financial performance. That said, we've developed a 2021 budget which incorporates everything we know now, including revenue and expense run rates, current macro environmental factors, planned sales contributions and expected attrition impacts. In addition, our guidance assumes a continued rollout of the vaccines that will allow gradual volume and revenue improvement in the first half of the year with an acceleration in the back half of the year, as client softness and new sales performance improve sequentially. 
As I mentioned earlier, we expect several expense lines to normalize higher in 2021 compared with 2020. As our business recovers, stock and bonus accruals as well as sales commission expenses will be higher. T&E will rise as our salespeople get back on the road, and volume-related expenses will also rise with increased business activity. Bad debt expense is expected to normalize as we've reopened credit and our sales performance continues to improve. We're also making incremental investments in sales, marketing and IT to support our growth aspirations and to deliver a 2021 sales production plan that's more than 30% higher than 2020's results. 
We're extremely excited with the Roger acquisition, and a disproportionate share of our incremental sales and marketing investments will be directed towards that business. As such, the fully loaded acquisition will be an estimated $0.10 drag to adjusted net income per diluted share in 2021. As we've demonstrated time and again, we do take a balanced approach on expenses, and we'll adjust accordingly if we see revenues begin to deviate from our expectations. 
And lastly, we continue to work through the approvals on AFEX, which have been slowed by Brexit and virus-related shutdowns. While we still expect the deal to be accretive in 2021, we now believe it is more likely to close in Q2 versus our original expectation of Q1. And just for clarity, AFEX is not included in the guidance ranges I provided earlier. 
And now, operator, we'd like to open the line for questions."

On the downside, I mean, who knows what's going to happen with COVID, right? So if things weren't to come back, it could be a problem. We just think -- we think that we're being reasonably optimistic in that regard given everything that the news says: The economy, the vaccines, the Biden administration mentioning things will be back in by Q3.

But nonetheless, I'd say that the things about -- it is a very small acquisition, $1 million-some-odd, a couple of million in terms of revenue.

But that's the one, I'd say, has the snap, bounce back possibility. So we've cut -- took a ton of money out of that business, particularly out of the airline portion of the business, to kind of wait here to see if it's going to snap back. But it would be number three, but we still like it. I think we lay out on that Page 11, there's a couple of interesting verticals beyond workforce and beyond airline that we're looking at that we like a lot, that leverage everything we have, the systems, the network and stuff. 
So I want to be clear, we like that business, and we will keep investing. And we may buy some additional things in the business. Let me be clear: It's not white-collar T&E kind of a lodging business."

The dollars spent on fuel are massive. 
And so the bit of the delay was not only COVID, but our guys tinkered and came up with 2 or 3 different hardware-software configurations for the fueling locations that improve reliability like super high. So the car gets in, the thing knows it's the right car and doesn't make mistakes and to dramatically reduce the cost. And so that business is going to be on a super-duper, hurry-up drill even now, even in the first half of the year, trying to add stations across the board. So we should see those transaction counts, usage of the thing, grow a lot as we move into the second half."

So when the thing happened, we kind of pulled pretty far back, which clearly reduced revenue. We even pulled back on existing accounts, right, trimming lines, accelerating payment terms and stuff. So we went at it pretty hard. And now we've reported out for the year. And I think Chuck even mentioned the forward roll rates, so we've got the, I think, the lowest credit loss, as low as I can remember, and certainly as the base is against spend. And so we rotated back. 
I'd say in the fuel card business, we are 100% back. So whatever credit policies we had pre-COVID, I'd say, if you went and looked at our fuel card businesses, we are right back to fully open, still balanced, but fully open. 
I'd say the one place where we're still being a little cautious is in the corporate pay. And the reason is the spend per client there is so significant, if you think about it. And so we're still being careful. There's certain industries sitting in the corporate pay space that have been pretty impacted. So I'd say we've moved that one back but still not all the way back because it's more high line, what we call internally, high-line risk of a couple of BKs for some significant amount of money. So I think there's still upside as we roll through '21, as those 3 or 4 industries were cautious on kind of come back."

So if you take the entire line of business sitting in our plans, we're out looking at high teens for that. I think inside of that, the T&E, which has now shrunk down, is probably in the mid- to high single digits. And if you remember, what we call kind of the multicard, kind of walk around plastics there that buy supplies, even fuel, and they're even used as P-Cards as a form of vendor payables, that line of business, that plastics or multicard, I think the last time I looked, is down to about 20% of it now being white-collar T&E, like us. 
And so fortunately, kind of 80% of that business is kind of okay. It's buying fuels. It's buying supplies. It's paying vendors. And so it's not going to decline, if you will. It's not going to drag down really the growth rate as much because it shrunk down in 2020. So fortunately, it will have less impact on the total corporate pay business this year."

So surprisingly, that business is getting healthier from some of those digital initiatives.

I mean, I think, Pete, a bit, I think we've been on for all kinds of reasons, not only EV but just TAM and growth rate and long-term potential of the company of diversifying things that we do that share the same model. And so I don't know where we're at, 60% now, I guess. So we're moving anyway. But I said a little bit in the call the last time on the EV thing that our perspective on the thing is: a, it's way farther out, even if the acceleration of EV sales is pretty dramatic because of the size of the installed base and the useful life. Our models show the same number of commercial vehicles, the combustion engine vehicles in 10 years here in the U.S. and in the U.K., our 2 biggest markets in 10 years as today because of the growth rate of sales and again over the life. 
But the more important point I mentioned last time is, it's less about the fuel card buying fuel or the fleet card buying electricity. I think what we're learning, particularly in Europe and in the U.K., is we're getting paid by our clients as they move to some EV. They're paying us card fees, for example, for the EV vehicle the same way. And there's this new opportunity of, we're going from, call it, 150,000 gas stations in the United States to having millions of charging points at employees' homes. And so the employers look like they want us to play a role in the hardware and software and the measuring of all of those new charge points and all the reimbursement. 
And so it's early days. But I'd say to you guys that doing what we do of measuring and helping pay and reimburse employee expenditures in and around vehicles, we think we're still going to get paid a fair amount of money both in the transition to mixed fleet and even when people get over to EV. So we're going to have a little bit of a teach-in maybe in 90 days on this subject, with the takeaway hopefully being: a, it's way long or out there for the old combustion engine; and b, what FLEETCOR's economics may look like even in a pure EV world."

And particularly, our North America fuel business is still catching up. It's on an upward swing, but it just hasn't recovered quite as quickly. Our lodging business has actually come in kind of right around last year. So that's performed okay. 
So it's mixed, I'd say. But nonetheless, they've all kind of come back from Q2 through Q3 and exiting Q4 at a better place.

And so to Chuck's point, this is a super big deal for '22. I know most people on the call are interested in this year, in '21. But my headline to you guys is that if we make the sales plan, which is super big, both against the prior year and absolute, it's -- that will pour all kinds of revenue into '22, which is part of the softness that we're dealing with here in '21, right, that we basically took a 1.5 quarters out of selling.

So one of the attractive things about the SMB bill pay is what you said, it's the instamatic sale and sign up and get going. The card business that we have today, which is in the middle market, has a pretty prolonged kind of implementation cycle. It's almost like a project to get a $200 million company to connect with you and get the merchants in place and all that kind of stuff. And so the first good news is that sales and revenue will be more connected in the SMB corporate pay business than they are in the middle market. 
And I think the point that -- the question you asked, the point that we make is a super good one, which is the missing capability, I think Napoli asked me this in the last call, but I couldn't tell them, ""Hey, Ron, what are you missing to really be a gorilla here in corporate pay?"" And I didn't want to say, the answer is an SMB killer software app that works for the little company because we have the rest of the stuff. We acquire tons of clients with our sales channels. We've got capital. We've got processing capability. We've got the merchant networks to monetize. So we -- obviously, clients, the sell-up they do, they'll listen to us. 
And so unlike Roger, when I met the principals there who were kind of on the road with a super good product kind of hanging out on their own, you take their super good product and you embed it into these sets of things we have. I mean, we are -- I said it, half kiddingly in the remarks that this could be kind of the biggest deal of all because finally, we have a product that matches up with some of our capabilities. I mean, no one ever asked me before, but how funny that FLEETCOR built the corporate payments business in the middle market when the whole company was an SMB company. And so it just took us a while to pair up the corporate payments business with the business that we built over the last 20 years. 
And so the headline is, we've arrived. We have it. So I think without getting way over the skis here that this is a super big deal directionally for the company over the next 3 to 5 years of just building this thing out, where both walk-around plastic and payables sit inside the same client, where we stitch together effectively our fuel card business and our corporate payments business in the same client. It's not a small idea in our mind. It's a big idea."

But I'd say that the nuance that's different is we're going to make more investments kind of in digital, kind of at the top of the funnel. So we're going to spend more money to create more engagement as we have this broader product set now. And so having more things to sell, I think, allows us to spend some money earlier in people's decision cycle than at the end. So we tested that in Q4 last year, and it's working.

There's kind of like a re-level-set in this Q1 and then moving forward from there. So that's part of it. 
To your point, though, when the volume does come back that's COVID-related and that revenue does pour in, it will come in at a higher margin level. But offsetting that are some of these incremental investments that Ron mentioned, right? We're layering in more sales and marketing for our core products. We're hiring in a lot of sales and marketing for Roger and our cross-sell efforts. So I'd say it's going to be pretty balanced in my view as we go through the quarters of the year."

It is only then that you can get in the line for questions. Please note that our earnings release and supplement can be found under the Investor Relations section of our website at fleetcor.com. 
Now throughout this call, we will be presenting non-GAAP financial information, including adjusted revenues, adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share. This information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than non-GAAP information at other companies. Reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP information appears in today's press release and on our website as previously described. 
I do need to remind everybody that part of our discussion today may include forward-looking statements. These statements reflect the best information as of today. All statements about our recovery, outlook, new products and acquisitions and expectations regarding business development and future acquisitions are based on that information. They are not guarantees of future performance and you should not put undue reliance upon them. We do not undertake any obligation to update any of these statements. 
These expected results are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, which could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release on Form 8-K and on our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents are available on our website and at sec.gov. 
Before we begin, I would like to make you aware that over the last few weeks, we posted 2 short videos to the Investor Relations website. The first is around our approach and strategy for electric vehicles as discussed by Alan King, who is the head of the U.K. Europe and ANZ for fuel and heading up that effort for us. The second is a video providing some insight into our downmarket full AP product so you can get a feel for what it is and how it works. We had mentioned that we would likely spend some more time on these topics in the future, and this is an interim step while we continue to work on those efforts. 
So now with that out of the way, I will turn the call over to Ron Clarke, our Chairman and CEO. Ron?"

Hi, everyone, and thanks for joining our first quarter 2021 earnings call. So upfront here, 3 subjects: first, my view of Q1 results; second, I'll share our rest of year outlook; and then third, talk a bit about how we're positioned for",1242,"Okay. Jim, thanks. Hi, everyone, and thanks for joining our first quarter 2021 earnings call. So upfront here, 3 subjects: first, my view of Q1 results; second, I'll share our rest of year outlook; and then third, talk a bit about how we're positioned for growth over the midterm. 
Okay, let me turn to Q1 results. So we reported Q1 revenue of $609 million, really kind of spot on our expectations. Reported cash EPS of $2.82. That's a bit better than our guide mostly helped by lower credit losses and fewer outstanding shares. The macro, not much of a factor. We really call the macro pretty well versus our guidance. We did have higher fuel prices but a bit lower spreads and so really no impact there. Against the prior year, we reported a revenue decline of 8% and  organic revenue decline of 6%, unfavorable Brazil FX hurting our prints and continued weak same-store client volume softness impacting our organic growth. 
All right, let me make a turn to the trends in the quarter and share with you what we're seeing. So volume, sequential volume in Q1 versus Q4, pretty stable as we expected but we are now beginning to see a bit of an uptick here in April, so early signs of volume recovery. Same-store sales or what we call client softness really stuck at approximately minus 6%. This continues to reflect a small segment of our client base that is struggling to recover but fortunately still trying. 
Retention, really terrific in Q1. We reported 93% overall retention. That's our best result in years. Credit losses, very low for the quarter, $2 million. That was helped by a $6 million recovery and again, lower sales rolling into this year. But the real story of Q1 is sales, so Q1 sales results, nothing -- really nothing short of fantastic. Consolidated sales finished 7% ahead of last year, yes, 7% ahead of last year so finally growing again. 
If you rewind sales over the last 4 quarters so sales versus prior year, 55%, 81%, 92% and now 107%. Inside of that, our fuel card businesses, both here and international, coming in ahead of the prior year, driven mostly by record digital sales. So for Q1, we signed 35,000 new business clients worldwide, 35,000 so again, a terrific result. 
So the summary for Q1, I'd call it an in-line result for volume, revenue and cash EPS, and I call it an outstanding result for credit performance, retention performance and most importantly, sales performance. 
Okay. Let me transition to our rest of year 2021 outlook, along with the assumptions behind that. Included in our Q1 earnings supplement on Page 12, you'll see our updated guidance for the year. So full year '21 revenue expectations at the midpoint, $2,650,000,000. That's unchanged from last time. Reasons that we're staying put are: one, Q1 revenue, again, coming in kind of on plan; two, we've built in significant sequential revenue step-up in the forward quarters, probably in the range of $100 million up from Q1 to Q4. So our Q2, Q3, Q4 revenue guidance now assumes revenue growth in the high teens. 
In terms of the COVID recovery in our outlook, I'd say it's a bit mixed. U.S. and U.K. look maybe better than our planned outlined. But in our case, the Brazil COVID situation, worse, and so a pushback there in terms of recovery. 
On the cash EPS front, we will flow through our $0.12 Q1 beat. We'll raise full year '21 cash EPS guidance at the midpoint to $12.42, so $12.42 for the base business. In terms of the AFEX acquisition, hopeful now to close that deal on June 1. Initially, we thought May 1. So as a result of the 1-month delay, we're going to take the expected in-year AFEX accretion at the midpoint to $0.18 versus $0.20 previously. 
If you combine the base business and AFEX, our consolidated EPS outlook at the midpoint would be $12.60, $12.60 for the full year. I do want to add we feel very good about the AFEX cross-border deal. They had a great Q1 performance and their management is really holding steady their rest of year forecast. 
All right, let me make a turn over to our last subject today, which is how is FLEETCOR positioned for growth in '22 and beyond. So I do want to highlight just a few factors that give us confidence in sustainable growth. So one is the exit rate. So if we hit this rest of year guidance, our Q4 step-off will be quite strong heading into '22. And if we hit our rest of year sales plan, again, that will pour in-year revenues into 2022. 
Digital, I can't say enough about digital and the investments we're making in digital selling, digital UIs and customer experience, new ways of underwriting credit, and so the digital transformation making a big impact on the company. Third is EV. We're actually embracing EV, particularly in Europe. Early feedback really, really positive there that we may actually be advantaged in selling because of our integrated mix lead experience as well as this at-home recharging opportunity. It looks real. It looks like clients will pay subscriptions to basically measure and reimburse employer recharging at home. So potentially a new meaningful revenue opportunity that is nonexistent today. 
Fourth factor, our Beyond strategy or our entry into new segments. So as we've discussed before, we're extending into new customer segments really in each of our major lines of business. So in corporate pay, the Roger deal helped us enter the SMB space. In lodging, a couple of deals last year helped us enter the airline accommodation space. And in Brazil, we've entered what we call the urban driver space. So in each of these cases, basically, we're extending our businesses, extending our TAM and obviously extending our longer-term sales opportunity. 
Fifth factor is brand. We've just introduced our new Corpay brand aimed at unifying all of our various corporate payment assets. So this single brand will help our corporate payment business go to market with a single identity and hopefully give us an advantage with this broader bundle that we've got. 
And then last factor is capital. Our balance sheet's in terrific shape. Leverage ratio 2.5x, liquidity approaching $2 billion. Again, our plan is to generate $1 billion-plus of annual free cash flow. We had the ability to lever up to 3x target, which would produce circa $8 billion in capital to invest in either M&A or buybacks over the forecast period. So obviously, upside for us via capital allocation. 
So look, the takeaways from today: so one, Q1, I'd say again, an in-line Q1 financial performance but an outstanding Q1 sales performance. Rest of the year, again, we're raising rest of year cash EPS at the midpoint to $12.42. That's excluding acquisitions. And the $12.60 at the midpoint, that's including AFEX, so tracking to deliver that, although again, fully aware of the uncertainties. 
And then lastly, in terms of positioning, we really do feel well positioned to grow the company next year and beyond. Again, we expect a strong exit which will pour into '22. We're extending each of our businesses into bigger TAMs, and we've got the available capital to drive incremental returns if we manage it well. So with that, let me turn the call back over to Chuck to provide some additional details on the quarter."

For Q1 of 2021, we reported revenue of $609 million, down 8%; GAAP net income, up 25% to $184 million and GAAP net income per diluted share up 29% to $2.15.

For Q1 of 2021, we reported revenue of $609 million, down 8%; GAAP net income, up 25% to $184 million and GAAP net income per diluted share up 29% to $2.15. Included in our Q1 2020 results was the impact of the $90 million onetime loss related to a customer receivable in our cross-border payments business, which equated to $0.74 per diluted share as reported last year. 
Adjusted net income for the quarter decreased 8% to $242 million, and adjusted net income per diluted share decreased 6% to $2.82 as we continue to feel the effects of COVID on our businesses. Organic revenue growth improved 2 points sequentially to down 6% on a year-over-year basis. We saw improvement in every category except tolls as Brazil continues to grapple with incremental COVID-related shutdowns. 
As a reminder, organic revenue neutralizes the impact of year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates, fuel prices and fuel spreads and includes pro forma results for acquisitions closed during the 2 years being compared. Our fuel category was down organically about 6% year-over-year, which was a 4-point improvement from Q4. The international fuel business growth was a bit better than North American growth as those international markets shut down earlier in the quarter last year so had easier comps. 
The corporate payments category was down 5% in the first quarter, 1 point better than Q4 as improvements in virtual card and full AP were offset by FX, which was lapping a very strong Q1 last year. Full AP growth accelerated 14 points sequentially to 21% growth year-over-year, powered by continued strong new sales. 
Tolls was up 3% compared with last year but down 4 points from Q4 of 2020 due to the aforementioned shutdowns in Brazil. Looking longer term, compared with Q1 of 2019, revenue was up 13% organically. The lodging category was down 14%, which was an improvement from down 25% last quarter, with domestic airline activity recovering faster than we expected. Gift showed organic growth of 2% year-over-year as that business felt the effects of COVID earlier in Q1 of 2020 than most of our other businesses. 
That said, we've seen real traction in digital card sales and in our B2B sales efforts where we are selling gift cards to businesses for use as incentives. Recognizing that the comps to 2020 may not be very helpful, we did add some comparisons to 2019 for organic revenue growth and sales, so you can see how we are trending compared with the most recent pre-COVID or ""normal year"". That's available in the supplement we provided today. 
Looking further down the income statement. Total operating expenses were down 7% to $343 million excluding the impact of the onetime loss in our cross-border payments business last year. The decrease was primarily due to better bad debt expense, lower expenses in Brazil due to the currency translation impact and lower T&E costs as travel and the associated expenses are much lower than last year. As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses excluding the onetime loss were stable compared with Q1 of 2020 at approximately 56%. 
In the quarter, bad debt was only $2.5 million or 1 basis point as it included the benefit of a $6 million recovery for credit loss recorded in the first quarter of last year. Credit continues to be a bright spot but we expect our bad debt to normalize as our new sales levels recover and grow. Interest expense decreased 20% to $29 million due to lower borrowings on our revolver and decreases in LIBOR related to the unhedged portion of our debt. 
Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 21.8%. Excluding the impact of the onetime loss in our cross-border payments business last year, our effective tax rate in Q1 of 2020 was 18.9%. The increase over last year's adjusted tax rate was due primarily to the level of excess tax benefit on employee stock option exercises relative to pretax income. 
Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $958 million of unrestricted cash, and we also had approximately $1 billion of undrawn availability on our revolver. In total, we had $3.5 billion outstanding on our credit facilities and $915 million borrowed on our securitization facility. As of March 31, our leverage ratio was 2.48x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA as calculated in accordance with our credit agreement. 
We refinanced our securitization facility at the end of the first quarter, less than 6 months after our last refi. Recall that our normal 3-year term expired last fall when credit markets were unfavorable, so we entered into a 1-year note at LIBOR plus 125 basis points with a 37.5 basis point floor, expecting to refinance again when conditions improved. Our new securitization has a duration of 3 years at LIBOR plus 100 basis points with a floor of 0, so our effective all-in rate is approximately 50 basis points better, given the current level of LIBOR. 
We've also just completed a refinance of our Term B credit facility, upsizing it to $1.15 billion for a new term of 7 years and maintaining the rate of LIBOR plus 175 basis points. We used the proceeds to pay off our existing Term B note, pay down the revolver, funded the AFEX acquisition and improve our liquidity position for future capital actions. 
We repurchased approximately 640,000 shares during the quarter for $170 million at an average price of $266 per share, and we have approximately $836 million in repurchase capacity remaining under our current authorization. 
Now let me share some thoughts on our outlook. We are maintaining our full year revenue guidance of between $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion as improvements in some businesses such as domestic airline lodging are being offset by other places like Brazil and Europe. They're experiencing incremental virus flare-ups and associated lockdowns. As we explained last quarter, our full year guidance assumes we recover about 1/3 of of our Q4 exit revenue softness during calendar 2021. And that this recovery would account for about 4 to 5 percentage points of revenue growth in the second half. 
Within that expectation, there is very little recovery impact assumed for Q1, a modest amount for Q2 and then an acceleration into the back half of the year. While we are seeing some puts and takes between businesses, our overall outlook remains intact. You can see our full updated guidance and assumptions in both our press release and our earnings supplement so I won't reiterate them here. 
We are raising the midpoint of our adjusted net income per diluted share guidance $0.12 to $12.42 to reflect our first quarter results compared to our expectations. Looking ahead, we are expecting Q2 2021 adjusted net income per diluted share to be in the range of $2.80 to $3 per share. Volumes should build throughout the year with the COVID recovery and our new growth initiatives gaining momentum. 
As for AFEX, the closing is taking longer than we had hoped, but we still believe the deal will close by the end of the second quarter as we're nearing the finish line with all of the approvals we need from the various regulators globally. Because of the delay, the in-year benefit will be slightly less than what we expected in February. But the upside is that we've had more time to refine our integration plans, so we'll hit the ground running at full speed once we do close. With that said, operator, we'll open it up for questions."

It helps not only with the UI in terms of being able to cross sell and showcase but it also helps at the top of the funnel, being able to promote a broader line of things to prospective clients that are earlier in the cycle because who knows, per se, which product may be interesting at that moment? So we think there'll be benefits both engaging prospects at the top of the funnel. And then once we've got a client on one of the products, it would facilitate our ability to cross sell it. 
So -- and then again, the comment I mentioned earlier that we're going to use the same brand kind of down market and SMB land is in the middle market. So it will look -- we hope, as we put this thing out, pretty seamless to whoever is looking at it."

But then the second one, to your point is, yes, we'll go out directly to SMB prospects. And clearly, digital has now become, I don't think 60% of our fuel card sales. We're getting lots of new smaller accounts via that channel. And we have a lot of other assets in corporate pay to be able to monetize it, for example, in the back end with our merchant network in terms of putting some of the payments through virtual cards. So we think that we can go out with pretty attractive proposals, if you will, out to the prospective accounts and still make a bunch of money, if you will, on the back end.

In terms of the seasonality and sequential revenue within fuel, what I'd say is I'd remind you that we do have some COVID recovery planned in our forecast.

And so our expectation -- my expectation is Q2 here is going to be the thaw [indiscernible] that will move off of that 6% kind of flat line and see less of that, right, in this quarter. And then the second one, to your point, is we studied it to death here and it's just a super narrow set of clients again. So when we go in and look at the, call it, that 6% overall or consolidated softness and you run the distribution, you've got 1 decile that accounts for 100% of it. 
It's just -- there's a narrow set of clients that are in super impacted, movie theater companies, cruise line companies, you name it, we've got clients that are in super hurt businesses.

So again, I think the headline to you guys is we start by looking out at attractiveness of deals and how we feel about the price of our stock and then work our way back into what liquidity we need."

And so if you run a company in the U.K. and have gone to some mixed fleet, you've added 20 EV vehicles and you want us to help measure and reimburse that. 
And we talked to you about how we're going to get paid for it, the fact that real clients are paying meaningful amounts of subscription does help equalize, to your point, the economics of this thing as this thing converts. In addition, obviously, I try to say it on the call is if during this transition time, I really love our chances because it creates an advantage, right, as the company adds 10 new EV things, it's hard for anyone who doesn't already have the incumbency position and data on all the vehicles to go sell a guy some kind of phone mobile solution or something to deal with a 10, like why would they ever want that when we made our card and mobile programs work at all the public EV recharging places as well as at home? 
And so a kind of really interesting twist here. The old-fashioned fuel car guy actually has the advantage because you can't link and change out the installed base of all the vehicles and M&A without obviously flushing a lot of value. So I'd say this thing has manifested itself. We're feeling better and better about the economic model of the future."

So we've got a lot of experience in the company by category of the translation of what we call new bookings or sales will start to roll call, right, the recognition of a new account. And when it converts, to your point, into in-year revenue, and that conversion rate varies a tremendous amount by the products we have. 
So for example, in fuel cards, it's probably 50%. If you sold $100 million, you'd get $50 million in-year. Or Brazil, if you sold $100 million, you might get $60 million or $70 million. But if you sold corporate pay in the middle market, you might get $20 million. So the conversion rates vary tremendously by the product category. But what I would say is, clearly, we're good at math, and so we built our '21 plan and guidance anticipating good sales. 
These sales were above what we did plan. But generally, that's all cooked into the plan and the guidance that we have. And so the biggest help is what I said, if we make this plan, which would be up over 30%, right? As you go into the next quarter is like we'll probably double Q2 sales because it was pretty low, but hopefully, be up over 30% for the full year. You've got lots of those categories like corporate pay or that revenue pours into '22. So people should listen carefully to the sales numbers, which I did try to call out. They really are an early leading indicator really of '22 revenue."

But what I mentioned is, selectively, we see areas where sequentially, the volumes are starting to come back to par, if you will. And even against the base period of 2019, we're seeing growth. 
So just to call out 1, like in our international fuel card business, for example, which we kind of break into 4 markets, the U.K., Russia, Central Europe and Australia, 3 of those, the volumes in April are higher than they were in April of '19. And the 1 that's not is Central Europe, where again, the COVID restrictions are still in place. So we're seeing same in corporate pay. We see areas like the virtual card business that's way ahead of its baseline from April. The full AP, I think, I mentioned is more than double. The cross-border business is up. So a lot of the businesses are now, in April, ahead of their '19 baseline. 
There's a handful of stubborn ones that I mentioned that are more COVID-impacted like again, Central Europe, like the T&E card, which requires people like us to travel, like the airline, lodging business that we bought. It's coming back but it's still soft against the prior period. So there's a handful 3 or 4 areas that are pretty stubborn and then [indiscernible] areas that we're seeing the thing come back. So as I said, our view is we're going to see a change in same-store this quarter, Q2. And then we planned a pretty significant recovery again in Q3 and Q4, which will pour revenue and, more importantly, profit dollars into the second half."

We actually had our Board meeting last week and actually covered this particular subject, competing in this strange time that we're in. And I think the couple of comments I'd give you is, one, we tried to build plans to invest more -- differentially more in that business than some of our others to try to target that business closer to 20% on the top versus kind of 10%, if you will, for the consolidated company. So that's point 1 that inherent in our base plans, our overall profit plan, there's incremental investment to grow faster already. 
And then second, I think the conclusion that we got to coming out of the Board meeting on this is it depends on the investment. So if there's a clear investment we can make that's got an attractive return profile, we'll be back to you in the buy side with, ""Hey, look, we're going to slow earnings a bit, whatever, if we think we can make some great return."" But again, it's got to be a return we can execute. So hey, if [ hire 100 ] people told you a bunch of times, that's hard to add all those people execution-wise and make it work versus if we could pour money into the top of the funnel of the digital thing, which is one of a lot of the reasons we did this Corpay unification. 
That might be a basis, right, where we could spend money effectively and see good returns. So I'd say nothing staring us in the face now. We've got lots of money, incremental capital. I think we're spending $20 million, $25 million of incremental capital above last year in IT. Half of that's in corporate pay. We're spending more in sales. And so if we got the right kind of investment, I think the answer is we would do it."

I think people that drive off and cut trees and then in the airline accommodation where we're connected literally into the airlines systems.

So the answer is it's obviously it's recovering. It was one of those businesses hurt really the most a year ago. So we've gotten a lot of it back already in the workforce side. And I'd say we're probably half of the way back. In fact, it's the 1 area that outperformed the COVID recovery in the first quarter. For each line of business, we plan a certain amount of softness, if you will, coming back, and the airline business actually came back faster than we planned. 
So I think it's on track depending on what happens over the next couple of months to have a huge recovery, right, in the second half. And we're selling a lot, like I'm looking at the sales. We continue to sell a lot in that business. We've got some attractive adjacencies in the business. It's probably our highest margin business.

So we've proven, I guess, Chuck, over 20 years, we've compounded, David, at over 20%. 
So the reminder to you and others out there is, I think for full year calendar '18 and full year calendar '19, the business grew 10% organically in those 2 most recent years until we hit COVID here in 2020. And so my expectation is that we will be back there in certainly in '22. And part of it is, again, the setup is just so good in terms of the exit rate that if we get this recovery in the second half and we make the sales that we're making, the exit rate pouring into '22 will obviously be super attractive. 
And then to your point, the deal we've announced and a couple we're working on will be, as I've mentioned before, quite accretive. And so it all points, I try to say it in the thing, I think the business, because of the pain we took last year is particularly well set up to get a good number in '22. And then what I'd say to you is we like our chances after that because we're diversifying the space, right, in the businesses, the fuel card, bank chase and EV and launching, chasing new categories and getting into SMB and corporate payments. We're not sitting still just kind of twiddling the places that we're in, David. 
So I think it's -- I think we sit here more optimistic about the future because we're coming out. We're coming out, finally coming out of the woods here and can kind of see the other side, and that sets up well for us. So I'd say '22 will be better and then we like our chances after that."

Hi, everyone, and thanks for joining our first quarter 2021 earnings call. So upfront here, 3 subjects: first, my view of Q1 results; second, I'll share our rest of year outlook; and then third, talk a bit about how we're positioned for growth over the midterm.  
Okay, let me turn to Q1 results. So we reported Q1 revenue of $609 million, really kind of spot on our expectations. Reported cash EPS of $2.82. That's a bit better than our guide, mostly helped by lower credit losses and fewer outstanding shares. The macro, not much of a factor. We really call the macro pretty well versus our guidance. We did have higher fuel prices but a bit lower spreads and so really no impact there.  
Against the prior year, we reported a revenue decline of 8% and organic revenue decline of 6%. Unfavorable Brazil FX hurting our prints and continued weak same-store client volume softness impacting our organic growth.  
All right, let me make a turn to the trends in the quarter and share with you what we're seeing. So volume, sequential volume in Q1 versus Q4, pretty stable, as we expected, but we are now beginning to see a bit of an uptick here in April, so early signs of volume recovery. Same-store sales or what we call client softness really stuck at approximately minus 6%. This continues to reflect a small segment of our client base that is struggling to recover but fortunately still trying.  
Retention, really terrific in Q1. We reported 93% overall retention. That's our best result in years. Credit losses, very low for the quarter, $2 million. That was helped by a $6 million recovery and again, lower sales rolling into this year. But the real story of Q1 is sales, so Q1 sales results, nothing -- really nothing short of fantastic. Consolidated sales finished 7% ahead of last year. Yes, 7% ahead of last year, so finally growing again.  
If you rewind sales over the last 4 quarters, so sales versus prior year, 55%, 81%, 92% and now 107%. Inside of that, our fuel card businesses, both here and international, coming in ahead of the prior year, driven mostly by record digital sales. So for Q1, we signed 35,000 new business clients worldwide, 35,000. So again, a terrific result. So the summary for Q1, I'd call it an in-line result for volume, revenue and cash EPS, and I call it an outstanding result for credit performance, retention performance and most importantly, sales performance.  
Okay. Let me transition to our rest of year 2021 outlook, along with the assumptions behind that. Included in our Q1 earnings supplement on Page 12, you'll see our updated guidance for the year. So full year '21 revenue expectations at the midpoint, $2,650,000,000. That's unchanged from last time. Reasons that we're staying put are: one, Q1 revenue, again, coming in kind of on plan; two, we've built in significant sequential revenue step-up in the forward quarters, probably in the range of $100 million up from Q1 to Q4. So our Q2, Q3, Q4 revenue guidance now assumes revenue growth in the high teens.  
In terms of the COVID recovery in our outlook, I'd say it's a bit mixed. U.S. and U.K. look maybe better than our planned outline. But in our case, the Brazil COVID situation, worse, and so a pushback there in terms of recovery.  
On the cash EPS front, we will flow through our $0.12 Q1 beat. We'll raise full year '21 cash EPS guidance at the midpoint to $12.42, so $12.42 for the base business. In terms of the AFEX acquisition, hopeful now to close that deal on June 1. Initially, we thought May 1. So as a result of the 1-month delay, we're going to take the expected in-year AFEX accretion at the midpoint to $0.18 versus $0.20 previously.  
If you combine the base business and AFEX, our consolidated EPS outlook at the midpoint would be $12.60, $12.60 for the full year. I do want to add, we feel very good about the AFEX cross-border deal. They had a great Q1 performance and their management is really holding steady their rest of year forecast. 
All right. Let me make a turn over to our last subject today, which is how is FLEETCOR positioned for growth in '22 and beyond. So I do want to highlight just a few factors that give us confidence in sustainable growth. So one is the exit rate. So if we hit this rest of year guidance, our Q4 step-off will be quite strong heading into '22. And if we hit our rest of year sales plan, again, that will pour in-year revenues into 2022. 
Digital, I can't say enough about digital and the investments we're making in digital selling, digital UIs and customer experience, new ways of underwriting credit, and so the digital transformation making a big impact on the company. Third is EV. We're actually embracing EV, particularly in Europe. Early feedback really, really positive there that we may actually be advantaged in selling because of our integrated mix lead experience as well as this at-home recharging opportunity. It looks real. It looks like clients will pay subscriptions to basically measure and reimburse employee recharging at home. So potentially a new meaningful revenue opportunity that is nonexistent today.  
Fourth factor, our Beyond strategy or our entry into new segments. So as we've discussed before, we're extending into new customer segments really in each of our major lines of business. So in corporate pay, the Roger deal helped us enter the SMB space. In lodging, a couple of deals last year helped us enter the airline accommodation space. And in Brazil, we've entered what we call the urban driver space. So in each of these cases, basically, we're extending our businesses, extending our TAM and obviously extending our longer-term sales opportunity.  
Fifth factor is brand. We've just introduced our new Corpay brand aimed at unifying all of our various corporate payment assets. So this single brand will help our corporate payment business go to market with a single identity and hopefully give us an advantage with this broader bundle that we've got.  
And then last factor is capital. Our balance sheet's in terrific shape. Leverage ratio 2.5x, liquidity approaching $2 billion. Again, our plan is to generate $1 billion-plus of annual free cash flow. We had the ability to lever up to 3x target, which would produce circa $8 billion in capital to invest in either M&A or buybacks over the forecast period. So obviously, upside for us via capital allocation.  
So look, the takeaways from today: so one, Q1, I'd say again, an in-line Q1 financial performance but an outstanding Q1 sales performance. Rest of year, again, we're raising rest of year cash EPS at the midpoint to $12.42. That's excluding acquisitions, and the $12.60 at the midpoint, that's including AFEX, so tracking to deliver that, although again, fully aware of the uncertainties.  
And then lastly, in terms of positioning, we really do feel well positioned to grow the company next year and beyond. Again, we expect a strong exit, which will pour into '22. We're extending each of our businesses into bigger TAMs, and we've got the available capital to drive incremental returns if we manage it well. 
So with that, let me turn the call back over to Chuck to provide some additional details on the quarter."
28756,712098195,2271517,"FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc., Q1 2021 Earnings Call, May 05, 2021",2021-05-05,"Earnings Calls","Corpay, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ron. For Q1 of 2021, we reported revenue of $609 million, down 8%; GAAP net income up 25% to $184 million, and GAAP net income per diluted share up 29% to $2.15. Included in our Q1 2020 results was the impact of the $90 million onetime loss relate",1252,"Thanks, Ron. For Q1 of 2021, we reported revenue of $609 million, down 8%; GAAP net income up 25% to $184 million, and GAAP net income per diluted share up 29% to $2.15. Included in our Q1 2020 results was the impact of the $90 million onetime loss related to a customer receivable in our cross-border payments business, which equated to $0.74 per diluted share, as reported last year.  
Adjusted net income for the quarter decreased 8% to $242 million, and adjusted net income per diluted share decreased 6% to $2.82 as we continue to feel the effects of COVID on our businesses. Organic revenue growth improved 2 points sequentially to down 6% on a year-over-year basis. We saw improvement in every category except tolls as Brazil continues to grapple with incremental COVID-related shutdowns.  
As a reminder, organic revenue neutralizes the impact of year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates, fuel prices and fuel spreads and includes pro forma results for acquisitions closed during the 2 years being compared. Our fuel category was down organically about 6% year-over-year, which was a 4-point improvement from Q4. The international fuel business growth was a bit better than North American growth as those international markets shut down earlier in the quarter last year, so had easier comps. 
The corporate payments category was down 5% in the first quarter, 1 point better than Q4, as improvements in virtual card and full AP were offset by FX, which was lapping a very strong Q1 last year. Full AP growth accelerated 14 points sequentially to 21% growth year-over-year, powered by continued strong new sales.  
Tolls was up 3% compared with last year but down 4 points from Q4 of 2020 due to the aforementioned shutdowns in Brazil. Looking longer term, compared with Q1 of 2019, revenue was up 13% organically. The lodging category was down 14%, which was an improvement from down 25% last quarter, with domestic airline activity recovering faster than we expected. Gift showed organic growth of 2% year-over-year as that business felt the effects of COVID earlier in Q1 of 2020 than most of our other businesses. 
That said, we've seen real traction in digital card sales and in our B2B sales efforts where we are selling gift cards to businesses for use as incentives. Recognizing that the comps to 2020 may not be very helpful, we did add some comparisons to 2019 for organic revenue growth and sales, so you can see how we are trending compared with the most recent pre-COVID or ""normal year"". That's available in the supplement we provided today.
looking further down the income statement. Total operating expenses were down 7% to $343 million, excluding the impact of the onetime loss in our cross-border payments business last year. The decrease was primarily due to better bad debt expense, lower expenses in Brazil due to the currency translation impact and lower T&E costs as travel and the associated expenses are much lower than last year. As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses excluding the onetime loss were stable compared with Q1 of 2020 at approximately 56%.  
In the quarter, bad debt was only $2.5 million or 1 basis point, as it included the benefit of a $6 million recovery for credit loss recorded in the first quarter of last year. Credit continues to be a bright spot, but we expect our bad debt to normalize as our new sales levels recover and grow. Interest expense decreased 20% to $29 million due to lower borrowings on our revolver and decreases in LIBOR related to the unhedged portion of our debt.  
Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 21.8%. Excluding the impact of the onetime loss in our cross-border payments business last year, our effective tax rate in Q1 of 2020 was 18.9%. The increase over last year's adjusted tax rate was due primarily to the level of excess tax benefit on employee stock option exercises relative to pretax income. 
Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $958 million of unrestricted cash, and we also had approximately $1 billion of undrawn availability on our revolver. In total, we had $3.5 billion outstanding on our credit facilities and $915 million borrowed on our securitization facility. As of March 31, our leverage ratio was 2.48x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA, as calculated in accordance with our credit agreement.  
We refinanced our securitization facility at the end of the first quarter, less than 6 months after our last refi. Recall that our normal 3-year term expired last fall when credit markets were unfavorable, so we entered into a 1-year note at LIBOR plus 125 basis points with a 37.5 basis point floor, expecting to refinance again when conditions improve. Our new securitization has a duration of 3 years at LIBOR plus 100 basis points with a floor of 0, so our effective all-in rate is approximately 50 basis points better, given the current level of LIBOR.  
We've also just completed a refinance of our Term B credit facility, upsizing it to $1.15 billion for a new term of 7 years and maintaining the rate of LIBOR plus 175 basis points. We used the proceeds to pay off our existing Term B note, pay down the revolver, funded the AFEX acquisition and improve our liquidity position for future capital actions. 
We repurchased approximately 640,000 shares during the quarter for $170 million at an average price of $266 per share, and we have approximately $836 million in repurchase capacity remaining under our current authorization.  
Now let me share some thoughts on our outlook. We are maintaining our full year revenue guidance of between $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion as improvements in some businesses such as domestic airline lodging are being offset by other places like Brazil and Europe. They're experiencing incremental virus flare-ups and associated lockdowns. 
As we explained last quarter, our full year guidance assumes we recover about 1/3 of our Q4 exit revenue softness during calendar 2021. And that this recovery would account for about 4 to 5 percentage points of revenue growth in the second half.  
Within that expectation, there is very little recovery impact assumed for Q1, a modest amount for Q2 and then an acceleration into the back half of the year. While we are seeing some puts and takes between businesses, our overall outlook remains intact. You can see our full updated guidance and assumptions in both our press release and our earnings supplement, so I won't reiterate them here.  
We are raising the midpoint of our adjusted net income per diluted share guidance $0.12 to $12.42 to reflect our first quarter results compared to our expectations. Looking ahead, we are expecting Q2 2021 adjusted net income per diluted share to be in the range of $2.80 to $3 per share. Volumes should build throughout the year with the COVID recovery and our new growth initiatives gaining momentum.  
As for AFEX, the closing is taking longer than we had hoped, but we still believe the deal will close by the end of the second quarter as we're nearing the finish line with all of the approvals we need from the various regulators globally. Because of the delay, the in-year benefit will be slightly less than what we expected in February. But the upside is that we've had more time to refine our integration plans, so we'll hit the ground running at full speed once we do close. 
With that said, operator, we'll open it up for questions."

In terms of the first part of the question, the sales, the answer is yes, kind of all the segments. I think I called out the fuel card businesses were ahead of the prior year, so was the corporate payments business. So really strength virtually everywhere, except, I'd say, Brazil. Brazil was a bit softer than we had outlook mostly because of the COVID situation. So with that exception, really, the sales were super terrific. 
Yes. On the Corpay question, again, the answer is yes. I mean, again, as I mentioned earlier, it's unifying all of the products, which helps in a lot of ways, to your point. It helps not only with the UI in terms of being able to cross-sell and showcase but it also helps at the top of the funnel, being able to promote a broader line of things to prospective clients that are earlier in the cycle because who knows, per se, which product may be interesting at that moment? So we think there'll be benefits both engaging prospects at the top of the funnel. And then once we've got a client on one of the products, it would facilitate our ability to cross-sell it. 
So -- and then again, the comment I mentioned earlier that we're going to use the same brand kind of down market and SMB land is in the middle market. So it will look, we hope, as we put this thing out, pretty seamless to whoever is looking at it."

But then the second one, to your point is, yes, we'll go out directly to SMB prospects. And clearly, digital has now become, I don't think 60% of our fuel card sales. We're getting lots of new smaller accounts via that channel. And we have a lot of other assets in corporate pay to be able to monetize it, for example, in the back end with our merchant network in terms of putting some of the payments through virtual cards. So we think that we can go out with pretty attractive proposals, if you will, out to the prospective accounts and still make a bunch of money, if you will, on the back end.

In terms of the seasonality and sequential revenue within fuel, what I'd say is I'd remind you that we do have some COVID recovery planned in our forecast. So assuming that, that comes back, we should get a little bit higher than normal in terms of sequential growth in that business. But again, a lot of that recovery is still back half focused but we have some plan for Q2. And we're seeing early, early signs in April. But as Ron mentioned, it's still early."

And then two, unfortunately, the amount of due sales we had in 2020 were lower than normal and lower than planned and they carry higher losses. 
So when you have a mix of less new to existing, you'll have lower credit losses. So those couple of things will make it a bit better. But I think as you roll forward, I think we would probably anticipate we get back more, David, to normalized levels because we've opened the credit patches, if you will, now, and again, our sales are way up as we said.

So I'd say the first thing is we're actually seeing the thaw, if you will, in some of that same-store stuff, so some recovery literally already in some of the lines in April. 
And so our expectation -- my expectation is Q2 here is going to be the thawing that will move off of that 6% kind of flat line and see less of that, right, in this quarter. And then the second one, to your point, is we studied it to death here and it's just a super narrow set of clients again. So when we go in and look at the, call it, that 6% overall or consolidated softness and you run the distribution, you've got 1 decile that accounts for 100% of it. 
It's just -- there's a narrow set of clients that are in super impacted, movie theater companies, cruise line companies, you name it, we've got clients that are in super hurt businesses. And so we're seeing, again, some that aren't that impacted already coming back in April.

And then the second one is really the comment I made to Tien-Tsin, which is it's incredibly, in our case, narrowly focused on a very, very small set of clients that again are causing the overall number, right, the consolidated number to be negative.

So that's kind of the short-term thing that we try to obviously prepare our liquidity situation for the pipeline that we see. 
But I think longer term, we really don't think about it that way. Deals are bumpy. Sometimes you spend a lot of money in a year. Sometimes we don't spend a lot, and we'd have enormous opportunities for liquidity based on where our leverage ratio is and the cash that we generate. So we really, I think, try to think about it short term, when we see a situation where we've got some stuff lined up. And then longer term, we really just focus it, honestly, on the M&A side. 
We look for super attractive things we have conviction in and then back our way into how to pay for it versus the other way around.

And we talked to you about how we're going to get paid for it, the fact that real clients are paying meaningful amounts of subscription does help equalize, to your point, the economics of this thing as this thing converts. 
In addition, obviously, I try to say it on the call is during this transition time, I really love our chances because it creates an advantage, right, as the company adds 10 new EV things, it's hard for anyone who doesn't already have the incumbency position and data on all the vehicles to go sell a guy some kind of phone, mobile solution or something to deal with the 10. Like why would they ever want that when we made our card and mobile programs work at all the public EV recharging places as well as at home? 
And so in a kind of a really interesting twist here, the old-fashioned fuel car guy actually has the advantage because you can't link and change out the installed base of all the vehicles in a day without obviously flushing a lot of value.

So for example, in fuel cards, it's probably 50%. If you sold $100 million, you'd get $50 million in-year. Or Brazil, if you sold $100 million, you might get $60 million or $70 million. But if you sold corporate pay in the middle market, you might get $20 million. So the conversion rates vary tremendously by the product category. But what I would say is, clearly, we're good at math, and so we built our '21 plan and guidance anticipating good sales. 
These sales were above what we did plan. But generally, that's all cooked into the plan and the guidance that we have. And so the biggest help is what I said, if we make this plan, which would be up over 30%, right? As you go into the next quarter, it's like we'll probably double Q2 sales because it was pretty low, but hopefully, be up over 30% for the full year. You've got lots of those categories like corporate pay where that revenue pours into '22. So people should listen carefully to the sales numbers, which I did try to call out.

The slide in the deck is really helpful, but just I'm curious if at any of the segments, if any of them either exited Q1 or quarter-to-date in April are trending higher relative to '19 than they did for Q1, just to see where we might get some kind of meaningful sequential acceleration in Q2."

But what I mentioned is, selectively, we see areas where sequentially, the volumes are starting to come back to par, if you will. And even against the base period of 2019, we're seeing growth. 
So just to call out one, like in our international fuel card business, for example, which we kind of break into 4 markets, the U.K., Russia, Central Europe and Australia, 3 of those, the volumes in April are higher than they were in April of '19. And the 1 that's not is Central Europe, where again, the COVID restrictions are still in place. So we're seeing same in corporate pay. We see areas like the virtual card business that's way ahead of its baseline from April. The full AP, I think, I mentioned is more than double. The cross-border business is up. So a lot of the businesses are now, in April, ahead of their '19 baseline. 
There's a handful of stubborn ones that I mentioned that are more COVID-impacted like again, Central Europe, like the T&E card, which requires people like us to travel. Like the airline lodging business that we bought, it's coming back, but it's still soft against the prior period. So there's a handful 3 or 4 areas that are pretty stubborn and then the 10 areas that we're seeing that didn't come back. So as I said, our view is we're going to see a change in same-store this quarter, Q2. And then we plan a pretty significant recovery again in Q3 and Q4, which will pour revenue and, more importantly, profit dollars into the second half."

And your thoughts on balancing growth with margins, and you have a number of high-growth public and private companies that are investing very aggressively and looking at margins down the road where you're generating strong margins today.

We actually had our Board meeting last week and actually covered this particular subject, competing in this strange time that we're in.

We actually had our Board meeting last week and actually covered this particular subject, competing in this strange time that we're in. And I think the couple of comments I'd give you is, one, we tried to build plans to invest more -- differentially more in that business than some of our others to try to target that business closer to 20% on the top versus kind of 10%, if you will, for the consolidated company. So that's point 1 that inherent in our base plans, our overall profit plan, there's incremental investment to grow faster already. 
And then second, I think the conclusion that we got to coming out of the Board meeting on this is it depends on the investment. So if there's a clear investment we can make that's got an attractive return profile, we'll be back to you in the buy side with, ""Hey, look, we're going to slow earnings a bit, whatever, if we think we can make some great return."" But again, it's got to be a return we can execute. So hey, to hire 100 people, I've told you a bunch of times, that's hard to add all those people execution-wise and make it work versus if we could pour money into the top of the funnel of the digital thing, which is one of the lot -- reasons we did this Corpay unification, that might be a basis, right, where we could spend money effectively and see good returns. 
So I'd say nothing staring us in the face now. We've got lots of money, incremental capital. I think we're spending $20 million, $25 million of incremental capital above last year in IT. Half of that's in corporate pay. We're spending more in sales. And so if we got the right kind of investment, I think the answer is we would do it."

It's a super business, to your point, because again, we're pretty specialized, right? We're in the workforce segment, think blue collar people that drive off and cut trees and then in the airline accommodation where we're connected literally into the airline's systems. So we know that the 2 of us pilots are going to show up somewhere tomorrow. 
So the answer is, obviously, it's recovering. It was one of those businesses hurt really the most a year ago. So we've gotten a lot of it back already in the workforce side. And I'd say we're probably half of the way back. In fact, it's the 1 area that outperformed the COVID recovery in the first quarter. For each line of business, we plan a certain amount of softness, if you will, coming back, and the airline business actually came back faster than we planned. 
So I think it's on track, depending on what happens over the next couple of months, to have a huge recovery, right, in the second half. And we're selling a lot. Like I'm looking at the sales, we continue to sell a lot in that business. We've got some attractive adjacencies in the business. It's probably our highest margin business. So to your point, there's a lot to like about it, and people should keep their eyes open. We're probably going to do more of it."

I think if I've been repetitive on something that's been [ 10%, 13, 19, 10%, 13, 19 ], which is if we can grow revenues organically 10%, we can grow operating EBITDA, if you will, fast because of the operating lever",358,"David, it's Ron. It's a great question. I think if I've been repetitive on something that's been [ 10%, 13, 19, 10%, 13, 19 ], which is if we can grow revenues organically 10%, we can grow operating EBITDA, if you will, fast because of the operating leverage and then use the $1 billion of capital to either buy earnings or buy shares. So we've proven, I guess, Chuck, over 20 years, we've compounded, David, at over 20%. 
So the reminder to you and others out there is, I think for full year calendar '18 and full year calendar '19, the business grew 10% organically in those 2 most recent years until we hit COVID here in 2020. And so my expectation is that we will be back there in -- certainly in '22. And part of it is, again, the setup is just so good in terms of the exit rate that if we get this recovery in the second half and we make the sales that we're making, the exit rate pouring into '22 will obviously be super attractive. 
And then to your point, the deal we've announced and a couple we're working on will be, as I've mentioned before, quite accretive. And so it all points, I try to say it in the thing, I think the business, because of the pain we took last year, is particularly well set up to get a good number in '22. And then what I'd say to you is we like our chances after that because we're diversifying the space, right, in the businesses, the fuel card, bank chase and EV and launching, chasing new categories and getting into SMB and corporate payments. We're not sitting still just kind of twiddling the places that we're in, David. 
And so I think it's -- I think we sit here more optimistic about the future because we're coming out. We're freaking coming out, finally coming out of the woods here and can kind of see the other side, and that sets up well for us. So I'd say, '22 will be better and then we like our chances after that."

This information is not calculated in accordance with GAAP and may be calculated differently than non-GAAP information at other companies. Reconciliations of historical non-GAAP financial information to the most directly comparable GAAP information appears in today's press release and on our website, as previously described.  
I do need to remind everybody that part of our discussion today may include forward-looking statements. These statements reflect the best information we have as of today.

They are not guarantees of future performance and you should not put undue reliance upon them. We do not undertake any obligation to update any of these statements. 
These expected results are subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, which could cause actual results to differ materially from what we expect. Some of those risks are mentioned in today's press release on Form 8-K and on our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These documents are available on our website and at sec.gov. 
Before we begin, I would like to make you aware that over the last few weeks, we posted 2 short videos to the Investor Relations website. The first is around our approach and strategy for electric vehicles as discussed by Alan King, who is the head of the U.K., Europe and ANZ for Fuel and heading up that effort for us. The second is a video providing some insight into our downmarket full AP product so you can get a feel for what it is and how it works. We had mentioned that we would likely spend some more time on these topics in the future, and this is an interim step while we continue to work on those efforts.

Hi, everyone, and thanks for joining our first quarter 2021 earnings call. So upfront here, 3 subjects: first, my view of Q1 results; second, I'll share our rest of year outlook; and then third, talk a bit about how we're positioned for",1242,"Okay. Jim, thanks. Hi, everyone, and thanks for joining our first quarter 2021 earnings call. So upfront here, 3 subjects: first, my view of Q1 results; second, I'll share our rest of year outlook; and then third, talk a bit about how we're positioned for growth over the midterm.  
Okay, let me turn to Q1 results. So we reported Q1 revenue of $609 million, really kind of spot on our expectations. Reported cash EPS of $2.82. That's a bit better than our guide, mostly helped by lower credit losses and fewer outstanding shares. The macro, not much of a factor. We really called the macro pretty well versus our guidance. We did have higher fuel prices but a bit lower spreads and so really no impact there.  
Against the prior year, we reported a revenue decline of 8% and an organic revenue decline of 6%. Unfavorable Brazil FX hurting our prints and continued weak same-store client volume softness impacting our organic growth.  
All right, let me make a turn to the trends in the quarter and share with you what we're seeing. So volume, sequential volume in Q1 versus Q4, pretty stable, as we expected, but we are now beginning to see a bit of an uptick here in April, so early signs of volume recovery. Same-store sales or what we call client softness really stuck at approximately minus 6%. This continues to reflect a small segment of our client base that is struggling to recover but fortunately still trying.  
Retention, really terrific in Q1. We reported 93% overall retention. That's our best result in years. Credit losses, very low for the quarter, $2 million. That was helped by a $6 million recovery and again, lower sales rolling into this year. But the real story of Q1 is sales, so Q1 sales results, nothing -- really nothing short of fantastic. Consolidated sales finished 7% ahead of last year. Yes, 7% ahead of last year, so finally growing again.  
If you rewind sales over the last 4 quarters, so sales versus prior year, 55%, 81%, 92% and now 107%. Inside of that, our fuel card businesses, both here and international, coming in ahead of the prior year, driven mostly by record digital sales. So for Q1, we signed 35,000 new business clients worldwide, 35,000. So again, a terrific result. So the summary for Q1, I'd call it an in-line result for volume, revenue and cash EPS, and I call it an outstanding result for credit performance, retention performance and most importantly, sales performance.  
Okay. Let me transition to our rest of year 2021 outlook, along with the assumptions behind that. Included in our Q1 earnings supplement on Page 12, you'll see our updated guidance for the year. So full year '21 revenue expectations at the midpoint, $2,650,000,000. That's unchanged from last time. Reasons that we're staying put are: one, Q1 revenue, again, coming in kind of on plan; two, we've built in significant sequential revenue step-up in the forward quarters, probably in the range of $100 million up from Q1 to Q4. So our Q2, Q3, Q4 revenue guidance now assumes revenue growth in the high teens.  
In terms of the COVID recovery in our outlook, I'd say it's a bit mixed. U.S. and U.K. look maybe better than our planned outline. But in our case, the Brazil COVID situation, worse, and so a pushback there in terms of recovery.  
On the cash EPS front, we will flow through our $0.12 Q1 beat. We'll raise full year '21 cash EPS guidance at the midpoint to $12.42, so $12.42 for the base business. In terms of the AFEX acquisition, hopeful now to close that deal on June 1. Initially, we thought May 1. So as a result of the 1-month delay, we're going to take the expected in-year AFEX accretion at the midpoint to $0.18 versus $0.20 previously.  
If you combine the base business and AFEX, our consolidated EPS outlook at the midpoint would be $12.60, $12.60 for the full year. I do want to add, we feel very good about the AFEX cross-border deal. They had a great Q1 performance and their management is really holding steady their rest of year forecast. 
All right. Let me make a turn over to our last subject today, which is how is FLEETCOR positioned for growth in '22 and beyond. So I do want to highlight just a few factors that give us confidence in sustainable growth. So one is the exit rate. So if we hit this rest of year guidance, our Q4 step-off will be quite strong heading into '22. And if we hit our rest of year sales plan, again, that will pour in-year revenues into 2022. 
Digital, I can't say enough about digital and the investments we're making in digital selling, digital UIs and customer experience, new ways of underwriting credit, and so the digital transformation making a big impact on the company. Third is EV. We're actually embracing EV, particularly in Europe. Early feedback really, really positive there that we may actually be advantaged in selling because of our integrated mixed fleet experience as well as this at-home recharging opportunity. It looks real. It looks like clients will pay subscriptions to basically measure and reimburse employee recharging at home. So potentially a new meaningful revenue opportunity that is nonexistent today.  
Fourth factor, our Beyond strategy or our entry into new segments. So as we've discussed before, we're extending into new customer segments really in each of our major lines of business. So in corporate pay, the Roger deal helped us enter the SMB space. In lodging, a couple of deals last year helped us enter the airline accommodation space. And in Brazil, we've entered what we call the urban driver space. So in each of these cases, basically, we're extending our businesses, extending our TAM and obviously extending our longer-term sales opportunity.  
Fifth factor is brand. We've just introduced our new Corpay brand aimed at unifying all of our various corporate payment assets. So this single brand will help our corporate payment business go to market with a single identity and hopefully give us an advantage with this broader bundle that we've got.  
And then last factor is capital. Our balance sheet's in terrific shape. Leverage ratio 2.5x, liquidity approaching $2 billion. Again, our plan is to generate $1 billion-plus of annual free cash flow. We have the ability to lever up to 3x target, which would produce circa $8 billion in capital to invest in either M&A or buybacks over the forecast period. So obviously, upside for us via capital allocation.  
So look, the takeaways from today: so one, Q1, I'd say again, an in-line Q1 financial performance but an outstanding Q1 sales performance. Rest of year, again, we're raising rest of year cash EPS at the midpoint to $12.42. That's excluding acquisitions, and the $12.60 at the midpoint, that's including AFEX, so tracking to deliver that, although again, fully aware of the uncertainties.  
And then lastly, in terms of positioning, we really do feel well positioned to grow the company next year and beyond. Again, we expect a strong exit, which will pour into '22. We're extending each of our businesses into bigger TAMs, and we've got the available capital to drive incremental returns if we manage it well. 
So with that, let me turn the call back over to Chuck to provide some additional details on the quarter."

For Q1 of 2021, we reported revenue of $609 million, down 8%; GAAP net income up 25% to $184 million, and GAAP net income per diluted share up 29% to $2.15. Included in our Q1 2020 results was the impact of the $90 million onetime loss relate",1253,"Thanks, Ron. For Q1 of 2021, we reported revenue of $609 million, down 8%; GAAP net income up 25% to $184 million, and GAAP net income per diluted share up 29% to $2.15. Included in our Q1 2020 results was the impact of the $90 million onetime loss related to a customer receivable in our cross-border payments business, which equated to $0.74 per diluted share, as reported last year.  
Adjusted net income for the quarter decreased 8% to $242 million, and adjusted net income per diluted share decreased 6% to $2.82 as we continue to feel the effects of COVID on our businesses. Organic revenue growth improved 2 points sequentially to down 6% on a year-over-year basis. We saw improvement in every category except tolls as Brazil continues to grapple with incremental COVID-related shutdowns.  
As a reminder, organic revenue neutralizes the impact of year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates, fuel prices and fuel spreads and includes pro forma results for acquisitions closed during the 2 years being compared. Our fuel category was down organically about 6% year-over-year, which was a 4-point improvement from Q4. The international fuel business growth was a bit better than North American growth as those international markets shut down earlier in the quarter last year, so had easier comps. 
The corporate payments category was down 5% in the first quarter, 1 point better than Q4, as improvements in virtual card and full AP were offset by FX, which was lapping a very strong Q1 last year. Full AP growth accelerated 14 points sequentially to 21% growth year-over-year, powered by continued strong new sales.  
Tolls was up 3% compared with last year but down 4 points from Q4 of 2020 due to the aforementioned shutdowns in Brazil. Looking longer term, compared with Q1 of 2019, revenue was up 13% organically. The lodging category was down 14%, which was an improvement from down 25% last quarter, with domestic airline activity recovering faster than we expected. Gift showed organic growth of 2% year-over-year as that business felt the effects of COVID earlier in Q1 of 2020 than most of our other businesses. 
That said, we've seen real traction in digital card sales and in our B2B sales efforts where we are selling gift cards to businesses for use as incentives. Recognizing that the comps to 2020 may not be very helpful, we did add some comparisons to 2019 for organic revenue growth and sales, so you can see how we are trending compared with the most recent pre-COVID or ""normal year."" That's available in the supplement we provided today.
Looking further down the income statement. Total operating expenses were down 7% to $343 million, excluding the impact of the onetime loss in our cross-border payments business last year. The decrease was primarily due to better bad debt expense, lower expenses in Brazil due to the currency translation impact and lower T&E costs as travel and the associated expenses are much lower than last year. As a percentage of total revenues, operating expenses excluding the onetime loss were stable compared with Q1 of 2020 at approximately 56%.  
In the quarter, bad debt was only $2.5 million or 1 basis point, as it included the benefit of a $6 million recovery for credit loss recorded in the first quarter of last year. Credit continues to be a bright spot, but we expect our bad debt to normalize as our new sales levels recover and grow. Interest expense decreased 20% to $29 million due to lower borrowings on our revolver and decreases in LIBOR related to the unhedged portion of our debt.  
Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 21.8%. Excluding the impact of the onetime loss in our cross-border payments business last year, our effective tax rate in Q1 of 2020 was 18.9%. The increase over last year's adjusted tax rate was due primarily to the level of excess tax benefit on employee stock option exercises relative to pretax income. 
Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $958 million of unrestricted cash, and we also had approximately $1 billion of undrawn availability on our revolver. In total, we had $3.5 billion outstanding on our credit facilities and $915 million borrowed on our securitization facility. As of March 31, our leverage ratio was 2.48x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA, as calculated in accordance with our credit agreement.  
We refinanced our securitization facility at the end of the first quarter, less than 6 months after our last refi. Recall that our normal 3-year term expired last fall when credit markets were unfavorable, so we entered into a 1-year note at LIBOR plus 125 basis points with a 37.5 basis point floor, expecting to refinance again when conditions improved. Our new securitization has a duration of 3 years at LIBOR plus 100 basis points with a floor of 0, so our effective all-in rate is approximately 50 basis points better, given the current level of LIBOR.  
We've also just completed a refinance of our Term B credit facility, upsizing it to $1.15 billion for a new term of 7 years and maintaining the rate of LIBOR plus 175 basis points. We used the proceeds to pay off our existing Term B note, pay down the revolver, fund the AFEX acquisition and improve our liquidity position for future capital actions. 
We repurchased approximately 640,000 shares during the quarter for $170 million at an average price of $266 per share, and we have approximately $836 million in repurchase capacity remaining under our current authorization.  
Now let me share some thoughts on our outlook. We are maintaining our full year revenue guidance of between $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion as improvements in some businesses such as domestic airline lodging are being offset by other places like Brazil and Europe that are experiencing incremental virus flare-ups and associated lockdowns. 
As we explained last quarter, our full year guidance assumes we recover about 1/3 of our Q4 exit revenue softness during calendar 2021, and that this recovery would account for about 4 to 5 percentage points of revenue growth in the second half.  
Within that expectation, there is very little recovery impact assumed for Q1, a modest amount for Q2 and then an acceleration into the back half of the year. While we are seeing some puts and takes between businesses, our overall outlook remains intact. You can see our full updated guidance and assumptions in both our press release and our earnings supplement, so I won't reiterate them here.  
We are raising the midpoint of our adjusted net income per diluted share guidance $0.12 to $12.42 to reflect our first quarter results compared to our expectations. Looking ahead, we are expecting Q2 2021 adjusted net income per diluted share to be in the range of $2.80 to $3 per share. Volumes should build throughout the year with the COVID recovery and our new growth initiatives gaining momentum.  
As for AFEX, the closing is taking longer than we had hoped, but we still believe the deal will close by the end of the second quarter as we're nearing the finish line with all of the approvals we need from the various regulators globally. Because of the delay, the in-year benefit will be slightly less than what we expected in February. But the upside is that we've had more time to refine our integration plans, so we'll hit the ground running at full speed once we do close. 
With that said, operator, we'll open it up for questions."

In terms of the first part of the question, the sales, the answer is yes, kind of all the segments. I think I called out the fuel card businesses were ahead of the prior year, so was the corporate payments business. So really strength virtually everywhere, except, I'd say, Brazil. Brazil was a bit softer than we had outlooked mostly because of the COVID situation. So with that exception, really, the sales were super terrific. 
Yes. On the Corpay question, again, the answer is yes. I mean, again, as I mentioned earlier, it's unifying all of the products, which helps in a lot of ways, to your point. It helps not only with the UI in terms of being able to cross-sell and showcase but it also helps at the top of the funnel, being able to promote a broader line of things to prospective clients that are earlier in the cycle because who knows, per se, which product may be interesting at that moment? So we think there'll be benefits both engaging prospects at the top of the funnel, and then once we've got a client on one of the products, it would facilitate our ability to cross-sell it.

But then the second one, to your point is, yes, we'll go out directly to SMB prospects. And clearly, digital has now become, I don't think 60% of our fuel card sales. We're getting lots of new smaller accounts via that channel. And we have a lot of other assets in corporate pay to be able to monetize it, for example, in the back end with our merchant network in terms of putting some of the payments through virtual cards. So we think that we can go out with pretty attractive proposals, if you will, out to the prospective accounts and still make a bunch of money, if you will, on the back end.

We've, I think going back to the baseline of 2019, more than doubled the spend and revenue in that business. And I think we've got a plan to sell this year in '21 like 60% or 70% of the base of that business. So that business was picking over $50 million. We've got a plan to sell $35 million or $40 million.

In terms of the seasonality and sequential revenue within fuel, what I'd say is I'd remind you that we do have some COVID recovery planned in our forecast.

So when you have a mix of less new to existing, you'll have lower credit losses. So those couple of things will make it a bit better.

The first one, which I think I mentioned in my opening comment, is we have the luxury of seeing April volume. So I'd say the first thing is we're actually seeing the thaw, if you will, in some of that same-store stuff, so some recovery literally already in some of the lines in April. 
And so our expectation -- my expectation is Q2 here is going to be the thawing that will move off of that 6% kind of flat line and see less of that, right, in this quarter. And then the second one, to your point, is we studied it to death here and it's just a super narrow set of clients again. So when we go in and look at the, call it, that 6% overall or consolidated softness and you run the distribution, you've got 1 decile that accounts for 100% of it. 
It's just there's a narrow set of clients that are in super impacted -- movie theater companies, cruise line companies, you name it, we've got clients that are in super hurt businesses. And so we're seeing, again, some that aren't that impacted already coming back in April. And my -- our sense, which is kind of built a bit into our guidance, is that some of those that are still significantly down will start to rebound here in the second half."

I did call out the U.K., but as you know, we do have broader businesses in more countries over there. We're on the continent in 4 or 5 countries. We're in Russia. We're in Australia, New Zealand. And so to me, the fascinating thing is just how different the recovery and the softness is across those 5, 6, 7 countries would be the first call out. Like Russia is kind of -- I don't know if they had COVID, is booming again. And Australia and New Zealand are celebrating. They'd rid the thing. We see huge rebounds there. The U.K., the thawing is happening here in the second quarter. The Czech is going backwards. So the first comment is it's just incredibly kind of pocketed by place. 
And then the second one is really the comment I made to Tien-Tsin, which is it's incredibly, in our case, narrowly focused on a very, very small set of clients that again are causing the overall number, right, the consolidated number to be negative. And so those are the 2 things we see. And I did mention, and I think we're super surprised by the Brazil thing. Probably like others, we didn't anticipate that coming into the year that, that thing would get worse and that they would raise the restrictions and stuff.

And so the combination of those 2 things is what caused us to basically upsize the facility now. So that's kind of the short-term thing that we try to obviously prepare our liquidity situation for the pipeline that we see. 
But I think longer term, we really don't think about it that way. Deals are bumpy. Sometimes you spend a lot of money in a year. Sometimes we don't spend a lot, and we'd have enormous opportunities for liquidity based on where our leverage ratio is and the cash that we generate. So we really, I think, try to think about it short term, when we see a situation where we've got some stuff lined up. And then longer term, we really just focus it, honestly, on the M&A side. 
We look for super attractive things we have conviction in and then back our way into how to pay for it versus the other way around. But on your other comment, if we don't like our stock price, which obviously, there's been times we don't, we'll obviously increase liquidity and buy back shares.

And we talked to you about how we're going to get paid for it. The fact that real clients are paying meaningful amounts of subscription does help equalize, to your point, the economics of this thing as this thing converts. 
In addition, obviously, I try to say it a bit on the call is during this transition time, I really love our chances because it creates an advantage, right, as the company adds 10 new EV things, it's hard for anyone who doesn't already have the incumbency position and data on all the vehicles to go sell a guy some kind of phone, mobile solution or something to deal with the 10. Like why would they ever want that when we've made our card and mobile programs work at all the public EV recharging places as well as at home? 
And so in a kind of a really interesting twist here, the old-fashioned fuel car guy actually has the advantage because you can't blink and change out the installed base of all the vehicles in a day without obviously flushing a lot of value. So I'd say, as this thing has manifested itself, we're feeling better and better about the economic model of the future."

So we've got a lot of experience in the company by category of the translation of what we call new bookings or sales will start to roll call, right, the recognition of a new account. And when it converts, to your point, into in-year revenue, and that conversion rate varies a tremendous amount by the products we have. 
So for example, in fuel cards, it's probably 50%. If you sold $100 million, you'd get $50 million in-year. Or Brazil, if you sold $100 million, you might get $60 million or $70 million. But if you sold corporate pay in the middle market, you might get $20 million. So the conversion rates vary tremendously by the product category. But what I would say is, clearly, we're good at math, and so we built our '21 plan and guidance anticipating good sales. 
These sales were above what we did plan. But generally, that's all cooked into the plan and the guidance that we have. And so the biggest help is what I said, if we make this plan, which would be up over 30%, right? As you go into the next quarter, it's like we'll probably double Q2 sales because it was pretty low, but hopefully, be up over 30% for the full year. You've got lots of those categories like corporate pay where that revenue pours into '22. So people should listen carefully to the sales numbers, which I did try to call out.

But what I mentioned is, selectively, we see areas where sequentially, the volumes are starting to come back to par, if you will. And even against the base period of 2019, we're seeing growth. 
So just to call out one, like in our international fuel card business, for example, which we kind of break into 4 markets, the U.K., Russia, Central Europe and Australia, 3 of those, the volumes in April are higher than they were in April of '19. And the 1 that's not is Central Europe, where again, the COVID restrictions are still in place. So we're seeing same in corporate pay. We see areas like the virtual card business that's way ahead of its baseline from April. The full AP, I think, I mentioned is more than double. The cross-border business is up. So a lot of the businesses are now, in April, ahead of their '19 baseline. 
There's a handful of stubborn ones that I mentioned that are more COVID-impacted like again, Central Europe, like the T&E card, which requires people like us to travel. Like the airline lodging business that we bought, it's coming back, but it's still soft against the prior period. So there's a handful 3 or 4 areas that are pretty stubborn and then 8, 10 areas that we're seeing the thing come back. So as I said, our view is we're going to see a change in same-store this quarter, Q2. And then we plan a pretty significant recovery again in Q3 and Q4, which will pour revenue and, more importantly, profit dollars into the second half."

We actually had our Board meeting last week and actually covered this particular subject, competing in this strange time that we're in. And I think the couple of comments I'd give you is, one, we tried to build plans to invest more -- differentially more in that business than some of our others to try to target that business closer to 20% on the top versus kind of 10%, if you will, for the consolidated company. So that's point one, that inherent in our base plans, our overall profit plan, there's incremental investment to grow faster already. 
And then second, I think the conclusion that we got to coming out of the Board meeting on this is it depends on the investment. So if there's a clear investment we can make that's got an attractive return profile, we'll be back to you and the buy side with, ""Hey, look, we're going to slow earnings a bit, whatever, if we think we can make some great return."" But again, it's got to be a return we can execute. So hey, if it's hire 100 people, I've told you a bunch of times, that's hard to add all those people execution-wise and make it work, versus if we could pour money into the top of the funnel of the digital thing, which is one of the lot -- reasons we did this Corpay unification, that might be a basis, right, where we could spend money effectively and see good returns. 
So I'd say nothing staring us in the face now. We've got lots of money, incremental capital. I think we're spending $20 million, $25 million of incremental capital above last year in IT. Half of that's in corporate pay. We're spending more in sales. And so if we got the right kind of investment, I think the answer is we would do it."

So the answer is, obviously, it's recovering. It was one of those businesses hurt really the most a year ago. So we've gotten a lot of it back already in the workforce side. And I'd say we're probably half of the way back. In fact, it's the 1 area that outperformed the COVID recovery in the first quarter. For each line of business, we plan a certain amount of softness, if you will, coming back, and the airline business actually came back faster than we planned. 
So I think it's on track, depending on what happens over the next couple of months, to have a huge recovery, right, in the second half. And we're selling a lot. Like I'm looking at the sales, we continue to sell a lot in that business. We've got some attractive adjacencies in the business. It's probably our highest margin business.

And then to your point, the deal we've announced and a couple we're working on will be, as I've mentioned before, quite accretive. And so it all points, I tried to say it in the thing, I think the business, because of the pain we took last year, is particularly well set up to get a good number in '22. And then what I'd say to you is we like our chances after that because we're diversifying the space, right, in the businesses, the fuel card thing chasing EV and launching, chasing new categories and getting into SMB and corporate payments. We're not sitting still just kind of twiddling the places that we're in, David. 
And so I think it's -- I think we sit here more optimistic about the future because we're coming out. We're freaking coming out, finally coming out of the woods here and can kind of see the other side, and that sets up well for us. So I'd say, '22 will be better and then we like our chances after that."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q2 earnings call. Upfront here, I'll plan to cover 3 subjects. First, I'll share my perspective on our Q2 results, along with rest of your outlook. Second, I'll provide an update on our 2 newest acquisitions. And then lastly, I'll talk about our fuel card business, including our latest view on EV, along with a couple of innovative developments underway in that business. 
Okay. Let me turn to our Q2 results. So very pleased to report outstanding Q2 financial results meaningfully above our internal expectations. We reported Q2 revenue of $667 million that's up 27% and cash EPS of $3.15, up 38%. Both our Q2 '21 revenue and cash EPS exceeded our Q2 '19 results, so finally moving past our pre-pandemic baseline. Organic revenue growth came in at 23% for the quarter, our full AP outsourcing platform segment up 53% versus Q2 last year. 
The trends in the quarter are really quite good. Our same store sales metric improved to plus 18%, so hardness of 18%, many of the sectors in our client base recovering. Retention, record level, we reached nearly 94%, an all-time high since we've been reporting the metric. And interestingly, our global fuel card business reached 92% retention, also an all-time high. Credit losses remain very good, running at historic levels and sales outstanding in the quarter finishing up almost 2x last year's Q2 and up 6% against 2019. 
Okay. Let me transition to our view of the rest of the year. So today, we're raising guidance to $2.765 billion at the midpoint for full year revenue, raising cash EPS at the midpoint to $12.90. That's driven by our Q2 beat, the AFEX close and really the momentum that we have running into the second half. I do want to remind everyone we had previously guided to a pretty substantial second half sequential step-up already. As a reminder, cash EPS guidance up nearly $0.60 from the start of the year. So we opened the year at $12.30; today, $12.90, so obviously, better than we outlooked. 
The second half guidance implies a few things. So first, the revenue growth will run about 20% ahead of last year and high single digits really above the second half 2019 baseline. So we are expecting the business to reach all-time highs again in both revenues and profits. Our Q4 EPS profit guidance implies nearly a $14 annualized cash EPS exit rate. 
Okay. Let me transition now to an update on our recent acquisitions. So as a reminder, we closed AFEX -- that's the add-on cross-border deal, on June 1. And then last week, we signed definitive documents to acquire ALE, which is a lodging provider to the insurance vertical. 
So let me start with ALE, really a highly complementary add-on to our existing lodging business, and that company brings a whole set of specialized capabilities designed just to serve the insurance vertical. So we've got a pretty interesting synergy plan for that business and expect accelerated revenue and profit growth next year. 
We're also well underway on our AFEX integration. We've already exited about $10 million of run rate payroll expense. We've implemented one unified cross-border management organization, and we've designed an IT consolidation plan to move to a single system. That will significantly reduce run rate IT and operations expense. 
So look, both of these acquisitions, classic FLEET wheelhouse deals. We paid reasonable prices. There are extensions of our existing business -- so we know them well, and both have very rich synergy opportunities. we're expecting the businesses to grow about 20% on the top on a pro forma basis next year and together deliver incremental cash EPS in 2022 in the $0.50 to $0.70 range, so big upside. So obviously, we are quite enthusiastic about the transactions. 
All right. Let me shift gears now and talk a bit about our fuel card business, which we continue to love and which we think has a bright future. So I'll talk a bit about EV, the latest and greatest, and then talk about innovation and specifically 2 new things that we're doing to improve the growth prospects of our fuel card business. 
So starting out with EV. I mentioned last time, we're really embracing EV as an opportunity and in no way see it putting an end to our fuel card business. Employers are going to need to reimburse employees for recharging electric vehicles much like they reimburse employees for refueling combustion engines. And I think you may find that it costs more to operate EV than people think. 
We also think there'll be some new economics and that we've got an opportunity to achieve, very similar economics from EV measuring and reimbursing as we do from combustion engines. We've included a couple of EV exhibits in our Q2 earnings supplement. You'll see some comparisons of spend where the cost of public charging is about 70% of fossil fuel charging. And then because there's more attractive MDR rates, we believe that we can achieve pretty interesting revenue there as well. In a nutshell, we expect the at-home software subscription fees to be pretty significant and augment a number of the other fees that we get in the revenue mix. 
We are outlooking the commercial transition to EV to be slow, particularly here in the U.S., giving us ample time to build out our public charging network and implement recharging at home. We expect mixed fleets to be how things start out. So our incumbent position should give us quite an advantage in consolidating activity and data for our clients. So look, in conclusion, we're outlooking EV to really just be a different way to serve commercial fleets but one in which we think can still be attractive. 
All right. Let me leave EV and cut over to the couple of innovations that we're working in the fuel card business. So first is digital and particularly digital selling, which now in Q2 has reached about 60% of all our new fuel card sales globally coming to us digitally. So lots of improvements in our digital selling capabilities. We've got automated keyword bidding now. We've redesigned our websites to maximize sales conversion, and we're beginning investments at the top of the funnel in the form of digital TV, radio, Facebook advertising, which is driving about 50% more visitors to our websites, so obviously leading to incremental sales. 
The last innovation I'd like to touch on is our effort to transform our fuel card UI, which is used by over 100,000 clients, really into a broader payment platform. So we're combining our newest cloud-based SMB bill pay platform with our fuel card so that clients go on to pay us the fuel card bill that they'd have the option then of paying additional vendors with the same software platform. So this idea is really aimed at accelerating the number of active bill pay clients we can add to our platform and again beginning the transformation of the fuel card business into a corporate payments business. So we'll keep you updated there as we go. 
So look, in closing, 3 thoughts for you. So one, on '21, again, we're pleased with Q2, particularly the record retention and record sales levels. And again, our second half outlook calls for new all-time highs again in revenue and profits. 
Second, on the fuel card business, again, we think the prospects are bright for the business. We do have a plan to monetize EV adoption by providing some new services and particularly measuring and reimbursing at-home recharging. We've got an opportunity to keep stepping up digital sales and digital advertising at the top of the funnel. We think we can drive incremental visitors and incremental sales. And we're launching a bill pay cross-sell opportunity to our fuel card clients again by turning our existing fuel UI into a broader payment platform. 
And lastly, although early, we're quite encouraged by our 2022 setup. Our second half guidance calls for nearly $7 in cash EPS for the second half or approximately $14 annualized, again forecasting record sales for the full year, which will flow revenue into next year. We'll roll off $1 billion in interest rate hedges in January. That will free up about $0.20 of incremental cash EPS; and lastly, our 2 newest acquisitions, hoping to contribute in the $0.50 to $0.70 range of incremental cash EPS. So look, taken together a lot to like about our 2022 setup. 
So with that, let me turn the call back over to Chuck. He'll provide some additional details on the quarter. Chuck?"

I'm delighted to share with you the results of a very good quarter. For Q2 of 2021, we reported revenue of $667 million, up 27%; GAAP net income up 24% to $196 million; and GAAP net income per diluted share up 26% to $2.30. Adjusted net incom",1340,"Thanks, Ron. I'm delighted to share with you the results of a very good quarter. For Q2 of 2021, we reported revenue of $667 million, up 27%; GAAP net income up 24% to $196 million; and GAAP net income per diluted share up 26% to $2.30. Adjusted net income for the quarter, or ANI, increased 36% to $268 million and ANI per diluted share increased 38% to $3.15 as we finally lapped the worst of COVID. Organic revenue growth improved 29 points sequentially to up 23% on a year-over-year basis, driven by strong sales, record retention levels and same-store sales recovery. 
Looking at organic growth across the categories. Corporate payments was up 32% in the second quarter, led by our full AP solutions. We are seeing very good success leading with our full AP and selling a more complete package versus just a stand-alone virtual card offering. Full AP is clearly what we prefer to sell, so we've reoriented our combined sales force with this focus, and it's paying off. 
T&E card revenue was up 58% year-over-year, rebounding significantly as business activity and travel began to resume. This T&E description is a bit of a misnomer as it's really a multipurpose card that can be used as either a purchasing card or is walk-around plastic depending on how the customer wants to use it. And while spending within T&E-related categories has rebounded, it's still below historical levels. So there's clearly room for further improvement there. 
Cross-border revenue was up 25%. These results do include 1 month of AFEX with pro forma results for Q2 last year, so which is if we owned it in both periods. And finally, virtual card revenue was up 13%. Both of these areas are still affected by COVID softness in industries that we've discussed before, like airlines, cruise operators, hotels and restaurants, international trade and commercial construction to a lesser extent. We do believe much of this softness is recoverable, but the timing is hard to predict. 
Fuel was up organically 19% year-over-year with strong retention trends and record digital sales helping to drive the performance. We still see opportunities for further softness recoveries in fuel once the labor shortage affecting our large trucking fleet customer subsides and offices reopen more broadly so our white-collar commuters can return to normal activity levels. 
Tolls was up 9% compared with last year and showed impressive performance in light of the lockdowns in place for much of the quarter. This growth was driven by record first half tag sales, demonstrating the value proposition and attractiveness of our offerings even when many folks aren't driving on the roads. And approximately 1/4 of all consumer tags sold year-to-date are signed up to urban plans, which allow purchases beyond tolls, such as for parking, fueling and fast food. We also added 25% more fuel stations to our tag acceptance network during the first half with plans to add another 50% during the second half. The combination of urban tag sales and non-toll network expansion should produce Beyond total volume growth as lockdowns ease and consumer activity increases. 
Lodging was up 39%, with workforce up 36%. The pace of improvement in workforce lodging has leveled off some as customers are being held back by the labor shortage, but we feel this volume will come back over time as the labor market normalizes. Airline lodging was up 49% as domestic air travel recovered faster than expected but still remains below historical norms. International airline lodging should come back as international air travel recovers. So despite the sizable recovery in lodging, we still see upside potential here. 
Gift organic growth was 22% year-over-year, benefiting from continued retailer embrace of the online sales channel. We expect this trend to continue as we are experiencing success with gift clients using our proprietary platform to sell both digital and physical cards online. In fact, we expect to double the number of clients utilizing this platform by year-end. Momentum in mobile wallet services and B2B sales, where third parties sell gift cards to companies for use as employee incentives and rewards, are also contributing to the improvement. 
Looking further down the income statement. Our operating expenses were up 18% to $370 million, totaling 55% of revenue. The increase was primarily due to higher levels of business activity, the effect of currency translation impact on international expenses and acquisitions. We've also made incremental investments in digital sales and top-of-funnel marketing efforts and incurred some nonrecurring integration-related expenses for AFEX, such as severance and platform migration costs. Operating margins improved 4 points from last year to 45% due to recovering volumes that have higher margins, higher fuel prices and solid expense control. 
In the quarter, bad debt was $6 million or 2 basis points. Credit performance continues to be strong, although we do expect our bad debt to normalize as our new sales improve and grow. Interest expense increased 7% to $34.7 million due to a $6.2 million charge associated with our debt refinance, a higher balance on the new Term B note partially offset by lower borrowings on our revolver and lower LIBOR rates on the unhedged portion of our debt. 
Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 25.2%, similar to last year, and reflects a $6.5 million adjustment to our deferred tax position due to a rate change in the U.K. In our guidance, we are increasing our expected tax rate for the year given this adjustment and an assumed lower level of excess tax benefits on stock option exercises in the second half. 
Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of unrestricted cash. We also had approximately $1.2 billion of undrawn availability on our revolver. In total, we had $4.1 billion outstanding on our credit facilities and $1 billion borrowed on our securitization facility. As of June 30, our leverage ratio was 2.62x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA as calculated in accordance with our credit agreement. 
We repurchased approximately 926,000 shares during the quarter for $246 million at an average price of $266 per share. The Board increased our share repurchase authorization by $1 billion on July 27, which now gives us $1.6 billion of share buyback capacity. Now even including the recent buybacks, the AFEX closing and the pending ALE deal, we still have low leverage and ample liquidity for additional deals and/or buybacks. Our high margin, high cash flow business, which generated $268 million of ANI this quarter quickly replenishes capital, allowing us to pursue attractive buying opportunities as they present themselves. 
Now let me share some thoughts on our outlook. We are raising our full year revenue guidance to between $2.74 billion and $2.79 billion, which is up over $100 million at the midpoint. We are also raising our adjusted net income per diluted share guidance to between $12.80 and $13 or $12.90 at the midpoint. AFEX is a big contributor as is a better macro environment in addition to volumes that improved faster than we expected in the first half of the year. We continue to be encouraged by our strong sales and retention trends and currently expect COVID volume recovery to continue through the second half of the year. We are being mindful of the potential impact from the Delta variant, and we'll adjust our outlook and operations as necessary. We are expecting Q3 2021 adjusted net income per diluted share to be in the range of $3.35 to $3.55. 
You can see our full updated guidance and assumptions in our press release, so I won't reiterate them here. I would note that our guidance does not include the impact of the ALE acquisition that we just announced. We'll update for that when we actually close the transaction. 
In closing, I'd like to thank my 8,000-plus FLEETCOR colleagues around the world who persevered through the pandemic, helped us return to growth this quarter and have positioned our company for a strong second half and beyond. 
With that said, operator, we'll open it up for questions."

And I did try to -- I know there's a lot of chitchat in these opening scripts, but I didn't want to just double down on the comment around this digital thing. I tried to call it out, but I'd say it's the most hopeful like for me that I've done. I've taken this question, 100 times, ""Hey, Ron, can you just spend more? Why don't you just invest more in sales and marketing, sell more and all that kind of stuff?"" And I've always said that, ""Hey, we want good returns. We don't waste money."" And practically, it's hard to hire 50% more people and you have turnover. 
So at this time, Tien-tsin, it's a bit different with the digital because you can kind of turn the crank right in a way and generating more visitors. On the call, I said we did that and generated 50% more visitors in Q2 than we had in the trailing baseline quarters.

So the first thing I'd say is it's been different than we planned because Brazil slid into a COVID problem kind of in the February, March period. I believe it's starting to come out. If you look at the curve, it's starting to kind of reopen. So that's the first comment is the activity and people driving obviously less than we planned. 
But what I'd say for this particular thing is it's less credit because we do put some of the stuff on credit cards, and we do have experience with customers that we take money from their bank accounts. So we're -- we've got the credit under control. It's a network issue for us. So we spent a lot of time optimizing the digits on the software that go in parking garages and fuel sites and fast food to get the right performance, to get super high performance and stuff. And so we put a ton of capital. I think, Chuck, it's in the $10 million to $20 million range again to build out. 
So they're adding network like crazy now, which we see already even through this COVID lens volume going up because we've got obviously millions of consumers already that have the tag that just need a gas station or parking garage near them. 
And so I'd say that it's the combo of those 2 things: one, the rate at which we build out the network; and then two, the rate of recovery of people driving around again. So I don't know when those -- that thing will cross the curve, whether it's later this year or the beginning of next.

I think I mentioned it in the top of my comments that were taking the fuel card UI that, what was it, call it 100,000 clients use to go in and pay their bills and basically putting in the Roger payment platform to pay the FLEETCOR bill and offer to pay additional bills. So that thing is actually going live in this month. 
So we'll report back. But I'd say, again, we're -- the category is super high. We've got a super good product. We're selling a few thousands, and we're making sure the quality is good. And were on the 1-yard line here to launch the cross-sell. So early, but I'd say encouraging so far."

So the EV action, if you will, is super pocketed. So we really only see stuff in Europe. So when we convene and we talk about EV and who's doing what, I'd say it's all quiet on the Western front here in all the U.S.A. But we see it in certain markets. It's pretty active, for example, in the Netherlands. It's starting to become active in the U.K. and it's -- interestingly, it's starting with the big accounts. 
And so what we are seeing is the corporate accounts, which I guess are trying to be green or whatever have more money and are willing to kind of dispose of the old-fashioned combustion assets are kind of the early adopters of the thing. So we are seeing some exchange, some transition among our client base at that level at the corporate level. 
And then Part B is what you said. We're trying to get the model player, okay? What spend -- I don't know if had a chance to flip through the supplement we put out. But to me, it's just almost shocking that to drive a van into a EV station in the U.K. or to drive an EV van into a public charge point, it's the same cost of the guy.  The guy spends -- or the gal spend the same amount of money for those -- to fill up or the recharge. I don't know if that would be what people would think. 
But when you look at it based on the efficiency of the vehicles and the markup that the charge point guys are charging right there, you're like, ""Oh, I didn't know that someone like FLEETCOR can actually get paid because there's real spend."" And then this idea that we have live now of actually putting software at the employees' home to -- so he's not burdened with his own electricity costs and putting boxes and that stuff in, we're getting a bunch of money for that and a lot of demand for it. So it's a little of both. It's starting to head this way and then us trying to get out ahead of it so we can articulate what the model looks like."

So our confidence -- my confidence is super high in that kind of $0.50 to $0.70 increment because obviously, they're late coming into our company and the synergies are well as the year goes on. 
And the other thing is something the treasurer took me through a couple of weeks ago that we made a bad hedge or a roll off and so I'm happy. So I just want to make sure people are clear that there's some happy set of things in our business, including the exit rate of the business and these couple of things that we can see.

And so we have all these clients showing up pretty frequently inside our software UI. 
And so what we've done, what we've been working on is taking the Roger bill pay software and basically making it the bill payment system of record. So when you go into the UI and look over to pay something, that platform is working. So we don't really have to rebuild the bill pay platform in the network as we got that already. And obviously, we have all those capabilities from our other businesses, merchant networks and the deals we have with our friends at MasterCard. We have all that other stuff vendors that do paper making and everything. 
So really, it's just customers. It's just seeing if the accounts are comfortable using the UI to do more than just pay us. And we'll have certainly a report for you back, but the numbers are just staggeringly big, right? It's over 100,000 just here in the United States are paying a bill every month on these UIs. So we're hopeful, I don't know if you want to call it the super app, but the idea is more and more people are using these software apps with us.

I don't think you could ask them that they've done a lot today of combining the pay with the software, but I know that that's their ambition. 
So what I'd say is for a year or 2, we've studied and looked at a bunch of companies that have software that's kind of up the value chain, right, AP automation, scheduling approval, workflow software and even on top of that kind of procurement contract compliance kind of software that you've mentioned. Our take on it is it will be all of the above, which means some clients will just take that AP automation software like they do from Coupa and not to pay. Some people will just take pay like what we offer, and some people will take both. And I think I've repeated that we probably will offer that. We probably will offer the both. I don't know if we'll offer the stand-alone AP automation software or not, but that's our take that based on the size of the company and the industry that they're in and the research that we've done is it won't be one size fits all. It's not like everybody is going to do it one way. 
So we think it's a good idea. It's something that we'll look probably to offer. We do partner with people where we offer the pay into their software. So we're studying how well they're doing it. I call it, peanut butter and jelly. Is it going to be peanut butter and jelly? Or is it going to be not peanut butter and jelly. So I think the jury is still out on."

We've actually sold more year-to-date in the forecast. So the second half is actually higher in fuel than the plan that we built. So most of the overperformance against our internal expectations is fuel, and most of that overperformance is digital selling. We keep growing the share of new digital accounts that we're onboarding. And as I mentioned, we're investing more at the top to try to drive that. So that's the overperformance. 
I'd say everything else is kind of mostly on plan. We're super pleased with it. As you mentioned, the plan is up -- way, way up from last year and even up against '19. So I'd say everybody else is kind of delivering what we hope for. 
On Part B, who knows on the infrastructure bill. I'd say, first, tell me what infrastructure is. And if it's like what it would be, what you think it would be, which is kind of fixing stuff and construction-centric, it could help us a lot.

And so I'd say the same thing that if that comes to pass and gets funded and its regular old fashion kind of infrastructure where stuff gets built, we're pretty weighted concentrated in that construction segment. So it's got to help us. If there's more money and more work for those sets of companies, that will flow through to us. I'm not counting on it, George, by the way. It's a political thing.

And then lastly, I'll talk about our fuel card business, including our latest view on EV, along with a couple of innovative developments underway in that business.  
Okay. Let me turn to our Q2 results. So very pleased to report outstanding Q2 financial results meaningfully above our internal expectations. We reported Q2 revenue of $667 million that's up 27% and cash EPS of $3.15, up 38%. Both our Q2 '21 revenue and cash EPS exceeded our Q2 '19 results, so finally moving past our pre-pandemic baseline. Organic revenue growth came in at 23% for the quarter, our full AP outsourcing platform segment up 53% versus Q2 last year.  
The trends in the quarter are really quite good. Our same store sales metric improved to plus 18%, so hardness of 18%, many of the sectors in our client base recovering. Retention, record level, we reached nearly 94%, an all-time high since we've been reporting the metric. And interestingly, our global fuel card business reached 92% retention, also an all-time high. Credit losses remain very good, running at historic levels. And sales outstanding in the quarter finishing up almost 2x last year's Q2 and up 6% against 2019.  
Okay. Let me transition to our view of the rest of the year. So today, we're raising guidance to $2.765 billion at the midpoint for full year revenue, raising cash EPS at the midpoint to $12.90. That's driven by our Q2 beat, the AFEX close and really the momentum that we have running into the second half. I do want to remind everyone we had previously guided to a pretty substantial second half sequential step-up already. As a reminder, cash EPS guidance up nearly $0.60 from the start of the year. So we opened the year at $12.30; today, $12.90, so obviously, better than we outlooked.  
The second half guidance implies a few things. So first, the revenue growth will run about 20% ahead of last year and high single digits really above the second half 2019 baseline. So we are expecting the business to reach all-time highs again in both revenues and profits. Our Q4 EPS profit guidance implies nearly a $14 annualized cash EPS exit rate.  
Okay. Let me transition now to an update on our recent acquisitions. So as a reminder, we closed AFEX, that's the add-on cross-border deal, on June 1. And then last week, we signed definitive documents to acquire ALE, which is a lodging provider to the insurance vertical.  
So let me start with ALE, really a highly complementary add-on to our existing lodging business, and that company brings a whole set of specialized capabilities designed just to serve the insurance vertical. So we've got a pretty interesting synergy plan for that business and expect accelerated revenue and profit growth next year.  
We're also well underway on our AFEX integration. We've already exited about $10 million of run rate payroll expense. We've implemented one unified cross-border management organization, and we've designed an IT consolidation plan to move to a single system. That will significantly reduce run rate IT and operations expense.  
So look, both of these acquisitions, classic FLEET wheelhouse deals. We paid reasonable prices. They're extensions of our existing business, so we know them well. And both have very rich synergy opportunities. we're expecting the businesses to grow about 20% on the top on a pro forma basis next year and together deliver incremental cash EPS in 2022 in the $0.50 to $0.70 range, so big upside. So obviously, we are quite enthusiastic about the transactions.  
All right. Let me shift gears now and talk a bit about our fuel card business, which we continue to love and which we think has a bright future. So I'll talk a bit about EV, the latest and greatest, and then talk about innovation and specifically 2 new things that we're doing to improve the growth prospects of our fuel card business.  
So starting out with EV. I mentioned last time, we're really embracing EV as an opportunity and in no way see it putting an end to our fuel card business. Employers are going to need to reimburse employees for recharging electric vehicles much like they reimburse employees for refueling combustion engines. And I think you may find that it costs more to operate EV than people think.  
We also think there'll be some new economics and that we've got an opportunity to achieve, very similar economics from EV measuring and reimbursing as we do from combustion engines. We've included a couple of EV exhibits in our Q2 earnings supplement. You'll see some comparisons of spend where the cost of public charging is about 70% of fossil fuel charging. And then because there's more attractive MDR rates, we believe that we can achieve pretty interesting revenue there as well.  
In a nutshell, we expect the at-home software subscription fees to be pretty significant and augment a number of the other fees that we get in the revenue mix.  
We are outlooking the commercial transition to EV to be slow, particularly here in the U.S., giving us ample time to build out our public charging network and implement recharging at home. We expect mixed fleets to be how things start out. So our incumbent position should give us quite an advantage in consolidating activity and data for our clients. So look, in conclusion, we're outlooking EV to really just be a different way to serve commercial fleets but one in which we think can still be attractive.  
All right. Let me leave EV and cut over to the couple of innovations that we're working in the fuel card business. So first is digital and particularly digital selling, which now in Q2 has reached about 60% of all our new fuel card sales globally coming to us digitally. So lots of improvements in our digital selling capabilities. We've got automated keyword bidding now. We've redesigned our websites to maximize sales conversion, and we're beginning investments at the top of the funnel in the form of digital TV, radio, Facebook advertising, which is driving about 50% more visitors to our websites, so obviously leading to incremental sales.  
The last innovation I'd like to touch on is our effort to transform our fuel card UI, which is used by over 100,000 clients, really into a broader payment platform. So we're combining our newest cloud-based SMB bill pay platform with our fuel card UI so that clients go on to pay us the fuel card bill that they'd have the option then of paying additional vendors with the same software platform. So this idea is really aimed at accelerating the number of active bill pay clients we can add to our platform and again beginning the transformation of the fuel card business into a corporate payments business. So we'll keep you updated there as we go.  
So look, in closing, 3 thoughts for you. So one, on '21, again, we're pleased with Q2, particularly the record retention and record sales levels. And again, our second half outlook calls for new all-time highs again in revenue and profits. Second, on the fuel card business, again, we think the prospects are bright for the business. We do have a plan to monetize EV adoption by providing some new services and particularly measuring and reimbursing at-home recharging. We've got an opportunity to keep stepping up digital sales and digital advertising at the top of the funnel. We think we can drive incremental visitors and incremental sales. And we're launching a bill pay cross-sell opportunity to our fuel card clients again by turning our existing fuel UI into a broader payment platform.  
And lastly, although early, we're quite encouraged by our 2022 setup. Our second half guidance calls for nearly $7 in cash EPS for the second half or approximately $14 annualized, again forecasting record sales for the full year, which will flow revenue into next year. Will roll off $1 billion in interest rate hedges in January. That will free up about $0.20 of incremental cash EPS. And lastly, our 2 newest acquisitions, hoping to contribute in the $0.50 to $0.70 range of incremental cash EPS. So look, taken together a lot to like about our 2022 setup.  
So with that, let me turn the call back over to Chuck. He'll provide some additional details on the quarter. Chuck?"
28756,1675237410,2363450,"FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2021",2021-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Corpay, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ron. I'm delighted to share with you the results of a very good quarter. For Q2 of 2021, we reported revenue of $667 million, up 27%; GAAP net income up 24% to $196 million; and GAAP net income per diluted share up 26% to $2.30. Adjusted net incom",1340,"Thanks, Ron. I'm delighted to share with you the results of a very good quarter. For Q2 of 2021, we reported revenue of $667 million, up 27%; GAAP net income up 24% to $196 million; and GAAP net income per diluted share up 26% to $2.30. Adjusted net income for the quarter, or ANI, increased 36% to $268 million and ANI per diluted share increased 38% to $3.15 as we finally lapped the worst of COVID. Organic revenue growth improved 29 points sequentially to up 23% on a year-over-year basis, driven by strong sales, record retention levels and same-store sales recovery.  
Looking at organic growth across the categories. Corporate payments was up 32% in the second quarter, led by our full AP solutions. We are seeing very good success leading with our full AP and selling a more complete package versus just a stand-alone virtual card offering. Full AP is clearly what we prefer to sell, so we've reoriented our combined sales force with this focus, and it's paying off.  
T&E card revenue was up 58% year-over-year, rebounding significantly as business activity and travel began to resume. This T&E description is a bit of a misnomer as it's really a multipurpose card that can be used as either a purchasing card or as walk-around plastic, depending on how the customer wants to use it. And while spending within T&E-related categories has rebounded, it's still below historical levels. So there's clearly room for further improvement there.  
Cross-border revenue was up 25%. These results do include 1 month of AFEX with pro forma results for Q2 last year, so which is if we owned it in both periods. And finally, virtual card revenue was up 13%. Both of these areas are still affected by COVID softness in industries that we've discussed before, like airlines, cruise operators, hotels and restaurants, international trade and commercial construction to a lesser extent. We do believe much of this softness is recoverable, but the timing is hard to predict.  
Fuel was up organically 19% year-over-year with strong retention trends and record digital sales helping to drive the performance. We still see opportunities for further softness recoveries in fuel once the labor shortage affecting our large trucking fleet customer subsides and offices reopen more broadly so our white-collar commuters can return to normal activity levels.  
Tolls was up 9% compared with last year and showed impressive performance in light of the lockdowns in place for much of the quarter. This growth was driven by record first half tag sales, demonstrating the value proposition and attractiveness of our offerings even when many folks aren't driving on the roads. And approximately 1/4 of all consumer tags sold year-to-date are signed up to urban plans, which allow purchases beyond tolls, such as for parking, fueling and fast food. We also added 25% more fuel stations to our tag acceptance network during the first half with plans to add another 50% during the second half. The combination of urban tag sales and non-toll network expansion should produce Beyond total volume growth as lockdowns ease and consumer activity increases.  
Lodging was up 39%, with workforce up 36%. The pace of improvement in workforce lodging has leveled off some as customers are being held back by the labor shortage, but we feel this volume will come back over time as the labor market normalizes. Airline lodging was up 49% as domestic air travel recovered faster than expected but still remains below historical norms. International airline lodging should come back as international air travel recovers. So despite the sizable recovery in lodging, we still see upside potential here.  
Gift organic growth was 22% year-over-year, benefiting from continued retailer embrace of the online sales channel. We expect this trend to continue as we are experiencing success with gift clients using our proprietary platform to sell both digital and physical cards online. In fact, we expect to double the number of clients utilizing this platform by year-end. Momentum in mobile wallet services and B2B sales, where third parties sell gift cards to companies for use as employee incentives and rewards, are also contributing to the improvement.  
Looking further down the income statement. Our operating expenses were up 18% to $370 million, totaling 55% of revenue. The increase was primarily due to higher levels of business activity, the effect of currency translation impact on international expenses and acquisitions. We've also made incremental investments in digital sales and top-of-funnel marketing efforts and incurred some nonrecurring integration-related expenses for AFEX, such as severance and platform migration costs. Operating margins improved 4 points from last year to 45% due to recovering volumes that have higher margins, higher fuel prices and solid expense control.  
In the quarter, bad debt was $6 million or 2 basis points. Credit performance continues to be strong, although we do expect our bad debt to normalize as our new sales improve and grow. Interest expense increased 7% to $34.7 million due to a $6.2 million charge associated with our debt refinance, a higher balance on the new Term B note partially offset by lower borrowings on our revolver and lower LIBOR rates on the unhedged portion of our debt. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 25.2%, similar to last year, and reflects a $6.5 million adjustment to our deferred tax position due to a rate change in the U.K. In our guidance, we are increasing our expected tax rate for the year given this adjustment and an assumed lower level of excess tax benefits on stock option exercises in the second half.  
Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of unrestricted cash. We also had approximately $1.2 billion of undrawn availability on our revolver. In total, we had $4.1 billion outstanding on our credit facilities and $1 billion borrowed on our securitization facility. As of June 30, our leverage ratio was 2.62x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA as calculated in accordance with our credit agreement.  
We repurchased approximately 926,000 shares during the quarter for $246 million at an average price of $266 per share. The Board increased our share repurchase authorization by $1 billion on July 27, which now gives us $1.6 billion of share buyback capacity. Now even including the recent buybacks, the AFEX closing and the pending ALE deal, we still have low leverage and ample liquidity for additional deals and/or buybacks. Our high margin, high cash flow business, which generated $268 million of ANI this quarter quickly replenishes capital, allowing us to pursue attractive buying opportunities as they present themselves.  
Now let me share some thoughts on our outlook. We are raising our full year revenue guidance to between $2.74 billion and $2.79 billion, which is up over $100 million at the midpoint. We are also raising our adjusted net income per diluted share guidance to between $12.80 and $13 or $12.90 at the midpoint. AFEX is a big contributor as is a better macro environment in addition to volumes that improved faster than we expected in the first half of the year. We continue to be encouraged by our strong sales and retention trends and currently expect COVID volume recovery to continue through the second half of the year. We are being mindful of the potential impact from the Delta variant, and we'll adjust our outlook and operations as necessary.  
We are expecting Q3 2021 adjusted net income per diluted share to be in the range of $3.35 to $3.55.  
You can see our full updated guidance and assumptions in our press release, so I won't reiterate them here. I would note that our guidance does not include the impact of the ALE acquisition that we just announced. We'll update for that when we actually close the transaction.  
In closing, I'd like to thank my 8,000-plus FLEETCOR colleagues around the world who persevered through the pandemic, helped us return to growth this quarter and have positioned our company for a strong second half and beyond.  
With that said, operator, we'll open it up for questions."

I tried to call it out, but I'd say it's the most hopeful like for me that I've done. I've taken this question, 100 times of, hey, Ron, can you just spend more? Why don't you just invest more in sales and marketing, sell more and all that kind of stuff? And I've always said that, hey, we want good returns. We don't waste money.

So at this time, Tien-Tsin, it's a bit different with the digital because you can kind of turn the crank, right, in a way and generating more visitors. On the call, I said we did that and generated 50% more visitors in Q2 than we had in the trailing baseline quarters. So that's the one place I'd say there's a ray of light there of us being able maybe to really step up the digital sales even more."

If you look at the curve, it's starting to kind of reopen. So that's the first comment is the activity and people driving obviously is less than we planned. 
But what I'd say for this particular thing is it's less credit because we do put some of the stuff on credit cards, and we do have experience with customers that we take money from their bank accounts. So we're -- we've got the credit under control. It's a network issue for us. So we spent a lot of time optimizing the digits on the software that go in parking garages and fuel sites and fast food to get the right performance, to get super high performance and stuff. And so we put a ton of capital. I think, Chuck, it's in the $10 million to $20 million range again to build out. 
So they're adding network like crazy now, which we see already even through this COVID lens volume going up because we've got obviously millions of consumers already that have the tag that just need a gas station or parking garage near them. 
And so I'd say that it's the combo of those 2 things: one, the rate at which we build out the network; and then two, the rate of recovery of people driving around again. So I don't know when those -- that thing will cross the curve, whether it's later this year or the beginning of next.

So we'll report back. But I'd say, again, we're -- the category is super high. We've got a super good product. We're selling a few thousands, and we're making sure the quality is good. And were on the 1-yard line here to launch the cross-sell. So early, but I'd say encouraging so far."

So when we convene and we talk about EV and who's doing what, I'd say it's all quiet on the Western front here in old U.S.A. But we see it in certain markets. It's pretty active, for example, in the Netherlands. It's starting to become active in the U.K. and it's -- interestingly, it's starting with the big accounts. 
And so what we are seeing is the corporate accounts, which I guess are trying to be green or whatever have more money and are willing to kind of dispose of the old-fashioned combustion assets are kind of the early adopters of the thing. So we are seeing some exchange, some transition among our client base at that level, at the corporate level. 
And then Part B is what you said. We're trying to get the model clear, okay? What spend -- I don't know if had a chance to flip through the supplement we put out. But to me, it's just almost shocking that to drive a van into a EV station in the U.K. or to drive an EV van into a public charge point, it's the same cost to the guy. The guy spends -- or the gal spends the same amount of money for those -- to fill up or the recharge. Like I don't know if that would be what people would think. 
But when you look at it based on the efficiency of the vehicles and the markup that the charge point guys are charging right there, you're like, oh, I didn't know that someone like FLEETCOR can actually get paid because there's real spend. And then this idea that we have live now of actually putting software at the employees' home to -- so he's not burdened with his own electricity costs and putting boxes and that stuff in, we're getting a bunch of money for that and a lot of demand for it.

So I just want to make sure people are clear that there's some happy set of things in our business, including the exit rate of the business and these couple of things that we can see. But obviously, we're going to work hard to keep selling way more and buying way more. So I wouldn't, in one second, try to suggest that what I'm saying is anywhere near what the guidance is going to be. We'll cook that as we run through the year."

So I'd say those couple of things combined with a little bit of COVID recovery still to go, but those things combined will help lift us a bit faster in Q3 versus Q2."

And so we have all these clients showing up pretty frequently inside our software UI. 
And so what we've done, what we've been working on is taking the Roger bill pay software and basically making it the bill payment system of record. So when you go into the UI and look over to pay something, that platform is working. So we don't really have to rebuild the bill pay platform in the network because we got that already. And obviously, we have all those capabilities from our other businesses, merchant networks and the deals we have with our friends at MasterCard. We have all that other stuff, vendors that do paper making and everything. 
So really, it's just customers. It's just seeing if the accounts are comfortable using the UI to do more than just pay us. And we'll have certainly a report for you back, but the numbers are just staggeringly big, right? It's over 100,000 just here in the United States are paying a bill every month on these UIs. So we're hopeful, I don't know if you want to call it the super app, but the idea is more and more people are using these software apps with us. We just want them to be more useful and we've got another product that's ready to go. So it's going live."

And one thing that they've been saying, they as a software company focus on procurement, they've been getting more involved in Coupa Pay. And I think what they would say is procurement and payments or payments of the procured items are actually complementary services.

I don't think you could ask them that they've done a lot today of combining the pay with the software, but I know that that's their ambition. 
So what I'd say is for a year or 2, we've studied and looked at a bunch of companies that have software that's kind of up the value chain, right, AP automation, scheduling approval, workflow software and even on top of that kind of procurement contract compliance kind of software that you've mentioned. Our take on it is it will be all of the above, which means some clients will just take that AP automation software like they do from Coupa and not to pay. Some people will just take pay like what we offer, and some people will take both. And I think I've repeated that we probably will offer that. We probably will offer the both. I don't know if we'll offer the stand-alone AP automation software or not, but that's our take that based on the size of the company and the industry that they're in and the research that we've done is it won't be one size fits all. It's not like everybody is going to do it one way. 
So we think it's a good idea. It's something that we'll look probably to offer. We do partner with people where we offer the pay into their software. So we're studying how well they're doing it. I call it, peanut butter and jelly. Is it going to be peanut butter and jelly? Or is it going to be not peanut butter and jelly? So I think the jury is still out on it."

So yes, I think I mentioned we've been surprised to the upside against the plan that we built. And I'd say this -- I'm sure it will sound funny to everybody, but it's been fuel. We've actually sold more year-to-date in the forecast. So the second half is actually higher in fuel than the plan that we built. So most of the overperformance against our internal expectations is fuel, and most of that overperformance is digital selling. We keep growing the share of new digital accounts that we're onboarding. And as I mentioned, we're investing more at the top to try to drive that. So that's the overperformance. 
I'd say everything else is kind of mostly on plan. We're super pleased with it. As you mentioned, the plan is up, way, way up from last year and even up against '19. So I'd say everybody else is kind of delivering what we hope for. 
On Part B, who knows on the infrastructure bill. I'd say, first, tell me what infrastructure is. And if it's like what it would be, what you think it would be, which is kind of fixing stuff and construction-centric, it could help us a lot. I'd say it looks a lot to us like the stimulus from last year obviously helped us get paid and helped a lot of our clients stay open and pay payroll. And so I'd say the same thing that if that comes to pass and gets funded and its regular old fashion kind of infrastructure where stuff gets built, we're pretty weighted concentrated in that construction segment. So it's got to help us. If there's more money and more work for those sets of companies, that will flow through to us. I'm not counting on it, George, by the way. It's a political thing. But if it comes to be and it comes to be the old-fashioned infrastructure, it's happy for FLEET."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q3 earnings call. So up-front here, I'd like to run through 4 subjects. First, I'll give you my take on our Q3 results  along with the rest of your outlook. Second, take you into a bit deeper dive into our sales results. Third, give you an update on the 3 acquisitions that we've completed year-to-date. And then lastly, an early preview of 2022 and beyond. 
All right. So let me make the turn to our Q3 results. We reported Q3 revenue of $755 million, up 29% and cash EPS of $3.52, up 25%. So both of those all-time record highs for the company. Also, the Q3 results annualized finally above $3 billion. So past the $3 billion mark in revenue and $14 in cash EPS. 
Organic revenue for the quarter, up 17%. And inside of that, corporate payments business grew 22% organically. 
The trends in Q3 are quite good. Sales finishing at record levels, up over 50% versus Q3 last year and over 30% against the baseline of Q3 '19. Retention, steady as she goes at 93% for the quarter. And again, our fuel card business inside of that also coming at 93%. 
Same-store sales strengthened plus 5% for the quarter, which further adds to the same-store sales rebound we saw in Q2. Credit losses low again at 3 basis points, continuing to run below historic levels. 
You may notice our tax rate kind of 4 points higher than last year. That did shave about $0.20 off the $3.52 that we reported for the quarter. So look, overall, pretty pleased with the quarter. 
So in terms of rest of the year, we're raising guidance today. So revenue guidance at the midpoint now, $2.795 billion. That's up $30 million from August. Cash EPS at the midpoint to $13.05, that's up $0.15 from August. This raise versus last time reflects, obviously, these Q3 results are beat the ALE acquisition, which closed September 1 and a bit more favorable fuel prices. All of those offset just a bit by slower-than-planned COVID recovery. 
If you look at the Q4 on its own, it anticipates revenue and profit growth up about 20% versus Q4 last year and about 10% against Q4 2019. 
All right. Let me make the transition into a bit deeper dive into our sales results. So as I mentioned, new sales or bookings reached record levels in the quarter and are up sequentially significantly and up dramatically over the prior periods. So as I'm sure you're aware, sales reflect the market demand for our solutions but are also really the best leading indicator of future prospects. And so crazy record this quarter, we signed up almost 50,000 new business clients globally in Q3. So 50,000 new accounts join the fold, so a record. 
Over 50% of all of our global fuel card sales now come to us through our digital channels. So great because it's very low cost. 
We continue to increase our digital advertising spend, and we're enjoying record levels of prospects visiting our websites. 
Interest in EV solutions increasing. So a number of large accounts signing on to our EV solution. So that included Hertz Volkswagen U.S.A., Union Pacific, LeasePlan Europe and Siemens. 
Brazil toll sales rocked in the quarter. Our urban sales or kind of the city dwellers that are lower frequency toll users represented 23% of all new sales in the quarter. So programs, whatever, 2 or 3 years old now, almost [ a quarter ]. And the active tags for the quarter reached a new milestone, 6 million. 6 million active paying tags now in Brazil. We are planning to launch our new bank JV this month with the largest bank in Brazil, who will be helping to promote our products. 
We don't talk about it much, but our customer acquisition cost is really quite attractive, runs about 65% of the sales new revenue, so really super important for profitable growth. 
So let me shift gears and talk a little bit about the 3 acquisitions that we've close year-to-date and how they're doing. So Roger first up, We've now rebranded Roger to be Corpay One, which is our entry to corporate payments SMB space. We're underway now adding new SMB bill pay clients through digital channels and accounting channels and have some early returns on cross-selling bill pay into our fuel card base. So super early, but it looks like about 10% of our fuel card clients that pay their bills with our new Corpay One 1 platform are choosing to pay a second non-fleet core bill with us, so effectively becoming bill pay customers. 
We're looking at somewhere around 10,000 to 20,000 SMB bill pay clients coming online in 2022. And also interesting, we plan to launch what we call our 2-in-1 solution before year-end that will combine our smart business cards with our bill pay platform into one interface. So an SMB client could potentially pay all of their nonpayroll expenses with us on a single platform. 
Second deal this year, AFEX, which is a cross-border provide very similar to our Cambridge business super performance in '21. Pro forma revenue growing mid-teens. EBITDA up almost 50% versus prior year. Well along on integration, we've already combined the management teams into one group and are about halfway through migrating the AFEX customers onto the Cambridge IT platform. So I hope to retire most of the AFEX IT system by year-end. 
Last deal up is ALE. That's the lodging extension for the insurance vertical. It helps homeowner insurance place policyholders into hotels and temporary housing. So we closed at September 1 about 3.5 million incremental annual hotel rooms, will be added to our lodging business. Underway with the synergy work. And early view is about $0.20 accretive to 2022. So, so far, so good really across all 3 transactions this year. 
All right. So lastly, let me share our view, early view of 2022, a little bit to the beyond '22 prospects of the company. 
So for next year, encouraged by a few things. First, the run rate, We're exiting '21 with about $3 billion of annualized revenue and $14 of cash EPS. So nose of the plane is up. Sales again running at record levels, which will drive incremental revenue into '22. We also expect sales to grow again next year about 20%. 
Macros on our side, helping us. Obviously, fuel prices are high. FX is generally holding, so setting up well there. And then I mentioned the acquisitions, particularly AFEX and ALE together contributing probably about $0.50 of incremental accretion next year. So look, taken together, the early 2022 setup is quite good. 
If we look just a little further out into the midterm, we're kind of also encouraged there for a couple of reasons. So first, we've expanded via our Beyond strategy, the market segments or the served market segments in each of our 5 major lines of business. So that's laid out on, I think, Page 14 of the earnings supplement. So for example, in Corpay, our Corporate Payments business, we've added cloud-based AP solutions to our original virtual card business. So we did that a couple of years ago in the middle market with Nvoicepay. And then obviously, this year, in the SMB market with Roger. So look much, much better positioned now to attack the corporate payments TAM. 
And then again, if you look at our lodging business initially focused only on workforce or blue collar travelers going to economy hotels. Since we've added 2 new segments, the airline crew business and now the insurance policyholder business of the fold, that really triples opportunity in terms of room nights for the lodging business. 
A second thing is we're on a path, as I mentioned, to combine our card business with our payables business into a single platform. which would do two things: first, give us differentiation in the marketplace, where we can help clients pay all their nonpayroll expenses with us, both walk-around purchases and supplier payables from a single account. And second, could help us turn our fuel card business into a corporate payments business by cross-selling our bill pay services to our hundreds of thousands of fuel card clients. So as I mentioned, underway there. 
So look, the combination of expanding our served market segments in our existing 5 businesses along with this idea of joining up our cards and bill pay onto a single platform is encouraging for us. 
So look, in closing, just a few final wrap-up thoughts. So again, a really good quarter, record revenue and profits for Q3, good trends, same-store sales up -- sales -- new sales up and retention steady again, record sales and very attractive cost of acquisition of new accounts. 3 acquisitions on track against our thesis, and our early '22 setup attractive. So look, all in all, it feels like we're in a pretty good place. 
So with that, let me turn the call back over to Chuck to provide some additional details on the quarter. Chuck?"
28756,1686075670,2423832,"FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc., Q3 2021 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2021",2021-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Corpay, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ron. I'm delighted to share with you some more color on a very solid clean quarter. For Q3 of 2021, we reported revenue of $755 million, up 29%; GAAP net income of $234 million, up 24% and GAAP net income per diluted share of $2.80, up 28%. Adju",949,"Thanks, Ron. I'm delighted to share with you some more color on a very solid clean quarter. For Q3 of 2021, we reported revenue of $755 million, up 29%; GAAP net income of $234 million, up 24% and GAAP net income per diluted share of $2.80, up 28%. 
Adjusted net income for the quarter, or ANI, increased 22% to $294 million or roughly $1.2 billion annualized. ANI per diluted share increased 25% to $3.52. 
Organic revenue growth was 17%, driven by continued strong sales, solid retention levels and same-store sales rate. 
Looking at organic growth across product categories. corporate payments was up 22% in the third quarter, highlighted by full AP, which grew over 50% again this quarter. Corpay One, our small business-focused full AP offering grew 78%. So our full AP solutions continue to sell well in the market. 
Cross-border revenue was up 19%, which showed some softness from the lockdowns down under in Australia. We do believe much of this softness is recoverable, but the timing is hard to predict. 
The AFEX integration is progressing quite well, and we've converted more than half of its customers onto our existing cross-border payment systems. We expect to convert the remaining customers before year-end. 
I'd like to thank our cross-border team as they've worked tirelessly to complete these customer migrations seamlessly while simultaneously operating a growing, thriving business. 
And within B2B, a lot of attention has been paid to new small entrants, several of which we enable with our partner program using our best-in-class virtual card. 
The partners we enable own the customer relationship do the marketing and take the credit risk, so they keep most of the economics. We're more of a processor to them. So our take rate is meaningfully lower than when we go direct to customers, which is really where we tend to focus most of our sales and marketing efforts. So while these partners drive some volume growth, they still only represent about 13% of our corporate payments revenue. 
Fuel was up organically 13% year-over-year, with strong retention trends and record digital sales continuing to drive the performance. We're seeing some softness in same-store sales as Australia, New Zealand and parts of Continental Europe are still grappling with COVID-related lockdowns, and over-the-road trucking is facing the driver supply shortage that's been all over the news. But despite these headwinds, our fuel businesses continue to grow in every geography as a result of our sales efforts and strong retention rates. 
Tolls was up 14% compared with last year and showed impressive performance again this quarter, growing to above 6 million total tag holders with 5 million consumer tags and 1 million business tags. Now just for context, the business had approximately 4.5 million total tag holders when we acquired it back in 2016. 
Economic and business activity has returned to relatively normal levels in Brazil, which has increased customer mobility and sales traffic through retail and toll locations, helping us to achieve record Q3 sales. 
Lodging was particularly strong, up 40%, with airline lodging up 61% on the back of the recovery in domestic air travel. We hope to see more recovery in international airline lodging as borders reopen. 
Gift organic growth was 25% year-over-year, benefiting from continued retailer embrace of the online sales channel. 
Now looking further down the income statement. Operating expenses were up 30% to $417 million and were 55% of revenue, stable with last year. The increase was primarily due to higher levels of business activity, the effect of currency translation impact on international expenses and acquisitions. 
Interest expense decreased 7% to $29 million, primarily due to higher interest income earned on cash balances and lower LIBOR rates more than offsetting higher debt and securitization balances. 
As Ron mentioned, our effective tax rate for the third quarter was higher than expected, coming in at 24.1%. This was due to fewer stock option exercises during the quarter likely due to the low share price, which resulted in minimal excess tax benefits. We currently expect our tax rate in Q4 to be back within our full year guidance range. 
Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of unrestricted cash, and we also had approximately $650 million of undrawn availability on our revolver. In total, we had $4.6 billion outstanding on our credit facilities and $1.1 billion borrowed on our securitization facility. 
As of September 30, our leverage ratio was 2.76x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA as calculated in accordance with our credit agreement. 
We used $406 million to repurchase approximately 1.6 million shares during the quarter at an average price of $260 per share. We still have $1.18 billion of share buyback capacity in our program. 
So far this year, we bought back 3.1 million shares, and we've closed 3 deals, putting $1.7 billion of capital to work. On top of that, we still have low leverage and ample liquidity for additional deals and/or buybacks, clearly demonstrating the earnings power and attractiveness of our high margin, high cash flow business. 
Looking ahead, I would note that you can see our full updated guidance and assumptions in both our press release and supplement. 
But before we open it up for questions, I would like to inform you that at the most recent Board meeting, FLEETCOR adopted the Rooney Rule for all future Board positions. 
I would also like to mention that we expect to publish our latest ESG report to our Investor Relations website within the next few weeks. And we'd be happy to take your feedback on our ESG efforts after you've had a chance to review that report. 
With that said, operator, we'll open it up for questions."

So we're selling, I don't know, I think almost [indiscernible] what we call full AP where we take 100% of the clients' payables versus virtual card. But obviously, the great news is it's still all virtual guard, right? 
When we sell that, full AP, underneath that, basically is the same engine to your point, the same merchant database, the same ability to earn interchange, if you will, on that portion. So it sells better. We think it has more value to the client. We generally retain more of the economics there and yet we still have a bunch of virtual cards. So you'll see more of that. I think we'll probably move even more of the business as you roll forward that way."

So some businesses are better than that. Obviously, some are worse and same with channels. So it's referencing that the digital channel, which is growing as the percent is lower than that 65% line average. So the good news is as the mix of our total sales moves more and more to digital, that should improve basically our cost of acquisition. And so obviously, we're delighted that more and more of the business is moving there. 
And the second thing I'd say about that is things that are less dependent on people, right, hiring, training and retaining lots of people, slows company's ability right to staff and grow that way. So on the digital side, we're getting pretty good at increasing digital advertising spend now and seeing the payback in terms of visitors and flow through to conversions. So that's something that we can step on a bit faster and get returns faster. So I'd say this whole shift basically to digital sets up super well. 
As it relates to the corporate pay economics long term, I think you're right. I mean I think the big, big idea we have is we've got this giant fuel card client base. I don't know, 500,000, I think, were more active clients. And they generally are small, right? We get a couple thousand in revenues. We don't get a lot from them. So the idea of being able to go to that group and cross sell them something else that has the same or more value, obviously, could accelerate revenue growth, but to your point, it's a way lower cost of acquisition than prospecting for new business, like going back to all the UIs and all the ways that we talk to our existing clients. So now when I say it's super early, we just started, but that would have an opportunity one, to make our fuel card business and the synergy, the assets of 20 years of building that payout. And then second, drive again the cost of acquisition down if that cross-sell component becomes big."

On the ALE side, I'd say it helps again a little bit. The diligence that we did in that business is surprisingly over incredibly long cycle. I don't know, 90% plus, I guess, over the 5 or 10 years we looked at is not hurricane or natural disaster-related. It's your pipe ranks and your house floods, and you left the candle on of the bathroom and the house burned down. And so it's what we think of as just way more common kind of every day, which is why we went ahead with the business. It's just way more ratably, you take all the hundreds of millions of homes or apartments. Stuff goes wrong, with them that displaces people. And so that business, obviously, it's insurance, so the statistics on it are pretty good. So I'd say for both businesses, it helps really just at the margin."

And so I would say the COVID basically people shifted to other priorities and do RFPs for fuel cards probably wasn't the top one. 
So the other thing I'd say because I think it's missed is the real competition for us. We study wins and losses in fuel cards. So where do we get the 35,000 new accounts that came on board this quarter and where the 10,000 that we lost? And the answer is not our friends WEX. It's basically business cards and other forms of payment, both in business cards, for example.

There weren't 50,000 accounts when I started with the platform 20 years ago. So sign up 50,000 new businesses in a quarter is good. And then second, against the '19 baseline, I think I called out our bookings dollars were up 30%. So forget the weak comp against the normal quarter. A couple of years ago, it's way up. So the headline is our company sales were way up. That's headline 1. And Part B is so why they weigh up? I think it's the location we made into digital, So start, I don't know, 4 or 5 years ago, we did a bunch of things to get way better at digital marketing and selling, obviously, not the least of which is the whole tech stack that we build to be able to follow businesses and everywhere they crawl around and then what they do to advertising, figuring out where to spend and who to target money against to get them to visit our sites to optimizing our sites to get conversion rates and sales at the bottom end to applications going end-to-end where someone could go on our site and literally order the program and get cards in a couple of days and not have to talk to people. 
So the reengineering, I'd say, of the whole digital machinery has been, first of all, it was massive, but we're getting the returns of it now. It's obviously ramped way the heck up. And I think it's another huge step-up in our early plans for '22. So I would say that's the main, main driver, and we're doing that everywhere. We're just way smarter in how we target and how we study where prospects go and what they're looking at instead of trying to make up who we think might be interested in our products. 
So on your second question on bookings, the answer to it is, let's say, we said, hey, we sold, pick a number, $100 million of new business in this core. To Chuck's point, what that means is as you roll forward and that all gets implemented, it's obviously an annualized amount of $100 million. It wouldn't be $100 million in this year, like we sold it throughout the year, it'd be $50 million, for example, in that case. And so we have very different timings. 
In our Brazil business, we sell and it's almost [indiscernible]. In our fuel card business, we sell and we get it pretty soon. 
In our corporate payments business, which are bigger accounts, it takes longer. So our -- we basically know our sales, if you will, our new business for '22 because it's all sitting in our pipeline to be implemented. So the bookings number turns into an annualized revenue number, which is how we build our plans, and then the timing or what we call the in-year amount varies across the various businesses we have. 
But the main thing I want to make sure people are clear is it's working. I don't want to get lost in the details here that the company, our company, is selling more of everything than it's ever sold before ever."

I like it, the people that put capital in alongside of me get returns, and I give returns. And if we don't, we don't. And obviously, there's more leverage than that. I've got, as you know, a lot of money. And so getting some money with our current tax structure is not super interesting. So it's a motivating way to keep me at the grindstone for a couple of years here to try to get the thing to a place. 
And how do I feel about the confidence other than the way people rate our stock? I feel good. We have models that come off of the sales and retention math that we run all the time for your models, and I see what the revenue and cash EPS looks like running through our machine. And if it's valued fairly reasonably, it gets to those targets that are there. So I look at it and go -- if someone priced our earnings reasonably, I think we can make the targets and then I could get paid."

But I'd say the upside for us is probably not so much that, that the card orders would go up. It's really, we finally, the guy running it, and we finally, found a way to grow the business. So and how long we followed our company, but I've been trying to sell a business since I bought it. And all the guy has turned it into a business now that we think that can compound a double digit. So the way they've done it is instead of just being an administrator, an accountant for the Macy's gift card and count them $100 down, they help our clients now sell online. So they've moved over to helping sell online digital gift cards because they know a lot about it. They're getting paid extra for wallet provisioning. Half the gift cards, there's breakage where people can't find them anymore. They're in a drawer. And so super technically hard to move private label cards into wallets, but our guys came up with a way to do it. So we get paid money from a number of the brands to basically provision those electronically. And then the guy came up with the idea of selling the content. We have, I don't know, 300 or 400 pretty good brands. So we're taking them back to businesses because we're in the B2B business. So they've built a bit of a revenue and sales stream now taking them for rewards like companies like ours, for example, for employees. 
So these 2 or 3 new ideas on top of the kind of old chugging along kind of low single-digit business has propped that thing up now to being north of 10%. So -- and I went through the guys plan a couple of weeks ago. So I think finally have a set of ideas that are more sustainable to keep growing that business now."

I don't have it in front of me versus 19 [ ship ]  checks is going to pull it up but these should record levels, whatever we sold in Q3 would have been an all-time record number of sales. And what I said about the recovery is Brazil, it is a complete ditch COVID-wise in the spring and into the summer and somehow has come out the other side. They are in a better price than we are here. 
So what that's done is it's opened the stores there where we sell a lot. We have kiosks and hundreds and hundreds of stores. So stores are open. People are walking. Mobility's back and more people are running through the tolls where we also sell. So the place is basically where we conduct business to try to make sales are kind of reactivated again, which is helping drive it. 
And then second, I think we said before, we've come up with a number of super new partner or channel ideas there. The newest one is we've got a couple of the big car manufacturers to put the tags now on the vehicles. So when you go in and get your new Volkswagen and drive it out of the dealership there, you look up and there's a sticker already there with a little POS thing that says, ""Hey, call this number go to this website."" We're getting like 50% or something conversion on adoption of these new vehicles rolling out of the dealership. So it's really -- I can't even tell you how good of a sales story that team has put together. 
But the -- as you said, the big, big idea for us and we poured a lot of capital into it this year in '21 is to double or triple the fueling locations, and the fueling transactions are up huge over a year ago now as we take the 6 million vehicles. So we had tags and given more places to use the tags. So that is the one said to me, where could the free money and real acceleration come. It could come from this massive group of people basically just having more places to use the tag and the accounts already on their vehicle."

And so the contracts generally would run anywhere from probably 3 to 5 Years. We just renewed actually a couple of them with some of our most important partners this year. 
In terms of what do I think I'd say down would be my answer. So if you look at, I think we put in a slide in the earnings supplement. I think it's Page 15 [indiscernible] positive. Yes, it takes pieces of our corporate payments business, the partner thing that we're talking about and then the direct business where we go to the end client and then the cross-border business where we mostly go to the end client. So you can see that those two are growing revenue much faster. And so the mix itself, if you just run the clock forward would make the partner piece smaller, I think, going forward. 
So obviously, there's lot of spend there and spend grows fast. But to your point, they do more of the work. So obviously, our rates are much, much lower there than in the direct business. So we like the business, but obviously, 90% of our corporate payments business is in the directed cross-border."

I think obviously, there's more people trying to get into entire processing, whether it's virtual or just traditional physical cards. So I think first off that a lot of the players that get into are issue for issuing kinds of companies that are in that business, right, for FIs and for us, but yes, some of them are coming into our area. 
What I'd say back is fallacy is somehow that the game is tech and product to the X, Y, Z fintech has some great thing not old fashion FLEETCOR out of it. And what I'd say to you is what they're missing is it's the merchant network, you can't monetize virtual cards if you don't have a virtual card merchant network that can process and capture those transactions you can profit until the day goes on, but you have to have the network. So we've had a, call it, I don't know, a 10-year head start on everybody in cleansing, building, growing that network. 
And then the second one is the whole service dimension of a huge pay for you group, a massive group that helps the partners clean up the data and get the stuff processed. So I'd say those would be the couple of components that people missed that this isn't just making a new processing engine in the garage and giving it to AWS, and that's all going to be great. There's actual real assets that we have that cause our partners to stay with us. I mean there was a big thing. Some came into my office a year, 2 of your clients, Build.com and Avid abroad and other providers. We're doing great with them. We've renewed the contract for a number of years with one of them. We're getting more business than ever from another. We're obviously we have a great relationship. 
Some of those are targeted like the Marketo thing, as an example, is targeted to FIs, which we're not even in. We're not in the processing business to help FIs. We thought they wouldn't use their own processes and stuff. And so I think like everything else, it's someone searching for some narrative that is in there. We've got a good business. It's growing. The spend is growing like crazy. But because we make so much more money on the direct businesses and a growing fast, that mix will cause the partner thing to be a bit smaller. 
But I think we're still -- I'd tell you, go call our partners. Don't ask me the supplier. Go ask our partners that they like the job we're doing. I look at the performance reports. I send performance reviews with the partners, myself personally. So from my vantage point, we're doing quite well."

The good news is -- The bad news is, a, the transactions are a little weaker than we thought. The good news is they're not worth much. 
So the two areas of weakness are in trucking, again, a particularly large trucking both here and in Europe. And you guys have read the press on this that the large trucking firms just don't have drivers. And not only are they not drivers, they're quitting and forming and going into smaller firms now. So our big accounts are effectively just soft in terms of trucks and transactions, but they're happy because they're just raising their rates. 
And then the second one I'd say is really Europe and the big corporates, they are the white collar book of business where people haven't gone back to work in Europe. And I don't know if you guys know it's been in Europe, lots of people of company cars. So people like us have a car and we used to drive around and get reimbursed. So those are the two areas that are weak. 
The good news is we don't get paid anything for those things. We don't get paid very much. So that's why our revenue growth is still pretty good. The local business, for example, in our partner business are super healthy, and even a big part of our U.K. business, which I'm looking at, had strong same-store sales recovery. So the areas where we get paid and we get revenue are actually pretty healthy."

So the way, I mean, I say this all the time, if you like businesses, you can plan, you should like our business, it's the nature of the model. And so what we do is we -- which we're about halfway through, we build things off of run rate. So we're staring here at October volumes and revenues in all of our businesses. And I think what I said is, hey, when you post $3.52 or $3.50, we multiply it and we go, okay, that sounds like $14, and we guided to a number we don't have in front of me, Chuck, that's $3.50-something for Q4 is a track stuff. 
So there's another one. So hey, we start with the company is running earning $14 on an annualized basis now. Then we sit there and say, ""Okay, we had sales record levels this year, of which call it, 2/3 of that will be realized in 2022 so we can see what that number is."" Then we have a bigger sales plan for 2022, probably 20% higher, and we look at what's in here there. I'm like, ""hey, that looks good"". 
And then we look at the deals that I mentioned that are kind of on top of that, which I think I called out together, call it, $0.50 would be kind of my commitment on the stuff that we use capital for. So that's how we build the math. We take the run rate, we take this year, next year sales. We take added things like the accretion of deals, and that helps us basically target a number that we can get to. And we haven't planned a heck of a lot of COVID recovery. Obviously, it's -- we're just obviously 12 months this year. And so we've been pretty conservative so far and getting some of that back. We still have probably $100 million, $150 million that could literally come back a different day potentially. And so those are the components. 
And what I was trying to say -- and the other one is the macro. Obviously, fuel prices are higher here in November than they were in January and seem to be holding. And so when you roll all that up, my message is it looks super early, but it looks like a really good number. And the reason I go through all that math is to get people longer than us who are in the company some insight into how they ought to think about it. Things could happen, but the company is pretty well positioned to put up an attractive growth number for next year."

So obviously, that's the overall number, David. 
But the pieces of that, again, are the direct or end client business, the cross-border business and then this channel partner business. And so for us, the good news is the 2 big pieces, which are about 90% I'm looking at the thing are effectively flat. So because we price it, there's really no rate erosion in that out of our business. And so all of the rate erosion is really just in the mix of partners where we have tax table rates, and we have some partners that are growing like crazy. So as their volumes go up, they enjoy a bit better rates, right, in the base than the base rates. 
And so because we don't have the same kind of reliance, if you will, on the channel business, I think we're a bit more insulated, if you will, from rate compression there. And I mentioned it earlier, I'd say the super positive thing is our mix of that business is going to more full AP. And don't forget, we bought an SMB company that has higher rates. So as we roll in the full AP, the Nvoicepay mix and this Corpay One mix, those have a way higher rate than the existing businesses. So my guess is just kicking out the channel business, I see actually rate expansion over the next couple of years in that business mostly help from mix."

So I'd say that who knows? My guess is it's not a super easy fix for suddenly large trucking people to get the people, although you see the pictures of the at the ports of the need for more trucking. So my guess is there'll be more incentives and pressure to try to get more people into the space over the next 6 to 12 months. But I'd say it doesn't do much to us. One, it's limited only to that trucking vertical. Two, it's limited to the big firms, which don't pay as much. And, And three, honestly, it's kind of in our run rate. The softness has really been the year for the last couple of quarters. And so I don't see it really getting any worse, mostly because of what I said that I think there's going to be such a push to try to add people. And I think the rates are going to keep going up to attract people. So I'd say it's probably not a super duper impact on our forward thinking for the few of our business."

So yes, we -- for corporate payments for every business, we turn that into a revenue number and say, okay, we're some, whatever, $20 million with clients that used to give us $20 million more 2 quarters ago than they do now. And hey, we watch them to see whether some of that $20 million is coming back. So we have super clear visibility on the amount of it and the rate of recovery of it. Is that one clear?"

So hey, we guesstimated those 100 people would come back a certain way in Q3 from 2 years ago, and they came part of the way back. They come back to where we thought we'd at. That's 3 points more of growth in the things. So it's still a significant thing. And we'd be hopeful maybe we get it back and be kind of ready to get back a different day. 
On your second question, the credit question, I'd say yes, yes and yes. It's a super good question. It's record lifetime lows of of credit losses, first of all, because we didn't sell much new business, obviously, in 2020. So there wasn't a lot of new business coming on. And then between the stimulus and relief and everything else, people repaid us and stuff. 
And so for sure, we've opened it up. I think Chuck said in the last call last time that we expect those losses to tick up. You can see it a bit in the roll rates, right, as we've onboarded a lot more business this year. Our Q4 losses will be a bit higher. 
And we're actually doing that juggling question now for 2022. Okay, how much do we -- how open do we want to be in credit both with existing accounts in terms of credit lines? I mean think of this, I've got fuel cards to have some credit line and the credit line is enough to pay their fuel card bills. What do they tell me they want to pay all my bill -- the bills with payment. And I said, okay, I lease with our credit. 
I mean our opportunity to increase credit to creditworthy people for our new products is like super high. And so I'd say we, for sure, will rebalance next year towards taking more risk certainly than this year and try to make that trade-off, right, between incremental sales and revenue growth and incremental losses. But we'll be careful. I want to make sure everyone on the call is clear, we're not crazy. We'll step our way in. We'll study our way in, but we will do more of it."

I'd say the most -- to me, the most exciting thing, which is coming mostly from the world out there is this synergy, this platform concept of bringing walk-around plastic, which is the business we've mostly been in with payable together. And so it's a way of trading, in our case, a massive synergy in these businesses we've built over 20 years of getting just way more out of them. 
So I gave the example earlier, we're launching late this month or the beginning of December, the thing we call the 2-in-1, where a client that has a business card of ours or a fuel card could also pay bills with us, and literally, it would just be in one place. He could use our card and our credit to pay some of his bills. Obviously, we'd have access that it was bank account to fund the bills. His report would show all his walk-around purchases like it does now and will show all his payables, the vendors, the way it is now, and it would all be in 1 place. 
And so that has the opportunity in joining up businesses that we have. That's what creates profit acceleration, right, where you don't have to go fish one at a time, right, for each new client, you can go back to this pretty gigantic customer base that we built and basically start to join it up and cross up that's useful to them. And the tech that we have now makes it look -- when you look at it, it just stitch together now. 
So I'd say, that's the -- again, I try to say the thing, I'm also excited, I know people, that will be bought us, but we got a lot of legs in the businesses we have on that page. We pitch this beyond thing, and we've added segments everywhere in all the businesses which are adding growth. So I'm obviously super happy about that. But this integration and joining up in synergy where the new guys that have some nice new shiny product, they don't have a 20-year customer base and spend, and they don't get 50,000. [indiscernible] of all year you guys had signed a 50,000 clients in the quarter. So that's the super exciting thing is can we monetize this bigger business profitably, would be what I'd say is the super new opportunity for us."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining our Q3 earnings call. So up-front here, I'd like to run through 4 subjects: first, I'll give you my take on our Q3 results  along with the rest of your outlook; second, take you into a bit deeper dive into our sales results; third, give you an update on the 3 acquisitions that we've completed year-to-date; and then lastly, an early preview of 2022 and beyond.  
All right. So let me make the turn to our Q3 results. We reported Q3 revenue of $755 million, up 29% and cash EPS of $3.52, up 25%, so both of those all-time record highs for the company. Also, the Q3 results annualized, finally above $3 billion, so past the $3 billion mark in revenue and $14 in cash EPS. Organic revenue for the quarter, up 17%. And inside of that, Corporate Payments business grew 22% organically.  
The trends in Q3 are quite good. Sales finishing at record levels, up over 50% versus Q3 last year and over 30% against the baseline of Q3 '19. Retention, steady as she goes at 93% for the quarter. And again, our global fuel card business inside of that also coming at 93%. Same-store sales strengthened plus 5% for the quarter, which further adds to the same-store sales rebound we saw in Q2. Credit losses low again at 3 basis points, continuing to run below historic levels. You may notice our tax rate kind of 4 points higher than last year. That did shave about $0.20 off the $3.52 that we reported for the quarter. So look, overall, kind of pretty pleased with the quarter.  
So in terms of rest of the year, we're raising guidance today. So revenue guidance at the midpoint now, $2.795 billion, that's up $30 million from August. Cash EPS at the midpoint to $13.05, that's up $0.15 from August. This raise versus last time reflects, obviously, these Q3 results are beat the ALE acquisition, which closed September 1 and a bit more favorable fuel prices, all of those offset just a bit by slower-than-planned COVID recovery. If you look at the Q4 on its own, it anticipates revenue and profit growth up about 20% versus Q4 last year and about 10% against Q4 2019.  
All right. Let me make the transition into a bit deeper dive into our sales results. So as I mentioned, new sales or bookings reached record levels in the quarter and are up sequentially, significantly and up dramatically over the prior periods. So as I'm sure you're aware, sales reflect the market demand for our solutions but are also really the best leading indicator of future prospects. And so crazy record this quarter. We signed up almost 50,000 new business clients globally in Q3. So 50,000 new accounts joined the fold, so a record.  
Over 50% of all of our global fuel card sales now come to us through our digital channels. So great because it's very low cost. We continue to increase our digital advertising spend, and we're enjoying record levels of prospects visiting our websites. Interest in EV solutions increasing, so a number of large accounts signing on to our EV solution. So that included Hertz, Volkswagen USA, Union Pacific, LeasePlan Europe and Siemens.  
Brazil toll sales rocked in the quarter. Our urban sales or kind of the city dwellers that are lower frequency toll users represented 23% of all new sales in the quarter. So programs, whatever, 2 or 3 years old now, almost a quarter. And the active tags for the quarter reached a new milestone, 6 million, so 6 million active paying tags now in Brazil. We are planning to launch our new bank JV this month with the largest bank in Brazil, who will be helping to promote our products.  
We don't talk about it much, but our customer acquisition cost is really quite attractive, runs about 65% of the sales new revenue, so really super important for profitable growth. So let me shift gears and talk a little bit about the 3 acquisitions that we've closed year-to-date and how they're doing. So Roger, first up. We've now rebranded Roger to be Corpay One, which is our entry into the Corporate Payments SMB space. So we're underway now adding new SMB bill pay clients through digital channels and accounting channels, and have some early returns on cross-selling bill pay into our fuel card base. So super early, but it looks like about 10% of our fuel card clients that pay their bills with our new Corpay One platform are choosing to pay a second non-fleet Cor bill with us, so effectively becoming bill pay customers.  
We're looking at somewhere around 10,000 to 20,000 SMB bill pay clients coming online in 2022. And also interesting, we plan to launch what we call our 2-in-1 solution before year-end that will combine our smart business cards with our bill pay platform into one interface. So an SMB client could potentially pay all of their nonpayroll expenses with us on a single platform.  
Second deal this year, AFEX, which is a cross-border provide, very similar to our Cambridge business. Super performance in '21. Pro forma revenue growing mid-teens. EBITDA up almost 50% versus prior year. Well along on integration, we've already combined the management teams into one group, and are about halfway through migrating the AFEX customers onto the Cambridge IT platform. So I hope to retire most of the AFEX IT system by year-end.  
Last deal up is ALE. That's the lodging extension for the insurance vertical. It helps homeowner insurance place policyholders into hotels and temporary housing. So we closed at September 1 about 3.5 million incremental annual hotel rooms, will be added to our lodging business. Underway with the synergy work. And early view is about $0.20 accretive to 2022. So, so far, so good really across all 3 transactions this year.  
All right. So lastly, let me share our view, early view of 2022, and speak a little bit to the beyond '22 prospects for the company. So for next year, encouraged by a few things. First, the run rate, we're exiting '21 with about $3 billion of annualized revenue and $14 of cash EPS. So nose of the plane is up. Sales again, running at record levels, which will drive incremental revenue into '22. We also expect sales to grow again next year about 20%.  
Macro is on our side, helping us. Obviously, fuel prices are high. FX is generally holding, so setting up well there. And then I mentioned the acquisitions, particularly AFEX and ALE, together contributing probably about $0.50 of incremental accretion next year. So look, taken together, the early 2022 set up is quite good.  
If we look just a little farther out into the midterm, we're kind of also encouraged there for a couple of reasons. So first, we've expanded, via our Beyond strategy, the market segments or the served market segments in each of our 5 major lines of business. So that's laid out on, I think, Page 14 of the earnings supplement. So for example, in Corpay, our Corporate Payments business, we've added cloud-based AP solutions to our original virtual card business. So we did that a couple of years ago in the middle market with Nvoicepay, and then obviously, this year, in the SMB market with Roger. So look, much, much better positioned now to attack the Corporate Payments TAM.  
And then again, if you look at our lodging business initially focused only on workforce or blue collar travelers going to economy hotels. Since we've added 2 new segments, the airline crew business and now the insurance policyholder business of the fold, that really triples the opportunity in terms of room nights for the lodging business.  
A second thing is we're on a path, as I mentioned, to combine our card business with our payables business into a single platform, which would do two things: first, give us differentiation in the marketplace, where we can help clients pay all their nonpayroll expenses with us, both walk-around purchases and supplier payables from a single account; and second, could help us turn our fuel card business into a Corporate Payments business by cross-selling our bill pay services to our hundreds of thousands of fuel card clients. So as I mentioned, underway there. So look, the combination of expanding our served market segments in our existing 5 businesses along with this idea of joining up our cards and bill pay onto a single platform is encouraging for us.  
So look, in closing, just a few final wrap-up thoughts. So again, a really good quarter, record revenue and profits for Q3, good trends, same-store sales up -- sales -- new sales up and retention steady, again, record sales and very attractive cost of acquisition of new accounts. 3 acquisitions on track against our thesis, and our early '22 set up attractive. So look, all-in-all, it feels like we're in a pretty good place.  
So with that, let me turn the call back over to Chuck to provide some additional details on the quarter. Chuck?"

I'm delighted to share with you some more color on a very solid clean quarter. For Q3 of 2021, we reported revenue of $755 million, up 29%; GAAP net income of $234 million, up 24%; and GAAP net income per diluted share of $2.80, up 28%. Adjusted net income for the quarter, or ANI, increased 22% to $294 million or roughly $1.2 billion annualized. ANI per diluted share increased 25% to $3.52.  
Organic revenue growth was 17%, driven by continued strong sales, solid retention levels and same-store sales recovery. Looking at organic growth across product categories. Corporate Payments was up 22% in the third quarter, highlighted by full AP, which grew over 50% again this quarter. Corpay One, our small business-focused full AP offering, grew 78%. So our full AP solutions continue to sell well in the market.  
Cross-border revenue was up 19%, which showed some softness from the lockdowns down under in Australia. We do believe much of this softness is recoverable, but the timing is hard to predict. The AFEX integration is progressing quite well, and we've converted more than half of its customers onto our existing cross-border payment systems. We expect to convert the remaining customers before year-end. I'd like to thank our cross-border team as they've worked tirelessly to complete these customer migrations seamlessly, while simultaneously operating a growing, thriving business.  
And within B2B, a lot of attention has been paid to new small entrants, several of which we enable with our partner program using our best-in-class virtual card. The partners we enable own the customer relationship, do the marketing and take the credit risk, so they keep most of the economics. We're more of a processor to them. So our take rate is meaningfully lower than when we go direct to customers, which is really where we tend to focus most of our sales and marketing efforts. So while these partners drive some volume growth, they still only represent about 13% of our Corporate Payments revenue.  
Fuel was up organically 13% year-over-year, with strong retention trends and record digital sales continuing to drive the performance. We're seeing some softness in same-store sales as Australia, New Zealand and parts of Continental Europe are still grappling with COVID-related lockdowns, and over-the-road trucking is facing the driver supply shortage that's been all over the news. But despite these headwinds, our fuel businesses continued to grow in every geography as a result of our sales efforts and strong retention rates.  
Tolls was up 14% compared with last year and showed impressive performance again this quarter, growing to above 6 million total tag holders, with 5 million consumer tags and 1 million business tags. Now just for context, the business had approximately 4.5 million total tag holders when we acquired it back in 2016.  
Economic and business activity has returned to relatively normal levels in Brazil, which has increased customer mobility and sales traffic through retail and toll locations, helping us to achieve record Q3 sales. Lodging was particularly strong, up 40%, with airline lodging up 61% on the back of the recovery in domestic air travel. We hope to see more recovery in international airline lodging as borders reopen. Gift organic growth was 25% year-over-year, benefiting from continued retailer embrace of the online sales channel.  
Now looking further down the income statement. Operating expenses were up 30% to $417 million and were 55% of revenue, stable with last year. The increase was primarily due to higher levels of business activity, the effect of currency translation impact on international expenses and acquisitions. Interest expense decreased 7% to $29 million, primarily due to higher interest income earned on cash balances and lower LIBOR rates more than offsetting higher debt and securitization balances.  
As Ron mentioned, our effective tax rate for the third quarter was higher than expected, coming in at 24.1%. This was due to fewer stock option exercises during the quarter likely due to the low share price, which resulted in minimal excess tax benefits. We currently expect our tax rate in Q4 to be back within our full year guidance range.  
Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of unrestricted cash, and we also had approximately $650 million of undrawn availability on our revolver. In total, we had $4.6 billion outstanding on our credit facilities and $1.1 billion borrowed on our securitization facility. As of September 30, our leverage ratio was 2.76x trailing 12-month adjusted EBITDA, as calculated in accordance with our credit agreement.  
We used $406 million to repurchase approximately 1.6 million shares during the quarter at an average price of $260 per share. We still have $1.18 billion of share buyback capacity in our program. So far this year, we've bought back 3.1 million shares and we've closed 3 deals, putting $1.7 billion of capital to work. On top of that, we still have low leverage and ample liquidity for additional deals and/or buybacks, clearly demonstrating the earnings power and attractiveness of our high-margin, high-cash flow business.  
Looking ahead, I would note that you can see our full updated guidance and assumptions in both our press release and supplement. But before we open it up for questions, I would like to inform you that at the most recent Board meeting, FLEETCOR adopted the Rooney Rule for all future Board positions. I would also like to mention that we expect to publish our latest ESG report to our Investor Relations website within the next few weeks, and we'd be happy to take your feedback on our ESG efforts after you've had a chance to review that report.  
With that said, operator, we'll open it up for questions."

But obviously, the great news is it's still all virtual guard, right?  
When we sell that, full AP, underneath that, basically is the same engine to your point, the same merchant database, the same ability to earn interchange, if you will, on that portion. So it sells better. We think it has more value to the client. We generally retain more of the economics there and yet we still have a bunch of virtual cards. So you'll see more of that.

So some businesses are better than that. Obviously, some are worse, and same with channels. So it's referencing that the digital channel, which is growing as a percent, is lower than that 65% line average. So the good news is as the mix of our total sales moves more and more to digital, that should improve basically our cost of acquisition. And so, obviously, we're delighted that more and more of the business is moving there.  
And then second thing I'd say about that is things that are less dependent on people, right, hiring, training and retaining lots of people, slows company's ability right to staff and grow that way. So on the digital side, we're getting pretty good at increasing digital advertising spend now and seeing the payback in terms of visitors and flow through to conversions. So that's something that we can step on a bit faster and get returns faster. So I'd say this whole shift basically to digital sets up super well.  
As it relates to the corporate pay economics long term, I think you're right. I mean, I think the big, big idea we have is we've got this giant fuel card client base. I don't know, 500,000, I think, or more active clients. And they generally are small, right? We get a couple thousand in revenues. We don't get a lot from them. So the idea of being able to go to that group and cross-sell them something else that has the same or more value, obviously, could accelerate revenue growth, but to your point, it's a way lower cost of acquisition than prospecting for new business, like going back to all the UIs and all the ways that we talk to our existing clients. So now when I say it's super early, we just started, but that would have an opportunity one, to make our fuel card business and the synergy, the assets of 20 years of building that payout. And then second, drive again the cost of acquisition down if that cross-sell component becomes big."

So we picked up some decent amount of incremental volume when that happens kind of almost unexpected volume, but the rate on that is like super-duper low. We sign up with contracts with people like FEMA and stuff. And so lots of volume and a little bit of revenue contribution.  
On the ALE side, I'd say, it helps again a little bit. The diligence that we did in that business is surprisingly over incredibly long cycle. I don't know, 90% plus, I guess, over the 5 or 10 years we looked at is not hurricane or natural disaster-related. It's your pipe ranks and your house floods, and you left the candle on of the bathroom and the house burned down. And so it's what we think of as just way more common kind of every day, which is why we went ahead with the business. It's just way more ratably, you take all the hundreds of millions of homes or apartments. Stuff goes wrong, with them that displaces people. And so that business, obviously, it's insurance, so the statistics on it are pretty good. So I'd say for both businesses, it helps really just at the margin."

And I think I called out that it remained at 93% for the quarter. And so I would say, the COVID basically people shifted to other priorities, and doing RFPs for fuel cards probably wasn't the top one.  
So the other thing I'd say, because I think it's missed is, the real competition for us. We study wins and losses in fuel cards. So where do we get the 35,000 new accounts that came on board this quarter and where the 10,000 that we lost? And the answer is not our friends WEX. It's basically business cards and other forms of payment, both in business cards, for example.

I tried to put a bit of a spotlight on it for the quarter because it's in record territory, right? There weren't 50,000 accounts when I started with the platform 20 years ago.

There weren't 50,000 accounts when I started with the platform 20 years ago. So to sign up 50,000 new businesses in a quarter is good. And then second, against the '19 baseline, I think I called out our bookings dollars were up 30%. So forget the weak comp against the normal quarter. A couple of years ago, it's way up. So the headline is our company sales were way up, that's headline 1. 
And Part B is so why they weigh up? I think it's the location we made into digital, So start, I don't know, 4 or 5 years ago, we did a bunch of things to get way better at digital marketing and selling, obviously, not the least of which is the whole tech stack that we build to be able to follow businesses and everywhere they crawl around and then what they do to advertising, figuring out where to spend and who to target money against to get them to visit our sites to optimizing our sites to get conversion rates and sales at the bottom end to applications going end-to-end where someone could go on our site and literally order the program and get cards in a couple of days and not have to talk to people.  
So the reengineering, I'd say, of the whole digital machinery has been, first of all, it was massive, but we're getting the returns of it now. It's obviously ramped way the heck up. And I think it's another huge step-up in our early plans for '22. So I would say that's the main, main driver, and we're doing that everywhere. We're just way smarter in how we target and how we study where prospects go and what they're looking at instead of trying to make up who we think might be interested in our products.  
So on your second question on bookings, the answer to it is, let's say, we said, hey, we sold, pick a number, $100 million of new business in this core. To Chuck's point, what that means is as you roll forward and that all gets implemented, it's obviously an annualized amount of $100 million. It wouldn't be $100 million in this year, like we sold it throughout the year, it'd be $50 million, for example, in that case. And so we have very different timings.  
In our Brazil business, we sell, and it's almost instamatic. In our fuel card business, we sell and we get it pretty soon. In our Corporate Payments business, which are bigger accounts, it takes longer. So our -- we basically know our sales, if you will, our new business for '22 because it's all sitting in our pipeline to be implemented. So the bookings number turns into an annualized revenue number, which is how we build our plans, and then the timing or what we call the in-year amount varies across the various businesses we have.  
But the main thing I want to make sure people are clear is it's working. I don't want to get lost in the details here that the company, our company, is selling more of everything than it's ever sold before ever."

I'd say basically that the first 10 years of the company's life was in a PE form with the alignment between investors and managers were super clear.

But I'd say the upside for us is probably not so much that, that the card orders would go up. It's really -- finally, the guy running it, and we finally found a way to grow the business. So -- and how long we followed our company, but I've been trying to sell a business since I bought it. And all the guys turned it into a business now that we think that can compound a double digit. 
So the way they've done it is instead of just being an administrator, an accountant for the Macy's gift card and count them $100 down, they help our clients now sell online. So they've moved over to helping sell online digital gift cards because they know a lot about it. They're getting paid extra for wallet provisioning. Half the gift cards, there's breakage where people can't find them anymore. They're in a drawer. 
And so super technically hard to move private label cards into wallets, but our guys came up with a way to do it. So we get paid money from a number of the brands to basically provision those electronically. And then the guy came up with the idea of selling the content. We have, I don't know, 300 or 400 pretty good brands. So we're taking them back to businesses because we're in the B2B business. So they've built a bit of a revenue and sales stream now taking them for rewards like companies like ours, for example, for employees.  
So these 2 or 3 new ideas on top of the kind of old chugging along kind of low single-digit business has propped that thing up now to being north of 10%. So -- and I went through the guys plan a couple of weeks ago. So I think finally have a set of ideas that are more sustainable to keep growing that business now."

Chuck is going to pull it out, but these should record levels. Whatever we sold in Q3 would have been an all-time record number of sales. And what I said about the recovery is Brazil is in a complete ditch COVID-wise in the spring and into the summer, and somehow has come out the other side. They are in a better price than we are here. 
So what that's done is it's opened the stores there where we sell a lot. We have kiosks and hundreds and hundreds of stores. So stores are open. People are walking. Mobility's back and more people are running through the tolls where we also sell. So the place is basically where we conduct business to try to make sales are kind of reactivated again, which is helping drive it.  
And then second, I think we said before, we've come up with a number of super new partner or channel ideas there. The newest one is we've got a couple of the big car manufacturers to put the tags now on the vehicles. So when you go in and get your new Volkswagen and drive it out of the dealership there, you look up and there's a sticker already there with a little POS thing that says, ""Hey, call this number go to this website."" We're getting like 50% or something conversion on adoption of these new vehicles rolling out of the dealership. So it's really -- I can't even tell you how good of a sales story that team has put together.  
But the -- as you said, the big, big idea for us and we poured a lot of capital into it this year in '21 is to double or triple the fueling locations, and the fueling transactions are up huge over a year ago now as we take the 6 million vehicles. So we had tags and given more places to use the tags. So that is the one said to me, where could the free money and real acceleration come. It could come from this massive group of people basically just having more places to use the tag and the accounts already on their vehicle."

And so the contracts generally would run anywhere from probably 3 to 5 Years. We just renewed actually a couple of them with some of our most important partners this year.  
In terms of what do I think I'd say down would be my answer. So if you look at -- I think we put, Jim, a slide in the earnings supplement. I think it's Page 15, Sanjay, but I think that's positive. Yes, it takes the 3 pieces of our Corporate Payments business, the partner thing that we're talking about and then the direct business where we go to the end client and then the cross-border business where we mostly go to the end client. So you can see that those two are growing revenue much faster. And so the mix itself, if you just run the clock forward would make the partner piece smaller, I think, going forward.  
So obviously, there's lot of spend there and spend grows fast. But to your point, they do more of the work. So obviously, our rates are much, much lower there than in the direct business. So we like the business, but obviously, 90% of our Corporate Payments business is in the directed cross-border."

I think obviously, there's more people trying to get into entire processing, whether it's virtual or just traditional physical cards. So I think, first off, that a lot of the players that get into are issue for issuing kinds of companies that are in that business, right, for FIs and for us, but yes, some of them are coming into our area.  
What I'd say back is fallacy is somehow that the game is tech and product to the X, Y, Z fintech has some great thing not old fashion FLEETCOR out of it. And what I'd say to you is what they're missing is it's the merchant network, you can't monetize virtual cards if you don't have a virtual card merchant network that can process and capture those transactions you can profit until the day goes on, but you have to have the network. So we've had a, call it, I don't know, a 10-year head start on everybody in cleansing, building, growing that network.  
And then the second one is the whole service dimension of a huge pay for you group, a massive group that helps the partners clean up the data and get the stuff processed. So I'd say those would be the couple of components that people missed that this isn't just making a new processing engine in the garage and giving it to AWS, and that's all going to be great. There's actual real assets that we have that cause our partners to stay with us. I mean, there was a big thing. Some came into my office a year, 2 of your clients, Build.com and AVIDA brought on other providers. We're doing great with them. We've renewed the contract for a number of years with one of them. We're getting more business than ever from another. We're obviously we have a great relationship.  
Some of those are targeted like the Marqeta thing, as an example, is targeted to FIs, which we're not even in. We're not in the processing business to help FIs. We thought they wouldn't use their own processes and stuff. And so I think like everything else, it's someone searching for some narrative that is in there. We've got a good business. It's growing. The spend is growing like crazy. But because we make so much more money on the direct businesses and a growing fast, that mix will cause the partner thing to be a bit smaller.  
But I think we're still -- I'd tell you, go call our partners. Don't ask me the supplier. Go ask our partners that they like the job we're doing. I look at the performance reports. I send performance reviews with the partners, myself personally. So from my vantage point, we're doing quite well."

The good news is -- the bad news is, a, the transactions are a little weaker than we thought. The good news is they're not worth much.  
So the two areas of weakness are in trucking, again, a particularly large trucking both here and in Europe. And you guys have read the press on this that the large trucking firms just don't have drivers. And not only are they not drivers, they're quitting and forming and going into smaller firms now. So our big accounts are effectively just soft in terms of trucks and transactions, but they're happy because they're just raising their rates.  
And then the second one I'd say is really Europe and the big corporates, they are the white collar book of business where people haven't gone back to work in Europe. And I don't know if you guys know it's been in Europe, lots of people of company cars. So people like us have a car and we used to drive around and get reimbursed. So those are the two areas that are weak.  
The good news is we don't get paid anything for those things. We don't get paid very much. So that's why our revenue growth is still pretty good. The local business, for example, in our partner business are super healthy, and even a big part of our U.K. business, which I'm looking at, had strong same-store sales recovery. So the areas where we get paid and we get revenue are actually pretty healthy."

So the way, I mean, I say this all the time, if you like businesses, you can plan, you should like our business, it's the nature of the model. And so what we do is we -- which we're about halfway through, we build things off of run rate. So we're staring here at October volumes and revenues in all of our businesses. And I think what I said is, hey, when you post $3.52 or $3.50, we multiply it and we go, okay, that sounds like $14, and we guided to a number we don't have in front of me, Chuck, that's $3.50-something for Q4 is a track stuff. So there's another one. 
So hey, we start with the company is running earning $14 on an annualized basis now. Then we sit there and say, ""Okay, we had sales record levels this year, of which, call it, 2/3 of that will be realized in 2022 so we can see what that number is."" Then we have a bigger sales plan for 2022, probably 20% higher, and we look at what's in here there. I'm like, ""hey, that looks good"".  
And then we look at the deals that I mentioned that are kind of on top of that, which I think I called out together, call it, $0.50 would be kind of my commitment on the stuff that we use capital for. So that's how we build the math. We take the run rate, we take this year, next year sales. We take added things like the accretion of deals, and that helps us basically target a number that we can get to. And we haven't planned a heck of a lot of COVID recovery. Obviously, it's -- we're just obviously 12 months this year. And so we've been pretty conservative so far and getting some of that back. We still have probably $100 million, $150 million that could literally come back a different day potentially. And so those are the components.  
And what I was trying to say -- and the other one is the macro. Obviously, fuel prices are higher here in November than they were in January and seem to be holding. And so when you roll all that up, my message is it looks super early, but it looks like a really good number. And the reason I go through all that math is to get people longer than us who are in the company some insight into how they ought to think about it. Things could happen, but the company is pretty well positioned to put up an attractive growth number for next year."

And so for us, the good news is the 2 big pieces, which are about 90% I'm looking at the thing are effectively flat. So because we price it, there's really no rate erosion in that out of our business. And so all of the rate erosion is really just in the mix of partners where we have tax table rates, and we have some partners that are growing like crazy. So as their volumes go up, they enjoy a bit better rates, right, in the base than the base rates. 
And so because we don't have the same kind of reliance, if you will, on the channel business, I think we're a bit more insulated, if you will, from rate compression there. And I mentioned it earlier, I'd say the super positive thing is our mix of that business is going to more full AP. And don't forget, we bought an SMB company that has higher rates. So as we roll in the full AP, the Nvoicepay mix and this Corpay One mix, those have a way higher rate than the existing businesses. So my guess is just kicking out the channel business, I see actually rate expansion over the next couple of years in that business mostly help from mix."

And so -- and again, we see it mostly in the large account trucking business. be the other thing, which we don't make any money in either. 
So I'd say that who knows? My guess is it's not a super easy fix for suddenly large trucking people to get the people, although you see the pictures of the at the ports of the need for more trucking. So my guess is there'll be more incentives and pressure to try to get more people into the space over the next 6 to 12 months. But I'd say it doesn't do much to us. One, it's limited only to that trucking vertical. Two, it's limited to the big firms, which don't pay as much. And, And three, honestly, it's kind of in our run rate. The softness has really been the year for the last couple of quarters. 
And so I don't see it really getting any worse, mostly because of what I said that I think there's going to be such a push to try to add people. And I think the rates are going to keep going up to attract people. So I'd say it's probably not a super duper impact on our forward thinking for the few of our business."

We are one of the easiest things to quantify for us is to look at clients we have, let's say, clients 1 through 100 and look at their volumes and revenue in a prior period, let's say, 2019 or Q3 of 2019.

And then, let's say, we still have those 100 clients to go look at their volume and revenue with us in Q3 of this year. So that's the stat we call same-store sales or the core client base. 
So yes, we -- for Corporate Payments or every business, we turn that into a revenue number and say, okay, we're some, whatever, $20 million with clients that used to give us $20 million more 2 quarters ago than they do now. And hey, we watch them to see whether some of that $20 million is coming back. So we have super clear visibility on the amount of it and the rate of recovery of it. Is that one clear?"

So hey, we guesstimated those 100 people would come back a certain way in Q3 from 2 years ago, and they came part of the way back. They come back to where we thought we'd at. That's 3 points more of growth in the things. So it's still a significant thing. And we'd be hopeful maybe we get it back and be kind of ready to get back a different day. 
On your second question, the credit question, I'd say yes, yes and yes. It's a super good question. It's record lifetime lows of credit losses, first of all, because we didn't sell much new business, obviously, in 2020. So there wasn't a lot of new business coming on. And then between the stimulus and relief and everything else, people repaid us and stuff. 
And so for sure, we've opened it up. I think Chuck said in the last call last time that we expect those losses to tick up. You can see it a bit in the roll rates, right, as we've onboarded a lot more business this year. Our Q4 losses will be a bit higher. 
And we're actually doing that juggling question now for 2022. Okay, how much do we -- how open do we want to be in credit both with existing accounts in terms of credit lines? I mean think of this, I've got fuel cards to have some credit line and the credit line is enough to pay their fuel card bills. What do they tell me they want to pay all my bill -- the bills with payment. And I said, okay, I lease with our credit. 
I mean our opportunity to increase credit to creditworthy people for our new products is like super high. And so I'd say we, for sure, will rebalance next year towards taking more risk certainly than this year and try to make that trade-off, right, between incremental sales and revenue growth and incremental losses. But we'll be careful. I want to make sure everyone on the call is clear, we're not crazy. We'll step our way in. We'll study our way in, but we will do more of it."

I'd say the most -- to me, the most exciting thing, which is coming mostly from the world out there is this synergy, this platform concept of bringing walk-around plastic, which is the business we've mostly been in with payable together. And so it's a way of trading, in our case, a massive synergy in these businesses we've built over 20 years of getting just way more out of them. 
So I gave the example earlier, we're launching late this month or the beginning of December, the thing we call the 2-in-1, where a client that has a business card of ours or a fuel card could also pay bills with us, and literally, it would just be in one place. He could use our card and our credit to pay some of his bills. Obviously, we'd have access that it was bank account to fund the bills. His report would show all his walk-around purchases like it does now and will show all his payables, the vendors, the way it is now, and it would all be in one place. 
And so that has the opportunity in joining up businesses that we have. That's what creates profit acceleration, right, where you don't have to go fish one at a time, right, for each new client, you can go back to this pretty gigantic customer base that we built and basically start to join it up and cross up that's useful to them. And the tech that we have now makes it look -- when you look at it, it's just stitched together now. 
So I'd say, that's the -- again, I try to say the thing, I'm also excited, I know people, doubt me -- doubt us, but we got a lot of legs in the businesses we have on that page. We pitch this beyond thing, and we've added segments everywhere in all the businesses which are adding growth. So I'm obviously super happy about that. But this integration and joining up in synergy where the new guys that have some nice new shiny product, they don't have a 20-year customer base and spend, and they don't get 50,000. So I mean, most of all year, your guys had signed 50,000 clients in the quarter. So that's the super exciting thing is can we monetize this bigger business profitably, would be what I'd say is the super new opportunity for us."
