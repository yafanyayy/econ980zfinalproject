Keysight delivered another outstanding quarter.

Keysight delivered another outstanding quarter. Our consistent performance illustrates the strength of our differentiated solutions, broad-based momentum across diverse end markets and the durability of our business model. Today, I'll focus my comments on 3 key headlines. First, we achieved record first quarter orders, driven by growth across all regions despite China trade headwinds. Second, strong execution by the Keysight team delivered revenue and earnings growth above guidance; and third, we entered the year with solid momentum across multiple end markets and confidence in our revenue and earnings growth trajectory for the year. Despite a short-term expectation of elevated expenses from variable compensation which is due to the high near-term revenue growth, we expect to achieve mid- to high teens earnings growth in fiscal 2021. 
Now let's take a deeper look into our first quarter results. We delivered record first quarter orders of $1.2 billion, which again exceeded revenue and grew 7%. First quarter revenue grew 8% to $1.2 billion. As previously discussed, we faced strong year-over-year headwinds in the first quarter due to China trade restrictions. Adjusting for this impact, both orders and revenue grew solid double digits. 
We continue to make strong progress towards our long-term financial targets with consistent execution and enabled by the strength and discipline of the Keysight leadership model. We delivered first quarter gross margin of 64%, operating margin of 27%, which increased 210 basis points and free cash flow of $267 million. Turning to our markets. Aerospace, defense and government achieved record first quarter orders and revenue. 20% revenue growth was driven by continued investment in electromagnetic spectrum operations, space and the new commercial technologies like 5G and early 6G research. 
In Commercial Communications, we achieved all-time record orders in total as well as for 5G, while revenue declined 3%. Adjusting for the transit impact of unfavorable trade restrictions, Commercial Communications orders grew double digits, and revenue grew high single digits. Strength was driven by ongoing global 5G deployments and the rollout of new 5G devices and continued investment in 400G and 800G Ethernet for data centers. 
Keysight's end-to-end solutions portfolio is enabling the rapid progression of new technologies, both in the wireless and wired systems of the communications network, where our value proposition remains strong. Keysight continues to lead the industry in 5G powered by years of close collaboration with market makers and standards bodies. We are advancing our 5G strategy to capture emerging opportunities in the application layer as momentum builds ahead of deployments in 2021. 
We made great progress this quarter as broad industries embrace our 5G platform and new applications emerge. For example, O-RAN continues to be an area of active investment for our customers. We recently introduced a suite of end-to-end solutions for O-RAN vendors and mobile operators. Our solutions are used to verify the interoperability, performance, conformance and security of multi-vendor 5G networks. 
We also announced strategic partnerships in the expanding O-RAN space with industry leaders like Xilinx, Radisys, Array and Alteo store. In addition, we continue to accelerate Keysight's capabilities to provide industry-leading solutions through strategic acquisitions. In Q1, we acquired Sangale, a leader in wireless test and measurement solutions for protocol decoding and interoperability. San Tele's offerings complement our end-to-end solutions portfolio providing problem-solving tools that extend from inside the wireless network out through over-the-air analytics. 
Record revenue for our Electronic Industrial Solutions group was driven by double-digit growth in semiconductors and general electronic solutions. Record semiconductor revenue was fueled by ongoing investment in next-generation process technologies bolstered by new customer wins in China as we successfully redeployed our sales force to capitalize on new opportunities. 
General electronics strength reflected continued economic recovery with growth across all regions and improvement in the advanced research education market. In automotive, despite ongoing macro challenges, and demand is stabilizing as strategic investments in advanced technologies have accelerated in Asia and in the Americas. In Europe, we continue to expand our presence and recently announced a collaboration with elring cleaner, one of the world's leading system partner to the automotive industry. 
They chose Keysight's battery test solution to advance e-mobility in the field of battery development for electric vehicles. Software and services each delivered double-digit order and revenue growth, combined, they were approximately 1/3 of total Keysight revenue contributing significantly to our software-centric solution strategy and differentiation and further strengthening the durability of our business model with increasing recurring revenue. 
In summary, I'd like to thank our Keysight employees around the world who have reacted dynamically to a challenging environment to deliver exceptional results for our customers and shareholders. We are pleased with our first quarter performance and encouraged by the broad-based momentum across our markets entering the year. 
Now I would like to turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail."

As Ron mentioned, the Keysight team delivered an outstanding first quarter as the continued economic recovery drove a steady improvement in demand across all major regions.

As Ron mentioned, the Keysight team delivered an outstanding first quarter as the continued economic recovery drove a steady improvement in demand across all major regions. First quarter revenue of $1,180,000,000 was above the high end of our guidance range and grew 8% or 6% on a core basis. Q1 revenue growth was driven by broad strength across multiple end markets and geographies. Total Keysight orders again exceeded revenue in Q1 with a book-to-bill just over 1. We achieved first quarter orders of $1,223,000,000, up 7% or 5% on a core basis successfully overcoming increased trade restrictions. 
Turning to our operational results for Q1. We reported gross margin of 64% and operating expenses of $439 million were well managed. Resulting in an operating margin of 27%, an increase of 210 basis points year-over-year. We achieved net income of $270 million and delivered $1.43 in earnings per share, which is well above the high end of our guidance. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 188 million shares. 
Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group generated record first quarter revenue of $852 million, up 4% and was delivering gross margin of 65% and operating margin of 26%. In Q1, Commercial Communications achieved all-time record total and 5G quarterly orders. First quarter revenue declined 3% to $558 million, with Commercial Communications disproportionately impacted by the China trade restrictions. 
Aerospace, defense and government achieved record first quarter revenue of $294 million, an increase of 20% versus a strong compare in Q1 last year. Growth was driven by robust year-end spending across all major regions. In the U.S., growth was driven by prime contractor spending, offsetting slightly lower our spending from direct government customers as we saw less than expected disruption from the U.S. administration transition. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated record revenue of $328 million, up 18% or 13% on a core basis. Orders and revenue for our Semiconductor and General Electronics Measurement Solutions both grew double digits for the second quarter in a row, with strong revenue growth across all regions, particularly in Asia Pacific. 
EISG reported gross margin of 63% and operating margin of 29%. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our first quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents and reported cash flow from operations of $295 million and free cash flow of $267 million or 23% of revenue. Under our share repurchase authorization during the quarter, we acquired approximately 137,000 shares on the open market at an average price of $145.14 for a total consideration of $20 million. Before moving to our guidance, I'd like to remind everyone of my comments last quarter, in which I stated that flexible spending and variable compensation is expected to increase in FY '21 with Q2 expenses seasonally higher than all other quarters. 
The principal driver is variable compensation, which is a function of organic revenue growth and operating margin. Just is reflect expenses down last year in response to a decline in revenue, it will flex up this year, particularly in quarters with soft revenue comps, notably Q2 and Q3. We believe our variable compensation is an important element of not only our flexible cost structure, but our human capital philosophy in which employees are engaged and participate in both the ups and downs of the business. 
Now turning to our outlook and guidance. We expect second quarter 2021 revenue to be in the range of $1,190,000,000 to $1,210,000,000, which represents 34% revenue growth at the midpoint. We expect Q2 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.29 to $1.35 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 188 million shares. 
In closing, we are entering the year with order momentum, a solid backlog position and strong operational execution. We are pleased with the trajectory of our business and expect to achieve mid- to high teens to earnings growth for the full fiscal year. 
With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A."

First of all, if you look at China, our China orders were down 6%, and we expected them to be down much more because of the effects of the China trade restrictions with Huawei. If you were to strip out Huawei, we had 19% order growth from our other Chinese customers. And as Huawei comes out of the compare in the past, we're very, very pleasantly surprised and pleased with that performance. Our Chinese sales force was redeployed from the accounts where they cannot sell into other accounts within the geography. And we were to do that almost instantaneously to produce the type of results that we did do. So that was clearly one. India was also very strong. Japan was very strong. Both of those well into double digits as well as Europe, which also hit double digit performance.

Jim, your second question was kind of forward-looking as it related to OpEx and I made some comments in my prepared remarks. Certainly, I think our underlying investment levels are stable and are likely to be stable going forward, but we do expect some short-term increases over the course of the next couple of quarters. And well, not the only impact, by far, the biggest driver of that increase is our variable pay program. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks last quarter, Q2 expenses are expected to be seasonally higher than all other quarters this year. The principal driver is the bounce back of variable compensation relative to last year. And that variable compensation is a function of both organic revenue growth and operating margin. 
And in quarters where we have soft revenue comps and therefore, higher revenue growth, like we will see in Q2 and in Q3 of this year, our variable compensation is going to be materially higher. So as you saw, we guided variable -- we guided very strong revenue growth of 34% in Q2 and expect a sequential increase as a result in our variable compensation program of more than $30 million relative to Q1. And since all of our nonexecutive employees are participants in that variable pay program. That increases split roughly equally between cost of sales, R&D and SG&A. So specifically impacting the OpEx lines that you asked about. 
But again, it's important to note that the underlying investment level is stable. And once we get past Q3, we're going to -- our variable pay and our expense levels are going to return to more normalized levels."

And what we saw this quarter was a broader adoption of 400-gig technology is still heavily driven by data center demand, which tends to -- you're seeing -- which is adopting, I should say, the 400-gig at scale, we saw increased spend from Tier 2 and long-term -- long tail customers in Asia, in particular. And we expect as the 400-gig economies of scale and maturity occur that more of that demand would start to shift in the telco or metro opportunities. So there is -- we're still on the front end of that. 
I would also say that on 800-gig, the investments are in early R&D which we expect to play out in production in 18 to 24 months. So we're engaged early. Just this quarter, we announced a full suite of R&D offerings for 800-gig as well, which positions us well to benefit from not only the wireless on the 5G side, but also from the wireline opportunities in our commercial communications business. 
As far as the software, I'll kick it off and maybe Neil can make a comment, we see for our double-digit growth in software coming from our Pathwave design franchise and from the 5G Solutions, which, as we have referenced before, have a higher percentage of software content with them.

So you can see we're very deliberate, and we're very focused. And we will not go ahead and go after things that are too speculative. So that is our first priority. 
The second thing, if we had -- if we have excess funds, at the end of the day, we would rather do that through opportunistic share repurchases. As you saw, not this quarter, but as you saw in Q4, where our average price was below $100 in the shares that we did repurchase. 
But -- and then third would be to do something like a dividend, but we're far, far from that at this point. But still, first, we're going ahead and making sure after organic growth is funded through over $700 million in R&D. Second, it's to look for M&A. That could go at and enhance our growth and produce a higher return on invested capital. Third, clearly, is to look for opportunistic, opportunistic share buybacks, which we have done. And we plan to make sure we're at least antidilutive, like we've stated before, but we will get a little bit more aggressive if we see a very big opportunity."

Keysight delivered another outstanding quarter. Our consistent performance illustrates the strength of our differentiated solutions, broad-based momentum across diverse end markets and the durability of our business model. Today, I'll focus my comments on 3 key headlines. First, we achieved record first quarter orders, driven by growth across all regions despite China trade headwinds. Second, strong execution by the Keysight team delivered revenue and earnings growth above guidance. And third, we entered the year with solid momentum across multiple end markets and confidence in our revenue and earnings growth trajectory for the year. 
Despite a short-term expectation of elevated expenses from variable compensation which is due to the high near-term revenue growth, we expect to achieve mid- to high teens earnings growth in fiscal 2021.  
Now let's take a deeper look into our first quarter results. We delivered record first quarter orders of $1.2 billion, which again exceeded revenue and grew 7%. First quarter revenue grew 8% to $1.2 billion. As previously discussed, we faced strong year-over-year headwinds in the first quarter due to China trade restrictions. Adjusting for this impact, both orders and revenue grew solid double digits.  
We continue to make strong progress towards our long-term financial targets with consistent execution and enabled by the strength and discipline of the Keysight leadership model. We delivered first quarter gross margin of 64%, operating margin of 27%, which increased 210 basis points and free cash flow of $267 million. 
Turning to our markets. Aerospace, defense and government achieved record first quarter orders and revenue. 20% revenue growth was driven by continued investment in electromagnetic spectrum operations, space and the new commercial technologies like 5G and early 6G research.  
In commercial communications, we achieved all-time record orders in total as well as for 5G, while revenue declined 3%. Adjusting for the transit impact of unfavorable trade restrictions, commercial communications orders grew double digits, and revenue grew high single digits. Strength was driven by ongoing global 5G deployments and the rollout of new 5G devices and continued investment in 400G and 800G Ethernet for data centers.  
Keysight's end-to-end solutions portfolio is enabling the rapid progression of new technologies, both in the wireless and wired systems of the communications network, where our value proposition remains strong. Keysight continues to lead the industry in 5G powered by years of close collaboration with market makers and standards bodies. We are advancing our 5G strategy to capture emerging opportunities in the application layer as
momentum builds ahead of deployments in 2021.  
We made great progress this quarter as broad industries embrace our 5G platform and new applications emerge. For example, O-RAN continues to be an area of active investment for our customers. We recently introduced a suite of end-to-end solutions for O-RAN vendors and mobile operators. Our solutions are used to verify the interoperability, performance, conformance and security of multi-vendor 5G networks.  
We also announced strategic partnerships in the expanding O-RAN space with industry leaders like Xilinx, Radisys, ArrayComm and Altiostar. In addition, we continue to accelerate Keysight's capabilities to provide industry-leading solutions through strategic acquisitions. In Q1, we acquired Sanjole, a leader in wireless test and measurement solutions for protocol decoding and interoperability. Sanjole's offerings complement our end-to-end solutions portfolio providing problem-solving tools that extend from inside the wireless network out through over-the-air analytics.  
Record revenue for our Electronic Industrial Solutions Group was driven by double-digit growth in semiconductors and general electronic solutions. Record semiconductor revenue was fueled by ongoing investment in next-generation process technologies bolstered by new customer wins in China as we successfully redeployed our sales force to capitalize on new opportunities.  
General electronics strength reflected continued economic recovery with growth across all regions and improvement in the advanced research education market. In automotive, despite ongoing macro challenges and demand is stabilizing as strategic investments in advanced technologies have accelerated in Asia and in the Americas. 
In Europe, we continue to expand our presence and recently announced a collaboration with ElringKlinger, one of the world's leading system partners to the automotive industry.  
They chose Keysight's battery test solution to advance e-mobility in the field of battery development for electric vehicles. Software and services each delivered double-digit order and revenue growth. Combined, they were approximately 1/3 of total Keysight revenue contributing significantly to our software-centric solution strategy and differentiation and further strengthening the durability of our business model with increasing recurring revenue.  
In summary, I'd like to thank our Keysight employees around the world who have reacted dynamically to a challenging environment to deliver exceptional results for our customers and shareholders. We are pleased with our first quarter performance and encouraged by the broad-based momentum across our markets entering the year.  
Now I would like to turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail."

As Ron mentioned, the Keysight team delivered an outstanding first quarter as the continued economic recovery drove a steady improvement in demand across all major regions.

As Ron mentioned, the Keysight team delivered an outstanding first quarter as the continued economic recovery drove a steady improvement in demand across all major regions. First quarter revenue of $1.18 billion was above the high end of our guidance range and grew 8% or 6% on a core basis. 
Q1 revenue growth was driven by broad strength across multiple end markets and geographies. Total Keysight orders again exceeded revenue in Q1 with a book-to-bill just over 1. We achieved first quarter orders of $1.223 billion, up 7% or 5% on a core basis successfully overcoming increased trade restrictions.  
Turning to our operational results for Q1. We reported gross margin of 64% and operating expenses of $439 million were well managed. Resulting in an operating margin of 27%, an increase of 210 basis points year-over-year. We achieved net income of $270 million and delivered $1.43 in earnings per share, which is well above the high end of our guidance. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 188 million shares.  
Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group generated record first quarter revenue of $852 million, up 4%. Was delivering gross margin of 65% and operating margin of 26%. In Q1, commercial communications achieved all-time record total and 5G quarterly orders. First quarter revenue declined 3% to $558 million, with commercial communications disproportionately impacted by the China trade restrictions.  
Aerospace, defense and government achieved record first quarter revenue of $294 million, an increase of 20% versus a strong compare in Q1 last year. Growth was driven by robust year-end spending across all major regions. In the U.S., growth was driven by prime contractor spending, offsetting slightly lower spending from direct government customers as we saw less-than-expected disruption from the U.S. administration transition. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated record revenue of $328 million, up 18% from 13% on a core basis. 
Orders and revenue for our semiconductor and general electronics measurement solutions both grew double digits for the second quarter in a row, with strong revenue growth across all regions, particularly in Asia Pacific.  
EISG reported gross margin of 63% and operating margin of 29%. Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our first quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents and reported cash flow from operations of $295 million and free cash flow of $267 million or 23% of revenue. Under our share repurchase authorization during the quarter, we acquired approximately 137,000 shares on the open market at an average price of $145.14 for a total consideration of $20 million. Before moving to our guidance, I'd like to remind everyone of my comments last quarter, in which I stated that flexible spending and variable compensation is expected to increase in FY '21 with Q2 expenses seasonally higher than all other quarters.  
The principal driver is variable compensation, which is a function of organic revenue growth and operating margin. Just as we flexed expenses down last year in response to a decline in revenue, it will flex up this year, particularly in quarters with soft revenue comps, notably Q2 and Q3. We believe our variable compensation is an important element of not only our flexible cost structure, but our human capital philosophy in which employees are engaged and participate in both the ups and downs of the business.  
Now turning to our outlook and guidance. We expect second quarter 2021 revenue to be in the range of $1.19 billion to $1.210 billion which represents 34% revenue growth at the midpoint. We expect Q2 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.29 to $1.35 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 188 million shares.  
In closing, we are entering the year with order momentum, a solid backlog position and strong operational execution. We are pleased with the trajectory of our business and expect to achieve mid- to high teens of earnings growth for the full fiscal year.  
With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A."

Jim, your second question was kind of forward-looking as it related to OpEx and I made some comments in my prepared remarks. Certainly, I think our underlying investment levels are stable and are likely to be stable going forward, but we do expect some short-term increases over the course of the next couple of quarters.  And well, not the only impact, by far, the biggest driver of that increase is our variable pay program. 
As I mentioned in my prepared remarks last quarter, Q2 expenses are expected to be seasonally higher than all other quarters this year. The principal driver is the bounce back of variable compensation relative to last year. And that variable compensation is a function of both organic revenue growth and operating margin. 
And in quarters where we have soft revenue comps and therefore, higher revenue growth, like we will see in Q2 and in Q3 of this year, our variable compensation is going to be materially higher. So as you saw, we guided variable -- we guided very strong revenue growth of 34% in Q2 and expect a sequential increase as a result in our variable compensation program of more than $30 million relative to Q1. 
And since all of our nonexecutive employees are participants in that variable pay program. That increases split roughly equally between cost of sales, R&D and SG&A. So specifically impacting the OpEx lines that you asked about. 
But again, it's important to note that the underlying investment level is stable. And once we get past Q3, we're going to -- our variable pay and our expense levels are going to return to more normalized levels."

And what we saw this quarter was a broader adoption of 400-gig technology still heavily driven by data center demand, which tends to -- which is seeing -- which is adopting, I should say, the 400-gig at scale. 
We saw increased spend from Tier 2 and long-term -- long tail customers in Asia, in particular. And we expect as the 400-gig economies of scale and maturity occur that more of that demand would start to shift in the telco or metro opportunities. So there is -- we're still on the front end of that. 
I would also say that on 800-gig, the investments are in early R&D which we expect to play out in production in 18 to 24 months. So we're engaged early. Just this quarter, we announced a full suite of R&D offerings for 800-gig as well, which positions us well to benefit from not only the wireless on the 5G side, but also from the wireline opportunities in our commercial communications business.

If you think of it, the focus on high-speed evolutions, 400-gig, 800-gig terahertz -- terabit Ethernet and beyond. And security as a second theme, which is gaining customer interest.

Keysight delivered a record quarter and we are entering the second half of the year with momentum.

Keysight delivered a record quarter and we are entering the second half of the year with momentum. Our broad portfolio of differentiated solutions continues to drive growth across a diverse set of growing markets. 
Today, I'll focus my comments on 3 key headlines. First, we delivered outstanding Q2 results with all-time record orders, revenue and free cash flow. Second, Keysight is enabling leading-edge disruptive innovation around the world. Our solutions have significant differentiation and contribute significant value to customers. which is fueling our growth for the long term. Third, while we are managing longer lead times and component availability, our leading market position, strong customer relationships and supply chain resiliency gives us the confidence in our ability to deliver on our commitments. 
Now let's take a deeper look across our second quarter performance across both business segments. Record orders of $1.3 billion grew 22%. Revenue grew 36% to $1.2 billion, which was an all-time high. We delivered second quarter gross margin of 64%, operating margin of 26% and earnings of $1.44, which was above the high end of our guidance and represents 85% year-over-year earnings growth. We also achieved record free cash flow of $369 million. Over the last 12 months, Keysight generated just over $1 billion of free cash flow that we've deployed through approximately $500 million in acquisitions and $455 million in share repurchases. 
We continue to be active and disciplined in our capital deployment. Second quarter strength was broad-based with double-digit order and revenue growth across all markets and regions. Outstanding results by both business segments demonstrates the power of Keysight's diversified portfolio in 5G and beyond. 
Our Electronic Industrial Solutions Group achieved its third consecutive quarter of record revenue with strong double-digit order and revenue growth in general electronics, semiconductor and automotive. The breadth of our contributions across multiple industries is exemplified by our double-digit order and revenue growth in our general electronics business. With ongoing investment in broad digital transformation, including advanced consumer electronics, digital health care and industrial IoT, Keysight is enabling innovation and capturing technology inflections for the IoT ecosystem. 
Strong demand for our semiconductor solutions drove record orders and revenue. Customer investment in advanced technology nodes remains high, while capacity is expanding for mature processes to address surging global semiconductor demands. In automotive, record orders resulted from improved macro conditions and increasing investments in EV and AV technologies. Keysight solutions portfolio for the automotive market continues to expand with new advanced technologies such as AC power emulation, millimeter wave radar, power semiconductor technology, automotive Ethernet, C-V2X and cybersecurity software systems. As the reinvention of automotive ecosystems continues, Keysight is enabling the disruptive innovation of new mobility technologies. 
Our Communications Solutions Group achieved record orders and delivered double-digit order and revenue growth in commercial communications and aerospace defense and government. Aerospace, defense and government revenue grew 46%, driven by strong demand in space, satellite, signal monitoring, 5G and early 6G research applications. Keysight's engagement with key industry players remain strong. We recently enabled a large prime contractors first test bed and have secured multiple 5G solutions wins in the aerospace, defense and government markets. 
Commercial Communications orders and revenue both grew double digits, driven by the ongoing investments in 5G and 400 gig, 800 gig Ethernet solutions for data centers. As 5G progresses and deployments drive sustained investment, we are uniquely positioned to capture the opportunities ahead as the ecosystem scales. Recent engagements include a broadening set of new customers as well as key industry players such as NEC, Fujitsu and MediaTek. We continue to maximize the 5G life cycle opportunity and lead the industry with differentiated 5G solutions. 
In addition, the success of our application layer strategy is reflected in the strong demand for new technologies such as O-RAN and business expansion in new end-to-end verticals. Our ability to provide complete solutions for network protocol test, security and visibility is enabling us to solve many challenges across the industry. 
In another area of disruption, we continue to advance our long-term initiative to enable the Quantum revolution. We are growing our quantum engagements with key customers worldwide. We also expanded our Quantum Solutions portfolio this quarter with the acquisition of Quantum Benchmark, which brings deep expertise in the performance validation software for quantum computing. Keysight's software-centric solutions in higher-value services continue to drive differentiation and recurring revenue growth. For the second quarter in a row, software and services each delivered double-digit order and revenue growth. 
Beyond innovation, execution and financial discipline, Keysight's culture has long embraced corporate social responsibility. We believe our focus on climate and diversity provides us with a competitive advantage. We recently published our annual CSR report, which includes progress towards our prior goals and the announcement of our commitment to achieving net zero emissions in the company operations by 2040. We are working to set interim science-based targets to ensure our progress towards this goal. 
Diversity and inclusion are also embodied in our Keysight leadership model. As a CEO priority, we have specific goals and actions that will be tracked by our leadership team and the Board of Directors. Diversity and inclusion brief will be published this month that describes our long-standing D&I philosophy as well as the details of our strategies and goals. 
While there is more work to do, Keysight remains steadfast in our commitment to CSR and building a better planet. As we look ahead, we are encouraged by the strong demand for our differentiated solutions while managing the longer lead times and component availability constraints. Our in-house high-performance semiconductor fab and the strength of our order fulfillment team are helping us manage these near-term supply challenges and give us confidence in our ability to navigate them entering the second half of this year. 
In summary, Keysight is enabling disruptive innovation across multiple waves of technology with a decades-long runway ahead of us. Our execution in the face of many dynamic challenges this past year is a testament to the Keysight leadership model, our employees and the breadth and depth of our customers. Now I would like to turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail."

As Ron mentioned, the Keysight team delivered another outstanding quarter and better-than-expected results as robust demand for our differentiated solutions and continued macro recovery resulted in strong growth across all regions. 
Second quarter revenue of $1.22 billion was above the high end of our guidance range and grew 36% or 33% on a core basis versus a soft compare due to COVID-related disruption. Q2 revenue growth was driven by broad strength across all markets and geographies as the Keysight team navigated macro dynamics and supply chain constraints. We achieved second quarter orders of $1,332 million, up 22% or 19% on a core basis. 
Turning to our operational results for Q2. We reported gross margin of 64%, which increased 170 basis points. Operating expenses of $467 million were well managed, resulting in operating margin of 26%. As discussed last quarter, variable pay expense increased approximately $30 million sequentially as a result of higher revenue growth and operating margin. We achieved net income of $270 million and delivered $1.44 in earnings per share, which was above the high end of our guidance. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 187 million shares. 
Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group achieved second quarter revenue of $877 million, up 34% while delivering gross margin of 65% and operating margin of 25%. Commercial Communications orders and revenue in the second quarter were all-time highs. Revenue of $606 million increased 30%, driven by continued investment across the 5G life cycle. Aerospace, defense and government revenue of $271 million grew 46%, resulting from strong demand across all regions, primarily in the U.S. and Asia Pacific, followed by a strong recovery in Europe. 
The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated record revenue of $344 million, up 42% or 37% on a core basis. Order and revenue strength was notable across all regions, particularly in Asia Pacific. Semiconductor, general electronics measurement and automotive solutions orders and revenue all grew strong double digit. EISG reported gross margin of 64% and operating margin of 28%. 
Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our second quarter with approximately $2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and reported cash flow from operations of $402 million and free cash flow of $369 million or 30% of revenue. Our capital allocation priorities are unchanged and are focused on investments in organic growth, value-creating acquisitions and share repurchases. Under our share repurchase authorization, during the quarter, we acquired 1.59 million shares on the open market at an average price of $138.36 for a total consideration of $220 million. 
Now turning to our outlook and guidance. We expect third quarter 2021 revenue to be in the range of $1,205 billion to $1,225 million, which represents 20% revenue growth at the midpoint. We expect Q3 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.39 to $1.45 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 187 million shares. 
In closing, we are entering the second half of the year with strong momentum. We are pleased with our operational execution and remain confident in our ability to drive growth and deliver on our commitments. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A."

We are already seeing a pretty steady business for millimeter wave offerings from our customers for the past few years. So we expect it to continue to grow. Again, we're on the front end of something that's going to play out over the next decade because of the progression in millimeter wave spectrum from 20 to 40 to 70 to 90 gigahertz. And then with 6G coming in with terahertz, so there is a big long-term road map that's playing out. Specific to your question on 5G, maybe I can offer a data point. If you think of the certification being a critical parameter for 5G devices, about 150 devices are being certified right now. About 30% of them have millimeter wave in it. So that paints the picture hopefully. And the total number of 5G devices right now that are being released is about 700. So it sort of gives you maybe a framing on where we are. It's still very early days."

And the most important part is that when you look at custom ICs, which have a very, very long lead time for many folks in the industry, we have an on-site fab that creates and produces all of our custom ICs. So that enables us to basically have complete control of that supply chain for the critical custom parts. We're very confident in the guide that we have.

Specific to the application layer, we identified a few areas around different end market verticals and new applications to focus on about a year ago, and that's paying rich dividends. On the new application front, it's the Open RAN, where it's an open virtualized network bringing in new customers and more players into the ecosystem. So we had strong demand for our solutions that we launched in Q1 and quarter 1. And on the new vertical side, we gained traction with a lot of the aerospace and defense companies that are looking to invest in the DoD's 5G program. So both those are going very well.

First of all, with regard to our free cash flow, obviously, we're very, very pleased with the cash generation of the business. Cash [indiscernible] was unusually strong here in the second quarter. I think there are a couple of drivers of that. One is the increasing deferred revenue balance as a result of our push into software and services and building recurring revenue. So that's a great long-term trend. And there's one significant timing difference, which we've already talked about. And that has to do with the variable pay. Obviously, we've recruited that variable pay based on what was earned here in the second quarter, but that will not hit the paychecks of our employees until Q3. And so there'll be a bit of reversal of that over the course of a couple of quarters because we expect accruals to be high here in the third quarter as well. 
As it looks to gross margin, we are seeing, in some cases, some increasing input costs. But as we've said, most of our highly differentiated ICs are manufactured in-house. I think that helps shield us. I think long term, if you look at our business, the push that we have again towards increasing software content, increasing recurring revenue, the migration of business into selling into our customers' R&D labs, the move towards complete solutions that are more highly differentiated, all of those things are helping to drive the gross margin performance that you've seen in this business over a number of years, right? At the time of our spin, we were in the mid- to upper 50s, and now we're in the mid-60s. And so I think we've got a lot of great momentum in that space. And as we continue to build software in our solutions portfolio, I think there's still room for further improvement."

Keysight delivered a record quarter and we are entering the second half of the year with momentum. Our broad portfolio of differentiated solutions continues to drive growth across a diverse set of growing markets. Today, I'll focus my comments on 3 key headlines. First, we delivered outstanding Q2 results with all-time record orders, revenue and free cash flow. Second, Keysight is enabling leading-edge disruptive innovation around the world. Our solutions have significant differentiation and contribute significant value to customers, which is fueling our growth for the long term. Third, while we are managing longer lead times and component availability, our leading market position, strong customer relationships and supply chain resiliency gives us the confidence in our ability to deliver on our commitments.  
Now let's take a deeper look across our second quarter performance across both business segments. Record orders of $1.3 billion grew 22%. Revenue grew 36% to $1.2 billion, which was an all-time high. We delivered second quarter gross margin of 64%, operating margin of 26% and earnings of $1.44, which was above the high end of our guidance and represents 85% year-over-year earnings growth. We also achieved record free cash flow of $369 million. Over the last 12 months, Keysight generated just over $1 billion of free cash flow that we've deployed through approximately $500 million in acquisitions and $455 million in share repurchases. 
We continue to be active and disciplined in our capital deployment. Second quarter strength was broad-based with double-digit order and revenue growth across all markets and regions. Outstanding results by both business segments demonstrates the power of Keysight's diversified portfolio in 5G and beyond. Our Electronic Industrial Solutions Group achieved its third consecutive quarter of record revenue with strong double-digit order and revenue growth in general electronics, semiconductor and automotive. The breadth of our contributions across multiple industries is exemplified by our double-digit order and revenue growth in our general electronics business. 
With ongoing investment in broad digital transformation, including advanced consumer electronics, digital health care and industrial IoT, Keysight is enabling innovation and capturing technology inflections for the IoT ecosystem.  
Strong demand for our semiconductor solutions drove record orders and revenue. Customer investment in advanced technology nodes remains high, while capacity is expanding for mature processes to address surging global semiconductor demands. In automotive, record orders resulted from improved macro conditions and increasing investments in EV and AV technologies. Keysight solutions portfolio for the automotive market continues to expand with new advanced technologies such as AC power emulation, millimeter wave radar, power semiconductor technology, automotive ethernet, C-V2X and cybersecurity software systems. As the reinvention of automotive ecosystems continues, Keysight is enabling the disruptive innovation of new mobility technologies.  
Our Communications Solutions Group achieved record orders and delivered double-digit order and revenue growth in commercial communications and aerospace defense and government. Aerospace, defense and government revenue grew 46%, driven by strong demand in space, satellite, signal monitoring, 5G and early 6G research applications. Keysight's engagement with key industry players remains strong. We recently enabled a large prime contractors first test bed and have secured multiple 5G solutions wins in the aerospace, defense and government markets.  
Commercial Communications orders and revenue both grew double digits, driven by the ongoing investments in 5G and 400 gig, 800 gig Ethernet solutions for data centers. As 5G progresses and deployments drive sustained investment, we are uniquely positioned to capture the opportunities ahead as the ecosystem scales. Recent engagements include a broadening set of new customers as well as key industry players such as NEC, Fujitsu and MediaTek. We continue to maximize the 5G life cycle opportunity and lead the industry with differentiated 5G solutions.  
In addition, the success of our application layer strategy is reflected in the strong demand for new technologies such as O-RAN and business expansion in new end-to-end verticals. Our ability to provide complete solutions for network protocol test, security and visibility is enabling us to solve many challenges across the industry. In another area of disruption, we continue to advance our long-term initiative to enable the quantum revolution. We are growing our quantum engagements with key customers worldwide. We also expanded our quantum solutions portfolio this quarter with the acquisition of Quantum Benchmark, which brings deep expertise in the performance validation software for quantum computing. Keysight's software-centric solutions in higher-value services continue to drive differentiation and recurring revenue growth. 
For the second quarter in a row, software and services each delivered double-digit order and revenue growth. Beyond innovation, execution and financial discipline, Keysight's culture has long embraced corporate social responsibility. We believe our focus on climate and diversity provides us with a competitive advantage. We recently published our annual CSR report, which includes progress towards our prior goals and the announcement of our commitment to achieving net zero emissions in the company operations by 2040. We are working to set interim science-based targets to ensure our progress towards this goal.  
Diversity and inclusion are also embodied in our Keysight leadership model. As a CEO priority, we have specific goals and actions that will be tracked by our leadership team and the Board of Directors. Diversity and inclusion brief will be published this month that describes our long-standing D&I philosophy as well as the details of our strategies and goals.  
While there is more work to do, Keysight remains steadfast in our commitment to CSR and building a better planet. As we look ahead, we are encouraged by the strong demand for our differentiated solutions while managing the longer lead times and component availability constraints. Our in-house high-performance semiconductor fab and the strength of our order fulfillment team are helping us manage these near-term supply challenges and give us confidence in our ability to navigate them entering the second half of this year.  
In summary, Keysight is enabling disruptive innovation across multiple waves of technology with a decades-long runway ahead of us. Our execution in the face of many dynamic challenges this past year is a testament to the Keysight leadership model, our employees and the breadth and depth of our customers. Now I would like to turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail."

As Ron mentioned, the Keysight team delivered another outstanding quarter and better-than-expected results as robust demand for our differentiated solutions and continued macro recovery resulted in strong growth across all regions.  
Second quarter revenue of $1.22 billion was above the high end of our guidance range and grew 36% or 33% on a core basis versus a soft compare due to COVID-related disruption. Q2 revenue growth was driven by broad strength across all markets and geographies as the Keysight team navigated macro dynamics and supply chain constraints. We achieved second quarter orders of $1.332 billion, up 22% or 19% on a core basis.  
Turning to our operational results for Q2. We reported gross margin of 64%, which increased 170 basis points. Operating expenses of $467 million were well managed, resulting in operating margin of 26%. As discussed last quarter, variable pay expense increased approximately $30 million sequentially as a result of higher revenue growth and operating margin. We achieved net income of $270 million and delivered $1.44 in earnings per share, which was above the high end of our guidance. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 187 million shares.  
Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group achieved second quarter revenue of $877 million, up 34% while delivering gross margin of 65% and operating margin of 25%. Commercial Communications orders and revenue in the second quarter were all-time highs. Revenue of $606 million increased 30%, driven by continued investment across the 5G life cycle. Aerospace, defense and government revenue of $271 million grew 46%, resulting from strong demand across all regions, primarily in the U.S. and Asia Pacific, followed by a strong recovery in Europe.  
The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated record revenue of $344 million, up 42% or 37% on a core basis. Order and revenue strength was notable across all regions, particularly in Asia Pacific. Semiconductor, general electronics measurement and automotive solutions orders and revenue all grew strong double digit. EISG reported gross margin of 64% and operating margin of 28%.  
Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our second quarter with approximately $2 billion in cash and cash equivalents and reported cash flow from operations of $402 million and free cash flow of $369 million or 30% of revenue. Our capital allocation priorities are unchanged and are focused on investments in organic growth, value-creating acquisitions and share repurchases.  
Under our share repurchase authorization during the quarter, we acquired 1.59 million shares on the open market at an average price of $138.36 for a total consideration of $220 million.  
Now turning to our outlook and guidance. We expect third quarter 2021 revenue to be in the range of $1.205 billion to $1.225 billion, which represents 20% revenue growth at the midpoint. We expect Q3 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.39 to $1.45 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 187 million shares.  
In closing, we are entering the second half of the year with strong momentum. We are pleased with our operational execution and remain confident in our ability to drive growth and deliver on our commitments. With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A."

We are already seeing a pretty steady business for millimeter wave offerings from our customers for the past few years. So we expect it to continue to grow. Again, we're on the front end of something that's going to play out over the next decade because of the progression in millimeter wave spectrum from 20 to 40 to 70 to 90 gigahertz. And then with 6G coming in with terahertz, so there is a big long-term road map that's playing out. Specific to your question on 5G, maybe I can offer a data point. If you think of the certification being a critical parameter for 5G devices, about 150 devices are being certified right now. About 30% of them have millimeter wave in it. So that paints the picture, hopefully. And the total number of 5G devices right now that are being released is about 700. So it sort of gives you maybe a framing on where we are. It's still very early days."

Of course, we see some COVID manufacturing decreases in capacity as well as some supply chain components shortages. However, we planned ahead. We fought for those. And the most important part is that when you look at custom ICs, which have a very, very long lead time for many folks in the industry, we have an on-site fab that creates and produces all of our custom ICs. So that enables us to basically have complete control of that supply chain for the critical custom parts. We're very confident in the guide that we have.

And so essentially, some of the COVID restrictions, of social distancing and all that, essentially means that customers have -- are looking at ramping up capacity for the future. But it's a steady demand that gives us confidence in our long-term outlook for the business. That's just one dimension of capacity.

First of all, with regard to our free cash, obviously, we're very, very pleased with the cash generation of the business. Cash penetration was unusually strong here in the second quarter. I think there are a couple of drivers of that. One is the increasing deferred revenue balance as a result of our push into software and services and building recurring revenue. So that's a great long-term trend. And there's one significant timing difference, which we've already talked about. And that has to do with the variable pay. Obviously, we've recruited that variable pay based on what was earned here in the second quarter, but that will not hit the paychecks of our employees until Q3. And so there'll be a bit of reversal of that over the course of a couple of quarters, because we expect accruals to be high here in the third quarter as well. 
As it looks to gross margin, we are seeing, in some cases, some increasing input costs. But as we've said, most of our highly differentiated ICs are manufactured in-house. I think that helps shield us. I think long term, if you look at our business, the push that we have, again towards increasing software content, increasing recurring revenue, the migration of business into selling into our customers' R&D labs, the move towards complete solutions that are more highly differentiated, all of those things are helping to drive the gross margin performance that you've seen in this business over a number of years, right? At the time of our spin, we were in the mid- to upper 50s, and now we're in the mid-60s. And so I think we've got a lot of great momentum in that space. And as we continue to build software in our solutions portfolio, I think there's still room for further improvement."

Keysight delivered another quarter of excellent results. Solid industry dynamics are accelerating demand for our differentiated solutions, and we continue to capitalize on broad-based technology investment across a diverse set of growing markets. 
Today, I'll focus my comments on 3 key headlines. First, we delivered record Q3 orders, all-time record revenue and our highest quarterly operating margin of the year. The durability of our business model was on full display as we continue to effectively navigate supply chain challenges. 
Second, Keysight's first-to-market software-centric solution strategy continues to yield consistently strong results. Since our launch in 2015 through our expected 2021 finish, we will have delivered 9% compound annual revenue growth and 16% annualized earnings growth, both well above our long-term commitments despite significant headwinds of trade restrictions and a global pandemic. Our investments are well aligned with the highest impact market opportunities as we continue to enable our customer success and deliver value to our shareholders. 
Third, given our outstanding performance year-to-date, we expect to achieve 2021 year-over-year revenue growth of 16% and EPS of $6.03, which represents 24% earnings growth at the midpoint of our guidance. We have strong momentum entering 2022, and our long-term revenue and earnings growth targets remain intact and we expect to drive incremental margin expansion going forward. 
Now let's take a deeper look at our third quarter performance. Record Q3 orders of $1.3 billion grew 23%. All-time record revenue also grew 23% to $1.2 billion. We delivered gross margin of 65%, operating margin of 27% and earnings of $1.54, which was well above the high end of our guidance and represents 29% year-over-year earnings growth. 
Keysight continues to deliver outstanding growth despite year-over-year headwinds due to trade restrictions and ongoing supply chain disruption. Our growth rates are not only just a result of soft year-over-year comparisons, but also reflect sustained multiyear above-market growth. For example, Q3 orders are up 18% and revenue was up 15% versus the same quarter in 2019 prior to the global pandemic. The strength and durability of our business model are delivering as expected. We see accelerated demand from our differentiated solutions from both existing and new customers. Our customer engagement throughout the pandemic has been strong with approximately 1,900 new customers added in 2020, which we would expect to exceed in 2021. 
Looking at our business segments, for the third quarter in a row, we reported double-digit year-over-year order and revenue growth across both segments and all regions, demonstrating the breadth and differentiated portfolio across a diverse set of end markets. Our Electronic Industrial Solutions Group achieved strong double-digit order and revenue growth across all regions, as well as its fourth consecutive quarter of record revenue. Continued investment in chipsets for 5G data center, cloud and AI applications drove demand for our differentiated semiconductor solutions, resulting in another quarter of record orders and revenue. 
Investment also remains high in advanced technology nodes and capacity expansion for mature processes to address surge in global semiconductor demands. Our general electronics business achieved record Q3 orders and revenue. 4 consecutive quarters of double-digit order and revenue growth demonstrate Keysight's breadth of contributions across multiple industries. Strength in the quarter was driven by investments in customers' broad-based digital transformation, industrial IoT, digital health, Industry 4.0 and advanced academic research. In automotive, record Q3 orders and all-time record revenue were driven by the ongoing macroeconomic recovery, acceleration in EV and AV technology investment and manufacturing expansion to meet pent-up demand. 
As the trend towards autonomous vehicles gains momentum, Keysight remains focused on enabling next-generation technologies across the automotive R&D workflow. We recently announced a new cellular vehicle to everything, or CV2X, autonomous drive emulation solution, which provides a real-world environment emulator for in-lab testing to simulate realistic roadway scenarios. We continue to see steady demand for our EV and AV solutions, including automotive Ethernet compliance and cybersecurity test. 
Our Communications Solutions Group achieved record third quarter orders and revenue and delivered double-digit order and revenue growth, despite trade restrictions that impacted one of our larger customers in China. Aerospace, defense and government delivered record Q3 orders and revenue. Revenue grew double digits across all major regions. While benefiting from a soft prior year comparison, Growth was again driven by space, satellite, electromagnetic spectrum operations, 5G and early 6G research applications. U.S. government and prime contractor investment was strong while internationally, Europe rebounded from a year ago, coupled with solid growth in Asia. 
Our Application Solutions strategy drove a significant win with a leading research institute in this quarter. Keysight's leading-edge integrated wireless and wireline test bed is enabling their next-generation terabit and 6G research. Our aerospace, defense and government customers will also benefit from our differentiated services offering to enable their mission-critical program needs. In Q3, we entered into multiple U.S. prime contractor engagements for calibration and uptime services. 
Commercial Communications achieved third quarter record orders and revenue. Adjusted for the impact of China trade restrictions, Commercial Communications orders and revenue both grew double digits. Ongoing strength was driven by global 5G deployments and the rollout of new 5G chipsets and devices, O-RAN adoption, 400 gig and 800 gig Ethernet for data centers and increased spending by service providers. Our collaboration with key 5G innovators remain strong as we continue to lead with new industry firsts. 
In partnership with Qualcomm, we were the first to achieve 10 gigabit per second 5G data connections. Keysight was also selected by Vodafone, along with other industry leaders such as Samsung, NEC and Dell to deliver end-to-end cloud solutions for the deployment of Europe's first commercial O-RAN network. 
Sanjole, acquired earlier this year, had a strong quarter driven by expanding adoption of our wave judge wireless test system, which further enhances Keysight's 5G solutions for deployments. Keysight continues to enable next-generation wireline standards, such as 800 gigabit Ethernet. Our newly announced 800 gigabit Ethernet solutions saw strong demand within the quarter. In recent partnership with Cisco and Amphenol, we demonstrated high data rate multivendor interoperability, a key enabler of next-generation networks.  The combination of our network application solutions from the Ixia acquisition and our leading physical layer bit array testers and oscilloscopes is driving new levels of customer insight and value. 
Our software and services solutions remain an important growth factor for Keysight. Higher value services are driving differentiation while strengthening our competitive position. At greater than 30% of total revenue with ARR exceeding $1 billion, our growing mix of software and services is increasing the durability of our business model while reducing overall cyclicality. They are both contributing to Keysight's margin expansion with operating margins at or above the company average. 
Keysight's focus on operational excellence continues to drive our consistent execution and our employees are critical to our success. Employee growth is a key component of the Keysight Leadership Model, and we view our high-performance culture as a competitive advantage. As such, we are honored to have our team in Malaysia recognized as the overall winner of the Employee Experience Awards by Human Resources Online. This award is in recognition of the innovative programs deployed in the Malaysia HR team to proactively engage employees and create positive experiences despite unprecedented pandemic-related challenges. 
Our employees in Malaysia have done an outstanding job under difficult circumstances since COVID restrictions were imposed and our production operations were impacted. To mitigate the risk of COVID-19 to employees, customers and suppliers, Keysight implemented a vaccine program for both Keysight employees and their suppliers. Over 95% of our employees at the Malaysian facility are now vaccinated. In addition, vaccination rates at our large U.S. sites are above their local community averages. 
In summary, our momentum continues and their strategy is generating strong results. We have a track record of consistent execution and delivering on our commitments. I am confident in our ability to capitalize on many growth opportunities ahead of us as we finish the fiscal year and look forward to 2022. 
Now I would like to turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail."

Third quarter revenue of $1.246 billion was above the high end of our guidance and grew 23% or 21% on a core basis. We achieved third quarter orders of $1.310 billion, up 23% or 20% on a core basis. Excluding the impact of China trade restrictions, orders grew 29%. 
Turning to our operational results. We reported Q3 gross margin of 65%, which increased 60 basis points year-over-year. Operating expenses of $472 million were well managed despite higher variable compensation. Operating margin was 27%, up over 100 basis points. 
We achieved net income of $286 million and delivered $1.54 in earnings per share, which was above the high end of our guidance. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 186 million shares. 
Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group, or CSG, achieved third quarter revenue of $875 million, up 15%. CSG delivered gross margin of 66%, which increased 50 basis points year-over-year. Operating margin was 26%. 
Commercial communications revenue of $595 million increased 6%, driven by continued investments across the 5G life cycle and our leadership in emerging applications. As Ron mentioned, adjusting for the transient impact of unfavorable trade restrictions, commercial communications revenue grew double digits. 
Aerospace, defense and government revenue of $280 million grew 39% and recorded double-digit growth across all major regions, led by U.S. and Europe. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group, or EISG, generated another record revenue quarter of $371 million, up 48% or 44% on a core basis. Order and revenue strength was notable across all markets and regions as semiconductor, general electronics and automotive solutions, orders and revenue all grew strong double digits. EISG reported gross margin of 64% and record operating margin of 31%. 
Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our third quarter with over $2 billion in cash and cash equivalents and reported cash flow from operations of $257 million and free cash flow of $217 million, or 17% of revenue. Our capital allocation priorities are unchanged and remain focused on investments in organic growth, value-creating acquisitions and share repurchase. 
Under our share repurchase authorization, during the quarter, we acquired approximately 570,000 shares on the open market at an average price of $140 for a total consideration of $80 million. 
Now turning to our outlook and guidance. We expect fourth quarter 2021 revenue to be in the range of $1.250 billion to $1.270 billion, which represents 3% revenue growth at the midpoint. Full year revenue at the midpoint of our guidance is $4.9 billion, representing 16% revenue growth. We expect Q4 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.59 to $1.65, based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 186 million shares. 
Full year earnings at the midpoint of our guidance is $6.03, representing 24% EPS growth. In closing, our expected 2021 revenue and earnings per share represent 7% and 13% compounded annual growth over the last 2 years since 2019. Both are not only above our long-term expectations, but accomplished in the face of significant COVID-related disruption last year and the substantial negative effect of China trade restrictions. 
Our consistent execution demonstrates the resilience of our business and our ability to drive sustainable and profitable growth. Beyond 2021, our long-term revenue and earnings growth targets, as well as our financial model, remain intact as we see continued opportunity for incremental margin expansion. 
With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A."

As a result of our classification of sales by customer, we actually have 5G orders and revenue, not only within aerospace, defense and commercial comps but also within EISG as well because of the way that, that is done. 
Under your question about kind of long-term operating model. First, we're very pleased with the results. If you look at our 3 quarters to date here in FY '21 plus our guide for Q4, we expect to finish this year with operating margin basically at the long-term target that we outlined at our March 2019 Analyst Day, where we said 26% to 27%. We're going to be at that 27% level here in FY 
'21. So we're pleased that we've achieved that objective 2 years ahead of where we expected to achieve it. So we've been making progress faster than expected. And then as we said in our prepared comments today, we don't believe that we're done. We believe that we have continued room for margin expansion. 
And while I don't have an updated guide for you here today or an updated long-term model, I will tell you that we do have multiple levers that we're working across the business. You noted a couple of them continuing to grow our software and services businesses at a rate that's faster than the overall company average, and therefore, growing our ARR at rates that are faster, a broad set of initiatives focused on gross margin improvement, where we've seen our gross margin improvement over the last several years go from the upper 50s into the mid-60% range, and then continuing to leverage our G&A infrastructure. 
And so we believe we continue to have a lot of levers. We -- and we remain confident in our ability to continue to drive margin improvement going forward."

If you take a look at our overall automotive business, it is really transforming in a very large way. As you know, the automobile is really turning into a computer with big batteries and a lot of wireless sensors that communicate to many, many different devices. 
And that really plays right into our strength. In the old world, the electromechanical car with a combustion engine was relatively low tech with regards to electronics. Sure there are transducers and things that are put on suspension systems to look at shocks and engine performance, more and more. But more and more microprocessors are in cars, and the whole car itself is really built around electronics that we test, whether it's computers or the wireless sensors for either radar or for 5G, et cetera. So we see this as a very big long-term trend for us. 
As far as production, it depends. Things that are more complex we're going to have a role in, things that get reduced to simple test, we won't be playing in that area as it's a very price-competitive market that doesn't really need as much value from us. But in R&D, where we focus -- that is the sweet spot for us. So R&D-focused, AV, EV technology is really, really a great opportunity for us going forward."

And then Mark Wallace, our Head of Sales, will talk about the excellent progress on our new customers. 
First, with regard to the supply chain, we've commented on this before. The more complex semiconductors that are in our products, we make right in-house. So we have a boutique fab that has to produce products that literally have, in many cases, 10x the performance of commercial products because we're the measurement device, and we have to be more accurate to be able to measure the performance on the commercial devices. 
That gives us more control of our supply chain -- Although we do obviously buy parts and some common components from other suppliers. But I think we have an exceptional management team and order fulfillment. We have the largest order fulfillment organization in the test and measurement industry. And I think they've done an excellent job working with our suppliers. 
There is no doubt that we continue to beat our expectations quarter after quarter after quarter. But obviously, if there were more components, we'd be even able to take our revenue up a little bit more quickly. Now I'll turn it over to Neil, who will add to more commentary."

But as Ron said, the kind of the vertical integration of our supply chain and the fact that we control the production of our most highly specialized parts, really helps to mute the impact. 
And so while the impact is not 0 within the quarter and it's not 0 within Q4, where we just guided, the impact is relatively small. And so I don't think it's a terribly huge concern. I think we're doing a good job managing the expectations of our customers in getting product into the hands of customers on a time line that they find to be acceptable. 
I can't point to any examples at this point. where we have had orders canceled because of an inability of us to manage our supply chain risk and get product into the hands of our customers. So yes, I'll leave it at that."

O-RAN is a great example that is accelerating, bringing new customers into the 5G ecosystem.

The other part, again, that Ron mentioned is capacity is enabling us to reach more customers into some of the more broad-based segments.

And year-to-date, you've already built up what I would kind of call an above average backlog. 
So how do you see this interplay of kind of delivery timing of supply chain? Do you think that you're able to compete around that excess backlog over the next 12 months? Is it something that extends? How should we think about that?"

I think, as you know, we've built up significant backlog. I think that backlog is going to -- it's going to come down over time. But we're also growing into it, right? The business is significantly larger now than it -- than it has been previously. So we would expect to be carrying higher amounts of backlog. 
But I don't expect that there's going to be a 1- or 2-quarter flush of material backlog. I think we're going to work it down over time and continue to meet the needs of our customers, working with them on scheduling deliveries as we manage the supply chain constraints and the addition of capacity, which we're still investing in to ultimately bring backlog levels in line with the size of our business."

At the highest level, we've long seen that the technology stacks are going to get virtualized to take advantage of the economics and the flexibility the cloud -- that comes with cloud. 
And so we -- if you remember, a couple of years ago, we made the acquisition of Prisma, which gave us some unique capabilities, which we were then able to combine with our Ixia acquisition that we made subsequently, and we've launched the Keysight Open RAN architect capability last quarter. And we've received pretty sizable orders already, and we have a very strong pipeline. 
And this quarter, we took the Keysight Open RAN architect and have now made it available on the Amazon Cloud as an offering for customers that are coming into this opportunity from a software perspective, so it's software testing software. 
We feel very good about our position in this marketplace. I just want to highlight that multiple Open RAN test and integration centers around the globe have already selected us in our KORA offering. And you've also heard, I think Ron referenced the success we've had with Vodafone selecting Keysight as a partner for design and test. So very pleased with it.

Clearly, a very strong quarter, again, building on 4 consecutive quarters of record orders of revenue in the business. We're very pleased with the performance there. 
With regard to where we play, we're playing in the wafer test, which is in the front end of the semi process. And given the dynamics that are going on around lithography and the advancements that are playing out, especially driven by 5G and data center applications for 7-nanometer, 5-nanometer and 3-nanometer, I think all of those new node size-based opportunities are still on the very early innings. Because one, those nodes have to get stable and then ramp up. So it's still very early stages there. 
So we view the capital spend for those new node sizes to be fairly stable over time. Obviously, there is a part of the business that is about scaling capacity into mature processes, and we think that will continue given this current semi shortages that are going on and demand being high through '22, and it remains to be seen what happens along the term. 
We also -- it's important to highlight that given the infrastructure spend that's likely to come into the United States and Europe and other regions looking to localize supply chain, it's one dynamic that's not factored into any of these outlook projections, but could have more upside for the semi business. 
But again, you look at the end market demand drivers, whether it's new memory, topologies or 5G or data center demand, all of those are feeding into this at this point."

So we've added significantly to revenue. Last quarter, we did talk about how -- within our own factories and subcontractors, which we did have some capacity constraints, those items were not a gating item for us this quarter. We've added enough capacity, but that was no longer the gating item. 
That doesn't mean that we are done investing as we continue to look forward to the future growth of our business. We're continuing to make investments in further capacity expansion. But right now, I feel like we're doing a good job of staying ahead of -- ahead of the curve. And certainly, particularly given that there are some supply chain constraints that potentially is relieving a little bit of the -- a little bit of the pressure there. 
On the seasonality question, I've answered this question many times over the years. And when I said back to model our business at the beginning of any year, we tend to think of coming off of Q4 is our biggest quarter of the year. So we modeled sequentially down in Q1, up in Q2, down a little bit in Q3 and then a big finish in Q4 was the highest quarter of the year. That's how I would sit down to model our business. 
As we talked about all through this year, we expected because of the rebound from COVID and then more recently with some of the supply chain constraints and the need to add capacity, we expected that seasonality to be more muted this year than it's historically been, and I think that's proven out here over the last several quarters. 
I think as we look forward, at least over the next couple of quarters, I expect that muted seasonality to remain intact. That doesn't mean there won't be any. I just think that the swings will be less than they typically are. And beyond that, it's hard to call."

So that's a dynamic that we certainly experienced. 
We had some pull in, as we talked about before, in semiconductor, but it was small and it really gives us this longer visibility through their forecasts and funnels going out many, many quarters as that is a slower moving process with fabs and so forth. 
And -- but again, most of our growth in the quarter still comes from the continuing investments in the areas that we're talking about for next-generation technologies, commercial of course comms and aerospace, defense and e-mobility. And we've done a great job of capturing those in all regions, including China, where obviously that's where the headwinds originate. And this last quarter, we overcame them again, sustaining top line growth in China, double-digit growth when you exclude the trade impact. And it's really a testament to our ability to pivot to the broad-based business that's available to us in China and the ability to capture that throughout the various cycles. 
So semiconductor, again, automotive, general electronics. So we've not only pivoted in China, but we've also captured this around the world."

In terms of the year-over-year growth rates, obviously, the Q4 of last year was the kind of the big bounce back quarter after our factories reopened up and reramped following the initial COVID shutdown. And so we have an unusually tough compare from a year ago. And frankly, not just on the revenue line, but we've talked about the extraordinarily favorable mix that we saw in Q4 of last year that grew gross margins and operating margins high. 
And so I think if you're thinking about it from that perspective, I'd just point really to that tough comp is something that's going to mute growth rates here in the fourth quarter.

Second, Keysight's first-to-market software-centric solution strategy continues to yield consistently strong results. Since our launch in 2015 through our expected 2021 finish, we will have delivered 9% compound annual revenue growth and 16% annualized earnings growth, both well above our long-term commitments despite significant headwinds of trade restrictions and a global pandemic. Our investments are well aligned with the highest impact market opportunities as we continue to enable our customer success and deliver value to our shareholders.  
Third, given our outstanding performance year-to-date, we expect to achieve 2021 year-over-year revenue growth of 16% and EPS of $6.03, which represents 24% earnings growth at the midpoint of our guidance. We have strong momentum entering 2022, and our long-term revenue and earnings growth targets remain intact and we expect to drive incremental margin expansion going forward.  
Now let's take a deeper look at our third quarter performance. Record Q3 orders of $1.3 billion grew 23%. All-time record revenue also grew 23% to $1.2 billion. We delivered gross margin of 65%, operating margin of 27% and earnings of $1.54, which was well above the high end of our guidance and represents 29% year-over-year earnings growth.  
Keysight continues to deliver outstanding growth despite year-over-year headwinds due to trade restrictions and ongoing supply chain disruption. Our growth rates are not only just a result of soft year-over-year comparisons, but also reflect sustained multiyear above-market growth. For example, Q3 orders are up 18% and revenue was up 15% versus the same quarter in 2019 prior to the global pandemic. The strength and durability of our business model are delivering as expected. We see accelerated demand from our differentiated solutions from both existing and new customers. Our customer engagement throughout the pandemic has been strong with approximately 1,900 new customers added in 2020, which we would expect to exceed in 2021.  
Looking at our business segments, for the third quarter in a row, we reported double-digit year-over-year order and revenue growth across both segments and all regions, demonstrating the breadth and differentiated portfolio across a diverse set of end markets. Our Electronic Industrial Solutions Group achieved strong double-digit order and revenue growth across all regions as well as its fourth consecutive quarter of record revenue. Continued investment in chipsets for 5G data center, cloud and AI applications drove demand for our differentiated semiconductor solutions, resulting in another quarter of record orders and revenue.  
Investment also remains high in advanced technology nodes and capacity expansion for mature processes to address surge in global semiconductor demands. Our general electronics business achieved record Q3 orders and revenue. Four consecutive quarters of double-digit order and revenue growth demonstrate Keysight's breadth of contributions across multiple industries. Strength in the quarter was driven by investments in customers' broad-based digital transformation, industrial IoT, digital health, Industry 4.0 and advanced academic research. 
In automotive, record Q3 orders and all-time record revenue were driven by the ongoing macroeconomic recovery, acceleration in EV and AV technology investment and manufacturing expansion to meet pent-up demand.  
As the trend towards autonomous vehicles gains momentum, Keysight remains focused on enabling next-generation technologies across the automotive R&D workflow. We recently announced a new cellular vehicle to everything, or CV2X, autonomous drive emulation solution, which provides a real-world environment emulator for in-lab testing to simulate realistic roadway scenarios. We continue to see steady demand for our EV and AV solutions, including automotive Ethernet compliance and cybersecurity test.  
Our Communications Solutions Group achieved record third quarter orders and revenue and delivered double-digit order and revenue growth, despite trade restrictions that impacted one of our larger customers in China. 
Aerospace, defense and government delivered record Q3 orders and revenue. Revenue grew double digits across all major regions. While benefiting from a soft prior year comparison, growth was again driven by space, satellite, electromagnetic spectrum operations, 5G and early 6G research applications. U.S. government and prime contractor investment was strong while internationally, Europe rebounded from a year ago, coupled with solid growth in Asia.  
Our Application Solutions strategy drove a significant win with a leading research institute in this quarter. Keysight's leading-edge integrated wireless and wireline test bed is enabling their next-generation terabit and 6G research. Our aerospace, defense and government customers will also benefit from our differentiated services offering to enable their mission-critical program needs. In Q3, we entered into multiple U.S. prime contractor engagements for calibration and uptime services.  
Commercial communications achieved third quarter record orders and revenue. Adjusted for the impact of China trade restrictions, Commercial communications orders and revenue both grew double digits. Ongoing strength was driven by global 5G deployments and the rollout of new 5G chipsets and devices, O-RAN adoption, 400 gig and 800 gig Ethernet for data centers and increased spending by service providers. Our collaboration with key 5G innovators remain strong as we continue to lead with new industry firsts.  
In partnership with Qualcomm, we were the first to achieve 10 gigabit per second 5G data connections. Keysight was also selected by Vodafone, along with other industry leaders such as Samsung, NEC and Dell to deliver end-to-end cloud solutions for the deployment of Europe's first commercial O-RAN network.  
Sanjole, acquired earlier this year, had a strong quarter driven by expanding adoption of our WaveJudge wireless test system, which further enhances Keysight's 5G solutions for deployments. Keysight continues to enable next-generation wireline standards, such as 800 gigabit Ethernet. Our newly announced 800 gigabit Ethernet solutions saw strong demand within the quarter. In recent partnership with Cisco and Amphenol, we demonstrated high data rate multi-vendor interoperability, a key enabler of next-generation networks. The combination of our network application solutions from the Ixia acquisition and our leading physical layer bit array testers and oscilloscopes is driving new levels of customer insight and value.  
Our software and services solutions remain an important growth vector for Keysight. Higher-value services are driving differentiation while strengthening our competitive position. At greater than 30% of total revenue with ARR exceeding $1 billion, our growing mix of software and services is increasing the durability of our business model while reducing overall cyclicality. They are both contributing to Keysight's margin expansion with operating margins at or above the company average.  
Keysight's focus on operational excellence continues to drive our consistent execution, and our employees are critical to our success. Employee growth is a key component of the Keysight leadership model, and we view our high-performance culture as a competitive advantage. As such, we are honored to have our team in Malaysia recognized as the overall winner of the Employee Experience Awards by Human Resources Online. This award is in recognition of the innovative programs deployed in the Malaysia HR team to proactively engage employees and create positive experiences despite unprecedented pandemic-related challenges.  
Our employees in Malaysia have done an outstanding job under difficult circumstances since COVID restrictions were imposed and our production operations were impacted. To mitigate the risk of COVID-19 to employees, customers and suppliers, Keysight implemented a vaccine program for both Keysight employees and their suppliers. Over 95% of our employees at the Malaysian facility are now vaccinated. In addition, vaccination rates at our large U.S. sites are above their local community averages.  
In summary, our momentum continues, and our strategy is generating strong results. We have a track record of consistent execution and delivering on our commitments. I am confident in our ability to capitalize on many growth opportunities ahead of us as we finish the fiscal year and look forward to 2022.  
Now I would like to turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail."

As Ron mentioned, Keysight delivered another outstanding quarter as broad-based technology investment accelerated demand for our differentiated solutions, resulting in better-than-expected results in the quarter.  Th",607,"Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. As Ron mentioned, Keysight delivered another outstanding quarter as broad-based technology investment accelerated demand for our differentiated solutions, resulting in better-than-expected results in the quarter.  
Third quarter revenue of $1.246 billion was above the high end of our guidance and grew 23% or 21% on a core basis. We achieved third quarter orders of $1.310 billion, up 23% or 20% on a core basis. Excluding the impact of China trade restrictions, orders grew 29%.  
Turning to our operational results. We reported Q3 gross margin of 65%, which increased 60 basis points year-over-year. Operating expenses of $472 million were well managed despite higher variable compensation. Operating margin was 27%, up over 100 basis points.  
We achieved net income of $286 million and delivered $1.54 in earnings per share, which was above the high end of our guidance. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 186 million shares.  
Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group, or CSG, achieved third quarter revenue of $875 million, up 15%. CSG delivered gross margin of 66%, which increased 50 basis points year-over-year. Operating margin was 26%.  
Commercial communications revenue of $595 million increased 6%, driven by continued investments across the 5G life cycle and our leadership in emerging applications. As Ron mentioned, adjusting for the transient impact of unfavorable trade restrictions, commercial communications revenue grew double digits.  
Aerospace, defense and government revenue of $280 million grew 39% and recorded double-digit growth across all major regions, led by U.S. and Europe. 
The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group, or EISG, generated another record revenue quarter of $371 million, up 48% or 44% on a core basis. Order and revenue strength was notable across all markets and regions as semiconductor, general electronics and automotive solutions orders and revenue all grew strong double digits. EISG reported gross margin of 64% and record operating margin of 31%.  
Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our third quarter with over $2 billion in cash and cash equivalents and reported cash flow from operations of $257 million and free cash flow of $217 million or 17% of revenue. Our capital allocation priorities are unchanged and remain focused on investments in organic growth, value-creating acquisitions and share repurchase.  
Under our share repurchase authorization, during the quarter, we acquired approximately 570,000 shares on the open market at an average price of $140 for a total consideration of $80 million.  
Now turning to our outlook and guidance. We expect fourth quarter 2021 revenue to be in the range of $1.250 billion to $1.270 billion, which represents 3% revenue growth at the midpoint. Full year revenue at the midpoint of our guidance is $4.9 billion, representing 16% revenue growth. We expect Q4 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.59 to $1.65 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 186 million shares. Full year earnings at the midpoint of our guidance is $6.03, representing 24% EPS growth. 
In closing, our expected 2021 revenue and earnings per share represent 7% and 13% compounded annual growth over the last 2 years since 2019. Both are not only above our long-term expectations, but accomplished in the face of significant COVID-related disruption last year and the substantial negative effect of China trade restrictions.  
Our consistent execution demonstrates the resilience of our business and our ability to drive sustainable and profitable growth. Beyond 2021, our long-term revenue and earnings growth targets as well as our financial model remain intact as we see continued opportunity for incremental margin expansion.  
With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A."

Now it will take quite a bit of time to play out in the end markets driven by spectrum and different interests across the globe. But it is broad, such as millimeter wave is clearly being used in space and satellite communication. It's being used in aerospace -- in automotive, for sure. And now with commercialization of this technology, it finds its application in 5G. 
And we actually classify orders based on customers who buy them, and we're able to maintain a lot of operating leverage across our businesses that way."

As a result of our classification of sales by customer, we actually have 5G orders and revenue not only within aerospace, defense and commercial comms, but also within EISG as well because of the way that, that is done. 
Under your question about kind of long-term operating model. First, we're very pleased with the results. If you look at our 3 quarters to date here in FY '21 plus our guide for Q4, we expect to finish this year with operating margin basically at the long-term target that we outlined at our March 2019 Analyst Day, where we said 26% to 27%. We're going to be at that 27% level here in FY '21. So we're pleased that we've achieved that objective 2 years ahead of where we expected to achieve it. So we've been making progress faster than expected. 
And then as we said in our prepared comments today, we don't believe that we're done. We believe that we have continued room for margin expansion. And while I don't have an updated guide for you here today or an updated long-term model, I will tell you that we do have multiple levers that we're working across the business. You noted a couple of them, continuing to grow our software and services businesses at a rate that's faster than the overall company average, and therefore, growing our ARR at rates that are faster. A broad set of initiatives focused on gross margin improvement, where we've seen our gross margin improvement over the last several years go from the upper 50s into the mid-60% range, and then continuing to leverage our G&A infrastructure. 
And so we believe we continue to have a lot of levers. We -- and we remain confident in our ability to continue to drive margin improvement going forward."

I mean I look at every car that's being sold out there or the newer ones coming out. They just have a lot more electronics and things that need to be calibrated and tested. Or is there something unique about that industry that would prevent you from going into it? Or maybe it's already big for you now, how much is it? Is the profitability the same? It seems like the design times would actually be more favorable because you design a car for multiple years compared to like a consumer electronics.

If you take a look at our overall automotive business, it is really transforming in a very large way. As you know, the automobile is really turning into a computer with big batteries and a lot of wireless sensors that communicate to many, many different devices. 
And that really plays right into our strength. In the old world, the electromechanical car with a combustion engine was relatively low tech with regards to electronics. Sure, there are transducers and things that are put on suspension systems to look at shocks and engine performance, more and more. But more and more microprocessors are in cars, and the whole car itself is really built around electronics that we test, whether it's computers or the wireless sensors for either radar or for 5G, et cetera. So we see this as a very big long-term trend for us. 
As far as production, it depends. Things that are more complex, we're going to have a role in. Things that get reduced to simple test, we won't be playing in that area as it's a very price-competitive market that doesn't really need as much value from us. But in R&D, where we focus -- that is the sweet spot for us. So R&D-focused, AV, EV technology is really, really a great opportunity for us going forward."

And then Mark Wallace, our Head of Sales, will talk about the excellent progress on our new customers. 
First, with regard to the supply chain, we've commented on this before. The more complex semiconductors that are in our products, we make right in-house. So we have a boutique fab that has to produce products that literally have, in many cases, 10x the performance of commercial products because we're the measurement device and we have to be more accurate to be able to measure the performance on the commercial devices. 
That gives us more control of our supply chain, although we do obviously buy parts and some common components from other suppliers. But I think we have an exceptional management team and order fulfillment. We have the largest order fulfillment organization in the test and measurement industry. And I think they've done an excellent job working with our suppliers. 
There is no doubt that we continue to beat our expectations quarter after quarter after quarter. But obviously, if there were more components, we'd be even able to take our revenue up a little bit more quickly. Now I'll turn it over to Neil, who will add to more commentary."

And so while the impact is not 0 within the quarter and it's not 0 within Q4, where we just guided, the impact is relatively small. And so I don't think it's a terribly huge concern. I think we're doing a good job managing the expectations of our customers in getting product into the hands of customers on a time line that they find to be acceptable. I can't point to any examples at this point where we have had orders canceled because of an inability of us to manage our supply chain risk and get product into the hands of our customers.

We have a focus on reaching new customers through a combination of marketing, our direct channel, which at the end of this year will be more than twice as big as it was just a few years ago; and through our indirect channel, which is a combination of distributors and our e-commerce platform, where the majority of customers who access Keysight electronically online are new customers.

And then I think in some markets, most notably the semi market, we have seen customers look to place orders earlier in the system or for delivery later out just as they're looking to secure supply and communicate their own needs. But we take comfort from the fact that we see the amount of fab construction that is underway and believe that those orders, particularly given the relationship that Keysight has with that relatively limited customer set are very strong."

You did hit on one of the key elements, which is the expansion of various ecosystems. O-RAN is a great example that is accelerating, bringing new customers into the 5G ecosystem. And then the success we're achieving in really all the ecosystems is expanding our footprint through that leverage. 
The other part, again, that Ron mentioned is the combination of marketing and increased selling capacity is enabling us to reach more customers into some of the more broad-based segments. As an example, in the last several quarters, we saw more education customers turn on, we saw more research. And as we spoke about earlier in the call, it's still early days on the ramp of automotive. And with that transformation from prior ICE vehicles to electric and autonomous vehicles, we're seeing a large number of new companies and customers that we are serving in all 4 regions. 
So it's -- like I said before, this is a part of our strategy. We've been running this for 5 years, and it's helping us to build this base of customers and accounts going forward."

And it's one where there's a lot of parallel sets of innovation going on, and we're able to do that today. And it's still very early days in the EV segment but we're getting embedded with a lot of the lead innovators and the larger ecosystem that's forming. 
With regard to AV, clearly, 5G is going to be a big factor that's going to impact the autonomous cars just from the connectivity aspect and the entire technology stack that goes with it. And that's where extending our strength and differentiation in 5G into this marketplace continues to give us a unique position of differentiation. Some of the successes we're having is on account of it. And as you saw, we just entered into a partnership with [ Decker ] as well to continue to promote this new standard approach to test in this marketplace.

Clearly, a very strong quarter, again, building on 4 consecutive quarters of record orders of revenue in the business. We're very pleased with the performance there. 
With regard to where we play, we're playing in the wafer test, which is in the front end of the semi process. And given the dynamics that are going on around lithography and the advancements that are playing out, especially driven by 5G and data center applications for 7-nanometer, 5-nanometer and 3-nanometer, I think all of those new node size-based opportunities are still on the very early innings. Because one, those nodes have to get stable and then ramp up. So it's still very early stages there. 
So we view the capital spend for those new node sizes to be fairly stable over time. Obviously, there is a part of the business that is about scaling capacity into mature processes, and we think that will continue given this current semi shortages that are going on and demand being high through '22, and it remains to be seen what happens along the term. 
We also -- it's important to highlight that given the infrastructure spend that's likely to come into the United States and Europe and other regions looking to localize supply chain, it's one dynamic that's not factored into any of these outlook projections but could have more upside for the semi business.

So we've added significantly to revenue. Last quarter, we did talk about how within our own factories and subcontractors, which we did have some capacity constraints, those items were not a gating item for us this quarter. We've added enough capacity that it was no longer the gating item. 
That doesn't mean that we are done investing as we continue to look forward to the future growth of our business. We're continuing to make investments in further capacity expansion. But right now, I feel like we're doing a good job of staying ahead of the curve. And certainly, particularly given that there are some supply chain constraints that potentially is relieving a little bit of the -- a little bit of the pressure there. 
On the seasonality question, I've answered this question many times over the years. And when I sit back to model our business at the beginning of any year, we tend to think of coming off of Q4 is our biggest quarter of the year. So we model sequentially down in Q1, up in Q2, down a little bit in Q3 and then a big finish in Q4, the highest quarter of the year. That's how I would sit down to model our business. 
As we talked about all through this year, we expected because of the rebound from COVID and then more recently with some of the supply chain constraints and the need to add capacity, we expected that seasonality to be more muted this year than it's historically been. And I think that's proven out here over the last several quarters. 
I think as we look forward, at least over the next couple of quarters, I expect that muted seasonality to remain intact. That doesn't mean there won't be any. I just think that the swings will be less than they typically are. And beyond that, it's hard to call."

We had some pull-in, as we talked about before, in semiconductor, but it's small and it really gives us this longer visibility through the forecasts and funnels going out many, many quarters as that is a slower moving process with fabs and so forth. 
And -- but again, most of our growth in the quarter still comes from the continuing investments in the areas that we're talking about for next-generation technologies, across commercial comms and aerospace, defense and e-mobility. And we've done a great job of capturing those in all regions, including China where obviously that's where the headwinds originate. And this last quarter, we overcame them again, sustaining top line growth in China, double-digit growth when you exclude the trade impact.

I mean if the Huawei headwinds roll off in the fourth quarter, I'm a little surprised that the implied revenue growth in the fourth quarter wouldn't be better than kind of low single digits, if that's the case, which would imply a deceleration on 2- and 3-year stack comps. It doesn't sound like the end markets have changed all that much. You talked about supply chain constraints here and there, but you seem to be managing it fairly well. So am I missing something here? Or are you embedding perhaps a little more conservatism around one particular end market?"

So we're making some stepped-up progression. 
In terms of the year-over-year growth rates, obviously, the Q4 of last year was the kind of the big bounce back quarter after our factories reopened up and reramped following the initial COVID shutdown. And so we have an unusually tough compare from a year ago. And frankly, not just on the revenue line, but we've talked about the extraordinarily favorable mix that we saw in Q4 of last year that drove gross margins and operating margins high. 
And so I think if you're thinking about it from that perspective, I'd just point really to that tough comp as something that's going to mute growth rates here in the fourth quarter. But I think we continue to make progress, adding capacity, continue to making progress in terms of ramping our revenue, and we're really well positioned as we look forward to FY '22."

Keysight delivered a record quarter and fiscal year. Strong demand for our portfolio of differentiated solutions is fueling continued momentum across all of our end markets. Today, I'll focus my commen",1188,"Thank you, Jason, and thank you all for joining us. Keysight delivered a record quarter and fiscal year. Strong demand for our portfolio of differentiated solutions is fueling continued momentum across all of our end markets. 
Today, I'll focus my comments on 4 key headlines. First, demand for Keysight differentiated solutions continues to be very strong with orders exceeding our expectations. Outstanding order growth of 21% in the fourth quarter topped off an excellent fiscal year where we grew 18%. Demand continues to be balanced across our business with double-digit gains across all end markets and regions, both in the fourth quarter and for the full fiscal year. 
Second, we delivered outstanding Q4 results despite a tightening supply environment. Exceptional execution by Keysight employees around the world resulted in record revenue, gross margin, operating margin and earnings per share for the fourth quarter and for the fiscal year 2021.
Third, we entered 2022 with strong momentum, robust end market demand and record backlog. Assuming a loosening of the supply situation in the second half of the calendar year, we expect fiscal year 2022 revenue growth of 6% to 7%, while delivering 10% earnings growth. Beyond 2022, we are increasingly confident in our ability to deliver sustained above-market results. We have established a strong track record of execution, and our competitive position earned over the past 7 years of investment in transformation has only grown stronger. 
Lastly, given the strength of our cash position and generation, we continue to see tremendous opportunities for value creation through disciplined investment in organic capabilities, targeted acquisitions and accordingly, today, we announced a new share repurchase authorization of $1.2 billion. 
Now let's take a deeper look at the strength of our fourth quarter and the fiscal year 2021 financial performance. In the fourth quarter, we saw continued momentum in the demand environment. Orders exceeded our expectations and grew 21% year-over-year. Revenue grew 6% with growth across all regions. Operational excellence resulted in record profitability as we delivered gross margin of 66%, operating margin of 31% and earnings of $1.82 per share. 
Fourth quarter results drove a very strong finish to an excellent year. In 2021, we overcame 5 percentage points of China trade headwinds and delivered 18% order growth to outpace the overall market, which continues to be strong. Despite a tightening supply environment, we ended it with 17% revenue growth and achieved record profitability with gross margin of 65%, operating margin of 28% and earnings of $6.23 per share. 
Compared to pre-pandemic fiscal year 2019, orders and revenue have grown 21% and 15% respectively over this 2-year period, highlighting the continued strong demand for our market-leading solutions. Broad-based growth across multiple dimensions of the business demonstrates the breadth of our customer base. We added more than 2,000 customers in 2021 and more than 1,900 in 2020 as we continue to expand our footprint, adding to the stability and durability of our business model. 
Despite the headwinds we faced in 2021, we delivered annual double-digit order and revenue growth in both business segments. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group achieved its fifth consecutive quarter of record revenue, driven by double-digit growth in semiconductor solutions and in automotive. Another quarter of record semiconductor revenue was fueled by ongoing investments in advanced technology nodes and capacity expansion to address pent-up demand. 
In automotive, we achieved record orders for the third consecutive quarter of double-digit order and revenue growth. Investment remains strong in EV and AV technologies. This quarter, we announced the collaboration with Neo, one of China's top EV automakers who selected Keysight 5G and C-V2X network emulation solutions. 
Strong demand for general electronics solutions was driven by continued investments in digital transformation, industrial IoT, digital health, Industrial 4.0 and advanced academic research. 
The Communications Solutions Group delivered double-digit order growth and record revenue in the fourth quarter. For the year, orders and revenue grew double digits despite the impact of China trade restrictions. Commercial Communications achieved all-time record orders and revenue in the fourth quarter. Q4 was another record quarter for 5G driven by the strength of our platform, continued O-RAN adoption and new industry applications. 
In addition, we saw ongoing investments in 400G and 800G R&D across the entire communications ecosystem. Increased spending in data centers and network security drove double-digit order growth in network test and visibility. In aerospace, defense and government, double-digit order growth was driven by ongoing investments in technology with a focus on space and new commercial technologies like 5G. We recently announced a collaboration with Lockheed Martin to advance 5G in support of mission-critical communications for aerospace and defense applications. 
Keysight's first-to-market solutions are enabling the rapid progression of new technologies and winning engagement with industrial leaders like NXP, NEC and MediaTek. In Q4, we joined Google's cloud partner initiative to support agile orchestration of innovative 5G services at the network edge. 
Our end-to-end solutions portfolio continues to capture new opportunities as the 5G life cycle progresses and expands into aerospace, defense and government, automotive and industrial applications. We continue to accelerate Keysight's capabilities to provide industry-leading solutions through strategic acquisitions and recently added scalable network technologies to our software-centric solutions portfolio. 
Scalable is a provider of best-in-class network simulation solutions to model and visualize communication networks and cyber effects for aerospace, defense and government customers. We're excited to welcome the scalable team to Keysight. 
Our software-centric solutions and higher value services continue to drive differentiation, strengthen our competitive position and capture a higher percentage of our customers' wallet share. In fiscal year 2021, software and services not only delivered double-digit order and revenue growth, but also outpaced Keysight's overall growth. Combined, they represented just over 1/3 of Keysight's total revenue for the year. 
We also continue to grow annualized recurring revenue, which now exceeds $1 billion. The growth in software and services as well as the recurring revenue further strengthens the durability and resiliency of our business model, while at the same time contributing to Keysight's margin expansion. 
Keysight's focus on first-to-market software-centric solutions and operational excellence drive our consistent execution. We have a strong track record of performance and proven business resiliency. Since our inception as a public company 7 years ago, we have achieved a 10% compound annual revenue growth rate, expanded gross margin by over 800 basis points, increased operating margin by nearly 1,000 basis points and generated 16% annualized EPS growth all while significantly increasing investment in R&D and sales to drive future growth. 
Over the same period, we have nearly tripled the size of our software revenue and more than doubled recurring revenue while growing services 75%. These accomplishments are a testament to Keysight's leadership model, our values and our people. I would like to thank all Keysight employees for their exceptional execution and dedication. We continue to capitalize on these multiple ways of technology innovation and long-term secular growth trends across multiple markets. We exit this year in a strong competitive position and expect to continue to deliver sustained above-market profitable growth. 
Now I will turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail. Happy Thanksgiving."

As Ron mentioned, we delivered an outstanding quarter and fiscal year. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we delivered record revenue of $1,294,000,000, which was above the high end of our guidance range and grew 6% or 5%",792,"Thank you, Ron, and hello, everyone. As Ron mentioned, we delivered an outstanding quarter and fiscal year. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we delivered record revenue of $1,294,000,000, which was above the high end of our guidance range and grew 6% or 5% on a core basis despite a tightening supply environment. 
The further contraction of the supply chain within the quarter tempered total revenue results and was more impactful on the Communications Solutions Group businesses. With demand outpacing supply, we delivered a record $1,491,000,000 in orders, up 21% on a reported and core basis and enter fiscal year 2022 with over $2 billion in backlog, which will position us well as the supply chain situation improves. 
Looking at our operational results for Q4, we reported record gross margin of 66% and operating expenses of $456 million, resulting in an operating margin of 31%, an all-time high. Net income was a record $338 million, and we achieved $1.82 in earnings per share, which was well above the high end of our guidance. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 186 million shares. 
Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group generated record revenue of $919 million, up 2%. CSG delivered gross margin of 66% and operating margin of 28%. In Q4, commercial communications generated revenue of $622 million, up 3% driven by strength across the 5G ecosystem, O-RAN adoption and investment in 400-gigabit and 800-gigabit R&D. 
Aerospace, defense and government achieved record revenue of $297 million, up slightly from the same quarter last year as solid growth in Asia Pacific was offset by supply chain constraints that impacted revenue in the U.S. and Europe. The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated fourth quarter revenue of $375 million, up 18% on a reported and core basis, driven by strength in semiconductor and automotive. EISG reported record gross margin of 66% and record operating margin of 36%. 
Given tightening supply chain constraints and trade headwinds, we are very pleased with our full year results. In FY '21, revenue totaled $4.9 billion, up 17% year-over-year or 15% on a core basis. Gross margin improved 40 basis points year-over-year to 65%. We continue to invest in R&D at 16% of revenue or $788 million for the year, while operating margin improved 260 basis points to 28%. On the strength of this performance, we have achieved our long-term operating margin target of 26% to 27%, 2 years ahead of plan. FY '21 non-GAAP net income was $1.2 billion or $6.23 per share, up 28%. 
Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our fourth quarter with $2.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents, generated cash flow from operations of $368 million and free cash flow of $295 million. Total free cash flow for the year was $1.1 billion, representing 23% of revenue and 99% non-GAAP net income. 
As announced earlier today, the Keysight Board of Directors has approved a new share repurchase authorization of $1.2 billion, effective immediately. Under our prior share repurchase authorization, we acquired approximately 2.1 million shares in the quarter at an average share price of $171 for a total consideration of $353 million. This brings our total share repurchase for the year to approximately 4.4 million shares at an average share price of $154 for a total consideration of $673 million or 59% of free cash flow. 
Now turning to our outlook and guidance. Despite a strong demand backdrop, supply chain constraints continue to moderate shipment expectations. As a result, we expect first quarter 2022 revenue to be in the range of $1.225 billion to $1.245 billion and Q1 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.50 to $1.56 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 185 million shares. 
Looking forward to 2022, we expect supply chain to remain tight in the first half of the year. Assuming a loosening of the supply situation in the second half, we expect full year revenue growth to be in the range of 6% to 7%, while delivering 10% earnings growth. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $78 million and capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $240 million to $260 million with increasing capacity and technology investments. 
Regarding our tax rate, we are modeling a 12% non-GAAP effective tax rate for FY '22, which assumes no change to current U.S. tax policy. In closing, we are entering the fiscal year with strong momentum, a record backlog position and a strong track record of operational excellence. We're encouraged by the strong dynamics across our end markets and are competitively positioned to drive sustainable and profitable growth going forward. 
With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A."

My first question is just around the full year guide.

And if so, does that imply that we should expect to see a similar cadence to revenue as we did in fiscal '21? Or is there something I'm not appreciating here as I think about revenue trends for the full year, such as maybe the benefits of the loosening of the supply chain as we head into the back half of the year?"

It's a great question. So first of all, I said the opposite. The impact was greater on CSG businesses than in EISG businesses.

The impact was greater on CSG businesses than in EISG businesses. If you think about why that is, the CSG products tend to be more complex. They have a longer bill of materials. And so there are more parts and components that go into building those instruments on average. And so that, just by its nature, increases the risk and the challenges that we have to fulfill that supply chain. 
I think it's also true on average that the CSG products tend to be at the higher end of the technology spectrum. And so there are fewer suppliers for those cutting-edge technology products than for a little bit more of the mainstream products that exist within EISG. 
I think if you think about the impact the supply chain, I'd maybe lump COVID and supply chain together because we've really seen this phenomenon over the last couple of years. And if you're starting to think about how to quantify those impacts, I'd really kind of focus your attention, not on any 1 quarter, but over time you're looking at the full fiscal years, as an example, at our order rates, right? 
If you look at our history prior to 2020, we have done a pretty good job of converting our orders to revenue. There's typically a little bit of a lag at certain percentage of each quarter's order ship within the quarter, another portion shift out into the following quarters. 
But over the past couple of years in 2020 because of COVID and into 2021 because of supply chain, we have seen that delta between orders and revenue grow. And so I think we estimate that if you think about it in terms of kind of an abnormal backlog build, that abnormal backlog build over the last couple of years is in the $300 million to $400 million range. And so I think that's the opportunity for us as we look forward to eventually clear that backlog once the supply chain situation fixes itself. 
I don't expect that we'll flex that in a quarter or 2. I think it will happen over time because the kind of the remedies of the supply chain are going to happen over time as well. But that's the rough magnitude of what we've -- what the impact has been here over a couple of year period of time."

And I guess what I was hoping to do is get a little bit more color about the software strategy you're deploying this time around, which seems like an incremental driver. I'm just kind of curious, can you size the potential TAM opportunity that gives you, especially as the network more from just being a backbone for handsets and mobile to actually being a backbone for a lot of new incremental applications. And to the extent that software and services is 1/3 of the business now, sort of how do we think about that over like the next 3 to 5 years?"

It's very, very clear that software and services continues to be a bigger and bigger percentage of our total business as we move from a hardware product supplier to a software-centric solution provider and the solutions obviously include hardware, software and services. And we've seen great growth, obviously, in our software and our services, and they've outpaced the hardware growth. 
Looking overall at 5G versus 4G, we made a decision in 2013, we announced Agilent. We're going to spin off Keysight in 2013, which we eventually did in November of 2014. But in 2013, I started working with the team that was developing to invest in 5G and make sure that we were going to be leaders. 
In 4G, we were providing a little bit more of, let's say, cash contribution to Agilent where we were not investing as heavily in the communications rollout of 4G by a substantial amount. So we invested earlier. We invested a greater amount as now we're roughly at 16% R&D where we used to be at approximately 12% of R&D. And we've gone from roughly $400 million to roughly $800 million in R&D spend over this period of time, but software is a key part. 
What we did was we consolidated our hardware development facilities into 1 organization as opposed to in separate divisions. And accordingly, that enabled us to basically provide software that could span the whole product offering. And we made an acquisition for instance of a company called Anite, which gave us software capability. They had some capability in 4G. We moved them over to 5G. 
And all this together, investing more, starting earlier, having a consistent R&D and investment profile has really gave us the lead and caused us to be a much, much stronger provider, and I believe the leading provider for 5G. 5G is still growing, and we anticipate it growing for years. I'm going to turn it over to Satish, who could tell you a little bit more about our results and our growth in, not only 2021, but what he sees going forward."

I think at the summary, we've had another record quarter for 5G and the drivers are scaling deployments, but equally important is the new application space. And I think we outplayed that as a strategy. We had to continue the progression from physical to protocol to application, and this application area is very rich, right? 
As I look forward, some of these application spaces have software as a percentage of the total value proposition in the 30%, 40%, 50% range and one we pursue very actively. I'll just make a few examples of these, right? So you can think of on the 5G side, O-RAN being a great example of that. On the wireline side, the protocols with 400-gig, 800-gig getting more complex. You look at new emerging spaces like SD-WAN, SASI and MACsec and the security domain. So you look at the commercial comms portfolio, it's very rich in applications that really favor our strategy of being more software-centric and one we're investing to pursue, and we're generating strong results."

The first thing that's probably really important to note is that our differentiating technologies that have given us the leadership position outside of the software that we have developed is semiconductors that have very particular high-performance capabilities. And as you know, we have an on-site fab that exists in Santa Rosa, and that fab mix scalers and indium phosphide semiconductors. 
So a lot of people are having trouble now getting more custom components built, and we build a lot of those custom components in-house. So that has definitely helped us. Now again, if you don't have all the parts, you can't ship anything. And we are in relatively good shape compared to other competitors, but there's no doubt that we have to make sure that we get all the components that are needed in order to ship the product. 
We always will look for opportunities to integrate provided that it makes financial sense. We feel very good about what we have in-house right now. It's not so much the plastic pieces and things like that. There are obviously not only components, but there is the whole logistical shipping issues that the whole world is going through. So we are impacted a little bit less than others. And I think the overall organization has done a real good job of being able to deliver during these very challenging times."

So again, a pretty strong quarter for aerospace defense orders growing double digits, finishing off a year with double-digit growth. If you look at what drove that growth, it's recovery in the macro environment globally, similar spend, especially towards technology that continues to increase, both in the U.S. and internationally and one we're capturing. 
We also took some concerted steps last year or 2 years ago, in fact, to take our 5G technology stack and customize it for aerospace, defense applications. And as you've probably seen, our collaboration with Lockheed Martin that we announced. So we're very pleased with the progression that we're making with commercial technologies that are getting adopted. So all of these are pretty favorable. 
We are observing that right now, the -- we are under continuing resolution from a budget perspective in the U.S. But if you look at the budget that has been put in place and if -- or that has been proposed and if it's approved, it does call for a year-over-year increase and also increased spend in technology or our T&E line item, which we view as a favorable dynamic.

And Tim, to your second question, yes, we've obviously had a great run here in terms of margin expansion since the birth of Keysight, adding 800 basis points approximately to gross margins about 1,000 basis points to operating margins. And I think the key point is that as we look forward over the longer term, we continue to see opportunities for further expansion of margins within the Keysight portfolio. 
I think as we look to next year, it's a really dynamic time, obviously, with supply chain pressures putting a little bit of a governor on revenue. At the same time, we've got inflationary pressures across the broader economy. And then the other thing that we're looking forward -- looking to, that's a little bit of a cost up within next year is hopefully a return to kind of a post-COVID or a pre-COVID normal in terms of our general operating environment, and that includes the costs associated with the facilities management as we return to the office, increase travel as people get back out and start seeing customers and conducting more business in person rather than over Zoom. 
I think -- and maybe the last point being that we saw -- we invested in R&D this year just under 16% of revenue. I think we continue to see great opportunities to invest in technology and bring new solutions into the marketplace. I think you're likely to see R&D tick upward next year into that kind of mid-16% range. 
So from those perspectives, I think FY '22 may be a bit of a catch-up year.

So we started to -- or we talked about in this recently completed fiscal year that we expected a couple of years of elevated CapEx as a result efforts to improve the resiliency of our supply chain.

I think in addition to continuing those investments, we see incremental investments that are necessary as we continue to expand our own capacity and invest in key technologies to drive the future growth of our business. So I think those are additive, given everything that's happening across the economic sphere today, there is, relative to what we were seeing this time last year, an increased need to spend money on capacity investments here within Keysight. And so I do not believe that the approximately $250 million of CapEx that we've communicated for next year is the new steady state, that is not the case. That steady state is significantly lower, exactly where -- a little bit difficult to call at this point, but materially lower than the $250 million that we're indicating for FY '22."

The only other thing I would say is in Q4, we did have extraordinary -- we did a very favorable product mix within the quarter, at least, as we see Q1 taking shape, we expect mix on a sequential basis to be a little bit less favorable. So -- and then there are some normal items for Keysight that also typically impact Q1, most notably that we do company-wide salary administration in the first quarter.

So we continue to look for adjacent opportunities also. That is what we're looking at. We have a very robust funnel, but we also have very high hurdles.

Keysight delivered a record quarter and fiscal year. Strong demand for our portfolio of differentiated solutions is fueling continued momentum across all of our end markets. Today, I'll focus my commen",1188,"Thank you, Jason, and thank you all for joining us. Keysight delivered a record quarter and fiscal year. Strong demand for our portfolio of differentiated solutions is fueling continued momentum across all of our end markets. 
Today, I'll focus my comments on 4 key headlines. 
First, demand for Keysight differentiated solutions continues to be very strong with orders exceeding our expectations. Outstanding order growth of 21% in the fourth quarter topped off an excellent fiscal year where we grew 18%. Demand continues to be balanced across our business with double-digit gains across all end markets and regions, both in the fourth quarter and for the full fiscal year. 
Second, we delivered outstanding Q4 results despite a tightening supply environment. Exceptional execution by Keysight employees around the world resulted in record revenue, gross margin, operating margin and earnings per share for the fourth quarter and for the fiscal year 2021.
Third, we enter 2022 with strong momentum, robust end market demand and record backlog. Assuming a loosening of the supply situation in the second half of the calendar year, we expect fiscal year 2022 revenue growth of 6% to 7%, while delivering 10% earnings growth. Beyond 2022, we are increasingly confident in our ability to deliver sustained above-market results. We have established a strong track record of execution, and our competitive position earned over the past 7 years of investment and transformation has only grown stronger. 
Lastly, given the strength of our cash position and generation, we continue to see tremendous opportunities for value creation through disciplined investment in organic capabilities, targeted acquisitions and accordingly, today, we announced a new share repurchase authorization of $1.2 billion. 
Now let's take a deeper look at the strength of our fourth quarter and the fiscal year 2021 financial performance. In the fourth quarter, we saw continued momentum in the demand environment. Orders exceeded our expectations and grew 21% year-over-year. Revenue grew 6% with growth across all regions. Operational excellence resulted in record profitability as we delivered gross margin of 66%, operating margin of 31% and earnings of $1.82 per share. 
Fourth quarter results drove a very strong finish to an excellent year. In 2021, we overcame 5 percentage points of China trade headwinds and delivered 18% order growth to outpace the overall market, which continues to be strong. Despite a tightening supply environment, we ended it with 17% revenue growth and achieved record profitability with gross margin of 65%, operating margin of 28% and earnings of $6.23 per share. 
Compared to pre-pandemic fiscal year 2019, orders and revenue have grown 21% and 15%, respectively, over this 2-year period, highlighting the continued strong demand for our market-leading solutions. Broad-based growth across multiple dimensions of the business demonstrates the breadth of our customer base. We added more than 2,000 customers in 2021 and more than 1,900 in 2020 as we continue to expand our footprint, adding to the stability and durability of our business model. 
Despite the headwinds we faced in 2021, we delivered annual double-digit order and revenue growth in both business segments. 
The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group achieved its fifth consecutive quarter of record revenue, driven by double-digit growth in semiconductor solutions and in automotive. Another quarter of record semiconductor revenue was fueled by ongoing investments in advanced technology nodes and capacity expansion to address pent-up demand. 
In automotive, we achieved record orders and the third consecutive quarter of double-digit order and revenue growth. Investment remains strong in EV and AV technologies. This quarter, we announced the collaboration with NIO, one of China's top EV automakers who selected Keysight's 5G and C-V2X network emulation solutions. 
Strong demand for general electronics solutions was driven by continued investments in digital transformation, industrial IoT, digital health, Industry 4.0 and advanced academic research. 
The Communications Solutions Group delivered double-digit order growth and record revenue in the fourth quarter. For the year, orders and revenue grew double digits despite the impact of China trade restrictions. 
Commercial Communications achieved all-time record orders and revenue in the fourth quarter. Q4 was another record quarter for 5G driven by the strength of our platform, continued O-RAN adoption and new industry applications. In addition, we saw ongoing investments in 400G and 800G R&D across the entire communications ecosystem. Increased spending in data centers and network security drove double-digit order growth in network test and visibility. 
In aerospace, defense and government, double-digit order growth was driven by ongoing investments in technology with a focus on space and new commercial technologies like 5G. We recently announced a collaboration with Lockheed Martin to advance 5G in support of mission-critical communications for aerospace and defense applications. 
Keysight's first-to-market solutions are enabling the rapid progression of new technologies and winning engagement with industry leaders like NXP, NEC and MediaTek. In Q4, we joined Google's cloud partner initiative to support agile orchestration of innovative 5G services at the network edge. Our end-to-end solutions portfolio continues to capture new opportunities as the 5G life cycle progresses and expands into aerospace, defense and government, automotive and industrial applications. 
We continue to accelerate Keysight's capability to provide industry-leading solutions through strategic acquisitions and recently added scalable network technologies to our software-centric solutions portfolio. Scalable is a provider of best-in-class network simulation solutions to model and visualize communication networks and cyber threats for aerospace, defense and government customers. We're excited to welcome the scalable team to Keysight. 
Our software-centric solutions and higher value services continue to drive differentiation, strengthen our competitive position and capture a higher percentage of our customers' wallet share. In fiscal year 2021, software and services not only delivered double-digit order and revenue growth, but also outpaced Keysight's overall growth. Combined, they represented just over 1/3 of Keysight's total revenue for the year. We also continued to grow annualized recurring revenue, which now exceeds $1 billion. The growth in software and services as well as the recurring revenue further strengthens the durability and resiliency of our business model, while at the same time contributing to Keysight's margin expansion. 
Keysight's focus on first-to-market software-centric solutions and operational excellence drives our consistent execution. We have a strong track record of performance and proven business resiliency. Since our inception as a public company 7 years ago, we have achieved a 10% compound annual revenue growth rate, expanded gross margin by over 800 basis points, increased operating margin by nearly 1,000 basis points and generated 16% annualized EPS growth all while significantly increasing investment in R&D and sales to drive future growth. Over this same period, we have nearly tripled the size of our software revenue and more than doubled recurring revenue while growing services 75%. These accomplishments are a testament to Keysight's leadership model, our values and our people. I would like to thank all Keysight employees for their exceptional execution and dedication. We continue to capitalize on these multiple waves of technology innovation and long-term secular growth trends across multiple markets. We exit this year in a strong competitive position and expect to continue to deliver sustained above-market profitable growth. 
Now I will turn it over to Neil to discuss our financial performance and outlook in more detail. Happy Thanksgiving."

As Ron mentioned, we delivered an outstanding quarter and fiscal year. 
In the fourth quarter of 2021, we delivered record revenue of $1.294 billion, which was above the high end of our guidance range and grew 6% or 5% on a core basis despite a tightening supply environment. The further contraction of the supply chain within the quarter tempered total revenue results and was more impactful on the Communications Solutions Group businesses. 
With demand outpacing supply, we delivered a record $1.491 billion in orders, up 21% on a reported and core basis and enter fiscal year 2022 with over $2 billion in backlog, which will position us well as the supply chain situation improves. 
Looking at our operational results for Q4, we reported record gross margin of 66% and operating expenses of $456 million, resulting in an operating margin of 31%, an all-time high. 
Net income was a record $338 million, and we achieved $1.82 in earnings per share, which was well above the high end of our guidance. Our weighted average share count for the quarter was 186 million shares. 
Moving to the performance of our segments. Our Communications Solutions Group generated record revenue of $919 million, up 2%. CSG delivered gross margin of 66% and operating margin of 28%. 
In Q4, commercial communications generated revenue of $622 million, up 3%, driven by strength across the 5G ecosystem, O-RAN adoption and investment in 400-gigabit and 800-gigabit R&D. 
Aerospace, defense and government achieved record revenue of $297 million, up slightly from the same quarter last year as solid growth in Asia Pacific was offset by supply chain constraints that impacted revenue in the U.S. and Europe.
The Electronic Industrial Solutions Group generated fourth quarter revenue of $375 million, up 18% on a reported and core basis, driven by strength in semiconductor and automotive. EISG reported record gross margin of 66% and record operating margin of 36%. 
Given tightening supply chain constraints and trade headwinds, we are very pleased with our full year results. In FY '21, revenue totaled $4.9 billion, up 17% year-over-year or 15% on a core basis. Gross margin improved 40 basis points year-over-year to 65%. We continue to invest in R&D at 16% of revenue or $788 million for the year, while operating margin improved 260 basis points to 28%. On the strength of this performance, we have achieved our long-term operating margin target of 26% to 27%, 2 years ahead of plan. FY '21 non-GAAP net income was $1.2 billion or $6.23 per share, up 28%. 
Moving to the balance sheet and cash flow. We ended our fourth quarter with $2.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents, generating cash flow from operations of $368 million and free cash flow of $295 million. Total free cash flow for the year was $1.1 billion, representing 23% of revenue and 99% non-GAAP net income. 
As announced earlier today, the Keysight Board of Directors has approved a new share purchase authorization of $1.2 billion, effective immediately. Under our prior share repurchase authorization, we acquired approximately 2.1 million shares in the quarter at an average share price of $171 for a total consideration of $353 million. This brings our total share repurchases for the year to approximately 4.4 million shares at an average share price of $154 for a total consideration of $673 million or 59% of free cash flow. 
Now turning to our outlook and guidance. Despite a strong demand backdrop, supply chain constraints continue to moderate shipment expectations. As a result, we expect first quarter 2022 revenue to be in the range of $1.225 billion to $1.245 billion and Q1 earnings per share to be in the range of $1.50 to $1.56 based on a weighted diluted share count of approximately 185 million shares. 
Looking forward to 2022, we expect supply chain to remain tight in the first half of the year. Assuming a loosening of the supply situation in the second half, we expect full year revenue growth to be in the range of 6% to 7%, while delivering 10% earnings growth. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $78 million and capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $240 million to $260 million with increasing capacity and technology investments. Regarding our tax rate, we are modeling a 12% non-GAAP effective tax rate for FY '22, which assumes no change to current U.S. tax policy. 
In closing, we are entering the fiscal year with strong momentum, a record backlog position and a strong track record of operational excellence. We're encouraged by the strong dynamics across our end markets and are competitively positioned to drive sustainable and profitable growth going forward. 
With that, I will now turn it back to Jason for the Q&A."

My first question is just around the full year guide.

First of all, does that expectation still stands true? And if so, does that imply that we should expect to see a similar cadence to revenue as we did in fiscal '21? Or is there something I'm not appreciating here as I think about revenue trends for the full year, such as maybe the benefits of the loosening of the supply chain as we head into the back half of the year?"

And then maybe if you think about it in terms of year-over-year growth, right, our guidance of 6% to 7% for the full year, I was thinking about that on a quarter-by-quarter basis, I'd be expecting growth rates in the first half of the year that are below that 6% to 7% level and growth rates in the back half of the year that are slightly above 6% to 7% level so that we average that for the full year."

The impact was greater on CSG businesses than in EISG businesses. If you think about why that is, the CSG products tend to be more complex. They have a longer bill of materials. And so there are more parts and components that go into building those instruments on average. And so that, just by its nature, increases the risk and the challenges that we have to fulfill that supply chain. I think it's also true on average that the CSG products tend to be at the higher end of the technology spectrum. And so there are fewer suppliers for those cutting-edge technology products than for a little bit more of the mainstream products that exist within EISG. 
I think if you think about the impact to supply chain, I'd maybe lump COVID and supply chain together because we've really seen this phenomenon over the last couple of years. And if you're starting to think about how to quantify those impacts, I'd really kind of focus your attention, not on any one quarter, over time, you're looking at the full fiscal years, as an example, at our order rates, right? If you look at our history prior to 2020, we have done a pretty good job of converting our orders to revenue. There's typically a little bit of a lag, a certain percentage of each quarter's order ship within the quarter, another portion shift out into the following quarters. 
But over the past couple of years in 2020 because of COVID and into 2021 because of supply chain, we have seen that delta between orders and revenue grow. And so I think we estimate, if you think about it in terms of kind of an abnormal backlog build, that abnormal backlog build over the last couple of years is in the $300 million to $400 million range. And so I think that's the opportunity for us as we look forward to eventually clear that backlog once the supply chain situation fixes itself. I don't expect that we'll flex that in a quarter or 2. I think it will happen over time because the kind of the remedies of the supply chain are going to happen over time as well. But that's the rough magnitude of what the impact has been here over a couple of year period of time."

It's very, very clear that software and services continues to be a bigger and bigger percentage of our total business as we move from a hardware product supplier to a software-centric solution provider, and the solutions obviously include hardware, software and services. And we've seen great growth, obviously, in our software and our services, and they've outpaced the hardware growth. 
Looking overall at 5G versus 4G, we made the decision in 2013, we announced that Agilent were going to spin off Keysight in 2013, which we eventually did in November of 2014. But in 2013, I started working with the team that was developing to invest in 5G and make sure that we were going to be leaders. In 4G, we were providing a little bit more of, let's say, cash contribution to Agilent where we were not investing as heavily in the communications rollout of 4G by a substantial amount. So we invested earlier. We invested a greater amount as now we're roughly at 16% R&D where we used to be at approximately 12% of R&D. And we've gone from roughly $400 million to roughly $800 million in R&D spend over this period of time. 
But software is a key part. What we did was we consolidated our hardware development facilities into one organization as opposed to in separate divisions. And accordingly, that enabled us to basically provide software that could span the whole product offering. And we made an acquisition for instance of a company called Anite, which gave us software capability. They had some capability in 4G. We moved them over to 5G. And all this together, investing more, starting earlier, having a consistent R&D and investment profile has really gave us the lead and caused us to be a much, much stronger provider, and I believe the leading provider, for 5G. 5G is still growing, and we anticipate it growing for years. 
I'm going to turn it over to Satish who could tell you a little bit more about our results and our growth in not only 2021 but what he sees going forward."

And the drivers are scaling deployments but, equally important, is the new application space. And I think we outplayed that as a strategy. We had to continue the progression from physical to protocol to application, and this application area is very rich, right? As I look forward, some of these application spaces have software as a percentage of the total value proposition in the 30%, 40%, 50% range and one we pursue very actively. 
I'll just make a few examples of these, right? So you can think of on the 5G side, O-RAN being a great example of that; on the wireline side, the protocols with 400-gig, 800-gig getting more complex; you look at new emerging spaces like SD-WAN, SASE and MACsec and the security domain. So you look at the commercial comms portfolio, it's very rich in applications that really favor our strategy of being more software-centric and one we're investing to pursue and we're generating strong results."

The first thing that's probably really important to note is that our differentiating technologies that have given us the leadership position outside of the software that we have developed is semiconductors that have very particular high-performance capabilities. And as you know, we have an on-site fab that exists in Santa Rosa, and that fab makes gallium arsenide and indium phosphide semiconductors. So a lot of people are having trouble now getting more custom components built, and we build a lot of those custom components in-house. So that has definitely helped us. 
Now again, if you don't have all the parts, you can't ship anything. And we are in relatively good shape compared to other competitors, but there's no doubt that we have to make sure that we get all the components that are needed in order to ship the product. We always will look for opportunities to integrate provided that it makes financial sense. We feel very good about what we have in-house right now. It's not so much the plastic pieces and things like that. There are obviously not only components but there is the whole logistical shipping issues that the whole world is going through. So we are impacted a little bit less than others. And I think the overall organization has done a real good job of being able to deliver during these very challenging times."

So again, a pretty strong quarter for aerospace defense orders growing double digits, finishing off a year with double-digit growth. If you look at what drove that growth, it's recovery in the macro environment globally, stimulus spend, especially towards technology that continues to increase, both in the U.S. and internationally and one we're capturing. We also took some concerted steps last year or 2 years ago, in fact, to take our 5G technology stack and customize it for aerospace defense applications. And as you've probably seen, our collaboration with Lockheed Martin that we announced, so we're very pleased with the progression that we're making with commercial technologies that are getting adopted. So all of these are pretty favorable. 
We are observing that right now, we are under continuing resolution from a budget perspective in the U.S. But if you look at the budget that has been put in place or that has been proposed, and if it's approved, it does call for a year-over-year increase and also increased spend in technology, our RDT&E line item, which we view as a favorable dynamic.

I think as we look to next year, it's a really dynamic time, obviously, with supply chain pressures putting a little bit of a governor on revenue. At the same time, we've got inflationary pressures across the broader economy. And then the other thing that we're looking to that's a little bit of a cost up within next year is, hopefully, a return to kind of a post-COVID or a pre-COVID normal in terms of our general operating environment. And that includes the costs associated with the facilities management as we return to the office, increased travel as people get back out and start seeing customers and conducting more business in person rather than over Zoom. 
And maybe the last point being that we invested in R&D this year, just under 16% of revenue. I think we continue to see great opportunities to invest in technology and bring new solutions into the marketplace. I think you're likely to see R&D tick upward next year in the kind of mid-16% range. So from those perspectives, I think FY '22 may be a bit of a catch-up year.

So we talked about in this recently completed fiscal year that we expected a couple of years of elevated CapEx as a result of some efforts to improve the resiliency of our supply chain.

So we talked about in this recently completed fiscal year that we expected a couple of years of elevated CapEx as a result of some efforts to improve the resiliency of our supply chain. And that, in fact, did pan out with CapEx of approximately $175 million this year. I think in addition to continuing those investments, we see incremental investments that are necessary as we continue to expand our own capacity and invest in key technologies to drive the future growth of our business. So I think those are additive. 
Given everything that's happening across the economic sphere today, there is, relative to what we were seeing this time last year, an increased need to spend money on capacity investments here within Keysight. And so I do not believe that the approximately $250 million of CapEx that we've communicated for next year is the new steady state. That is not the case. That steady state is significantly lower, a little bit difficult to call at this point, but materially lower than the $250 million that we're indicating for FY '22."

Very strong performance in our EISG business. Again, strength, as I mentioned, in the semiconductor where new wafer starts are really enabling us to continue to drive growth there, a very strong year, again, building off of a strong double-digit year last year in semiconductor as well. So when I think about what we're doing there, we're definitely taking share and we are continuing to invest to keep that portfolio growing and capitalizing on the environment we see with semiconductor. 
With regard to automotive, it's been a newer market entry for us, relatively speaking. We started this in spin. We're very pleased with the results we're seeing so far. And if you look at this fiscal year, we've had some wins in the manufacturing expansions that have happened in the EV sector. And as we shore up our contributions in the AV market, we've announced a partnership with NIO, as an example, of what we're doing by extending our 5G technology stack in C-V2X. In summary, all in all, you look at our entire portfolio for automotive, it is growing and it is much more comprehensive than any of our traditional competitors at this point and we are continuing to invest in growing that business. So overall, pleased with where we find ourselves with the EISG business."

The only other thing I would say is, in Q4, we did have a very favorable product mix within the quarter. At least as we see Q1 taking shape, we expect mix on a sequential basis to be a little bit less favorable. And then there are some normal items for Keysight that also typically impact Q1, most notably that we do company-wide salary administration in the first quarter.
