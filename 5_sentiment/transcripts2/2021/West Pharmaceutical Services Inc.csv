Thank you for joining us today. West had an extraordinary year of success in the face of the biggest health care challenge of our generation. Our record-setting year of sales and margins were driven by base",1317,"Thank you, Quintin, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. West had an extraordinary year of success in the face of the biggest health care challenge of our generation. Our record-setting year of sales and margins were driven by base business demand of our Components, Devices and Solutions as well as the accelerating demand for components associated with COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. This was accomplished by our dedicated team members across the globe, working tirelessly to show up each day at our facilities, our labs and remotely at their homes to make a meaningful difference to customers and patients. 
I want to begin by acknowledging his incredible efforts and say thank you. 
Starting on Slide 5 of the presentation. The past year has truly brought to life the importance of our mission and values that guides our work each day at West. We remain steadfast in our purpose to serve society and lead by example for the communities in which we live and work. Importantly, we continue to manage through these unprecedented times by focusing on 2 key priorities: 1, keeping our team members safe; and 2, ensuring uninterrupted supply of high-quality containment and delivery devices required by our customers and the patients we jointly serve. The criticality of our business today is shown in the character and the perseverance of our team members to deliver on our commitments as a trusted partner for our customers. The strength of our performance this past quarter and throughout 2020, demonstrates the forward momentum that we have built over time with our market-led strategy globalization of our manufacturing network and One West team approach to satisfy market demand. 
Moving to Slide 6. These charts show a breakdown of the 2020 sales and the impact of our high-value products that we bring to numerous customers around the world. As the base business continues to grow, and as we saw a growing demand for components associated with COVID 19, we leveraged our global infrastructure and team's agility to meet the increased demand. 
Now turning to Slide 7. Probably, West Components are on a majority of the vaccines on the market and in development to combat COVID-19. The process for selecting the best high-quality packaging components for use with injectable medicines including vaccines is a complex one, driven by years of science, which West has pioneered. It became clear to us in early 2020 that would -- we would need to accelerate production capacity for certain high-value products. 
As I previously shared, many of our customers are selecting fluoropolymer-coated stoppers from vial configurations made by both West and our partner, Daikyo. These are the industry standard for packaging sensitive molecules and have an outstanding track record of quality and reliability. 
Some of our customers have selected NovaPure, as they have made the decision to use this best-in-industry component to ensure the highest degree of quality and safety. In addition, we're involved in many therapeutic approvals and our contract manufacturing business is supporting the COVID-19 diagnostic requirements of our customers. 
In Q4, we accelerated our capacity expansion and began the installation of additional equipment with a modular approach to expand Flurotec and NovaPure capacity. This included the installation of several 45-ton hydraulic presses and additional HVP manufacturing processes to produce components for COVID-19 vaccines at several sites. I'm proud to say that the first presses were installed and validated at the end of 2020, and we're now producing product. 
And we're not done yet. We have more presses that will be installed in the first half of this year. It should be noted that these investments were already included in the 5-year plan, we just brought them forward to support the pandemic efforts. 
Moving to Slide 8. While COVID-19 was much of the focus in 2020, there are a few other notable highlights I would like to share. West was named to the S&P500 and recently joined the S&P500 Dividend Aristocrats. We continue to make significant progress with our environmental, social and governance priorities and have received many accolades in 2020 for these efforts. We launched several innovative products such as our 20-millimeter Vial2Bag advanced product. AccelTRA component line extensions and a flip-off seal container closure system compatible with Daikyo Crystal Zenith vials. Our team of scientific and technical experts continue to educate and share insights in biologics, combination products and container closure integrity, which are priority areas in pharmaceutical packaging and necessity during this pandemic to ensure patient safety. 
At the end of the year, West Digital technology center successfully implemented a new ERP system, SAP S/4HANA, which during this pandemic is quite an accomplishment. As we continue to improve our internal systems, S/4HANA brings enhanced analytics to improve responsiveness, operating efficiencies and greater service levels for customers. 
Turning to Slide 9. The opportunity ahead of us centers around 3 core pillars: execute, innovate and grow. The first pillar, Execute is about continuing to build from the strength and success of the market led strategy, further globalization of our operating model; and lastly, a shift from analog to a digital environment across West. We continue to drive the market led strategy for further defining unique value propositions to address specific customer needs in biologics, generics and pharma. These are very attractive, robust markets for the future of injectable medicines. For the benefit of our customers, we have been able to leverage our global manufacturing network by enabling the right capabilities, scale and flexibility to keep up with the increased demand with the ability to leverage existing assets more effectively across our global network, we can respond to the demand of our base business and importantly, the demand for COVID-19, while maintaining our global leadership position. 
We will continue to deliver digital tools, such as the Dallas Center and the West Virtual, along with enhancements to improve plant productivity with automation and advanced manufacturing systems. 
The second pillar is Innovate with a focus on R&D efforts from concept to commercialization. Our newly aligned R&D team is focused on several areas: the first area of new products and platforms to connect the dots across science and technology for potential value creation. The second area is Technology Scouting and new Go-to-Market enablement, which explores adjacent technologies and disruptors to realize new opportunities. And the third area is Product Life Cycle Management with the execution of development agreements and product extensions. We are confident that these R&D efforts will have us well positioned to deliver unique innovations and future improvements to existing portfolios for our customers. 
The third pillar is Growth, capital deployment and free cash flow. As mentioned earlier, we have increased capital expenditures on specific equipment focused on Flurotec and NovaPure to enable us to respond to the core business growth and vaccine requirements. And as that vaccines are being approved, making sure we can respond and meet the customer demand. And we continue to look for external technology opportunities to complement our business. We are working from a position of strength as we believe we have a long horizon of continued organic sales growth and margin expansion. 
Our focus within these 3 pillars: Execute, Innovate and Growth, allows us to be more responsive, leverage our assets more effectively, and support the trends that are happening in the industry today. 
Turning to Slide 10 and our performance in the fourth quarter and full year. Our financial results are strong. We had approximately 20% organic sales growth in the fourth quarter and 16% for the full year, driven again by robust biologics growth high-value product sales and contract manufacturing. And our base business delivered significant growth with solid growth and operating profit margin expansion. This resulted in a strong adjusted EPS and free cash flow for the fourth quarter. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to our CFO, Bernard Birkett, who will provide more detail on our financial performance and guidance. Bernard?"
313784,703265380,2215265,"West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2021",2021-02-18,"Earnings Calls","West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Eric, and good morning. So let's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q4 2020 revenues and profits where we saw continued strong sales and EPS growth led by strong revenue performance, primarily in our Biologics and Generics m",971,"Thank you, Eric, and good morning. So let's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q4 2020 revenues and profits where we saw continued strong sales and EPS growth led by strong revenue performance, primarily in our Biologics and Generics market units and Contract Manufacturing. I will take you through the margin growth we saw in the quarter as well as some balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we'll review our 2021 guidance. 
First up Q4, our financial results are summarized on Slide 11 and and the reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures are described in Slides 20 to 23. 
We recorded net sales of $580 million, representing organic sales growth of 19.8%. The COVID-related net revenues are estimated to have been approximately $46 million in the quarter. These net revenues include our assessment of components associated with vaccines, treatment and diagnosis of COVID-19 patients, offset by lower sales to customers affected by lower volumes due to the pandemic. 
Looking at Slide 12. Proprietary product sales grew organically by 25.1% in the quarter. High-Value Products, which made up more than 65% of proprietary product sales in the quarter grew double digits and had solid momentum across all market units throughout Q4. 
Looking at the performance of the market units, the Biologics market unit delivered strong double-digit growth. We continue to work with many biotech and biopharma customers, who are using West and Daikyo high-value product offerings. 
The Generics market unit also experienced strong double-digit growth made by sales of Westar and Flurotec components. 
Our pharma market unit saw low single-digit growth with sales led by high-value products, including Westar and Flurotec components. 
And Contract Manufacturing had mid single-digit organic sales growth for the fourth quarter, led once again, by sales of diagnostic and health care-related injection devices. 
We continue to see improvements in gross profit. We recorded a $211.1 million in gross profit, $57.9 million or 37.8% above Q4 of last year. And our gross profit margin of 36.4% was a 390-basis-point expansion from the same period last year. We saw improvement in adjusted operating profit with $119.1 million in quarter this quarter compared to $73.1 million in the same period last year or a 62.9% increase. 
Our adjusted operating profit margin of 20.5% was a 500-basis-point increase from the same period last year. Finally, adjusted diluted EPS grew 63% for Q4. Excluding stock tax benefit of $0.09 in Q4, EPS grew by approximately 55%. 
So let's review the growth drivers in both revenue and profit. On Slide 13, we show the contributions to sales growth in the quarter. Volume and mix contributed $87.8 million or 18.7 percentage points of growth, including approximately $46 million of volume-driven by COVID-19-related net demand. Sales price increases contributed $5.5 million, a 1.2 percentage points of growth, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased sales by $16.3 million or an increase of 3.5 percentage points. 
Looking at margin performance. Slide 14 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 36.4% for Q4 2020, up from 32.5% in Q4 2019. Proprietary Products fourth quarter gross profit margin of 41.7% was 370 basis points above the margin achieved in the fourth quarter of 2019. The key drivers for the continued improvement in Proprietary Products gross profit margin were favorable mix of products sold driven by growth in high-value products, reduction efficiencies and sales price increases, partially offset by increased overhead costs. 
Contract Manufacturing fourth quarter gross profit margin of 17.2% was 80 basis points above the margin achieved in the fourth quarter of 2019. This is a result of improved efficiencies and plant utilization. 
Now let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating more cash. On Slide 15, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $472.5 million for 2020, an increase of $105.3 million compared to the same period last year, a 28.7% increase. Our 2020 capital spending was $174.4 million, $48 million higher than the same period last year and in line with guidance. 
Working capital of $870.3 million at December 31, 2020, was $153.2 million higher than at December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable of $66 million due to increased sales activity and an increase in inventory of $85.6 million to position us to support the increasing needs of our customers. 
Our cash balance at December 31 of $615.5 million, was $176.4 million more than our December 2019 balance, primarily due to our positive operating results. 
Turning to guidance. Slide 16 provides a high level summary. Full year 2021 net sales guidance will be in a range of between $2.5 billion and $2.2 -- $2.525 billion. This includes estimated net COVID incremental revenues of approximately $260 million. There is an estimated benefit of $75 million foreign exchange rate. We expect organic sales growth to be approximately 13% to 14%. We expect our full year 2021 reported diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $6 to $6.15. We continue to expand our HVP manufacturing capacity at our existing sites to meet anticipated core growth and COVID vaccine demand. Accordingly, we have set CapEx guidance of $230 million to $240 million. 
There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our guidance. Estimated FX benefit on EPS has an impact of approximately $0.23 based on current foreign currency exchange rates and excludes future tax benefits from stock-based compensation. 
To summarize the key takeaways for the fourth quarter, strong top line growth in both proprietary and contract manufacturers, gross profit margin improvement, growth in operating profit margin growth and adjusted diluted EPS, and growth in operating and free cash flow, delivering in line with our pillars that Execute, Innovate and Grow. 
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Eric."

And if you look at the tailend of 2020, it started to flip more towards vaccines and as we move into 2021, you'll see most of -- going from, as you said, a little bit less than $100 million of revenues associated with COVID-19 in 2020, we're guiding towards $260 million approximately for 2021. Majority of that will be vaccines related. 
And our participation is very high in the types of solutions that we're bringing to the customers tend to be around the Flurotec, and in some cases, the NovaPure, in addition to products like seals. So that's the transition that you'll see in the mix of type of revenues to support the COVID-19 solutions.

Well, we've been talking about the growth in contract manufacturing for a while saying that it will gravitate towards mid single-digit growth, and it wouldn't be at the double-digit growth rates we've seen over the last number of years, just given the nature of that business. 
We continue to invest in it. It is part of our CapEx forecast for 2021, and there's a number of growth initiatives in that area. And what we have been communicating that the growth rate will become more in line with our overall construct. And I think if you look at Q4 -- the Q4 number, the absolute dollars was pretty consistent throughout the year with Contract Manufacturing. It just came up against a really big comp in Q4. So the percentage growth rate looked a little bit lighter than the previous quarters. 
But from a dollar perspective, it's pretty much in line with where we have expected it to be and where we have communicated it will be. But we continue to invest in that part of our business."

West had an extraordinary year of success in the face of the biggest health care challenge of our generation. A record-setting year of sales and margins were driven by base business demand of our components, devices and solutions as well as the accelerating demand for components associated with COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. This was accomplished by our dedicated team members across the globe, working tirelessly to show up each day at our facilities, our labs and remotely at their homes to make a meaningful difference to customers and patients. I want to begin by acknowledging this incredible efforts and say thank you.  
Starting on Slide 5 of the presentation. The past year has truly brought to life the importance of our mission and values that guides our work each day at West. We remain steadfast in our purpose to serve society and lead by example for the communities in which we live and work. Importantly, we continue to manage through these unprecedented times by focusing on 2 key priorities: one, keeping our team members safe; and two, ensuring uninterrupted supply of high-quality containment and delivery devices required by our customers and the patients we jointly serve. The criticality of our business today is shown in the character and the perseverance of our team members to deliver on our commitments as a trusted partner for our customers. The strength of our performance this past quarter and throughout 2020, demonstrates the forward momentum that we have built over time with our market-led strategy, globalization of our manufacturing network and One West team approach to satisfy market demand.  
Moving to Slide 6. These charts show a breakdown of the 2020 sales and the impact of our high-value products that we bring to numerous customers around the world. As the base business continues to grow, and as we saw a growing demand for components associated with COVID-19, we leveraged our global infrastructure and team's agility to meet the increased demand.  
Now turning to Slide 7. Proudly, West components are on a majority of the vaccines on the market and in development to combat COVID-19. The process for selecting the best high-quality packaging components for use with injectable medicines, including vaccines is a complex one, driven by years of science, which West has pioneered. It became clear to us in early 2020 that would -- we would need to accelerate production capacity for certain high-value products.  
As I previously shared, many of our customers are selecting fluoropolymer-coated stoppers from vial configurations made by both West and our partner, Daikyo. These are the industry standard for packaging sensitive molecules and have an outstanding track record of quality and reliability. Some of our customers have selected NovaPure, as they have made the decision to use this best-in-industry component to ensure the highest degree of quality and safety. In addition, we're involved in many therapeutic approvals and our contract manufacturing business is supporting the COVID-19 diagnostic requirements of our customers.  
In Q4, we accelerated our capacity expansions and began the installation of additional equipment with a modular approach to expand Flurotec and NovaPure capacity. This included the installation of several 45-ton hydraulic presses and additional HVP manufacturing processes to produce components for COVID-19 vaccines at several sites. I'm proud to say that the first presses were installed and validated at the end of 2020, and we're now producing product. And we're not done yet. We have more presses that will be installed in the first half of this year. It should be noted that these investments were already included in the 5-year plan. We just brought them forward to support the pandemic efforts.  
Moving to Slide 8. While COVID-19 was much of the focus in 2020, there are a few other notable highlights I would like to share. West was named to the S&P 500 and recently joined the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats. We continue to make significant progress with our environmental, social and governance priorities and have received many accolades in 2020 for these efforts. We launched several innovative products such as our 20-millimeter Vial2Bag Advanced product. AccelTRA component line extensions and a Flip-Off seal container closure system compatible with Daikyo Crystal Zenith vials. 
Our team of scientific and technical experts continue to educate and share insights in biologics, combination products and container closure integrity, which are priority areas in pharmaceutical packaging and necessity during this pandemic to ensure patient safety.  
At the end of the year, West digital technology center successfully implemented a new ERP system, SAP S/4HANA, which during this pandemic is quite an accomplishment. As we continue to improve our internal systems, S/4HANA brings enhanced analytics to improve responsiveness, operating efficiencies and greater service levels for customers.  
Turning to Slide 9. The opportunity ahead of us centers around 3 core pillars: execute; innovate; and grow. The first pillar, Execute is about continuing to build from the strength and success of the market led strategy. Further globalization of our operating model. And lastly, a shift from analog to a digital environment across West. We continue to drive the market-led strategy for further defining unique value propositions to address specific customer needs in biologics, generics and pharma. These are very attractive, robust markets for the future of injectable medicines. 
For the benefit of our customers, we have been able to leverage our global manufacturing network by enabling the right capabilities, scale and flexibility to keep up with the increased demand with the ability to leverage existing assets more effectively across our global network, we can respond to the demand of our base business and importantly, the demand for COVID-19, while maintaining our global leadership position. We will continue to deliver digital tools, such as the Knowledge Center and the West Virtual, along with enhancements to improve plant productivity with automation and advanced manufacturing systems.  
The second pillar is Innovate with a focus on R&D efforts with -- from concept to commercialization. Our newly aligned R&D team is focused on several areas: the first area of new products and platforms, to connect the dots across science and technology for potential value creation. The second area is Technology Scouting & New Go-to-Market Enablement, which explores adjacent technologies and disruptors to realize new opportunities. And the third area is Product Life Cycle Management with the execution of development agreements and product extensions. We are confident that these R&D efforts will have us well positioned to deliver unique innovations and future improvements to existing portfolios for our customers.  
The third pillar is Growth, capital deployment and free cash flow. As mentioned earlier, we have increased capital expenditures on specific equipment focused on Flurotec and NovaPure to enable us to respond to the core business growth and vaccine requirements and as the vaccines are being approved, making sure we can respond and meet the customer demand. And we continue to look for external technology opportunities to complement our business. We are working from a position of strength as we believe we have a long horizon of continued organic sales growth and margin expansion.  
Our focus within these 3 pillars: Execute, Innovate and Grow, allows us to be more responsive, leverage our assets more effectively, and support the trends that are happening in the industry today.  
Turning to Slide 10 and our performance in the fourth quarter and full year. Our financial results were strong. We had approximately 20% organic sales growth in the fourth quarter and 16% for the full year, driven again by robust biologics growth, high-value product sales and contract manufacturing. And our base business delivered significant growth with solid growth in operating profit margin expansion. This resulted in a strong adjusted EPS and free cash flow for the fourth quarter.  
And with that, I'll turn it over to our CFO, Bernard Birkett, who will provide more detail on our financial performance and guidance. Bernard?"
313784,703265380,2215468,"West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc., Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 18, 2021",2021-02-18,"Earnings Calls","West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Eric, and good morning. So let's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q4 2020 revenues and profits where we saw continued strong sales and EPS growth led by strong revenue performance, primarily in our biologics and generics m",971,"Thank you, Eric, and good morning. So let's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q4 2020 revenues and profits where we saw continued strong sales and EPS growth led by strong revenue performance, primarily in our biologics and generics market units and Contract Manufacturing. I will take you through the margin growth we saw in the quarter as well as some balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we'll review our 2021 guidance. 
First up Q4, our financial results are summarized on Slide 11 and the reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures are described in Slides 20 to 23. 
We recorded net sales of $580 million, representing organic sales growth of 19.8%. COVID-related net revenues are estimated to have been approximately $46 million in the quarter. These net revenues include our assessment of components associated with vaccines, treatment and diagnosis of COVID-19 patients, offset by lower sales to customers affected by lower volumes due to the pandemic. 
Looking at Slide 12. Proprietary product sales grew organically by 25.1% in the quarter. High-value products, which made up more than 65% of proprietary product sales in the quarter grew double digits and had solid momentum across all market units throughout Q4. 
Looking at the performance of the market units, the biologics market unit delivered strong double-digit growth. We continue to work with many biotech and biopharma customers, who are using West and Daikyo high-value product offerings. The generics market unit also experienced strong double-digit growth made by sales of Westar and Flurotec components. Our pharma market unit saw low single-digit growth with sales led by high-value products, including Westar and Flurotec components. And Contract Manufacturing had mid single-digit organic sales growth for the fourth quarter, led once again, by sales of diagnostic and health care-related injection devices. 
We continue to see improvements in gross profit. We recorded a $211.1 million in gross profit, $57.9 million or 37.8% above Q4 of last year. And our gross profit margin of 36.4% was a 390-basis-point expansion from the same period last year. We saw improvements in adjusted operating profit with $119.1 million recorded this quarter compared to $73.1 million in the same period last year or a 62.9% increase. 
Our adjusted operating profit margin of 20.5% was a 500-basis-point increase from the same period last year. Finally, adjusted diluted EPS grew 63% for Q4. Excluding stock tax benefit of $0.09 in Q4, EPS grew by approximately 55%. 
So let's review the growth drivers in both revenue and profit. On Slide 13, we show the contributions to sales growth in the quarter. Volume and mix contributed $87.8 million or 18.7 percentage points of growth, including approximately $46 million of volume-driven by COVID-19-related net demand. Sales price increases contributed $5.5 million, a 1.2 percentage points of growth, and changes in foreign currency exchange rate increased sales by $16.3 million or an increase of 3.5 percentage points. 
Looking at margin performance. Slide 14 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 36.4% for Q4 2020, up from 32.5% in Q4 2019. Proprietary Products fourth quarter gross profit margin of 41.7% was 370 basis points above the margin achieved in the fourth quarter of 2019. The key drivers for the continued improvement in Proprietary Products gross profit margin were favorable mix of products sold driven by growth in high-value products, reduction efficiencies and sales price increases, partially offset by increased overhead costs. Contract Manufacturing fourth quarter gross profit margin of 17.2% was 80 basis points above the margin achieved in the fourth quarter of 2019. This is a result of improved efficiencies and plant utilization. 
Now let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating more cash. On Slide 15, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $472.5 million for 2020, an increase of $105.3 million compared to the same period last year, a 28.7% increase. Our 2020 capital spending was $174.4 million, $48 million higher than the same period last year and in line with guidance. 
Working capital of $870.3 million at December 31, 2020, was $153.2 million higher than at December 31, 2019, primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable of $66 million due to increased sales activity and an increase in inventory of $85.6 million to position us to support the increasing needs of our customers. Our cash balance at December 31 of $615.5 million, was $176.4 million more than our December 2019 balance, primarily due to our positive operating results. 
Turning to guidance. Slide 16 provides a high level summary. Full year 2021 net sales guidance will be in a range of between $2.5 billion and $2.2 -- $2.525 billion. This includes estimated net COVID incremental revenues of approximately $260 million. There is an estimated benefit of $75 million based on current foreign exchange rate. We expect organic sales growth to be approximately 13% to 14%. We expect our full year 2021 reported diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $6 to $6.15. We continue to expand our HVP manufacturing capacity at our existing sites to meet anticipated core growth and COVID vaccine demand. Accordingly, we have set CapEx guidance of $230 million to $240 million. 
There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our guidance. Estimated FX benefit on EPS has an impact of approximately $0.23 based on current foreign currency exchange rates and excludes future tax benefits from stock-based compensation. 
To summarize the key takeaways for the fourth quarter, strong top line growth in both Proprietary and Contract Manufacturing, gross profit margin improvement, growth in operating profit margin, growth and adjusted diluted EPS, and growth in operating and free cash flow, delivering in line with our pillars of Execute, Innovate and Grow. 
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Eric."

Majority of that will be vaccines related. 
And our participation is very high and the types of solutions that we're bringing to the customers tend to be around the Flurotec, and in some cases, the NovaPure, in addition to products like seals. So that's the transition that you'll see in the mix of type of revenues to support the COVID-19 solutions.

We I am pleased to report that we had an exceptional first quarter. This was driven by strong organic sales growth in both our base business and the accelerating demand for products associated with COVID-19. Our high-value products continue to fuel increased gross and operating margins. 
Together, this has resulted in record EPS for the first quarter. The strength of our performance is demonstrated in our ability to execute the market-led strategy, leverage the power of our global manufacturing network and rally as a One West team to meet the increased market demand. I am proud of how our team members have focused on our priorities and emphasize the importance of our purpose and values during these times. 
Turning to Slide 6. We have highlighted the key drivers of growth in Q1. We continue to see strong uptake of HVP components, including Westar, FluroTec, Envision and NovaPure offerings as well as Daikyo's Crystal Zenith. Our biologics customers are seeking to use these best-in-industry components to ensure the highest degree of quality and safety for their vaccines and injectable medicines. 
This has resulted in strong double-digit growth, excluding COVID sales, and continued demand growth for FluroTec and NovaPure in our Biologics business. Through the first 4 months of 2021, our participation rate in recently approved new molecular entities In the U.S. and Europe continues to be strong with over 95% of these approvals using either West or Daikyo components. In addition, we experienced strong growth in Westar ready-to-use components with customers seeking the value, quality and convenience of our Westar wash and sterilized products. 
And for Envision, we also had significant growth with customers looking for higher quality and better production yields by using our Envision inspected components. Another highlight was strong sales growth in Daikyo CZ syringes and vials. Customers prefer CZ for its compatibility with their sensitive molecules and its outstanding track record of quality and reliability. 
Moving to Slide 7. I The power of our global manufacturing network continues to support our growth trajectory. We are uniquely positioned as a result of the global operations strategy implemented a few years ago. This has enabled the right capabilities, scale and flexibility to keep in pace with the increase in demand. As a result of recent capital investments, we have expanded our manufacturing capacity across our high-value product portfolio with additional equipment and validated lines to support our highest HBP growth areas, Westar, FluroTec and NovaPure. 
We have accelerated the time line for capacity builds within our existing footprint by working closely with our incumbent suppliers and staging installations around the 24/7 plant schedules. Our first phase, which began at the start of the pandemic is about 75% installed and operational, with expected completion in the second half of the year. 
Our second phase, we'll see equipment arriving in the back end of the year in operational in 2022. And we are evaluating additional investments for a third expansion phase in response to an increasing possibility of COVID-19 boosters and annual vaccinations required over the next few years. When this occurs, we think that future COVID-19 vaccines could likely be fewer doses per vial and/or in single-dose prefilled syringes. 
As a result, it may mean higher volume demand of our HVP components compared to what we are experiencing today. I am pleased to share that from my recent visit to our Scottsdale, Arizona facility, we are on schedule with our fully automated line for CZ insert needle syringes. We're in the process of validating the line, which is targeted to commence commercial production for our customers' committed orders during the third quarter of this year. This is our third automated line with another line scheduled for delivery in late 2021. 
Turning to Slide 8. Core to our values at West has been a strong corporate citizen. In 2019, we exceeded our initial 5-year environmental, social and governance, or ESG, initiatives set in 2017 and  raise the bar higher with a new set of 5-year goals. I'm proud to say that we continue to make significant progress on our ESG priorities with good momentum towards our stated reduction goals for waste, energy and water usage. 
We continue to reaffirm our commitment to live by our One West team value that calls on us to respect each other, drive collaboration and to embrace diversity inclusion in our workplace. We continue to make strides in this area from new team members hired at all levels in our manufacturing sites to the diverse representation on our executive leadership team at West. And we continuously look for ways to improve sustainability of our business and the rigor of our ESG reporting continues to evolve. 
Last year, we published a supplement -- or later this year, we will publish a supplement to our 2020 CR report incorporating the SASB ESG standards. Now I'll turn it over to our CFO, Bernard Birkett, who will provide more detail on our financial performance. Bernard?"

Let's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q1 2021 revenues and profits, where we saw continued strong sales and EPS growth, led by strong revenue performance, primarily in our biologics, pharma and generic market units. I will take you through the margin growth we saw in the quarter as well as some balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we will provide an update to our 2021 guidance. 
First up, Q1. Our financial results are summarized on Slide 9, and the reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures are described in Slides 17 to 20. We recorded net sales of $670.7 million representing organic sales growth of 31.1%. COVID-related net revenues are estimated to have been approximately $102.9 million in the quarter. These net revenues include our assessment of components associated with vaccines, treatment and diagnosis of COVID-19 patients, offset by lower sales to customers affected by lower volumes due to the pandemic. 
Looking at Slide 10. Proprietary Products sales grew organically by 39.6% in the quarter. High-value products, which made up more than 70% of proprietary product sales in the quarter grew double digits and had solid momentum across all market units throughout Q1. Looking at the performance of the market units, Biologics market unit delivered strong double-digit growth. We continue to work with many biotech and biopharma customers who are using West and Daikyo high-value product offerings. The generics market unit also experienced strong double-digit growth led by sales of Flurotec components. 
Our Pharma market unit saw strong double-digit growth with sales led by high-value products including Westar and FluroTec components. And Contract Manufacturing had mid-single-digit organic sales growth for the first quarter, led once again by sales of diagnostic and health care-related injection devices. We continue to see improvement in gross profit. We recorded $271.9 million in gross profit, $104.9 million or 62.8% above Q1 of last year. And our gross profit margin of 40.5% was a 650 basis point expansion from the same period last year. 
We saw improvements in adjusted operating profit with $179.2 million recorded this quarter compared to $88 million in the same period last year, for a 103.6% increase. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 26.7% was an 880 basis point increase from the same period last year. Finally, adjusted diluted EPS grew 103% for Q1. Excluding stock-based compensation tax benefit of $0.15 in Q1, EPS grew by approximately 102%. 
So let's review the growth drivers in both revenue and profit. On Slide 11, we show the contributions to sales growth in the quarter. Volume and mix contributed $146.7 million, Our 29.8 percentage points of growth, including approximately $102.9 million of volume driven by COVID-19-related net demand. Sales price increases contributed $6 million or 1.2 percentage points of growth, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased sales by $26.5 million or an increase of 5.4 percentage points. 
Looking at margin performance. Slide 12 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 40.5% for Q1 2021, up from 34% in Q1 2020. Proprietary Products first quarter gross profit margin of 46.3% was a 610 basis points above the margin achieved in the first quarter of 2020. The key drivers for the continued improvement in Proprietary Products gross profit margin were favorable mix of products sold driven by growth in high-value products. Production efficiencies, onetime fees associated with certain canceled COVID supply agreements of approximately $11.8 million and sales price increases, partially offset by increased overhead costs, inclusive of compensation. 
Contract manufacturing first quarter profit gross margin of 15.7% and was 140 basis points above the margin achieved in the first quarter of 2020. This is a result of improved efficiencies and plant utilization. 
Now let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating more cash for the business. On Slide 13, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $88.7 million for the first quarter of 2021, an increase of $31.6 million compared to the same period last year or a 55.3% increase. Our first quarter 2021 capital spending was $54.7 million, $22.6 million higher than the same period last year in line with guidance. 
Working capital of $844.2 million at March 31, 2021, declined slightly by $26.1 million from December 31, 2020. Our cash balance at March 31 of $483.7 million was $131.8 million less than our December 2020 balance, primarily due to our share repurchase program activity offset by the positive operating results. 
Turning to guidance. Slide 14 provides a high-level summary. Full year 2021 net sales are expected to be in a range of $2.63 billion and $2.655 billion, compared to prior guidance range of $2.5 billion and $2.525 billion. This guidance includes estimated net COVID with incremental revenues of approximately $345 million. There is an estimated benefit of $75 million based on current foreign exchange rates. We expect organic sales growth to be approximately 19% to 20%. 
We expect our full year 2021 adjusted diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $6.95 to $7.10 compared to a prior range of $6 to $6.15. We continue to expand our HVP manufacturing capacity at our existing sites to meet anticipated core growth and COVID vaccine demand. We are keeping our CapEx guidance at $230 million to $240 million, but continue to evaluate the levels needed to support our continued growth. 
There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our guidance. Estimated FX benefit on EPS has an impact of approximately $0.23 based on current foreign currency exchange rates. And our guidance excludes future tax benefits from stock-based compensation. So to summarize the key takeaways for the first quarter, strong top line growth in proprietary, gross profit margin improvement, growth in operating profit margin, growth in adjusted diluted EPS and growth in operating and free cash flow, delivering in line with our pillars of execute, innovate and grow. 
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Eric."

Also, we're starting to see the volume increase on a number of the biologics that have been recently introduced in the marketplace ramping up, and therefore, the volume component on existing molecules in the marketplace, we're seeing additional growth there. One last comment I'll add just because we're seeing really good strong growth in bio similars in our Asia Pacific region. So it's a combination of multiple aspects.

My question is around your HVP, I appreciate you guys always give the market unit growth. It makes me smile to hear Bernard emphasize strong double digits in the context of a 30% top line growth. I suspect It's very strong. I wondered, I may strike out on this, but I wondered if you guys would be willing to give maybe a little bit more precision about what strong double digits means.

The majority of the incremental growth that we're experiencing here at West, particularly in the last quarters, but as we look forward is within the HVP portfolio. We tried to highlight that we're excited and encouraged by the uptake of the higher end of that range, as you know, has a more attractive economic profile for or West. 
And not to say it has a phenomenal performance for our customers from a value proposition. But we're seeing over but over 2/3 of our growth coming in the high end of our HVP. And so if you can kind of think about do the math from there and get to the number you referenced 30%. It's a very, very strong growth. In the Walls of West, we don't really talk about the percentages in these 2 lines like NovaPure. We talk about the number of units and how can you double or triple that that portfolio in a very short period of time. So it's about as much context I can give on this, Bernard."

I am pleased to report that we had an exceptional first quarter. This was driven by strong organic sales growth in both our base business and the accelerating demand for products associated with COVID-19. Our high-value products continue to fuel increased gross and operating margins.  
Together, this has resulted in record EPS for the first quarter. The strength of our performance is demonstrated in our ability to execute the market-led strategy, leverage the power of our global manufacturing network and rally as a One West team to meet the increased market demand. I am proud of how our team members have focused on our priorities and emphasize the importance of our purpose and values during these times.  
Turning to Slide 6. We have highlighted the key drivers of growth in Q1. We continue to see strong uptake of HVP components, including Westar, FluroTec, Envision and NovaPure offerings as well as Daikyo's Crystal Zenith. Our biologics customers are seeking to use these best-in-industry components to ensure the highest degree of quality and safety for their vaccines and injectable medicines.  
This has resulted in strong double-digit growth, excluding COVID sales, and continued demand growth for FluroTec and NovaPure in our biologics business. Through the first 4 months of 2021, our participation rate in recently approved new molecular entities in the U.S. and Europe continues to be strong with over 95% of these approvals using either West or Daikyo components. In addition, we experienced strong growth in Westar ready-to-use components with customers seeking the value, quality and convenience of our Westar washed and sterilized products.  
And for Envision, we also had significant growth with customers looking for higher quality and better production yields by using our Envision inspected components. Another highlight was strong sales growth in Daikyo CZ syringes and vials. Customers prefer CZ for its compatibility with their sensitive molecules and its outstanding track record of quality and reliability.  
Moving to Slide 7. The power of our global manufacturing network continues to support our growth trajectory. We are uniquely positioned as a result of the global operations strategy implemented a few years ago. This has enabled the right capabilities, scale and flexibility to keep in pace with the increase in demand. As a result of recent capital investments, we have expanded our manufacturing capacity across our high-value product portfolio with additional equipment and validated lines to support our highest HVP growth areas, Westar, FluroTec and NovaPure.
We have accelerated the time line for capacity builds within our existing footprint by working closely with our incumbent suppliers and staging installations around the 24/7 plant schedules. Our first phase, which began at the start of the pandemic is about 75% installed and operational, with expected completion in second half of the year.  
Our second phase, we'll see equipment arriving in the back end of the year in operational in 2022. And we are evaluating additional investments for a third expansion phase in response to an increasing possibility of COVID-19 boosters and annual vaccinations required over the next few years. When this occurs, we think that future COVID-19 vaccines could likely be fewer doses per vial and/or in single-dose prefilled syringes.  
As a result, it may mean higher volume demand of our HVP components compared to what we are experiencing today. I am pleased to share that from my recent visit to our Scottsdale, Arizona facility, we are on schedule with our fully automated line for CZ insert needle syringes. We're in the process of validating the line, which is targeted to commence commercial production for our customers' committed orders during the third quarter of this year. This is our third automated line with another line scheduled for delivery in late 2021.  
Turning to Slide 8. Core to our values at West has been a strong corporate citizen. In 2019, we exceeded our initial 5-year environmental, social and governance, or ESG, initiatives set in 2017 and raised the bar higher with a new set of 5-year goals. I'm proud to say that we continue to make significant progress on our ESG priorities with good momentum towards our stated reduction goals for waste, energy and water usage.  
We continue to reaffirm our commitment to live by our One West team value that calls on us to respect each other, drive collaboration and to embrace diversity, inclusion in our workplace. We continue to make strides in this area from new team members hired at all levels in our manufacturing sites to the diverse representation on our executive leadership team at West. And we continuously look for ways to improve sustainability of our business and the rigor of our ESG reporting continues to evolve.  
Last year, we published a supplement -- or later this year, we will publish a supplement to our 2020 CR report incorporating the SASB ESG standards. Now I'll turn it over to our CFO, Bernard Birkett, who will provide more detail on our financial performance. Bernard?"

Let's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q1 2021 revenues and profits, where we saw continued strong sales and EPS growth, led by strong revenue performance, primarily in our biologics, pharma and generic market units. I will take you through the margin growth we saw in the quarter as well as some balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we will provide an update to our 2021 guidance.
First up, Q1. Our financial results are summarized on Slide 9, and the reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures are described in Slides 17 to 20. We recorded net sales of $670.7 million representing organic sales growth of 31.1%. COVID-related net revenues are estimated to have been approximately $102.9 million in the quarter. These net revenues include our assessment of components associated with vaccines, treatment and diagnosis of COVID-19 patients, offset by lower sales to customers affected by lower volumes due to the pandemic.  
Looking at Slide 10. Proprietary Products sales grew organically by 39.6% in the quarter. High-value products, which made up more than 70% of Proprietary Products sales in the quarter grew double digits and had solid momentum across all market units throughout Q1. Looking at the performance of the market units, Biologics market unit delivered strong double-digit growth. We continue to work with many biotech and biopharma customers who are using West and Daikyo high-value product offerings. The generics market unit also experienced strong double-digit growth led by sales of FluroTec components.  
Our pharma market unit saw strong double-digit growth with sales led by high-value products including Westar and FluroTec components. And Contract Manufacturing had mid-single-digit organic sales growth for the first quarter, led once again by sales of diagnostic and health care related injection devices. We continue to see improvement in gross profit. We recorded $271.9 million in gross profit, $104.9 million or 62.8% above Q1 of last year. And our gross profit margin of 40.5% was a 650 basis point expansion from the same period last year.  
We saw improvements in adjusted operating profit with $179.2 million recorded this quarter compared to $88 million in the same period last year, for a 103.6% increase. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 26.7% was an 880 basis point increase from the same period last year. Finally, adjusted diluted EPS grew 103% for Q1. Excluding stock-based compensation tax benefit of $0.15 in Q1, EPS grew by approximately 102%.  
So let's review the growth drivers in both revenue and profit. On Slide 11, we show the contributions to sales growth in the quarter. Volume and mix contributed $146.7 million or 29.8 percentage points of growth, including approximately $102.9 million of volume driven by COVID-19-related net demand. Sales price increases contributed $6 million or 1.2 percentage points of growth, and changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased sales by $26.5 million or an increase of 5.4 percentage points.  
Looking at margin performance. Slide 12 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 40.5% for Q1 2021, up from 34% in Q1 2020. Proprietary Products first quarter gross profit margin of 46.3% was a 610 basis points above the margin achieved in the first quarter of 2020. The key drivers for the continued improvement in Proprietary Products gross profit margin were favorable mix of products sold driven by growth in high-value products, production efficiencies, onetime fees associated with certain canceled COVID supply agreements of approximately $11.8 million and sales price increases, partially offset by increased overhead costs, inclusive of compensation.  
Contract manufacturing first quarter profit gross margin of 15.7% was 140 basis points above the margin achieved in the first quarter of 2020. This is a result of improved efficiencies and plant utilization.
Now let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating more cash for the business. On Slide 13, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $88.7 million for the first quarter of 2021, an increase of $31.6 million compared to the same period last year or a 55.3% increase. Our first quarter 2021 capital spending was $54.7 million, $22.6 million higher than the same period last year and in line with guidance.  
Working capital of $844.2 million at March 31, 2021, declined slightly by $26.1 million from December 31, 2020. Our cash balance at March 31 of $483.7 million was $131.8 million less than our December 2020 balance, primarily due to our share repurchase program activity offset by the positive operating results.  
Turning to guidance. Slide 14 provides a high-level summary. Full year 2021 net sales are expected to be in a range of $2.63 billion and $2.655 billion, compared to prior guidance range of $2.5 billion and $2.525 billion. This guidance includes estimated net COVID incremental revenues of approximately $345 million. There is an estimated benefit of $75 million based on current foreign exchange rates. We expect organic sales growth to be approximately 19% to 20%.  
We expect our full year 2021 adjusted diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $6.95 to $7.10 compared to a prior range of $6 to $6.15. We continue to expand our HVP manufacturing capacity at our existing sites to meet anticipated core growth and COVID vaccine demand. We are keeping our CapEx guidance at $230 million to $240 million, but continue to evaluate the levels needed to support our continued growth.  
There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our guidance. Estimated FX benefit on EPS has an impact of approximately $0.23 based on current foreign currency exchange rates. And our guidance excludes future tax benefits from stock-based compensation. So to summarize the key takeaways for the first quarter, strong top line growth in proprietary, gross profit margin improvement, growth in operating profit margin, growth in adjusted diluted EPS and growth in operating and free cash flow, delivering in line with our pillars of execute, innovate and grow.  
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Eric."

In this dynamic changing environment, we remain committed to our customers and the patients we serve together. Our focus remains within the strategic pillars, which allow us to be more responsive, leverage our assets more effectively and support the trends that are happening in the industry today. We're working from a position of strength, and we believe we have a long horizon of continued organic sales growth and margin expansion.  
Today, more than ever, we're enabling our customers' ability to support patient health, and it's not taken for granted. West products are needed by patients across the globe and in many cases, for the administration of life-saving medicines. As the market leader, we know that West will continue to play an integral role with our customers as they develop and bring new medicines to market for a brighter future. Stephanie, we're ready to take questions. Thank you."

The second thing I'll -- and that will evolve, Juan, over the -- if you think about over the next several quarters is there's a lot -- there's still a lot of moving parts. I think secondarily to that, we do have visibility of demand around the vaccines that's pushing into the 2022 time line. So we feel really good about where we are, but we know that we need to continue to see -- pivot, if necessary, as the number of doses per unit changes because it will require a slightly different product configuration."

We tried to highlight that we're excited and encouraged by the uptake of the higher end of that range, and as you know, has a more attractive economic profile for West. 
And not to say it has a phenomenal performance for our customers from a value proposition. But we're seeing over -- about over 2/3 of our growth coming in the high end of our HVP. And so if you can kind of think about -- do the math from there, you get to that number you referenced of 30%. It's a very, very strong growth.

But you're getting north of 50% on the margins now. 
And it -- as we progress based on the investments that we've made and the growth that we see that, that should continue. This all feeds into the long-term construct that we've rolled out there.

Starting on Slide 5, I am pleased to report that we delivered another solid quarter of growth. This was driven by strong organic sales in both our base business and the accelerating demand for products associated with COVID-19. Our high-value products, coupled with productivity gains, continue to feel expanding gross and operating margins. Together, this has resulted in significant EPS growth for the second quarter. The strong performance demonstrates the criticality of our business as the market leader in primary packaging of injectable drugs and is a testament to the foundation we have built over time with our market-led strategy, globalization of our manufacturing network and our One West team approach, which is bringing meaningful benefits to our customers to support patient health. 
We continue to manage through the challenges of the pandemic with focus on our key priorities of team member safety and ensuring uninterrupted supply of high-quality containment and delivery devices. I am proud of our team across the globe for their dedication to customers, patients and most importantly, to each other as we have met the demands of our business. Another highlight this quarter is the release of our 2020 Corporate Responsibility Report. The core values of West are well aligned with our environmental, social and governance goals with a great year of achievement and accolades. And in the future, we expect even more progress as we continue to raise our ESG expectations. I encourage you to get the report, which is on our corporate website. And as for guidance, we're well positioned with the right strategy, strong core business and the incremental pandemic opportunities. With this momentum and a strong execution by the team, we're raising our sales and EPS guidance for the full year 2021. Bernard will go into greater detail shortly. 
Turning to Slide 6. We continue to deliver the key drivers of growth in Q2 with strong customer demand of HVP components, including Westar, FluroTec, Envision and NovaPure offerings as well as Daikyo's Crystal Zenith. It is clear that our unique value propositions and technical expertise resonate with our customers. As quality requirements continue to rise, we have seen growing demand each year for our HVP products. Our industry-leading portfolio of film-coated components, Daikyo, FluroTec and NovaPure, our Safire biologic and pharma customers as an effective barrier against organic and inorganic extractables and minimizing the interaction between the drug and closure while maintaining container closure integrity. Through the first half of 2021, our participation rate in recently approved new molecular entities in the U.S. and Europe remains strong. Our components by West or our partner, Daikyo, are specked on almost all of the biologics and biosimilars approved so far in 2021 and a large majority of small molecules approved. And for the most part, these new drugs are using our highest levels of HVPs, including NovaPure, FluroTec and Westar. This has translated into robust double-digit growth for our biologics and pharma segments, both including and excluding COVID-19-related sales. Altogether, we continue to see sustainable, consistent growth and momentum in revenue growth and margin expansion and we have increased visibility into customer demand as our book of committed orders continue to significantly expand and grow, not only for the second half of this year, but also for sales into 2022 and beyond. 
Moving to Slide 7. And speaking of visibility into future demand, we continue to increase the capacity of our global manufacturing network to support our growth trajectory to keep pace with the demand increase. At the outset of the pandemic crisis, we responded by accelerating our plans to expand HVP capacity, especially for FluroTec and NovaPure components. This is above our typical annual CapEx spend of approximately 7% of sales. That first tranche of capacity expansion began in May of last year. Our teams did a fantastic job of procuring, installing and validating the equipment, and all of it is now producing commercial product at our sites in the U.S., Ireland, Germany and Singapore. In December, we began another tranche of investment based on the increased visibility of vaccine development success in our growing base business. We expect this portion to be completed and in production during the second half of this year. Of note, these capacity expansions are within existing HVP sites, and coupled with higher margins of HVP components, provide shorter paybacks and higher returns on invested capital than greenfield investments. This was made possible through the multiyear strategic transformation that our operations is currently executing, moving from a site or regional model to a global operating and supply chain network. As we discussed in the last earnings call, we have been contemplating an additional tranche as we are working with our customers to evaluate the need for even more volume production and stay ahead of both base and pandemic demand. Today, we are announcing that we have begun to execute that part, which is approximately $80 million, to support future demand of NovaPure and sealed as well as other HVP finishing capabilities. We expect to start in the second half of this year and be online towards the back half of 2022. 
Now I'll turn it over to our CFO, Bernard Birkett, who will provide more detail on our financial performance. Bernard?"

Let's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q2 2021 revenues and profits where we saw continued strong sales and EPS growth led by strong revenue performance, primarily in our biologics and pharma market",1028,"Thank you, Eric, and good morning. Let's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q2 2021 revenues and profits where we saw continued strong sales and EPS growth led by strong revenue performance, primarily in our biologics and pharma market units. I will take you through the margin growth we saw in the quarter as well as some balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we will provide an update to our 2021 guidance. 
First up, Q2. Our financial results are summarized on Slide 8, and the reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures are described in Slides 16 to 20. We recorded net sales of $723.6 million, representing organic sales growth of 30.6%. COVID net related revenues are estimated to have been approximately $117 million in the quarter. These net revenues include our assessment of components associated with vaccines, treatment and diagnosis of COVID-19 patients, offset by lower sales to customers affected by lower volumes due to the pandemic. 
Looking at Slide 9, Proprietary Products sales grew organically by 39.3% in the quarter. High-value products, which made up more than 70% of Proprietary Products sales in the quarter, grew double digits and had solid momentum across biologics and pharma market units throughout Q2. Looking at the performance of the market units, the biologics market unit delivered strong double-digit growth. We continue to work with many biotech biopharma customers who are using West and Daikyo high-value product offerings. The generics market unit experienced low single-digit growth led by sales of FluroTec components. Our pharma market units are strong double-digit growth with sales led by high-value products, including Westar and NovaPure components. And Contract Manufacturing had low single-digit organic sales growth for the second quarter, led once again by sales of diagnostic and healthcare-related injection devices. 
We continue to see improvement in gross profit. We recorded $315.1 million in gross profit, $120 million or 61.5% above Q2 of last year. And our gross profit margin of 43.5% was a 650 basis point expansion from the same period last year. We saw improvement in adjusted operating profit with $211.2 million recorded this quarter compared to $106 million in the same period last year or a 99.2% increase. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 29.2% with a 910 basis point increase from the same period last year. Finally, adjusted diluted EPS grew 97% for Q2. Excluding stock-based compensation tax benefit of $0.09 in Q2 2021 and 2020, EPS grew by approximately 104%. 
So let's review the growth drivers in both revenue and profit. On Slide 10, we show the contributions to sales growth in the quarter. Volume and mix contributed $152.2 million or 28.9 percentage points of growth, including approximately $117 million of volume driven by COVID-19-related net demand. Sales price increases contributed $9 million, a 1.7 percentage points of growth. And changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased sales by $35.2 million or an increase of 6.7 percentage points. 
Looking at margin performance. Slide 11 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 43.5% for Q2 2021, up from 37% in Q2 2020. Proprietary Products second quarter gross profit margin of 49.8% or 700 basis points above the margin achieved in the second quarter of 2020.  The key drivers for the continued improvement in Proprietary Products gross profit margin were favorable mix of products sold, driven by growth in high-value products, production efficiencies and sales price increases, partially offset by increased overhead costs inclusive of compensation. Contract manufacturing second quarter gross profit margin of 16.7% was 230 basis points below the margin achieved in the second quarter of 2020. The 2020 margin included approximately 180 to 200 basis points of positive impact from onetime benefits. 
Now let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating more cash. On Slide 12, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $233.1 million year-to-date, an increase of $27.9 million compared to the same period last year, a 13.6% increase. Operating cash flow in the period was adversely impacted by our working capital increase as well as timing of tax payments. Our 2021 year-to-date capital spending was $111.6 million, $42.4 million higher than the same period last year. Working capital of approximately $1 billion at June 30, 2021, increased by $134.1 million from December 31, 2020, primarily due to higher accounts receivable from increased sales. Our cash balance at June 30 of $576.2 million was $39.3 million less than our December 2020 balance. The decrease in cash is primarily due to our share repurchase program and higher CapEx in the period, offset by our positive operating results. 
Turning to guidance. Slide 13 provides a high-level summary. Full year 2021 net sales are expected to be in a range of $2.76 billion and $2.785 billion compared to prior guidance range of $2.63 billion to $2.655 billion. This guidance includes estimated net COVID incremental revenues of approximately $430 million. There is an estimated benefit of $80 million based on current foreign exchange rates. We expect organic sales growth to be approximately 24% to 25%. We expect our full year 2021 reported diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $8.05 to $8.20 compared to a range of $6.95 to $7.10. As we continue to expand our HVP manufacturing capacity at our existing sites to meet anticipated core growth and COVID vaccine demand, we are raising our CapEx guidance to $265 million to $275 million compared to our prior guidance of $230 million to $240 million of CapEx. There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as you review our guidance. Estimated FX benefit on EPS with an impact of approximately $0.27 based on current foreign currency exchange rates compared to a prior estimated benefit of $0.23. And our guidance excludes future tax benefits from stock-based compensation. 
So to summarize the key takeaways for the second quarter. Strong topline growth in Proprietary, gross profit margin improvement, growth in operating profit margin, growth in adjusted diluted EPS and growth in operating cash flow delivering in line with our pillars of execute, innovate and grow. 
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Eric."

So we did build up a small amount of inventory, but nothing overly material.

So you can see the momentum that is gaining. And when you think about the capital investments we're making because of the biologics growth and some of the small molecule new entrants, these tranches that we spoke of a reference, it is really -- it is all around HVP when you think about FluroTec, NovaPure in existing facilities.

It has significantly increased throughput. Additional capital has been put into Waterford. We increased the number of team members in that site significantly. So yes, these investments we're making because we really create this network around HVP in multiple sites. So we are not dependent on a site, but we've raised the volume level quite significant in Waterford. And we intend to continue to do so because it's been designed exactly what you've articulated. It's a modular approach, we can keep on adding to it the infrastructure and continue to put more volume through that. But I want to be clear, though, we still have that capability in Kinston. We're expanding Singapore. We have additional capabilities in other locations like Cobain and [indiscernible]. So it's not just one site of investment, it's multiple sites, but heavily weighted towards Waterford.  
We visited Waterford a couple of weeks ago, and it was my first time there in about 2 years, and the level of activity in that plant compared to where it was 2 years ago, it's just transformational as to what's happening there and how we've been able to leverage that. And that's really helped us in our response to COVID and also the core growth, but it's -- it does kind of highlight to us that we have to have some of this infrastructure in place before we actually believe we need it.

Starting on Slide 5, I am pleased to report that we delivered another solid quarter of growth. This was driven by strong organic sales in both our base business and the accelerating demand for products associated with COVID-19. Our high-value products, coupled with productivity gains, continue to fuel expanding gross and operating margins. Together, this has resulted in significant EPS growth for the second quarter. 
The strong performance demonstrates the criticality of our business as the market leader in primary packaging of injectable drugs and is a testament to the foundation we have built over time with our market-led strategy, globalization of our manufacturing network and our One West team approach, which is bringing meaningful benefits to our customers to support patient health.  
We continue to manage through the challenges of the pandemic with focus on our key priorities of team member safety and ensuring uninterrupted supply of high-quality containment and delivery devices. I am proud of our team across the globe for their dedication to customers, patients and most importantly, to each other as we have met the demands of our business. 
Another highlight this quarter is the release of our 2020 Corporate Responsibility Report. The core values of West are well aligned with our environmental, social and governance goals with a great year of achievement and accolades. And in the future, we expect even more progress as we continue to raise our ESG expectations. I encourage you to get the report, which is on our corporate website. 
And as for guidance, we're well positioned with the right strategy, strong core business and the incremental pandemic opportunities. With this momentum and a strong execution by the team, we're raising our sales and EPS guidance for the full year 2021. Bernard will go into greater detail shortly.  
Turning to Slide 6. We continue to deliver the key drivers of growth in Q2 with strong customer demand of HVP components, including Westar, FluroTec, Envision and NovaPure offerings as well as Daikyo's Crystal Zenith. It is clear that our unique value propositions and technical expertise resonate with our customers. As quality requirements continue to rise, we have seen growing demand each year for our HVP products. Our industry-leading portfolio of film-coated components, Daikyo, FluroTec and NovaPure are sought by our biologic and pharma customers as an effective barrier against organic and inorganic extractables and minimizing the interaction between the drug and closure while maintaining container closure integrity. 
Through the first half of 2021, our participation rate in recently approved new molecular entities in the U.S. and Europe remains strong. Our components by West or our partner, Daikyo, are specked on almost all of the biologics and biosimilars approved so far in 2021 and a large majority of small molecules approved. And for the most part, these new drugs are using our highest levels of HVPs, including NovaPure, FluroTec and Westar. This has translated into robust double-digit growth for our biologics and pharma segments, both including and excluding COVID-19-related sales. Altogether, we continue to see sustainable, consistent growth and momentum in revenue growth and margin expansion and we have increased visibility into customer demand as our book of committed orders continue to significantly expand and grow, not only for the second half of this year, but also for sales into 2022 and beyond. 
Moving to Slide 7. And speaking of visibility into future demand, we continue to increase the capacity of our global manufacturing network to support our growth trajectory to keep pace with the demand increase. At the outset of the pandemic crisis, we responded by accelerating our plans to expand HVP capacity, especially for FluroTec and NovaPure components. This is above our typical annual CapEx spend of approximately 7% of sales. That first tranche of capacity expansion began in May of last year. Our teams did a fantastic job of procuring, installing and validating the equipment, and all of it is now producing commercial product at our sites in the U.S., Ireland, Germany and Singapore. 
In December, we began another tranche of investment based on the increased visibility of vaccine development success in our growing base business. We expect this portion to be completed and in production during the second half of this year. Of note, these capacity expansions are within existing HVP sites. And coupled with higher margins of HVP components, provide shorter paybacks and higher returns on invested capital than greenfield investments. This was made possible through the multiyear strategic transformation that our operations is currently executing, moving from a site or regional model to a global operating supply chain network. 
As we discussed in the last earnings call, we have been contemplating an additional tranche as we are working with our customers to evaluate the need for even more volume production to stay ahead of both base and pandemic demand. Today, we are announcing that we have begun to execute that part, which is approximately $80 million, to support future demand of NovaPure and seals as well as other HVP finishing capabilities. We expect to start in the second half of this year and be online towards the back half of 2022.  
Now I'll turn it over to our CFO, Bernard Birkett, who will provide more detail on our financial performance. Bernard?"
313784,1674083268,2354192,"West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc., Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2021",2021-07-29,"Earnings Calls","West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Eric, and good morning. Let's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q2 2021 revenues and profits where we saw continued strong sales and EPS growth led by strong revenue performance, primarily in our biologics and pharma market",1028,"Thank you, Eric, and good morning. Let's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q2 2021 revenues and profits where we saw continued strong sales and EPS growth led by strong revenue performance, primarily in our biologics and pharma market units. I will take you through the margin growth we saw in the quarter as well as some balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we will provide an update to our 2021 guidance.  
First up, Q2. Our financial results are summarized on Slide 8, and the reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures are described in Slides 16 to 20. We recorded net sales of $723.6 million, representing organic sales growth of 30.6%. COVID net related revenues are estimated to have been approximately $117 million in the quarter. These net revenues include our assessment of components associated with vaccines, treatment and diagnosis of COVID-19 patients, offset by lower sales to customers affected by lower volumes due to the pandemic.  
Looking at Slide 9, Proprietary Products sales grew organically by 39.3% in the quarter. High-value products, which made up more than 70% of Proprietary Products sales in the quarter, grew double digits and had solid momentum across biologics and pharma market units throughout Q2. Looking at the performance of the market units, the biologics market unit delivered strong double-digit growth. We continue to work with many biotech and biopharma customers who are using West and Daikyo high-value product offerings. 
The generics market unit experienced low single-digit growth led by sales of FluroTec components. Our pharma market units saw strong double-digit growth with sales led by high-value products, including Westar and NovaPure components. And Contract Manufacturing had low single-digit organic sales growth for the second quarter, led once again by sales of diagnostic and healthcare-related injection devices.  
We continue to see improvement in gross profit. We recorded $315.1 million in gross profit, $120 million or 61.5% above Q2 of last year. And our gross profit margin of 43.5% was a 650 basis point expansion from the same period last year. 
We saw improvement in adjusted operating profit with $211.2 million recorded this quarter compared to $106 million in the same period last year or a 99.2% increase. Our adjusted operating profit margin of 29.2% was a 910 basis point increase from the same period last year. Finally, adjusted diluted EPS grew 97% for Q2. Excluding stock-based compensation tax benefit of $0.09 in Q2 2021 and 2020, EPS grew by approximately 104%.  
So let's review the growth drivers in both revenue and profit. On Slide 10, we show the contributions to sales growth in the quarter. Volume and mix contributed $152.2 million or 28.9 percentage points of growth, including approximately $117 million of volume driven by COVID-19-related net demand. Sales price increases contributed $9 million or 1.7 percentage points of growth. And changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased sales by $35.2 million or an increase of 6.7 percentage points.
Looking at margin performance. Slide 11 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 43.5% for Q2 2021, up from 37% in Q2 2020. Proprietary Products second quarter gross profit margin of 49.8% was 700 basis points above the margin achieved in the second quarter of 2020. The key drivers for the continued improvement in Proprietary Products gross profit margin were favorable mix of products sold, driven by growth in high-value products, production efficiencies and sales price increases, partially offset by increased overhead costs inclusive of compensation. 
Contract Manufacturing second quarter gross profit margin of 16.7% was 230 basis points below the margin achieved in the second quarter of 2020. The 2020 margin included approximately 180 to 200 basis points of positive impacts from onetime benefits.  
Now let's look at our balance sheet and review how we've done in terms of generating more cash. On Slide 12, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $233.1 million year-to-date, an increase of $27.9 million compared to the same period last year, a 13.6% increase. Operating cash flow in the period was adversely impacted by our working capital increase as well as timing of tax payments. 
Our 2021 year-to-date capital spending was $111.6 million, $42.4 million higher than the same period last year. Working capital of approximately $1 billion at June 30, 2021, increased by $134.1 million from December 31, 2020, primarily due to higher accounts receivable from increased sales. Our cash balance at June 30 of $576.2 million was $39.3 million less than our December 2020 balance. The decrease in cash is primarily due to our share repurchase program and higher CapEx in the period, offset by our positive operating results.  
Turning to guidance. Slide 13 provides a high-level summary. Full year 2021 net sales are expected to be in a range of $2.76 billion and $2.785 billion compared to prior guidance range of $2.63 billion to $2.655 billion. This guidance includes estimated net COVID incremental revenues of approximately $430 million. There is an estimated benefit of $80 million based on current foreign exchange rates. We expect organic sales growth to be approximately 24% to 25%. We expect our full year 2021 reported diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $8.05 to $8.20 compared to a range of $6.95 to $7.10. 
As we continue to expand our HVP manufacturing capacity at our existing sites to meet anticipated core growth and COVID vaccine demand, we are raising our CapEx guidance to $265 million to $275 million compared to our prior guidance of $230 million to $240 million of CapEx. 
There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to we review our guidance. Estimated FX benefit on EPS with an impact of approximately $0.27 based on current foreign currency exchange rates compared to a prior estimated benefit of $0.23. And our guidance excludes future tax benefits from stock-based compensation. 
So to summarize the key takeaways for the second quarter. Strong topline growth in Proprietary, gross profit margin improvement, growth in operating profit margin, growth in adjusted diluted EPS and growth in operating cash flow delivering in line with our pillars of execute, innovate and grow.  
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Eric."

So you can see the momentum that is gaining. And when you think about the capital investments we're making because of the biologics growth and some of the small molecule new entrants, these tranches that we spoke of a reference, it is really -- it is all around HVP when you think about FluroTec, NovaPure in existing facilities.

It has significantly increased throughput. Additional capital has been put into Waterford. We increased the number of team members in that site significantly. So yes, these investments we're making because we really create this network around HVP in multiple sites. So we are not dependent on a site, but we've raised the volume level quite significant in Waterford. And we intend to continue to do so because it's been designed exactly what you've articulated. It's a modular approach, we can keep on adding to it, the infrastructure and continue to put more volume through that. 
But I want to be clear, though, we still have that capability in Kinston. We're expanding Singapore. We have additional capabilities in other locations like [indiscernible] and Eschweiler. So it's not just one site of investment, it's multiple sites, but heavily weighted towards Waterford.  
We visited Waterford a couple of weeks ago, and it was my first time there in about 2 years, and the level of activity in that plant compared to where it was 2 years ago, it's just transformational as to what's happening there and how we've been able to leverage that.

We will start on Slide 5. Our team delivered an incredibly strong third quarter. Our proven market-led strategy delivered double-digit growth across all 3 market units and geographies. And excluding positive impact from sales related to the pandemic, we delivered double-digit growth in our base business with continued strong adoption of our high-value products, coupled with solid execution and leveraging our global operating model, it has led to robust margin expansion and EPS growth for the quarter.
Our Q3 performance was made possible by the commitment of the West team members across the globe. We are in the business of helping our customers bring new medicines and treatments that improve the lives of patients. I'm very proud and humble of how we live our purpose by producing billions of components and devices each quarter. And we do so with the knowledge that each and every component we make is impacting patients' life. We continue to fulfill our purpose by earning our customers' trust by leading with quality, service and science.
Looking ahead,  we are well positioned with the right growth strategy. Our committed order book remains robust. We continue to capture the benefits of the globalization of our operating network and continued capital investments to support the increasing demand, driven by the pandemic and attractive end markets. With this substantial momentum, we are raising our sales and EPS guidance for the full year 2021. And for the 29th consecutive year, we are increasing the company's dividend, Bernard will go into greater detail shortly.
Turning to Slide 6. Our key drivers of growth in Q3 are being fueled by COVID-19 customers that are used in our stoppers and seals including the highest level of NovaPure and FluroTec. Biologic customers that are shifting preference from FluroTec to our premium platform, NovaPure, to achieve the highest quality and tightest specifications for their newly approved biologic drugs. And pharma and generic customers, there are increasing orders as their demand grows for non-COVID-19 vaccines and injectable drugs. Shifting to our device portfolio and our long-standing partnership with Daikyo Saga, we continue to see adoption and uptick of customer interest for new pipeline drugs with Crystal Zenith syringes cartridges and vials. To meet this demand and stay ahead of the current growth trends for future approvals, we have continued to add manufacturing capacity for CZ.
Our teams have successfully validated additional lines for insert needle syringes and will begin producing commercial product by the end of the year. All these products as well as other HVP components are contributing to our growing book of committed orders, which position us well for the remainder of the year and into 2022 and beyond.
Moving to Slide 7. To date, we have been leveraging our global infrastructure and tapping into the agility of our own team to meet the increased customer orders. As we highlighted in Q2, several phases of investment are proceeding and now being realized. Since the onset of the pandemic, we have expanded capacity at 13 existing sites with 30 major facility modifications, dedicated over $300 million of capital and added over 400 incremental pieces of equipment, all while keeping pace with a growing base demand and moving our operations to 24/7. As our book of committed orders continues to surge, we will continue to make further strategic investments to meet demand. Today, we're announcing a fourth phase of capacity expansion that will commence in 2022. This will primarily focus on expanding NovaPure production at our HVP sites in the United States and Europe.
Shifting to the rapidly changing environment and the impact of COVID-19 on the global supply chain, no industry has been immune to this impact. We're working with our partners to help overcome challenges that span from transportation and logistics to raw materials and securing labor, all leading to cost inflation and delays. We are successfully navigating this environment, thanks in part to our unsurpassed manufacturing footprint that will continue to serve our business well as we operate through these unprecedented times.
Turning to Slide 8. I'm proud of the significant progress we have made on our ESG priorities. These have been an integral part of our One West culture and our commitment to all our stakeholders and the communities where we work and live. Over the past 6 years, we continue to raise the bar in all aspects of our ESG initiatives. And we remain on track to publish by year-end, a supplement to our 2020 corporate responsibility report incorporating the SASB and TSFD ESG standards. Now I'll turn it over to our CFO, Bernard Birkett, who will provide more detail on our financial performance. Bernard?"

Let's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q3 2021 revenues and profits where we saw continued strong sales and EPS growth led by strong revenue performance in our biologics, generics and pharma market",1055,"Thank you, Eric, and good morning. Let's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q3 2021 revenues and profits where we saw continued strong sales and EPS growth led by strong revenue performance in our biologics, generics and pharma market units. I will take you through the margin growth we saw in the quarter as well as some balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we will provide an update to our 2021 guidance.
First up, Q3. Our financial results are summarized on Slide 9 and the reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures are described on Slide 17 to 21. We recorded net sales of $706.5 million, representing organic sales growth of 27.9%. And COVID-related net revenues are estimated to have been approximately $115 million in the quarter. These net revenues include our assessment of components associated with vaccines, treatments and diagnosis of COVID-19 patients, offset by lower sales to customers affected by lower volumes due to the pandemic.
Looking at Slide 10. Proprietary Products sales grew organically by 35.7% in the quarter. High-value products, which made up approximately 73% of proprietary product sales in the quarter grew double digits and had solid momentum across all of our market units in Q3. Looking at the performance of the market units, the biologics market unit delivered strong double-digit growth. We continue to work with many biotech and biopharma customers who are using West and Daikyo high-value product offerings. The generics market unit also experienced double-digit growth led by sales of FluroTec and Westar components.
Our pharma market unit also saw strong double-digit growth with sales led by high-value products including Westar, FluroTec and NovaPure components. And Contract Manufacturing had low single-digit organic sales growth for the third quarter, led once again by sales of health care-related medical devices. We continue to see improvement in gross profit. We recorded $288.2 million in gross profit, $93.6 million or 48.1% above Q3 of last year. And our gross profit margin of [ 14.8% ] was a 530 basis point expansion from the same period last year.
We saw improvement in adjusted operating profit with $182.8 million recorded this quarter compared to $103.9 million in the same period last year for a 75.9% increase. Our adjusted operating profit margin, 25.9%, was a 690 basis point increase from the same period last year. Finally, adjusted diluted EPS grew 79% for Q3. Excluding stock-based compensation tax benefit of $0.11 in Q3, EPS grew by approximately 72%.
Let's review the growth drivers in both revenue and profit. On Slide 11, we show the contributions to sales growth in the quarter. Volume and mix contributed $142.9 million or 26.1 percentage points of growth, including approximately $83 million of incremental volume driven by COVID-19-related net demand. Sales price increases contributed $10.1 million or 1.8 percentage points of growth.
Looking at margin performance. Slide 19 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 40.8% for Q3 2021, up 35.5% in Q3 2020. Proprietary Products third quarter gross profit margin of 46.3% was 550 basis points above the margin achieved in the third quarter of 2020. The key drivers for continued improvement in Proprietary Products gross profit margin were favorable mix of products sold, driven by growth in high-value products, production efficiencies and sales price increases, partially offset by increased overhead costs, inclusive of compensation. Contract Manufacturing third quarter gross profit margin of 16.1% was 180 basis points below the margin achieved in the quarter of 2020. The decrease in margin is largely attributed to a mix of products sold as well as timing of the pass-through of raw material price increases to customers.
Now let's look at our balance sheet takeaway and review how we've done in terms of generating more cash for the business. On Slide 13, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $423.2 million for the third quarter of 2021, an increase of $99.4 million compared to the same period last year, a 30.7% increase. Operating cash flow in the period was adversely impacted by our working capital increase as well as timing of tax payments. Our third quarter 2021 year-to-date capital spending was $176.9 million, $60.2 million higher than the same period last year. Working capital of approximately $1 billion at September 30, 2021 increased by $169.4 million from December 31, 2020, primarily due to higher accounts receivable from our increased sales. Our cash balance at September 30 of $688 million was $72.5 million higher than our December 2020 balance. The increase in cash is primarily due to our strong operating results in the period, offset by our share repurchase program and higher CapEx.
Turning to guidance. Slide 4 (sic) [ Slide 14 ] provides a high-level summary. Full year 2021 net sales are expected to be in a range of $2.8 billion and $2.81 billion, compared to our prior guidance range of $2.76 billion to $2.785 billion. This guidance includes estimated net coal with incremental revenues of approximately $450 million. There is an estimated benefit of $55 million based on current foreign exchange rates compared to a prior estimated benefit of $80 million. This $25 million reduction in FX tailwind has been absorbed into our guidance.
We expect organic sales growth to be approximately 28% compared to a prior range of 24% to 25%. We expect our full year 2021 reported diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $8.40 to $8.50 compared to a prior range of $8.05 to $8.20. This revised guidance includes a $0.35 EPS positive impact of tax benefits from stock-based compensation from the first 9 months 2021. Also, our CapEx guidance remains at $265 million to $275 million for the year. There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as we review our guidance. Estimated FX benefit on EPS has an impact of approximately $0.19 based on current foreign currency exchange rates compared to a prior estimated benefit of $0.27. And our guidance excludes future tax benefits from stock-based compensation.
To summarize the key takeaways for the third quarter, strong top line growth in proprietary gross profit margin improvement, growth in operating profit margin, growth in adjusted diluted EPS and growth in operating cash flow, delivering in line with our pillars of execute, innovate and grow. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Eric."

So the short answer to your question is this is not greenfield.
A lot of the investments we're making right now are physical equipment, process expansions maybe moving some modular approach in some sites. You've been to Waterford, we will be looking at maybe expanding that site with another modular addition on the side, but it's leveraging existing facilities. When you add it all up, it really comes down to how fast we can have the equipment manufactured, delivered, installed and gone through validation since a lot of the equipment is replicating what's in place already. It's the validation process with customers is very short. So we could have some expansion proved up and running less than just in a couple of quarters.

We will start on Slide 5. Our team delivered an incredibly strong third quarter. Our proven market-led strategy delivered double-digit growth across all 3 market units and geographies. And excluding positive impact from sales related to the pandemic, we delivered double-digit growth in our base business. With continued strong adoption of our high-value products, coupled with solid execution and leveraging our global operating model, it has led to robust margin expansion and EPS growth for the quarter. 
Our Q3 performance was made possible by the commitment of the West team members across the globe. We are in the business of helping our customers bring new medicines and treatments that improve the lives of patients. I'm very proud and humble of how we live our purpose by producing billions of components and devices each quarter. And we do so with the knowledge that each and every component we make is impacting patients' life. We continue to fulfill our purpose by earning our customers' trust by leading with quality, service and science. 
Looking ahead,  we are well positioned with the right growth strategy. Our committed order book remains robust. We continue to capture the benefits of the globalization of our operating network and continued capital investments to support the increasing demand, driven by the pandemic and attractive end markets. With this substantial momentum, we are raising our sales and EPS guidance for the full year 2021. And for the 29th consecutive year, we are increasing the company's dividend. Bernard will go into greater detail shortly. 
Turning to Slide 6. Our key drivers of growth in Q3 are being fueled by COVID-19 customers that are using our stoppers and seals including the highest level of NovaPure and FluroTec. Biologic customers that are shifting preference from FluroTec to our premium platform, NovaPure, to achieve the highest quality and tightest specifications for their newly approved biologic drugs. And pharma and generic customers, there are increasing orders as their demand grows for non-COVID-19 vaccines and injectable drugs. 
Shifting to our device portfolio and our long-standing partnership with Daikyo Seiko. We continue to see adoption and uptick of customer interest for new pipeline drugs with Crystal Zenith syringes cartridges and vials. To meet this demand and stay ahead of the current growth trends for future approvals, we have continued to add manufacturing capacity for CZ. 
Our teams have successfully validated additional lines for insert needle syringes and will begin producing commercial product by the end of the year. All these products as well as other HVP components are contributing to our growing book of committed orders, which position us well for the remainder of the year and into 2022 and beyond. 
Moving to Slide 7. To date, we have been leveraging our global infrastructure and tapping into the agility of our own team to meet the increased customer orders. As we highlighted in Q2, several phases of investment are proceeding and now being realized. Since the onset of the pandemic, we have expanded capacity at 13 existing sites with 30 major facility modifications, dedicated over $300 million of capital and added over 400 incremental pieces of equipment, all while keeping pace with a growing base demand and moving our operations to 24/7. As our book of committed orders continues to surge, we will continue to make further strategic investments to meet demand. 
Today, we're announcing a fourth phase of capacity expansion that will commence in 2022. This will primarily focus on expanding NovaPure production at our HVP sites in the United States and Europe. 
Shifting to the rapidly changing environment and the impact of COVID-19 on the global supply chain, no industry has been immune to this impact. We're working with our partners to help overcome challenges that span from transportation and logistics to raw materials and securing labor, all leading to cost inflation and delays. We are successfully navigating this environment, thanks in part to our unsurpassed manufacturing footprint that will continue to serve our business well as we operate through these unprecedented times. 
Turning to Slide 8. I'm proud of the significant progress we have made on our ESG priorities. These have been an integral part of our One West culture and our commitment to all our stakeholders and the communities where we work and live. 
Over the past 6 years, we continue to raise the bar in all aspects of our ESG initiatives. And we remain on track to publish by year-end, a supplement to our 2020 corporate responsibility report incorporating the SASB and TSFD (sic) [ TFCD ] ESG standards. 
Now I'll turn it over to our CFO, Bernard Birkett, who will provide more detail on our financial performance. Bernard?"

Let's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q3 2021 revenues and profits where we saw continued strong sales and EPS growth led by strong revenue performance in our biologics, generics and pharma market",1051,"Thank you, Eric, and good morning. Let's review the numbers in more detail. We'll first look at Q3 2021 revenues and profits where we saw continued strong sales and EPS growth led by strong revenue performance in our biologics, generics and pharma market units. I will take you through the margin growth we saw in the quarter as well as some balance sheet takeaways. And finally, we will provide an update to our 2021 guidance. 
First up, Q3. Our financial results are summarized on Slide 9 and the reconciliation of non-U.S. GAAP measures are described on Slide 17 to 21. We recorded net sales of $706.5 million, representing organic sales growth of 27.9%. COVID-related net revenues are estimated to have been approximately $115 million in the quarter. These net revenues include our assessment of components associated with vaccines, treatments and diagnosis of COVID-19 patients, offset by lower sales to customers affected by lower volumes due to the pandemic. 
Looking at Slide 10. Proprietary Products sales grew organically by 35.7% in the quarter. High-value products, which made up approximately 73% of Proprietary Product sales in the quarter grew double digits and had solid momentum across all of our market units in Q3. Looking at the performance of the market units, the biologics market unit delivered strong double-digit growth. We continue to work with many biotech and biopharma customers who are using West and Daikyo high-value product offerings. The generics market unit also experienced double-digit growth led by sales of FluroTec and Westar components. 
Our pharma market unit also saw strong double-digit growth with sales led by high-value products including Westar, FluroTec and NovaPure components. And Contract Manufacturing had low single-digit organic sales growth for the third quarter, led once again by sales of health care-related medical devices. We continue to see improvement in gross profit. We recorded $288.2 million in gross profit, $93.6 million or 48.1% above Q3 of last year. And our gross profit margin of 40.8% was a 530 basis point expansion from the same period last year. 
We saw improvement in adjusted operating profit with $182.8 million recorded this quarter compared to $103.9 million in the same period last year for a 75.9% increase. Our adjusted operating profit margin, 25.9%, was a 690 basis point increase from the same period last year. Finally, adjusted diluted EPS grew 79% for Q3. Excluding stock-based compensation tax benefit of $0.11 in Q3, EPS grew by approximately 72%. 
Let's review the growth drivers in both revenue and profit. On Slide 11, we show the contributions to sales growth in the quarter. Volume and mix contributed $142.9 million or 26.1 percentage points of growth, including approximately $83 million of incremental volume driven by COVID-19-related net demand. Sales price increases contributed $10.1 million or 1.8 percentage points of growth. 
Looking at margin performance. Slide 19 shows our consolidated gross profit margin of 40.8% for Q3 2021, up 35.5% in Q3 2020. Proprietary Products third quarter gross profit margin of 46.3% was 550 basis points above the margin achieved in the third quarter of 2020. The key drivers for continued improvement in Proprietary Products gross profit margin were favorable mix of products sold, driven by growth in high-value products, production efficiencies and sales price increases, partially offset by increased overhead costs, inclusive of compensation. 
Contract Manufacturing third quarter gross profit margin of 16.1% was 180 basis points below the margin achieved in the quarter of 2020. The decrease in margin is largely attributed to a mix of products sold as well as timing of the pass-through of raw material price increases to customers. 
Now let's look at our balance sheet takeaway and review how we've done in terms of generating more cash for the business. On Slide 13, we have listed some key cash flow metrics. Operating cash flow was $423.2 million for the third quarter of 2021, an increase of $99.4 million compared to the same period last year, a 30.7% increase. Operating cash flow in the period was adversely impacted by our working capital increase as well as timing of tax payments. 
Our third quarter 2021 year-to-date capital spending was $176.9 million, $60.2 million higher than the same period last year. Working capital of approximately $1 billion at September 30, 2021 increased by $169.4 million from December 31, 2020, primarily due to higher accounts receivable from our increased sales. Our cash balance at September 30 of $688 million was $72.5 million higher than our December 2020 balance. The increase in cash is primarily due to our strong operating results in the period, offset by our share repurchase program and higher CapEx. 
Turning to guidance. Slide 4 (sic) [ Slide 14 ] provides a high-level summary. Full year 2021 net sales are expected to be in a range of $2.8 billion and $2.81 billion compared to our prior guidance range of $2.76 billion to $2.785 billion. This guidance includes estimated net COVID incremental revenues of approximately $450 million. There is an estimated benefit of $55 million based on current foreign exchange rates compared to a prior estimated benefit of $80 million. This $25 million reduction in FX tailwind has been absorbed into our guidance. 
We expect organic sales growth to be approximately 28% compared to a prior range of 24% to 25%. We expect our full year 2021 reported diluted EPS guidance to be in a range of $8.40 to $8.50 compared to a prior range of $8.05 to $8.20. This revised guidance includes a $0.35 EPS positive impact of tax benefits from stock-based compensation from the first 9 months 2021. 
Also, our CapEx guidance remains at $265 million to $275 million for the year. There are some key elements I want to bring your attention to as we review our guidance. Estimated FX benefit on EPS has an impact of approximately $0.19 based on current foreign currency exchange rates compared to a prior estimated benefit of $0.27. And our guidance excludes future tax benefits from stock-based compensation. 
To summarize the key takeaways for the third quarter, strong top line growth in Proprietary, gross profit margin improvement, growth in operating profit margin, growth in adjusted diluted EPS and growth in operating cash flow, delivering in line with our pillars of execute, innovate and grow. 
I'd now like to turn the call back over to Eric."

A lot of the investments we're making right now are physical equipment, process expansions maybe moving some modular approach in some sites. You've been to Waterford, we will be looking at maybe expanding that site with another modular addition on the side, but it's leveraging existing facilities. 
When you add it all up, it really comes down to how fast we can have the equipment manufactured, delivered, installed and gone through validation. Since a lot of the equipment is replicating what's in place already, it's -- the validation process with customers is very short.

So if you think about the device portfolio, let's just call it roughly 5% of West on the proprietary side. So 5% of the business. CZ is the largest portion of that. And what we're seeing is -- the reality is we're continuously optimizing the product and coming out with new line extensions. However, it's taken a while to  seed the market and gain confidence and traction. But once it starts becoming quite common use for the high-end biologics, we're seeing that acceleration. 
So we -- in particular, with the insert needle syringes that we have been producing in Arizona, we're actually at the stage of doubling capacity by the end of this year, and that's what was referenced. So when you think about the growth, which is above the company average, significantly above the company average. We do see through the number of approvals of drugs in the market, plus what's in the pipeline that's being reviewed as we speak, that this is an exciting area. 
But it has taken time. You're right, Dave. It's been -- this has been discussed for a number of years, but now it's becoming more noticeable in our growth numbers, particularly on devices."

I know earlier, we just briefly mentioned a new digital tool. And that actually was Delta Cube that was actually derived from conversations with our customers, would it be great if we could do this. So stay tuned on that question. We're constantly developing. And -- but be assured, though, they will be products that are being pulled by our customers today."

Last question for me is around capital deployment. You talked at times about being interested in acquisitions. I can imagine that maybe finding what you wanted at attractive prices might be a little hard in this market, raise the dividend, but not by much.
