To start, I'd like to take a moment to thank all of our employees and partners for their dedication and professionalism throughout 2020 and continuing to serve over 36 million consumers. I'd also like to briefly touch upon the extreme weather events that transpired last week. Our thoughts are with all those who have been impacted and the Oncor employees who are tirelessly working to maintain the integrity of the grid in Texas. 
We've often discussed our investment strategy and how it's focused on building 21st century energy networks or transmission and distribution investments that are essential to modern life, and the past year really highlights the importance of those essential services and why new investments will be needed to keep the grid growing and improving its resiliency. I'm pleased to report that in 2020, we also delivered strong financial and operating performance, creating positive momentum heading into 2021 as we build on our mission to be North America's premier energy infrastructure company. 
Turning to the financial results. Earlier this morning, we reported full year 2020 adjusted earnings of $8.03 per share, the highest in our company's history. We also exceeded our previously increased 2020 adjusted EPS guidance range, which reflects our firm resolve to always try to meet or exceed our commitments. In line with this positive momentum, we're reaffirming our 2021 EPS guidance range. I'd also like to mention that this guidance range excludes the impacts of the proposed IEnova exchange offer and the sale of a noncontrolling interest in Sempra Infrastructure Partners. 
Additionally, for the 11th consecutive year, we're raising our dividend. Our Board of Directors approved an increase to our annualized dividend to $4.40 per share from $4.18 per share. While future dividends are at the discretion of the Board, we plan to target a 50% to 60% dividend payout ratio. This demonstrates our commitment to generating value for our shareholders by continuing to grow the dividend while also reinvesting in the future growth of the business. 
Now please turn to the next slide, where I'll highlight some of our more notable accomplishments for the year. Our strong performance is attributable to our strategic focus on value creation, a track record of disciplined execution and operational excellence. We're proud of our many accomplishments in 2020. We continue to advance our capital plan with approximately $7 billion spent in 2020, which continues to be anchored around safety and reliability investments at our U.S. utilities. We also completed the sale of our South American businesses in June amidst the backdrop of a global pandemic and international travel restrictions. This was a terrific accomplishment and a credit to our talented team and marks the full completion of our multiyear strategic capital rotation program, which has allowed us to successfully reposition our business in what we believe to be the most attractive markets in North America. 
In line with our consistent focus on creating value for our shareholders, in December, we announced a series of integrated transactions intended to simplify our energy infrastructure businesses under 1 growth platform. This platform is also intended to create scale and strategic alignment while unlocking value by selling a noncontrolling interest to a strategic partner. Trevor will provide an update on the progress later on in the presentation. 
Financially, we've achieved strong results, raising our 2020 adjusted EPS guidance range last June and today, significantly exceeding that increased range. Additionally, we made great progress on our 5-year capital plan while also executing a $500 million share buyback program. Fundamentally, across our U.S. utilities and infrastructure platforms, we remain focused on investing and growing our businesses. And to a point that I've made previously, we're allocating capital into a lower-risk portion of the energy value chain in what we believe are the most attractive markets in North America. That really is the centerpiece of our strategy and is reflected in the strength of today's results. 
Please turn to the next slide. Our 2020 accomplishments are a testament to the remarkable growth we're continuing to see at our utilities. Our 2020 financial results were underpinned by strong performance grounded in safety and reliability. We also ended the period with approximately $37 billion of total combined rate base, of which nearly 74% is from electric T&D investments. So the key takeaway here is our 2-year capital rotation program was specifically designed to build out this position as a leader in our North American energy networks in order to improve the strength and consistency of our financial results, which has clearly been demonstrated over the last several years. 
Looking to the future, we believe our utilities platform will benefit from growth opportunities associated with serving the largest consumer base in the United States and operating in markets with the highest concentration of manufacturing and industrial production that, in combination, make up nearly 1/4 of the total GDP of the United States. 
In addition to growth, I also want to mention several other competitive advantages that allow our utilities to be successful in a variety of market conditions, such as decoupled revenues in California, constructive authorized ROEs averaging just over 10% and constructive regulatory environments that support serving growth and investing to meet bold sustainability goals that further our efforts to decarbonize energy and also improve the safety and reliability of our system. 
As an example, our California utilities have over 10 hydrogen research and development projects. We expect to showcase as well as other innovations that we have underway at our Investor Day later this spring. Now please turn to the next slide, where I'll turn the call over to Trevor to provide both business and financial updates."
120622,703353195,2223682,"Sempra Energy, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2021",2021-02-25,"Earnings Calls","Sempra","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. We've made substantial progress on the announced Sempra Infrastructure Partners integrated transactions since our last business update call in December.

We've made substantial progress on the announced Sempra Infrastructure Partners integrated transactions since our last business update call in December. As these transactions continue to advance, we wanted to reemphasize our key objectives and expectations. By simplifying the ownership structure of Sempra LNG and IEnova under Sempra Infrastructure Partners, we believe this new streamlined platform will offer scale benefits and portfolio synergies as we continue to grow the business by advancing investments in cross-border renewable opportunities, large-scale integrated LNG projects and other investments in energy networks. Overall, it's our expectation that these integrated transactions will simplify our business model, strengthen our balance sheet and highlight significant value in the underlying businesses. 
Please turn to the next slide, and I'll review the expected timing of this process. We continue to make good progress and I'd like to highlight that we plan to complete the exchange offer and announce the sale of the noncontrolling interest by the end of the second quarter. While timing is important, getting to the right partner and the right value is what is driving this great initiative. Additionally, I want to emphasize that while these 2 integrated time lines are part of our overall execution plan, the exchange offer and the sale of the noncontrolling interests are advancing independently and are not contingent upon the other's timing. 
Please turn to the next slide. We've had several positive developments this past quarter at our U.S. utilities and infrastructure businesses. At our U.S. utilities, we executed record capital investments in 2020 of nearly $6 billion, continuing our focus on grid modernization. At SoCalGas, we're proud that we achieved approximately 20% methane reductions below 2015 levels, which is 5 years earlier than mandated. 
Moving to Oncor. We continue to see strong growth throughout the service territory. In the fourth quarter alone, Oncor connected approximately 18,000 new premises, which brought the full year total to approximately 77,000. This is a 20% increase compared to 2019 connections, which is an amazing figure and reflects the best organic growth rate Oncor has ever experienced. This is particularly noteworthy considering the backdrop of the global pandemic. 
On the transmission side, Oncor set a record for interconnection requests in 2020, driven by continued strong development activity in utility-scale generation with a focus on the renewable and battery storage markets in their service territory. Also, Oncor completed 6 major transmission projects in West Texas, totaling approximately 260 circuit miles and approximately $300 million of investment. 
Shifting to our infrastructure businesses. ECA LNG Phase 1 reached final investment decision this past November, and we subsequently provided TechnipFMC with full notice to proceed under the EPC contract. The total expected capital investment is approximately $2 billion, which includes an equity contribution of approximately $250 million each from Sempra LNG and IEnova. And in December, an affiliate of Total took a 16.6% equity stake in the project. 
Shifting to Mexico. We continue to advance our pipeline of construction projects focused on improving the country's energy security. The Don Diego solar project reached commercial operations and recently, IEnova announced an agreement to acquire the remaining interest in ESJ. Additionally, last week, IEnova's CEO, Tony Ortiz, and Energy Minister Rocio Nahle, commissioned the Veracruz Refined Product Storage Terminal. As a reminder, the Veracruz Marine Terminal is situated in the largest Mexican port on the Gulf Coast and is expected to be one of the largest fuel terminals in the country, with the capacity to serve 2.1 million barrels of refined product. 
Please turn to the next slide, where I'll review our financial results. Earlier this morning, we reported fourth quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $414 million or $1.43 per share. This compares to fourth quarter 2019 GAAP earnings of $447 million or $1.55 per share. On an adjusted basis, fourth quarter 2020 earnings were $553 million or $1.90 per share. This compares to our fourth quarter 2019 earnings of $447 million or $1.55 per share. 
Full year 2020 GAAP earnings were $3,764,000,000 or $12.88 per share. This compares to 2019 GAAP earnings of $2,055,000,000 or $7.29 per share. On an adjusted basis, full year 2020 earnings were $2,350,000,000 or $8.03 per share. This compares favorably to our previous full year 2019 adjusted earnings of $1,911,000,000 or $6.78 per share. 
Please turn to the next slide. The variance in the full year 2020 adjusted earnings compared to last year was affected by the following key items: $146 million of lower earnings due to the sale of our Peruvian and Chilean businesses in April and June of 2020, respectively. This was offset by $284 million of higher equity earnings from Cameron LNG JV, primarily due to phase 1 commencing full commercial operations; $81 million of higher earnings at the California utilities from higher FERC and CPUC base operating margins; $63 million of lower losses at parent and other due to lower net interest expense and higher income tax benefits; $57 million of higher earnings at the California utilities from the release of a regulatory liability in 2020 associated with an income tax expense memorandum account that track differences between actual and forecasted estimates from 2016 to 2018, partially offset by income tax benefits in 2019 from the release of a regulatory liability established in connection with 2017 tax reform for the excess deferred income tax balances that the CPUC directed to be allocated to shareholders in a January 2019 decision; $51 million of higher equity earnings at Sempra Texas utilities, primarily due to increased revenues from rate updates to reflect invested capital and Oncor's acquisition of InfraREIT in May 2019; and $41 million of higher earnings from Sempra LNG's marketing operations, primarily driven by changes in natural gas prices. 
Lastly, I'd like to highlight that we're making a few changes regarding our financial guidance going forward in 2021 and beyond. We're continuing to work on ways to provide you a cleaner and clearer view of our operational performance and financial results. And after various discussions with a number of our investors and sell-side analysts, starting in the first quarter of 2021, we will be adjusting out foreign currency and inflation effects as well as unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses. This change is incorporated into our reaffirmed 2021 guidance range. Reporting our earnings with these items adjusted out allows for greater focus on earnings from ongoing business activities, and we appreciate all the input we received on this change of convention. 
Please turn to the next slide. Over the last 3 years, we've successfully narrowed our investment focus to T&D investments in what we believe are the most attractive markets in North America. And those of you who have followed us over the last 3 years have seen the difference this has made. Since 2017, we've transacted on approximately $27 billion in enterprise value while still growing our adjusted EPS annually by approximately 14%. Not only has our adjusted EPS growth been exceptional but the overall adjusted earnings quality has substantially increased, providing greater visibility into future cash flows. We're proud of where our business stands today and believe we're well positioned to continue providing strong financial results. 
With that, please turn to the next slide, where I will review our new 5-year capital plan. Last year, we laid out our record 5-year capital plan of $32 billion. And when rolling our plan forward this year, we continue to see robust opportunities to invest in our U.S. utilities and infrastructure businesses. In 2021 to 2025, the capital plan is anchored by $29 billion of U.S. utility investments, which represents over 90% of our total capital plan and is the largest utility program in the company's history. 
For SDG&E and SoCalGas, safety and reliability continue to be at the forefront of our capital plan. We're making investments at both utilities to enhance our pipeline infrastructure through our risk assessment mitigation phase and risk spending accountability reporting. At SDG&E, we continue to advance our industry-leading wildfire mitigation program by investing in innovative and cutting-edge technologies to keep our communities safe. And at SoCalGas, we're making strides toward achieving our greenhouse gas emissions reductions and executing on a strategy to achieve at least 40% reduction in methane emissions by 2030. 
Additionally, at Oncor, the capital plan is attributable to tremendous organic growth that we're seeing. On the distribution side, Dallas-Fort Worth is the fastest-growing metropolitan area in the fastest-growing state in the country. This is coupled with continued investments on the transmission side, resulting from the increase in wind and solar generation as well as battery storage being interconnected into the ERCOT system. When compared to Sempra's capital plan we shared with you last spring, we've identified an increase of roughly $1.1 billion of incremental utility CapEx in 2021 and 2022 combined. 
Lastly, we plan to fund our robust capital plan with cash flows from operations as well as using some of the cash proceeds received from the proposed sale of a noncontrolling interest in Sempra Infrastructure Partners and other available sources. As we've historically done, we'll continue to be disciplined and evaluate all available financing sources based on the timing of our investments and what we believe is the most efficient for our shareholders. 
Please turn to the next slide, where I will review rate base projections. Our continued investment in safety and reliability provides strong projected rate base growth of approximately 9% annually from 2020 to 2025. By 2025, our combined total rate base is projected to be approximately $56 billion. Notably, over that period, our rate base mix does not change materially, with approximately 70% of total rate base from electric infrastructure, which reflects how well positioned we are to continue supporting strong trends in electrification. Please turn to the next slide, where I will hand the call back over to Jeff to review our priorities for 2021."

As we turn our attention to the rest of 2021, we plan to continue our positive momentum. We've identified several priorities to capitalize on the critical role that energy infrastructure is providing in support of the energy transition. Our priorities include, among others: executing health and safety programs to help mitigate COVID-19 risk for our employees; maintaining a focus on safety and operational excellence across all of our companies; continue to execute on utility-centered capital plan; delivering strong financial results and completing the Sempra Infrastructure Partners' integrated set of transactions. I look forward to sharing more about how we're delivering on a sustainable future for all of our stakeholders at our Investor Day later this year. 
Please turn to the next slide. And finally, let me summarize for you our investment proposition, which we believe is differential to others in our industry and offers compelling value both in the near and long term. We're building a top-tier T&D infrastructure platform that is well positioned to succeed in attractive markets; continuing to execute a robust capital plan with significant expected growth in rate base; growing our EPS and improving our earnings visibility; maintain an attractive and growing dividend and remaining committed to innovation, sustainability and leadership. 
Please turn to the final slide. In summary, 2020 was a record year for our company. Against the challenging economic and operating backdrop, we deployed a record amount of capital and produced the best financial results in our company's history, topping the prior year's record of adjusted earnings results by over $400 million. We look forward to continuing to execute on our value proposition in 2021 and remain committed to creating long-term shareholder value. And with that, this concludes our prepared remarks and we'll stop to take your questions. Before opening the call to questions, however, I'd like to remind you that we will not be discussing the exchange offer."

In terms of use of proceeds, you obviously have an opportunity to reinvest for the buyback and delever. Any sort of priorities here? And how much do you sort of envision could be recycled at the utilities just from an equity standpoint? And how should we sort of be thinking about potential limits with efficient redeployment of the proceeds in the near term?"

And I think the way we think about it is, we've gone through, in our prepared remarks, kind of what we think the critical success factors are for the transaction. And obviously, one of the things we've identified in that order of criteria is to create an accretive transaction. 
So when you think about the use of proceeds, what I try to describe people is it's essentially dependent upon 3 factors: number one, how well you successfully execute the tender offer; number two, how well you execute the sell-down process, and that includes both the overall quantity of equity sold and the implied valuation; and to the point that you're getting to, the third part of that is a transaction, so to speak, is the use of proceeds. 
And one of the things we noted on the call is that you've seen not only the same $32 billion capital program roll forward, but you're also seeing a higher portion of capital in the 5-year plan allocated toward the utility. So last year's plan was roughly 85% to 86% utility spending over the 5 years. This year's plan's closer to 90%. And we did highlight for you that we think there's at least $1.1 billion of incremental CapEx just in our California utilities in the next 2 years. And you've seen us raise the CapEx for Oncor by another $300 million over the 5-year time frame. 
So we're going to look at both debt reduction. We're going to look at opportunities to fund additional utility CapEx. We will always test that against share repurchases. And there are scenarios where you could see us take in in-kind investments from investors, although it's probably a lower likelihood. So what we're going to try to do is manage all 3 of those things, the tender process, the equity sell-down and then efficient use of proceeds in a way that delivers all the critical success factors that we identified in our prepared remarks."

I think both of those points are accurate.

And we really wanted to focus on North America and sell noncore assets, make sure we're in the right markets. 
And I will tell you, if anything, about last week in Texas and some of the challenges you're seeing in your industry, if it points to anything, it's really the value of investing in the grid. And as you recall from some of our prior conversations, we have specifically avoided the generation marketplace. We've avoided being exposed to commodities, and that's why being in a decoupled marketplace like California is so important. 
So you've seen, over the last 3 years, us be able to grow our EPS at about a 14% CAGR. And as we think about 2021, I would probably go back and just mention to you that, think about how we did our guidance last year. I think it was on this call that we talked about our guidance last year, and some people were a little bit disappointed in the Q4 call of the 2020 guidance. And you'll recall, Shar, it was on the Q1 call that we guided to the high end of the range. And later in Q2, we went ahead and revised our guidance upward to $7.20 to $7.80. In the Q3 call last year in November, we guided to the high end of the range. 
And think about what we've done, right? During a pandemic, probably the worst economic downturn in the history of our country. Sempra Energy has produced record EPS. We've produced record earnings and all 5 business units, for the first time in the history of this company, each 1 of them produced record earnings results. So as we go into 2021, you should expect us to basically continue to look at getting the SIP transaction done, get further along in execution of our capital programs, specifically in our utilities and come back to you with a view toward trying to always under-promise and over-deliver."

Well, look, I would start to see by saying I think the events of last week, which were in the Midwest obviously, in Texas and obviously Northern Mexico as well, they also impacted California which we're also comfortable talking about, if you like to go into that. But it was the most important event in the energy markets globally last week. 
And we've always started by thanking our employees for their hard work in the Dallas community and across North Texas. And certainly, there's been a lot of people have been hurt by this and our hearts go out to all those folks. But as for Oncor, you'll recall that their job is really as the grid operator is to execute the commands of ERCOT in terms of load shedding just to make sure there wasn't a complete failure of the grid. And I think one of the things that's taking place in Austin today is we're going through legislative hearings. Our CEO, Allen Nye, is going to also testify at those hearings. 
But I think the most important thing is Oncor stood tall during last week's event. I think they were one of the more positive participants in the overall marketplace. That's also a view shared by the governor, by the way. I think what's important as we think about future reforms is I just want to be a little bit cautious, Steve, that we don't front-run the activities that are underway today at the state. There's going to be a full-scale investigation. The Railroad Commission will be involved, the PUCT, the governor's office and the PUCT, obviously, but -- and all the interveners in the marketplace. 
So I think what will happen from this is, you'll probably find opportunities for the state to improve its resiliency. There's also a lot of generation, as we've talked about on prior calls. It's in the interconnection queue. And we certainly expect that, that will lead to additional investments in the T&D space. Look, I don't want to start talking about capital at this point. I just think that as you think about building that marketplace, which has the strongest economy, at least the growth economy in the country, we don't think they're going to be spending less capital. We think that spending more capital will certainly be part of the solution."

You'll recall that Texas took up most of the new cycle but they had a DC time, the Midwest that went down. Obviously, there were impacts all the way across into Louisiana, which had some temporary disruptions to our Cameron facility. Cameron's online and operating well. 
You'll also recall, at 1 point in time, the governor issued an order that natural gas in Texas had to stay in Texas to meet electric generation needs first before being exported. That obviously has impacts to Mexico. Mexico had rolling blackouts in 4 or 5 of its northern states. So we were working very closely with Tanya, and you'll recall that we've got 7 pipelines where we've moved gas across the U.S.-Mexico exchange. And she was being quite helpful to Texas to make sure that people were not unnecessarily scheduling gas across that interchange, but she was also working very closely with CFE. 
So you think about our LNG facility in Baja, which is a giant storage facility, it was critical in that process of serving the needs of Northern Mexico and Southern California. And again, the state of California called on our storage network at SoCalGas, which is a very critical piece of infrastructure here in the state. And what people sometimes forget, Steve, is that California sits at the western end of the pipeline system. We don't have much, if any, indigenous production of natural gas in the state, so we're very reliant on events outside the state, like you saw last summer, for us to import power from neighboring states, but also to import gas, particularly here in the wintertime. 
So it was a system-wide event in the Western United States. And I think what we feel great about is, and we've really been hitting this pretty hard with our investment community, Steve, is we are the picks and shovels to the gold rush, right? We're the company that's investing in grids, we're investing in storage and we're a big part of the solution today. I think if you look at where the market is going, I think we've got the wind behind ourselves in terms of our investment thesis. And we should expect to see continued strong capital spending across our enterprise."

I would tell you that we certainly think that the theme of electrification is a hard secular trend. And I think if you think back to the Oncor acquisition in March of 2018, it was really premised on that expectation",535,"Yes. Thanks, Michael, for the question. I would tell you that we certainly think that the theme of electrification is a hard secular trend. And I think if you think back to the Oncor acquisition in March of 2018, it was really premised on that expectation that, that trend would continue. So as you see us lay out today, we've currently got 74% of our U.S. utility rate base is exposed to that dominant trend. 
But I would go back to a point I was making with Steve Fleishman, too, which is there is really an untold story of the criticality of natural gas to support the energy transition. So Michael, 80% of the world's energy emissions today related to carbon come from oil and coal. And by the middle of next decade, the most dominant fuel in the world will be natural gas. In fact, Royal Dutch Shell came out just yesterday and forecasted that the LNG trade would double by 2040. So there is a strong recognition that the 1 country in the world that's got it right and has reduced emissions the most has been the United States. So for the last 2 decades, we've led the world in emissions reductions: number one, by committing to renewable capacity; and number two, making sure that we fuel switch from coal to natural gas. 
So when you come back to California, clearly, Michael, we had blackouts last summer, and that was because we were over-reliant on imports. I think there's a recognition that natural gas is the natural partner to renewables. So I think we're going to have headwinds. We've got to tell a better story. The most important thing we can do, and Trevor talked about this is, we have to make sure that natural gas plays the appropriate role. But it's incumbent upon us as a company to limit future emissions around methane. And that is very critical all across this country that we're on top of that. I expect to see the Biden administration likewise continue to regulate that area. 
But longer term, natural gas, which we think over time will be replaced by hydrogen and green molecules, that will be the best way to get after heavy-duty transportation and the industrial side of the equation. So electrification can take you so far but it will be moving from natural gas to hydrogen, we believe, and the green molecules that will support what we need to do to reduce emissions, both in industry and transportation. 
So I think you're going to continue to see the type of rate base growth that you see in front of our utilities. And I will remind you and when we got our rate case at SoCalGas, it basically approved a record capital expenditures. Because as you go forward in time, Michael, you've got to make sure that you maintain the reliability of that system but also that it maintains it in a safe way. So we're going to definitely grow our electric side of our portfolio. And as you can see by the middle of this decade, we expect to have $55 billion in rate base across those 3 utilities. We're very excited about it."

There's some interesting legislation that's been batted around there regarding reforms to the power sector.

Or can your team talk about that, whether they think that legislation actually happens and gets done and what the ramification would be for IEnova?"

I think what the administration is looking to do is they proposed a set of reforms for the power industry. And there's a complex set of things that are embedded in the proposed law, but the 1 that's probably received the most press cover",534,"Sure, no problem. I think what the administration is looking to do is they proposed a set of reforms for the power industry. And there's a complex set of things that are embedded in the proposed law, but the 1 that's probably received the most press coverage is the attempt to really reorder the dispatch curve. So as you know, typically, market by market in the United States, lowest-cost generation dispatches first and particularly plants that have no or 0 fuel costs like nuclear or renewables. 
I think with the downturn in the global economy, you got to remember that Mexico is a member of OPEC Plus so they're a participant in the oil marketplace. And they have a little bit higher sulfur content in their fuel oil. So this is an opportunity for them to use more of their natural resources in power production. And what they're really trying to do is privilege in that dispatch curve that CFE's oil-fired plants with dispatch first. 
And the 1 that impacts the most are the IPP market participants that are actually using oil or natural gas in a competitive format. We're not in that business line. The only electric generation plant we have is connected to California. In fact, it's not even connected to the CFE grid and that provides support here in Southern California. It does impact our renewable portfolio. But keep in mind, they're net short in electricity so renewables will always dispatch. And this, I think our renewable business represents about 10% to 15% of the EBITDA in IEnova, and IEnova represents roughly 10% of the overall earnings of Sempra. But we think it's a manageable situation. 
And I would also conclude on 1 thing, which is if the law is passed, and it clears the Senate chambers in the next 2 or 3 weeks, it's got 3 fatal flaws: number one, under the Mexican constitution, there's an implied covenant of fair dealings and open competition. So there will be constitutional challenges to the law; number two, under the USMCA agreement, there's also a requirement that governmental entities will not be privileged over state-owned entities; and then secondly -- I mean, thirdly, we also have arguments that you can't pass a law like that and then retroactively apply it to marketplace where you've got agreement. 
So we have tried not to be in the middle of that site, Mike. I think we've really set a course in Mexico to be an active participant in helping Lopez and his administration be successful. That's one of the reasons I think it was important that Trevor said in his prepared remarks that the Minister of [indiscernible] joined us last week at the Veracruz Terminal. We also have senior officials joining us at other development projects. 
So our goal is to help Mexico be successful. They need more foreign direct investment. They have a deficit in their infrastructure. And this administration, fortunately, has been very committed to fiscal discipline. So I think our job is to make sure that we're working in partnership with the government to advance the government's goals. And it will be interesting to see how the legislation you referred to plays out."

And we're pleased to be able to come forward today and mentioned the fact that even on our slides, just in 2 businesses, we've identified incremental CapEx of $1.1 billion at SDG&E and SoCalGas over the balance of this year and next year.

So you saw some of the challenges we had in California last summer. Obviously, the challenge is that people in Texas surprised a lot of people last week. I think what we really want to do is make sure that people understand the importance of gas storage. 
So Texas has a lot of geology that supports natural gas storage. One of the things, Stephen that you've seen, particularly on the East Coast and the Northeast, as you've covered utilities, is the important sometimes of having liquid fuel on site. So peak shaving LNG is quite common on the East Coast. I think there's over 50 facilities. So as you think about future solutions for the state of Texas, I think part of it is to make sure that they've got a balanced energy strategy to continue to make investments in green energy, that will require future investments in transmission, but also making sure that not only are there existing natural gas and coal plants properly weatherized, and that includes a nuclear plant that went down last week, too, South Texas power. 
It also means making sure that you have reliability. And there's this old saying from someone who is an old-timer, who one time pointed to a cold stack outside a power plant and said, ""That's what reliability looks like."" I'm certainly not an advocate for coal. But I do think that by privileging natural gas storage and the geology that Texas has and looking at ideas either around electric storage or particularly LNG peak shading, one of the things you should expect to do is make sure that they've got the appropriate reserve margin and they've got fuel that is available and callable to meet the needs of the state during events like they had last week."

And one of the key issues is the most important thing is we march toward more renewables, green molecules like we talked about before and hydrogen is a significant expansion of our energy network. 
So the biggest issue, and there's different studies out there, there's a principal study and other studies. Some of them even have the electric grid increasing by 5x by 2050. So it doesn't matter what market you're in. This idea of electrification being a hard trend and the idea that distribution and transmission networks need to be expanded is really, really important. And I think we're as well positioned as anyone, given our footprint in Texas and California. But maybe, Don, if you won't mind talking about your thoughts on Texas.

So there's certainly a lot of opportunity for additional transmission and generation interconnection that's going to come out of that as that continues to develop. 
And then when you look at just West Texas alone, 40% of the Delaware Basin, the oil and gas facilities, 40% of the oil and gas facilities out there are on self-generation, waiting to be hooked up to the grid. So we're still catching up out there. And the big loops like the Culberson Loop out there continues to set peaks every year. So there's still a lot of demand out in that area, and we'll continue to build generation out there for the oil and gas as well as the renewables and the storage."

But when I was at SDG&E, I remember looking at some of the old strategy books from 1987 and 1990, and there was an embodying focus on making sure that bills did not get too high. This is something that we've been very focused on over multiple decades to make sure that the value of what we're providing is consistent with the value of what they're receiving. 
And I will tell you we have relatively high rates in California. We expect those rates to go higher because of the needed capital spending. But what's most important, and people miss this sometimes, is our bills are well below the national average. That's largely because you have very moderate weather here. So many parts of the year, many parts of San Diego don't even have air conditioning. 
So because of the moderate weather, because of the commitment to energy efficiency across the state, you're incentivizing customers to use less. And as you do that, the per-unit cost of electricity goes up, right? So rates probably continue to go up. We try to do everything possible to make sure that we meet those needs with energy efficiency and come up with programs to help people save on their bills. But right now, the annual bill is below average for the United States."

And we tend to focus on businesses that have substantially similar cost of capital and a model that provides substantially similar risk-adjusted cash flows. I think we've been successful in doing that. 
And if you've covered the industry for the last couple of decades, you've seen people move into unregulated businesses and out of it. But the common denominator for people who have moved out of unregulated businesses, they've either had challenges growing those businesses in a way or they've got a stride or a stray on the issue of having a substantially similar cost of capital. 
And I think what you're seeing us do is, we've made a very clear statement. We're going to be what we think is one of the most important owners of energy networks, specifically utility networks in the country. And we're going to be as well positioned as any other provider to take advantage of what we think is important trends around electrification. 
And what you're seeing us do with Sempra Infrastructure Partners is make sure that we source the lowest cost of capital to ensure that, that business can self-fund. And with self-fund, it really unlocks Sempra's balance sheet to continue to fund our priority, which is building out this network platform that we have in California and Texas. So as you see people who cannot grow outside the utility, they may hang a label of simplification on top of it. But you have to look back at how those changes in strategy has been helpful and not helpful to investors. I'm very deferential to how other companies run it, but at our company, as long as we have an opportunity to add more value for our investors, I think it's something we want to continue to do. 
And I'll actually add something which I've been really intrigued by. When you look back over the last 12 months, you think about the fact that our stock is trading at about $160 on [ February 19 ] of last year and ask ourselves, have we added value to overall franchise, specifically including some of the diversified investments that you're referring to, we've been able to bring 2 trains at Cameron online. It's transformed our LNG business and led to record earnings last year. We were able to sell both of our utilities in South America and derisked our business model and bring back $5.8 billion of pretax proceeds. 
We've been able to improve our credit metrics. Trevor talked about this and strengthened our balance sheet. We finished the year, we had a target of 16% FFO to debt and we finished with 17% and we're below a 50% threshold in debt to cap. We had record capital investments last year across both business lines, utilities and non-utilities of $7 billion. We raised guidance and exceeded guidance. We secured a 10.6% ROE at FERC on SDG&E's transmission assets. We bought back $500 million of stock. We took FID, the only FID in the world around LNG last year and we announced this 2-part SIP transaction. 
So what you should expect us to do is be very active about derisking the model, always challenging ourselves about whether our unregulated businesses fit in our portfolio. And actually, this underpins our transaction of finding a co-investor that has a shared vision for that business, at the same time that we unlock Sempra's balance sheet and support our credit initiatives by ensuring that on a going-forward basis, Sempra Infrastructure Partner both has an investment-grade balance sheet and the capability to fund all of its development initiatives."

To start, I'd like to take a moment to thank all of our employees and partners for their dedication and professionalism throughout 2020 in continuing to serve over 36 million consumers. I'd also like to briefly touch upon the extreme weather events that transpired last week. Our thoughts are with all those who have been impacted and the Oncor employees who are tirelessly working to maintain the integrity of the grid in Texas. 
We've often discussed our investment strategy and how it's focused on building 21st century energy networks where transmission and distribution investments that are essential to modern life, and the past year really highlights the importance of those essential services and why new investments will be needed to keep the grid growing and improving its resiliency. I'm pleased to report that in 2020, we also delivered strong financial and operating performance, creating positive momentum heading into 2021 as we build on our mission to be North America's premier energy infrastructure company. 
Turning to the financial results. Earlier this morning, we reported full year 2020 adjusted earnings of $8.03 per share, the highest in our company's history. We also exceeded our previously increased 2020 adjusted EPS guidance range, which reflects our firm resolve to always try to meet or exceed our commitments. In line with this positive momentum, we're reaffirming our 2021 EPS guidance range. I'd also like to mention that this guidance range excludes impacts of the proposed IEnova exchange offer and the sale of a noncontrolling interest in Sempra Infrastructure Partners. 
Additionally, for the 11th consecutive year, we're raising our dividend. Our Board of Directors approved an increase to our annualized dividend to $4.40 per share from $4.18 per share. While future dividends are at the discretion of the Board, we plan to target a 50% to 60% dividend payout ratio. This demonstrates our commitment to generating value for our shareholders by continuing to grow the dividend while also reinvesting in the future growth of the business. 
Now please turn to the next slide, where I'll highlight some of our more notable accomplishments for the year. Our strong performance is attributable to our strategic focus on value creation, a track record of disciplined execution and operational excellence. We're proud of our many accomplishments in 2020. We continue to advance our capital plan with approximately $7 billion spent in 2020, which continues to be anchored around safety and reliability investments at our U.S. utilities. We also completed the sale of our South American businesses in June amidst the backdrop of a global pandemic and international travel restrictions. This was a terrific accomplishment and a credit to our talented team and marks the full completion of our multiyear strategic capital rotation program, which has allowed us to successfully reposition our business in what we believe to be the most attractive markets in North America. 
In line with our consistent focus on creating value for our shareholders, in December, we announced a series of integrated transactions intended to simplify our energy infrastructure businesses under 1 growth platform. This platform is also intended to create scale and strategic alignment while unlocking value by selling a noncontrolling interest to a strategic partner. Trevor will provide an update on the progress later on in the presentation. 
Financially, we've achieved strong results, raising our 2020 adjusted EPS guidance range last June and today, significantly exceeding that increased range. Additionally, we made great progress on our 5-year capital plan while also executing a $500 million share buyback program. Fundamentally, across our U.S. utilities and infrastructure platforms, we remain focused on investing and growing our businesses. And to a point that I've made previously, we're allocating capital into a lower-risk portion of the energy value chain in what we believe are the most attractive markets in North America. That really is the centerpiece of our strategy and is reflected in the strength of today's results. 
Please turn to the next slide. Our 2020 accomplishments are a testament to the remarkable growth we're continuing to see at our utilities. Our 2020 financial results were underpinned by strong performance grounded in safety and reliability. We also ended the period with approximately $37 billion of total combined rate base, of which nearly 74% is from electric T&D investments. So the key takeaway here is our 2-year capital rotation program was specifically designed to build out this position as a leader in our North American energy networks in order to improve the strength and consistency of our financial results, which has clearly been demonstrated over the last several years. 
Looking to the future, we believe our utilities platform will benefit from growth opportunities associated with serving the largest consumer base in the United States and operating in markets with the highest concentration of manufacturing and industrial production that, in combination, make up nearly 1/4 of the total GDP of the United States. 
In addition to growth, I also want to mention several other competitive advantages that allow our utilities to be successful in a variety of market conditions, such as decoupled revenues in California, constructive authorized ROEs averaging just over 10% and constructive regulatory environments that support serving growth and investing to meet bold sustainability goals that further our efforts to decarbonize energy and also improve the safety and reliability of our system. 
As an example, our California utilities have over 10 hydrogen research and development projects. We expect to showcase as well as other innovations that we have underway at our Investor Day later this spring. Now please turn to the next slide, where I'll turn the call over to Trevor to provide both business and financial updates."
120622,703353195,2224262,"Sempra Energy, Q4 2020 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2021",2021-02-25,"Earnings Calls","Sempra","Executives","Thanks, Jeff. We've made substantial progress on the announced Sempra Infrastructure Partners integrated transactions since our last business update call in December.

We've made substantial progress on the announced Sempra Infrastructure Partners integrated transactions since our last business update call in December. As these transactions continue to advance, we wanted to reemphasize our key objectives and expectations. By simplifying the ownership structure of Sempra LNG and IEnova under Sempra Infrastructure Partners, we believe this new streamlined platform will offer scale benefits and portfolio synergies as we continue to grow the business by advancing investments in cross-border renewable opportunities, large-scale integrated LNG projects and other investments in energy networks. Overall, it's our expectation that these integrated transactions will simplify our business model, strengthen our balance sheet and highlight significant value in the underlying businesses. 
Please turn to the next slide, and I'll review the expected timing of this process. We continue to make good progress and I'd like to highlight that we plan to complete the exchange offer and announce the sale of the noncontrolling interest by the end of the second quarter. While timing is important, getting to the right partner and the right value is what is driving this great initiative. Additionally, I want to emphasize that while these 2 integrated time lines are part of our overall execution plan, the exchange offer and the sale of the noncontrolling interests are advancing independently and are not contingent upon the other's timing. 
Please turn to the next slide. We've had several positive developments this past quarter at our U.S. utilities and infrastructure businesses. At our U.S. utilities, we executed record capital investments in 2020 of nearly $6 billion, continuing our focus on grid modernization. At SoCalGas, we're proud that we achieved approximately 20% methane reductions below 2015 levels, which is 5 years earlier than mandated. 
Moving to Oncor. We continue to see strong growth throughout the service territory. In the fourth quarter alone, Oncor connected approximately 18,000 new premises, which brought the full year total to approximately 77,000. This is a 20% increase compared to 2019 connections, which is an amazing figure and reflects the best organic growth rate Oncor has ever experienced. This is particularly noteworthy considering the backdrop of the global pandemic. 
On the transmission side, Oncor set a record for interconnection requests in 2020, driven by continued strong development activity in utility-scale generation with a focus on the renewable and battery storage markets in their service territory. Also, Oncor completed 6 major transmission projects in West Texas, totaling approximately 260 circuit miles and approximately $300 million of investment. 
Shifting to our infrastructure businesses. ECA LNG Phase 1 reached final investment decision this past November, and we subsequently provided TechnipFMC with full notice to proceed under the EPC contract. The total expected capital investment is approximately $2 billion, which includes an equity contribution of approximately $250 million each from Sempra LNG and IEnova. And in December, an affiliate of Total took a 16.6% equity stake in the project. 
Shifting to Mexico. We continue to advance our pipeline of construction projects focused on improving the country's energy security. The Don Diego Solar project reached commercial operations and recently, IEnova announced an agreement to acquire the remaining interest in ESJ. Additionally, last week, IEnova's CEO, Tania Ortiz, and Energy Minister Rocio Nahle, commissioned the Veracruz Refined Product Storage Terminal. As a reminder, the Veracruz Marine Terminal is situated in the largest Mexican port on the Gulf Coast and is expected to be one of the largest fuel terminals in the country, with the capacity to serve 2.1 million barrels of refined product. 
Please turn to the next slide, where I'll review our financial results. Earlier this morning, we reported fourth quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $414 million or $1.43 per share. This compares to fourth quarter 2019 GAAP earnings of $447 million or $1.55 per share. On an adjusted basis, fourth quarter 2020 earnings were $553 million or $1.90 per share. This compares to our fourth quarter 2019 earnings of $447 million or $1.55 per share. 
Full year 2020 GAAP earnings were $3,764,000,000 or $12.88 per share. This compares to 2019 GAAP earnings of $2,055,000,000 or $7.29 per share. On an adjusted basis, full year 2020 earnings were $2,350,000,000 or $8.03 per share. This compares favorably to our previous full year 2019 adjusted earnings of $1,911,000,000 or $6.78 per share. 
Please turn to the next slide. The variance in the full year 2020 adjusted earnings compared to last year was affected by the following key items: $146 million of lower earnings due to the sale of our Peruvian and Chilean businesses in April and June of 2020, respectively. This was offset by $284 million of higher equity earnings from Cameron LNG JV, primarily due to phase 1 commencing full commercial operations; $81 million of higher earnings at the California Utilities from higher FERC and CPUC base operating margins; $63 million of lower losses at parent and other due to lower net interest expense and higher income tax benefits; $57 million of higher earnings at the California utilities from the release of a regulatory liability in 2020 associated with an income tax expense memorandum account that track differences between actual and forecasted estimates from 2016 to 2018, partially offset by income tax benefits in 2019 from the release of a regulatory liability established in connection with 2017 tax reform for the excess deferred income tax balances that the CPUC directed to be allocated to shareholders in a January 2019 decision. 
$51 million of higher equity earnings at Sempra Texas Utilities, primarily due to increased revenues from rate updates to reflect invested capital and Oncor's acquisition of InfraREIT in May 2019; and $41 million of higher earnings from Sempra LNG's marketing operations, primarily driven by changes in natural gas prices. 
Lastly, I'd like to highlight that we're making a few changes regarding our financial guidance going forward in 2021 and beyond. We're continuing to work on ways to provide you a cleaner and clearer view of our operational performance and financial results. And after various discussions with a number of our investors and sell-side analysts, starting in the first quarter of 2021, we will be adjusting out foreign currency and inflation effects as well as unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses. This change is incorporated into our reaffirmed 2021 guidance range. Reporting our earnings with these items adjusted out allows for greater focus on earnings from ongoing business activities, and we appreciate all the input we received on this change of convention. 
Please turn to the next slide. Over the last 3 years, we've successfully narrowed our investment focus to T&D investments in what we believe are the most attractive markets in North America. And those of you who have followed us over the last 3 years have seen the difference this has made. Since 2017, we've transacted on approximately $27 billion in enterprise value while still growing our adjusted EPS annually by approximately 14%. Not only has our adjusted EPS growth been exceptional but the overall adjusted earnings quality has substantially increased, providing greater visibility into future cash flows. We're proud of where our business stands today and believe we're well positioned to continue providing strong financial results. 
With that, please turn to the next slide, where I will review our new 5-year capital plan. Last year, we laid out our record 5-year capital plan of $32 billion. And when rolling our plan forward this year, we continue to see robust opportunities to invest in our U.S. utilities and infrastructure businesses. In 2021 to 2025, the capital plan is anchored by $29 billion of U.S. utility investments, which represents over 90% of our total capital plan and is the largest utility program in the company's history. 
For SDG&E and SoCalGas, safety and reliability continue to be at the forefront of our capital plan. We're making investments at both utilities to enhance our pipeline infrastructure through our risk assessment mitigation phase and risk spending accountability reporting. At SDG&E, we continue to advance our industry-leading wildfire mitigation program by investing in innovative and cutting-edge technologies to keep our communities safe. And at SoCalGas, we're making strides toward achieving our greenhouse gas emissions reductions and executing on a strategy to achieve at least 40% reduction in methane emissions by 2030. 
Additionally, at Oncor, the capital plan is attributable to tremendous organic growth that we're seeing. On the distribution side, Dallas-Fort Worth is the fastest-growing metropolitan area in the fastest-growing state in the country. This is coupled with continued investments on the transmission side, resulting from the increase in wind and solar generation as well as battery storage being interconnected into the ERCOT system. When compared to Sempra's capital plan we shared with you last spring, we've identified an increase of roughly $1.1 billion of incremental utility CapEx in 2021 and 2022 combined. 
Lastly, we plan to fund our robust capital plan with cash flows from operations as well as using some of the cash proceeds received from the proposed sale of a noncontrolling interest in Sempra Infrastructure Partners and other available sources. As we've historically done, we'll continue to be disciplined and evaluate all available financing sources based on the timing of our investments and what we believe is the most efficient for our shareholders. 
Please turn to the next slide, where I will review rate base projections. Our continued investment in safety and reliability provides strong projected rate base growth of approximately 9% annually from 2020 to 2025. By 2025, our combined total rate base is projected to be approximately $56 billion. Notably, over that period, our rate base mix does not change materially, with approximately 70% of total rate base from electric infrastructure, which reflects how well positioned we are to continue supporting strong trends in electrification. Please turn to the next slide, where I will hand the call back over to Jeff to review our priorities for 2021."

As we turn our attention to the rest of 2021, we plan to continue our positive momentum. We've identified several priorities to capitalize on the critical role that energy infrastructure is providing in support of the energy transition. Our priorities include, among others: executing health and safety programs to help mitigate COVID-19 risk for our employees; maintaining a focus on safety and operational excellence across all of our companies; continue to execute on utility-centered capital plan; delivering strong financial results and completing the Sempra Infrastructure Partners' integrated set of transactions. I look forward to sharing more about how we're delivering on a sustainable future for all of our stakeholders at our Investor Day later this year. 
Please turn to the next slide. And finally, let me summarize for you our investment proposition, which we believe is differential to others in our industry and offers compelling value both in the near and long term. We're building a top-tier T&D infrastructure platform that is well positioned to succeed in attractive markets; continuing to execute a robust capital plan with significant expected growth in rate base; growing our EPS and improving our earnings visibility; maintain an attractive and growing dividend and remaining committed to innovation, sustainability and leadership. 
Please turn to the final slide. In summary, 2020 was a record year for our company. Against the challenging economic and operating backdrop, we deployed a record amount of capital and produced the best financial results in our company's history, topping the prior year's record of adjusted earnings results by over $400 million. We look forward to continuing to execute on our value proposition in 2021 and remain committed to creating long-term shareholder value. And with that, this concludes our prepared remarks and we'll stop to take your questions. Before opening the call to questions, however, I'd like to remind you that we will not be discussing the exchange offer."

In terms of use of proceeds, you obviously have an opportunity to reinvest for the buyback and delever. Any sort of priorities here? And how much do you sort of envision could be recycled at the utilities just from an equity standpoint?

And I think the way we think about it is, we've gone through, in our prepared remarks, kind of what we think the critical success factors are for the transaction. And obviously, one of the things we've identified in that order of criteria is to create an accretive transaction. 
So when you think about the use of proceeds, what I try to describe -- it's essentially dependent upon 3 factors: number one, how well you successfully execute the tender offer; number two, how well you execute the sell-down process, and that includes both the overall quantity of equity sold and the implied valuation; and to the point that you're getting to, the third part of that is a transaction, so to speak, is the use of proceeds. 
And one of the things we noted on the call is that you've seen not only the same $32 billion capital program roll forward, but you're also seeing a higher portion of capital in the 5-year plan allocated toward the utility. So last year's plan was roughly 85% to 86% utility spending over the 5 years. This year's plan's closer to 90%. And we did highlight for you that we think there's at least $1.1 billion of incremental CapEx just in our California Utilities in the next 2 years. And you've seen us raise the CapEx for Oncor by another $300 million over the 5-year time frame. 
So we're going to look at both debt reduction. We're going to look at opportunities to fund additional utility CapEx. We will always test that against share repurchases. And there are scenarios where you could see us take in in-kind investments from investors, although it's probably a lower likelihood. So what we're going to try to do is manage all 3 of those things, the tender process, the equity sell-down and then efficient use of proceeds in a way that delivers all the critical success factors that we identified in our prepared remarks."

I think both of those points are accurate. And I think, Shar, you have followed our company for quite a while, and I would tell you that we went through a relatively thoughtful process with our Board in 2018 to make sure we have the right strategy. And we really wanted to focus on North America and sell noncore assets, make sure we're in the right markets. 
And I will tell you, if anything, about last week in Texas and some of the challenges you're seeing in your industry, if it points to anything, it's really the value of investing in the grid. And as you recall from some of our prior conversations, we have specifically avoided the generation marketplace. We've avoided being exposed to commodities, and that's why being in a decoupled marketplace like California is so important. 
So you've seen, over the last 3 years, us be able to grow our EPS at about a 14% CAGR. And as we think about 2021, I would probably go back and just mention to you that, think about how we did our guidance last year. I think it was on this call that we talked about our guidance last year, and some people were a little bit disappointed in the Q4 call of the 2020 guidance. And you'll recall, Shar, it was on the Q1 call that we guided to the high end of the range. And later in Q2, we went ahead and revised our guidance upward to $7.20 to $7.80. In the Q3 call last year in November, we guided to the high end of the range. 
And think about what we've done, right? During a pandemic, probably the worst economic downturn in the history of our country Sempra Energy has produced record EPS. We've produced record earnings and all 5 business units, for the first time in the history of this company, each 1 of them produced record earnings results. So as we go into 2021, you should expect us to basically continue to look at getting the SIP transaction done, get further along in execution of our capital programs, specifically in our utilities and come back to you with a view toward trying to always under-promise and over-deliver."

Well, look, I would start to see by saying I think the events of last week, which were in the Midwest obviously, in Texas and obviously Northern Mexico as well, they also impacted California which we're also comfortable talking about, if you like to go into that. But it was the most important event in the energy markets globally last week. 
And we've always started by thanking our employees for their hard work in the Dallas community and across North Texas. And certainly, there's been a lot of people have been hurt by this and our hearts go out to all those folks. But as for Oncor, you'll recall that their job is really as the grid operator is to execute the commands of ERCOT in terms of load shedding just to make sure there wasn't a complete failure of the grid. And I think one of the things that's taking place in Austin today is we're going through legislative hearings. Our CEO, Allen Nye, is going to also testify at those hearings. 
But I think the most important thing is Oncor stood tall during last week's event. I think they were one of the more positive participants in the overall marketplace. That's also a view shared by the governor, by the way. I think what's important as we think about future reforms is I just want to be a little bit cautious, Steve, that we don't front-run the activities that are underway today at the state. There's going to be a full-scale investigation. The Railroad Commission will be involved, the PUCT, the governor's office and the PUCT, obviously, but -- and all the interveners in the marketplace. 
So I think what will happen from this is, you'll probably find opportunities for the state to improve its resiliency. There's also a lot of generation, as we've talked about on prior calls. It's in the interconnection queue. And we certainly expect that, that will lead to additional investments in the T&D space. Look, I don't want to start talking about capital at this point. I just think that as you think about building that marketplace, which has the strongest economy, at least the growth economy in the country, we don't think they're going to be spending less capital. We think that spending more capital will certainly be part of the solution."

You'll recall that Texas took up most of the new cycle but they had a DC time, the Midwest that went down. Obviously, there were impacts all the way across into Louisiana, which had some temporary disruptions to our Cameron facility. Cameron's online and operating well. 
You'll also recall, at one point in time, the governor issued an order that natural gas in Texas had to stay in Texas to meet electric generation needs first before being exported. That obviously has impacts to Mexico. Mexico had rolling blackouts in 4 or 5 of its northern states. So we were working very closely with Tania, and you'll recall that we've got 7 pipelines where we've moved gas across the U.S.-Mexico exchange. And she was being quite helpful to Texas to make sure that people were not unnecessarily scheduling gas across that interchange, but she was also working very closely with CFE. 
So you think about our LNG facility in Baja, which is a giant storage facility, it was critical in that process of serving the needs of Northern Mexico and Southern California. And again, the state of California called on our storage network at SoCalGas, which is a very critical piece of infrastructure here in the state. And what people sometimes forget, Steve, is that California sits at the western end of the pipeline system. We don't have much, if any, indigenous production of natural gas in the state, so we're very reliant on events outside the state, like you saw last summer, for us to import power from neighboring states, but also to import gas, particularly here in the wintertime. 
So it was a system-wide event in the Western United States. And I think what we feel great about is, and we've really been hitting this pretty hard with our investment community, Steve, is we are the picks and shovels to the gold rush, right? We're the company that's investing in grids, we're investing in storage and we're a big part of the solution today. I think if you look at where the market is going, I think we've got the wind behind ourselves in terms of our investment thesis. And we should expect to see continued strong capital spending across our enterprise."

I would tell you that we certainly think that the theme of electrification is a hard secular trend. And I think if you think back to the Oncor acquisition in March of 2018, it was really premised on that expectation",535,"Yes. Thanks, Michael, for the question. I would tell you that we certainly think that the theme of electrification is a hard secular trend. And I think if you think back to the Oncor acquisition in March of 2018, it was really premised on that expectation that, that trend would continue. So as you see us lay out today, we've currently got 74% of our U.S. utility rate base is exposed to that dominant trend. 
But I would go back to a point I was making with Steve Fleishman, too, which is there is really an untold story of the criticality of natural gas to support the energy transition. So Michael, 80% of the world's energy emissions today related to carbon come from oil and coal. And by the middle of next decade, the most dominant fuel in the world will be natural gas. In fact, Royal Dutch Shell came out just yesterday and forecasted that the LNG trade would double by 2040. So there is a strong recognition that the 1 country in the world that's got it right and has reduced emissions the most has been the United States. So for the last 2 decades, we've led the world in emissions reductions: number one, by committing to renewable capacity; and number two, making sure that we fuel switch from coal to natural gas. 
So when you come back to California, clearly, Michael, we had blackouts last summer, and that was because we were over-reliant on imports. I think there's a recognition that natural gas is the natural partner to renewables. So I think we're going to have headwinds. We've got to tell a better story. The most important thing we can do, and Trevor talked about this is, we have to make sure that natural gas plays the appropriate role. But it's incumbent upon us as a company to limit future emissions around methane. And that is very critical all across this country that we're on top of that. I expect to see the Biden administration likewise continue to regulate that area. 
But longer term, natural gas, which we think over time will be replaced by hydrogen and green molecules, that will be the best way to get after heavy-duty transportation and the industrial side of the equation. So electrification can take you so far but it will be moving from natural gas to hydrogen, we believe, and the green molecules that will support what we need to do to reduce emissions, both in industry and transportation. 
So I think you're going to continue to see the type of rate base growth that you see in front of our utilities. And I will remind you and when we got our rate case at SoCalGas, it basically approved a record capital expenditures. Because as you go forward in time, Michael, you've got to make sure that you maintain the reliability of that system but also that it maintains it in a safe way. So we're going to definitely grow our electric side of our portfolio. And as you can see by the middle of this decade, we expect to have $55 billion in rate base across those 3 utilities. We're very excited about it."

There's some interesting legislation that's been batted around there regarding reforms to the power sector.

Or can your team talk about that, whether they think that legislation actually happens and gets done and what the ramification would be for IEnova?"

I think what the administration is looking to do is they proposed a set of reforms for the power industry. And there's a complex set of things that are embedded in the proposed law, but the 1 that's probably received the most press cover",537,"Sure, no problem. I think what the administration is looking to do is they proposed a set of reforms for the power industry. And there's a complex set of things that are embedded in the proposed law, but the 1 that's probably received the most press coverage is the attempt to really reorder the dispatch curve. So as you know, typically, market by market in the United States, lowest-cost generation dispatches first and particularly plants that have no or 0 fuel costs like nuclear or renewables. 
I think with the downturn in the global economy, you got to remember that Mexico is a member of OPEC+ so they're a participant in the oil marketplace. And they have a little bit higher sulfur content in their fuel oil. So this is an opportunity for them to use more of their natural resources in power production. And what they're really trying to do is privilege in that dispatch curve that CFE's oil fire plants with dispatch first. 
And the 1 that impacts the most are the IPP market participants that are actually using oil or natural gas in a competitive format. We're not in that business line. The only electric generation plant we have is connected to California. In fact, it's not even connected to the CFE grid and that provides support here in Southern California. It does impact our renewable portfolio. But keep in mind, they're net short in electricity so renewables will always dispatch. And this, I think our renewable business represents about 10% to 15% of the EBITDA in IEnova, and IEnova represents roughly 10% of the overall earnings of Sempra. But we think it's a manageable situation. 
And I would also conclude on 1 thing, which is if the law is passed, and it clears the Senate chambers in the next 2 or 3 weeks, it's got 3 fatal flaws: number one, under the Mexican constitution, there's an implied covenant of fair dealings and open competition. So there will be constitutional challenges to the law; number two, under the USMCA agreement, there's also a requirement that governmental entities will not be privileged over state-owned entities; and then secondly -- I mean, thirdly, we also have arguments that you can't pass a law like that and then retroactively apply it to marketplace where you've got agreement. 
So we have tried not to be in the middle of that fight, Mike. I think we've really set a course in Mexico to be an active participant in helping López Obrador and his administration be successful. That's one of the reasons I think it was important that Trevor said in his prepared remarks that the Minister of -- Rocio Nahle joined us last week at the Veracruz Terminal. We also have senior officials joining us at other development projects. 
So our goal is to help Mexico be successful. They need more foreign direct investment. They have a deficit in their infrastructure. And this administration, fortunately, has been very committed to fiscal discipline. So I think our job is to make sure that we're working in partnership with the government to advance the government's goals. And it will be interesting to see how the legislation you referred to plays out."

And I would tell you, when you think about using that capital, we've tried to think about all the different permutations of whether it's 50-50 incremental CapEx and debt reductions or some other ratio. And we're pleased to be able to come forward today and mentioned the fact that even on our slides, just in 2 businesses, we've identified incremental CapEx of $1.1 billion at SDG&E and SoCalGas over the balance of this year and next year. 
We've talked about in the past, Julien, I think on the Q4 -- on the Q3 call, that Oncor raised its overall capital program from $11.9 billion to $12.2 billion.

So the whole goal of this transaction is to make sure that we continue to unburden Sempra's balance sheet to really grow aggressively our regulated utility platform, at the same time that we're freeing up the balance sheet of Sempra Infrastructure Partners to self-fund its growth. 
So one of the things we've talked about, Jeremy, is making sure that we're working with the credit rating agencies, and we've been doing this since last summer, to -- when we complete this transaction that Sempra Infrastructure Partners will have an investment-grade balance sheet, and it will be able to self-fund all of these expected capital needs. The 1 exception may be Port Arthur but it depends on how we approach funding out our obligations there, and we would even consider bringing in equity partners at the project level if needed."

So you saw some of the challenges we had in California last summer. Obviously, the challenges that people met in Texas surprised a lot of people last week. I think what we really want to do is make sure that people understand the importance of gas storage. 
So Texas has a lot of geology that supports natural gas storage. One of the things, Stephen that you've seen, particularly on the East Coast and the Northeast, as you've covered utilities, is the important sometimes of having liquid fuel on site. So peak shaving LNG is quite common on the East Coast. I think there's over 50 facilities. So as you think about future solutions for the state of Texas, I think part of it is to make sure that they've got a balanced energy strategy to continue to make investments in green energy, that will require future investments in transmission, but also making sure that not only are there existing natural gas and coal plants properly weatherized, and that includes a nuclear plant that went down last week, too, South Texas Power. 
It also means making sure that you have reliability. And there's this old saying from someone who is an old-timer, who one time pointed to a cold stack outside a power plant and said, ""That's what reliability looks like."" I'm certainly not an advocate for coal. But I do think that by privileging natural gas storage and the geology that Texas has and looking at ideas either around electric storage or particularly LNG peak shading, one of the things you should expect to do is make sure that they've got the appropriate reserve margin and they've got fuel that is available and callable to meet the needs of the state during events like they had last week."

And one of the key issues is the most important thing is we march toward more renewables, green molecules like we talked about before and hydrogen is a significant expansion of our energy network. 
So the biggest issue, and there's different studies out there, there's a principal study and other studies. Some of them even have the electric grid increasing by 5x by 2050. So it doesn't matter what market you're in. This idea of electrification being a hard trend and the idea that distribution and transmission networks need to be expanded is really, really important. And I think we're as well positioned as anyone, given our footprint in Texas and California. But maybe, Don, if you won't mind talking about your thoughts on Texas.

So there's certainly a lot of opportunity for additional transmission and generation interconnection that's going to come out of that as that continues to develop. 
And then when you look at just West Texas alone, 40% of the Delaware Basin, the oil and gas facilities -- 40% of the oil and gas facilities out there are on self-generation, waiting to be hooked up to the grid. So we're still catching up out there. And the big loops like the Culberson Loop out there continues to set peaks every year.

But when I was at SDG&E, I remember looking at some of the old strategy books from 1987 and 1990, and there was an embodying focus on making sure that bills did not get too high. This is something that we've been very focused on over multiple decades to make sure that the value of what we're providing is consistent with the value of what they're receiving. 
And I will tell you we have relatively high rates in California. We expect those rates to go higher because of the need of capital spending. But what's most important, and people miss this sometimes, is our bills are well below the national average. That's largely because you have very moderate weather here. So many parts of the year, many parts of San Diego don't even have air conditioning. 
So because of the moderate weather, because of the commitment to energy efficiency across the state, you're incentivizing customers to use less. And as you do that, the per-unit cost of electricity goes up, right? So rates probably continue to go up. We try to do everything possible to make sure that we meet those needs with energy efficiency and come up with programs to help people save on their bills. But right now, the annual bill is below average for the United States."

And we tend to focus on businesses that have substantially similar cost of capital and a model that provides substantially similar risk-adjusted cash flows. I think we've been successful in doing that. 
And if you've covered the industry for the last couple of decades, you've seen people move into unregulated businesses and out of it. But the common denominator for people who have moved out of unregulated businesses, they've either had challenges growing those businesses in a way or they've got a stride or a stray on the issue of having a substantially similar cost of capital. 
And I think what you're seeing us do is, we've made a very clear statement. We're going to be what we think is one of the most important owners of energy networks, specifically utility networks in the country. And we're going to be as well positioned as any other provider to take advantage of what we think is important trends around electrification. 
And what you're seeing us do with Sempra Infrastructure Partners is make sure that we source the lowest cost of capital to ensure that, that business can self-fund. And with self-fund, it really unlocks Sempra's balance sheet to continue to fund our priority, which is building out this network platform that we have in California and Texas. So as you see people who cannot grow outside the utility, they may hang a label of simplification on top of it. But you have to look back at how those changes in strategy has been helpful and not helpful to investors. I'm very deferential to how other companies run it, but at our company, as long as we have an opportunity to add more value for our investors, I think it's something we want to continue to do. 
And I'll actually add something which I've been really intrigued by. When you look back over the last 12 months, you think about the fact that our stock is trading at about $160 on February 19 of last year and ask ourselves, have we added value to overall franchise, specifically including some of the diversified investments that you're referring to, we've been able to bring 2 trains at Cameron online. It's transformed our LNG business and led to record earnings last year. We were able to sell both of our utilities in South America and derisked our business model and brined back $5.8 billion of pretax proceeds. 
We've been able to improve our credit metrics. Trevor talked about this and strengthened our balance sheet. We finished the year, we had a target of 16% FFO to debt and we finished with 17% and we're below a 50% threshold in debt to cap. We had record capital investments last year across both business lines, utilities and non-utilities of $7 billion. We raised guidance and exceeded guidance. We secured a 10.6% ROE at FERC on SDG&E's transmission assets. We bought back $500 million of stock. We took FID, the only FID in the world around LNG last year and we announced this 2-part SIP transaction. 
So what you should expect us to do is be very active about derisking the model, always challenging ourselves about whether our unregulated businesses fit in our portfolio. And actually, this underpins our transaction of finding a co-investor that has a shared vision for that business, at the same time that we unlock Sempra's balance sheet and support our credit initiatives by ensuring that on a going-forward basis, Sempra Infrastructure Partner both has an investment-grade balance sheet and the capability to fund all of its development initiatives. ."

Before starting, I'd like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements we make today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. All of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call for a reconciliation to GAAP measures. 
I'd also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, May 5, 2021, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future. Lastly, because the offer period for our IEnova exchange offer is open, we're limited in what we can say about the exchange offer, and we will be unable to respond to questions about this transaction.

I'm pleased with our first quarter results and I think it sets us up well for the balance of 2021. You'll recall, we shifted our market focus back to North America several years ago and have been consistently investing new capital in our utility platforms in California and Texas. This strategic focus, together with strong operational execution, are continuing to drive improvements in our financial performance. 
A second part of our strategy is focused on consolidating our unregulated investments under Sempra Infrastructure and we're making great progress there as well. Just last month, we announced our agreement to sell a 20% equity interest in that business to KKR, and it's an important step for 2 reasons: First, bringing in a new strategic partner allows Sempra infrastructure to strengthen its own balance sheet while also positioning the business to self-fund its future growth; and second, this transaction sends a clear market signal about the value and expected growth of our Infrastructure platform. 
Turning now to the company's financial results. Earlier this morning, we reported first quarter 2021 adjusted earnings per share of $2.95. We're also affirming our 2021 adjusted EPS guidance range. Now please turn to the next slide where I'll turn the call over to Trevor to provide both business and financial updates."

We've had several positive developments at our operating companies this past quarter.

We've had several positive developments at our operating companies this past quarter. At our California Utilities, we received a proposed decision for 2022 and 2023 attrition rates, which if approved, will provide greater support for safety and reliability initiatives as well as improved visibility into future earnings. 
Moving to Texas, in 2020, Oncor experienced its highest organic premise growth ever and we're excited to see the growth continue this year. In the first quarter alone, Oncor connected approximately 19,000 new premises, greater than the connections in the first quarter of 2020, again validating the underlying strength of economic and demographic growth in the region. 
Now shifting to our Infrastructure business. At Sempra LNG, we have begun engineering construction of ECA Phase 1 and continue to progress our LNG development projects. At Cameron Phase 2, we continue to work with our Cameron partners on the technical design of the project and to advance commercial discussions. At Port Arthur LNG, we continue to work with partners and customers to focus on options to reduce the project's greenhouse gas profile and continue improving its competitive position in the global energy transition. 
At this time, given this work and the continued impacts of the pandemic on the global energy markets, it is more likely that final investment decision at Port Arthur will move to next year. We will keep you updated as things progress. 
Moving to our Mexican business. We continue to advance our pipeline of development projects, focused on diversifying its energy supplies and improving the country's energy security. In March, we expanded the renewable energy platform by finalizing the acquisition of the remaining 50% equity interest in ESJ and placing the border solar project into operation. 
Also, as Jeff mentioned earlier, we're making great progress on Sempra Infrastructure and the associated series of transactions. Just last week, we received the necessary regulatory approvals to launch the IEnova exchange offer. As that process moves forward, it's important to note that it does not have a minimum requirement to close. 
With that, please turn to the next slide for a short update on additional details of the pending sale announcement in Sempra Infrastructure. With the announced sale of a 20% equity interest in Sempra Infrastructure to KKR, we've gained a strategic partner to help fund future growth. The $3.37 billion in proceeds is expected to be used to fund growth at our U.S. utilities and to strengthen our balance sheet and also establishes an implied enterprise value of approximately $25.2 billion. 
Equally important, we're pleased to be partnering with an investment firm that has a shared vision for growth in North America. Lastly, we expect to close the transaction in the middle of this year, subject to customary closing conditions and certain approvals from third parties and regulatory agencies. 
Please turn to the next slide where I will review the financial results. Earlier this morning, we reported first quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $874 million or $2.87 per share. This compares to first quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $760 million or $2.53 per share. On an adjusted basis, first quarter 2021 earnings were $900 million or $2.95 per share. This compares to our first quarter 2020 adjusted earnings of $741 million or $2.47 per share. 
Please turn to the next slide. The variance in the first quarter 2021 adjusted earnings compared to the same period last year was affected by the following key items: $73 million of lower losses at parent and other, primarily due to net investment gains, lower net interest expense, lower retained operating costs and lower preferred dividends; $62 million of higher equity earnings from Cameron LNG JV, primarily due to Phase 1 commencing full commercial operations in August of 2020; $35 million of higher CPUC base operating margin at SoCalGas, net of operating expenses; and $30 million of higher equity earnings at Sempra Texas Utilities, primarily due to increased revenues from rate updates to reflect invested capital and customer growth and higher consumption due to weather. This was partially offset by $56 million of lower earnings due to the sales of our Peruvian and Chilean businesses in April and June of 2020, respectively. 
Please turn to the next slide. We're pleased to report a successful quarter, both operationally and financially, and we are affirming our full year 2021 adjusted EPS guidance range. And with that, this concludes our prepared remarks. However, before moving to the Q&A, I'd like to remind you that we will not be discussing the exchange offer. We'll stop now and take your questions."

This is a conversation that we've had a lot over the last 90-plus days. And I will tell you that I think as you think back over the last 2 or 3 years, you've seen us really focus on funding our utilities, right? So we've got a $32 billion 5-year capital program. It's a very large capital project. Close to $29 billion of that is dedicated to our utilities. So as we think about how we would use those proceeds, certainly, we want to make sure that we're funding growth in our utilities. And there will be opportunities for us to look at paying down parent debt and continue to strengthen our balance sheet. 
We've made great progress also over the last 3 years of improving our equity layer. So what I would say is when we get to our analyst conference, and right now, we're targeting June 29, we'll look forward to reviewing our 2021 guidance by that time to see if there's any adjustments that are needed. We will also, for the first time, Shar, issue our 2022 guidance.

We do a very periodic strategic review with our Board. And I think you've heard us talk a lot about this long-term secular trend toward electrification and how we've continued to reorient our portfolio toward transmission and distribution. So as you think about the outages in California last summer and some of the things that Texas has gone through, we really think the best risk-adjusted returns near term and long term for our investors is to continue to take a leadership position in owning more energy grids. 
So as you think about renewables over the next 20 or 30 years potentially doubling across the country, we really think this grid position is going to be very important. So you're right in your assessment. We find Oncor to be a very attractive investment. It has a wonderful management team. We think it has a really important leadership position in the Texas market. 
We have good relationships with GIC and TTI. As you know, as a matter of convention, we tend not to talk about M&A type of opportunities, but I will -- I do feel comfortable confirming that I think our T&D thesis has been validated several times over the last couple of years, and that will be a continuing priority for our management team."

And just for the benefit of the larger audience, Allen Nye, the CEO of Oncor, is on the phone with us. And I'll just make a quick contextual comment, Steve, before passing to Allen, which is really proud of how our team responded during the crisis in February. I mentioned this in the comment to Shar, but I think the importance of T&D in Texas, as the state thinks about adding new generation, as it thinks about meeting its growth prospects, I think, will become increasingly important. 
One observation I'll note before I hand it off is, there's a lot of conversations around PUC reform or market reform or increased capital spending around weatherization. I think one of the takeaways, Steve, is this was a really remarkable weather event, really, really highly uncommon. And it's very much focused on the supply side and making sure that weatherization is a real priority from the generation assets, Steve, all the way up the value chain going toward the wellhead. 
So I think this is probably, in the long run, going to be more about how we prepare the supply side, including the fuel side more so than expected market reforms. But I think we've talked with Allen and we think we're probably not going to try to front-run the state in terms of what the expected outcomes are, but we have a lot of confidence we'll get to a good outcome from the legislature. But Allen, perhaps you could comment more on the different buckets that you expect conversations to occur in the legislature and at the PUC, if you could."

And I think it's getting an appropriate and a corresponding response from both the legislature and the regulators. We're obviously in the middle of session, getting towards the end. But as of now, we have over 180 bills dealing with issues associated with the winter event. 
To Jeff's point, we're not seeing things that are likely to have significant market redesign type implementation. But generally, we see the current legislative session kind of falling into 6 categories: market governance and oversight; winterization; communications, both within the market and the customers; obviously, gas and electric coordination; customer and market protection; and securitization. 
And while we don't see overall market redesign occurring, we think there's significant momentum about behind any number of those issues, and we're likely to see -- could see legislation path addressing each of those concerns or issues, rather. But frankly, it's too early to tell. We've got session going through May 31 and the possibility of additional special sessions. 
Similarly, the PUC has addressed 8 areas of inquiry. They basically overlap many of the categories coming out of the legislature. Those areas of inquiry could obviously change as we get new commissioners appointed to the commission. So overall, probably not wholesale market change, likely action on each of those topics that I addressed. Many of them, some of them could impact us. Some of them could require additional investment on our system. 
As I said when I testified before the legislature, I believe and I think it shows -- the evidence shows that our system performed very well and we did what we had to do. But obviously, there are things we can improve on and the things that we intend to improve on and depending on what comes out of the legislative session, we'll make the necessary investment to achieve those ends."

I can't tell you what it's related to or what it's not. I know there's a lot of legislative action, [ SB 3 ], in particular, around -- that can have potential implications to renewables. But so far, those are the numbers that we have on generation for first quarter of this year. And obviously, much as you would expect when you look at the Q, much of those are renewable solar and wind."

We continue to be very optimistic about our development portfolio. Steve. You recall on our Q4 call, we commented on some of the spot prices, I think, which set records actually at JKM, at least at that marker in January. And I -- we were talking about looking back at LNG trade last year and for the first part of this year. It has been one of the bright spots in the overall global energy markets. I think in part, it's attributable to this robust demand response we're seeing in Asia and low inventories in Europe. 
The consultants we work with think that by 2030, you could see the market climb to about 550 million tons per annum, and today, it's right around 365 million. So we're pretty optimistic about where we're at in terms of our development portfolio and particularly being able to access Asia. 
We talked about, at least Trevor did in his prepared remarks, Port Arthur. Obviously, this is a really large project for the United States and obviously for our company. We expect that we will probably move that FID decision into next year. But one of the things that's interesting is we're trying to improve our portfolio. I'll look at things like carbon capture and move into electric drive supported by renewables. I think the greening up of the value chain here in North America is something that the sell side and the buy side should follow because I expect it will make America increasingly competitive over time. 
I would mention that ECA Phase 1 are going very well. In fact, our EPC contractor actually mobilized last month to begin some of the site preparation work, and that's one that we'll look to make updates on going forward. Then at Cameron Phase 2 probably has had the most activity. We're working with our Cameron partners through the pre-FEED work. This will also help us advance and optimize the overall technical design on that project, which we remain quite bullish on. 
After pre-FEED, the next steps, Steve, will be the engineering work for FEED and moving forward with the EPC contract. And we're also making great progress on the commercial conversations with both Mitsui, Mitsubishi and Total. So that's advancing quite nicely. So I think as we look at it, we think the thesis that we've laid out to Wall Street about this supply-demand gap in the middle of the decade continues to be validated. We've talked about this now for 3 or 4 years. 
So I think our portfolio will be well positioned going forward. And I think as you see, the higher coal use right now in Asia, particularly this year as compared to prior years, I think the importance of LNG as part of the clean energy transition is increasing in importance."

As we've thought about it, you look back over the last 3 years, I think we've shown a real willingness, as a management team with our Board, to make changes to the portfolio all through the lens of trying to see if we can improve our financial performance, right? And we found opportunities where we're a seller when other people value our assets at a level higher than we value them. And you've likewise seen us be a buyer, particularly around our T&D thesis where we feel like that we can pick something up at a fair price in a market that's strategic to us. 
And as you think about those activities and being thoughtful about our capital allocation, we've been able to grow our adjusted earnings per share at about a 14% CAGR. So we feel very good about the portfolio. In fact, we did a lookback to our portfolio over the last 2 decades, and we've been able to grow our total shareholder return at just over 1,000% versus the S&P 500 is right around a 400% total shareholder return and the S&P utilities at right around 314%. So we've been able to, over 2 decades, outperform our sector by 3x type of performance. 
I think it's this idea that you can put together a portfolio, and if you're really thoughtful and disciplined about capital allocation, you're always taking what the market gives you. And right now, we think we want to focus on growing our utility platform, both in Texas and California. We think we have a leadership position in both markets. 
So I think in the near term, our focus will be on growing our utilities and try to meet and fund the most capital-efficient way that $32 billion capital program. At the end of the day, we're very excited about our partnership with KKR. But this was also an opportunity for us to source the lowest cost of capital to fund our capital program. So we're actually quite bullish on both of these platforms and look forward to growing them into the future."

I think that on prior calls, you may recall that we mentioned that we did not expect to have any cash tax consequences associated with the transaction because of the buildup of NOLs we have the kind of the 2024, 2025 time frame. I think the most important takeaway from my earlier remarks is that we're going to be in a position at our analyst conference, Julien, to provide our 2022 guidance. And I think that's the appropriate thing to focus on. 
The use of proceeds for this transaction will be important. I've talked about the importance of making sure that we can fund our capital program. There's nothing unique or nuanced about the balance sheet issue. I think you've seen us go from an equity layer that was closer to 40%, 41%, 42% in Q2 of 2018, and we finished this year last year, on December 31 with a balance sheet that had an equity layer at about 51%. So we really have improved our balance sheet and thickened our equity layer. 
But as we look at paying down debt, we'll look at our various maturities, we'll look at our make-whole payments, we'll get to the right economic decision, and we'll balance that with other offensive opportunities to fund our capital programs. So we feel good about the Sempra Infrastructure transaction.

You've got deep capital markets. 
We have always said, and I think most forecasters agree, the United States will lead the world in LNG exports for the next 2 or 3 years. As you think about other competitive advantages, I mentioned this at Port Arthur but also at Cameron specifically, we're looking at opportunities to make sure that we can green up the value chain so we have the most competitive form of LNG possible. 
And I think what you talked about at Shell, that will become increasingly common. But I think the United States, in particular, will take its existing advantages and will become more advantaged relative to our competitors because of the very things you referenced in.

Yes, Jeremy, I think on the 45Q question, yes, we do think that will play an important part as we look at carbon capture around our LNG and I guess, broader within the company. And in terms of what we're doing at our LNG projects, we are always looking for ways to reduce our emissions both on-site and then from the gas coming in as well as the power that's coming into the project. 
So as Jeff mentioned earlier, as we look to potential electric drives, trying to increase the percentage of renewable power that would drive those as well as other ways to capture and reduce methane on our site, I think those are important drivers as we look to keep greening our facilities and frankly, the supply that comes into them. 
In terms of -- you made reference to the Cheniere-Shell deal. I think you will start to see more of that in the LNG marketplace. We are working with our customers and potential customers as to how we will track the emissions associated with that and then as to ways that the emissions with that LNG can be offset. So I do think you will see that play an important role as the market continues to grow. 
But as Jeff mentioned in his earlier remarks, I think what excites us most about LNG is the continued growth you see in the LNG around the world, frankly, as the rest of the world and us move toward energy transition and cleaner energy. Natural gas is clean, affordable. We're seeing it supplement domestic gas resources around the world. We're seeing it provide support for renewables and supporting electrification.

And to your point, we have made a commitment to be at 20% renewable natural gas by 2030. I think we're at about the 5% level today. And what's interesting is you get carbon offset credits if you can use renewable natural gas for marine purposes as well as for transportation purposes. And I think there's an opportunity to extend those type of offsets to pipeline utilization. 
We also think there's an opportunity here in California to see us move towards something that looks a lot more like the renewable portfolio standard that was used in 2007 to launch our renewable investments across the state. But we do think capturing biogas from landfill and from dairies has a huge impact on taking uncombusted methane out of the environment. So we're going to be trying to -- we're actually going to try to be a leader in that area.

But this is an issue that we're going to have to tackle in the state, right? Methane is about 80x, or you've seen maybe even more times worse, more times the net worse for the atmosphere and for the climate than CO2. And so there's going to be a need to be a regulatory construct in the end to drive kind of emitters of this -- of methane to capture that and use it or burn it or put it back into the ground.

So these are very, very hard to site and build. These are long lead time projects that can take up to a decade to complete. 
And it's one of the reasons I think that we feel so constructive about the transmission and distribution positions we have in Texas and California because we think the lion's share of these upgrades that will be extended will come from the existing owners of the existing rights way and existing land positions and infrastructure.

Secondly, you're going to hear us talk about the growth that we expect in our California and utility platforms in Texas and how we expect to fund that going forward. There'll be a lot of focus, in Trevor's presentation in June, around our approach to funding our capital program. And I would also mention we expect Steve to have spotlights on technology and innovation in all of our business unit presentations. 
So it's very interesting. We had a conversation with Fatih Birol from the IEA not too long ago who met with our Board. And he made the point to us that for the world to reach net 0 by 2050, it's the view of the International Energy Agency that 50% of the required technology, and that includes new fuels, do not exist today. So we think that industry controls the tools of decarbonization, and the research and development and innovation that's needed needs to come from industry. 
So you'll expect to hear us not just talk about sustainability but our role in taking a leadership position in our industry about what we're going to do in each business unit to improve sustainability and focus on innovation."

And maybe just on innovation and following up on the questions around California and natural gas. I mean, you all have been leaders in innovation in terms of thinking about renewable natural gas, how to pivot your business model to achieve a variety of goals. 
I was just curious, though, as you talk with the CPUC and talk with California legislators on the more negative end of the spectrum in terms of just any new developments that you see in terms of wanting, from a variety of folks, to move away from conventional methane more quickly or changes, pushes towards electrification. Anything else that you're sort of seeing in terms of your dialogue with policymakers?"

But I would tell you that I think we benefited from positive and progressive regulation in the state for a long period of time. And there's no question that electrification will be a dominant near-term and long-term secular trend. 
But what's interesting to me is there's this growing convergence around the role of not just electric infrastructure but natural gas infrastructure because natural gas is what's allowing us to find that efficient frontier. I hosted a guest in our Center of Excellence here yesterday, and we were looking at our real-time board. And I think we were at right around 82% renewable penetration on SDG&E's system at a point in time yesterday afternoon. 
And that's only possible because you've made those investments in a resilient grid backed up by batteries, and you've got all the peaking and necessary load support from your natural gas side. So this was one of the lessons learned from our blackouts in California last summer. So I think there is this kind of convergence that over long periods of time, to continue to push cleaner forms of energy, natural gas has a role, and we're still using a lot of natural gas, obviously, in power production. 
So there will always be points of differences. There will be robust dialogues. There will be conflict of discussions around energy policy. But over long periods of time, I think the state has done a great job. And you'll recall, in the most recent GRC, the PUC approved the largest capital spending program in the history of SoCalGas. And it's really a flexion of their commitment to safety and reliability and I think the long-term importance of that system. And Kevin, would you like to make any more comments about natural gas generally in the state?"

I'll just echo really what you said about, it's really clean electrons and clean molecules working in tandem. I think that's becoming clear as we progress on this continuum of the energy transition, Stephen. It's not really binary, it's not electrification and then forget about natural gas or forget about hydrogen or forget about other clean forms of molecules. It's really some combination of both because you can't really decarbonize the industrial sectors, the heavy-duty transportation sectors without the clean molecules. 
And really, what you need to make the clean molecules is more renewable energy. You need more clean electrons, which means more investment in the transmission grids. And so it's really these 2 systems working together, which is going to result in achieving this net 0 GHG emissions by 2045 goal that both the state has but both of our utilities have announced their alignment with as well. So just -- that's the key takeaway, I think."

And I'm just curious because you've made lots of great transactions to simplify the business and to monetize some of the valuable assets you own. 
Do you worry there's a need to diversify further away from California? Meaning do you worry and does the Board have a concern that California Utilities, whether it's due to wildfire risk, whether it's due to the move away from natural gas, whether it's earnings risk due to the cost of capital mechanism kicking in and low interest rates, do you kind of worry that relative to the rest of the sector, that California Utilities are kind of, I guess, use the term discount stocks?"

Well, I would start by saying that -- and you've followed this for a long time, Michael, that we tend to take a long-term view around how we try to create value. And we don't have knee-jerk reactions to short-term changes in the marketplace. And I know that's not what you're implying, but we are always tying ourselves to that long-term view. 
And you'll recall, I went back and looked, at the end of 2017, 88% of our earnings were North America and 12% were in South America, and we had roughly 70% of our earnings composition came from California. And today, that's just less than 50%. So there has been a trend in terms of how we've managed Sempra Infrastructure Partners and how we've managed our growth in Texas, namely through the acquisition of an 80% interest in Oncor. And then as you recall, we also bought InfraREIT, which was a public company. 
And then you've seen at Allen's capital program went from what was about a $7.4 billion commitment in his November of 2017 for a 5-year capital program to today is closer to $12.2 billion. So we're now forecasting $55 billion of utility rate base by the end of 2025 and at least, based upon current returns, is on a weighted ROE basis of about [ 10.1 ] 
But I think you're on a good point. Look, we're going to continue to manage this portfolio, and we're going to continue to grow at, number one, weighted toward utilities. And number two, if there's opportunities to expand, we have a huge leadership presence in California. We like the state. We think we have the chance to take some of the economies of learning here around sustainability, and that influences why we're a better stakeholder and investor in other parts of our business. Yes, we'll continue to look for opportunities to expand outside of California. And frankly, Mike, when you look back on the last 3 years, you've seen us execute that way."

Well, look, I think what we try to do in our unregulated business is make sure that we exercise our capital allocation strategy to produce cash flows that have substantially similar risk reward to our utilities, right? So Port Arthur is an opportunity where we've got 7 today. I don't see any scenario that we would probably take FID without having it fully contracted. 
I would mention, one of the things that was attractive, Michael, about the Sempra Infrastructure Partners portfolio is, you're hard-pressed to find someone that owns a business like that, that has average contract tenor across LNG and our contracts in Mexico at 21 years. So all the lessons from last decade and the decade before about merchant positions and commodity exposure and exposure to generation, we paid our tuition back in those decades. And I think what we're focused on right now is aggressively growing our California and Texas utility platform. 
And inside of Sempra Infrastructure Partners, there's no question. We have an industry-leading development platform. But we think that we have competitive positions that will allow us to fully contract those businesses before they go forward. 
And I'll make 1 last point. You may remember that we announced early on the MOUs, Michael, for ECA Phase 1 and that was fully tied up by MOUs before we progress to SPAs. We're in that exact same position today with Cameron expansion. So even though we're bullish long term about Port Arthur, that can be a remarkable project. We're even more bullish about Cameron expansion. So that's 1 that Justin and the team will be speaking more about at our analyst conference."

We also have not really had a return to the office program across Sempra yet. So we're still working more in a virtual mode, except for our central workforce, which is in the field. But things that we're looking at, you may recall, over the last 3 years, we've had these programs we call the Janus program, where we try to take costs, particularly out of the parent company. We've had a consistent process in '18, '19 and '20 of reducing costs at the parent company. 
At our California utilities, they're also being thought. But 1 area that we're going to track well into the future, Ryan, is our real estate needs. We have a lot of office space, storage facilities all across Southern California. I know Allen has looked at this in Texas. And once we get back to a more normalized return-to-work profile, I think this will be an opportunity to look at our fleet vehicle program. We'll look at our real estate costs.

You've obviously seen it in the pipeline industry as well, but particularly because transmission and pipelines involve interstate commerce, that's one of the reasons that the federal government has such an important role here in terms of policymaking. But a lot of those land and those rights issues fall to the state. 
So I think this is something they're going to continue to grapple with. We found no silver bullet in the last couple of decades in this area. What I would say is the ability to develop, whether it's generation spurs, 230 kV lines, 500 kV lines. It's a little bit different by jurisdiction, whether you're in Louisiana or you're in Texas or Mexico relative to California. You may remember the largest -- the last large-scale transmission line we built here was the Sunrise power line, and it took up almost $1.9 billion to build 90 miles, right? So it is a very costly, challenging permitting project, particularly in California. 
And that's one of the reasons, Ryan, that we have a thesis that when you talk about transmission and distribution and the importance of grids towards accepting more renewables, it will fall largely to upgrading existing facilities and making sure that more renewable clusters can access existing infrastructure."

So here in California, there's a big emphasis around safety and resiliency and reliability. In Texas, Allen's challenge is a little bit more different. He's got really enormous growth challenges in terms of making infrastructure investments to accommodate growth. 
I participated in the Board call with Allen and Trevor recently at Oncor. And in the far west region, they saw something close to 5% to 5.3% quarter-over-quarter electricity growth. So I think the challenge will be different by jurisdiction. I would say this, one thing that intrigues us is, we spend a lot of time not just investing in our high-performing culture but building a business system that allows us to effectively manage our businesses, manage risk effectively, invest in our culture and be good allocators of capital. And I think we have the real opportunity to build a bigger platform of scale. 
I think it was one of the outcomes from the pandemic last year was this belief that it's important to be larger and a market leader in every market. So when you think about our position in California, you think about our position with Allen's business in Texas, and you think about Sempra Infrastructure Partner, we've added scale at all 3 of those growth platforms. And what we want to do is continue to assert those advantages in those markets to meet the needs of our regulators and our customers.

Before starting, I'd like to remind everyone that we'll be discussing forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements we make today. The factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q filed with the SEC. All of the earnings per share amounts in our presentation are shown on a diluted basis and we'll be discussing certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please refer to the presentation slides that accompany this call for a reconciliation to GAAP measures.  
I'd also like to mention that the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation speak only as of today, May 5, 2021, and the company does not assume any obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements in the future. Lastly, because the offer period for our IEnova exchange offer is open, we're limited in what we can say about the exchange offer, and we will be unable to respond to questions about this transaction.

I'm pleased with our first quarter results and I think it sets us up well for the balance of 2021. You'll recall, we shifted our market focus back to North America several years ago and have been consistently investing new capital in our utility platforms in California and Texas. This strategic focus, together with strong operational execution, are continuing to drive improvements in our financial performance.  
A second part of our strategy is focused on consolidating our unregulated investments under Sempra Infrastructure, and we're making great progress there as well. Just last month, we announced our agreement to sell a 20% equity interest in that business to KKR, and it's an important step for 2 reasons: first, bringing in a new strategic partner allows Sempra Infrastructure to strengthen its own balance sheet while also positioning the business to self-fund its future growth; and second, this transaction sends a clear market signal about the value and expected growth of our infrastructure platform.  
Turning now to the company's financial results. Earlier this morning, we reported first quarter 2021 adjusted earnings per share of $2.95. We're also affirming our 2021 adjusted EPS guidance range. Now please turn to the next slide where I'll turn the call over to Trevor to provide both business and financial updates."

We've had several positive developments at our operating companies this past quarter.

We've had several positive developments at our operating companies this past quarter. At our California utilities, we received a proposed decision for 2022 and 2023 attrition rates, which if approved, will provide greater support for safety and reliability initiatives as well as improved visibility into future earnings.  
Moving to Texas. In 2020, Oncor experienced its highest organic premise growth ever and we're excited to see the growth continue this year. In the first quarter alone, Oncor connected approximately 19,000 new premises, greater than the connections in the first quarter of 2020, again validating the underlying strength of economic and demographic growth in the region.  
Now shifting to our infrastructure business. At Sempra LNG, we have begun engineering construction of ECA Phase 1 and continue to progress our LNG development projects. At Cameron Phase 2, we continue to work with our Cameron partners on the technical design of the project and to advance commercial discussions. At Port Arthur LNG, we continue to work with partners and customers to focus on options to reduce the project's greenhouse gas profile and continue improving its competitive position in the global energy transition.  
At this time, given this work and the continued impacts of the pandemic on the global energy markets, it is more likely that final investment decision at Port Arthur will move to next year. We will keep you updated as things progress.  
Moving to our Mexican business. We continue to advance our pipeline of development projects focused on diversifying its energy supplies and improving the country's energy security. In March, we expanded the renewable energy platform by finalizing the acquisition of the remaining 50% equity interest in ESJ and placing the border solar project into operation. Also, as Jeff mentioned earlier, we're making great progress on Sempra Infrastructure and the associated series of transactions. Just last week, we received the necessary regulatory approvals to launch the IEnova exchange offer. As that process moves forward, it's important to note that it does not have a minimum requirement to close.  
With that, please turn to the next slide for a short update on additional details of the pending sale announcement in Sempra Infrastructure. With the announced sale of a 20% equity interest in Sempra Infrastructure to KKR, we've gained a strategic partner to help fund future growth. The $3.37 billion in proceeds is expected to be used to fund growth at our U.S. utilities and to strengthen our balance sheet and also establishes an implied enterprise value of approximately $25.2 billion.  
Equally important, we're pleased to be partnering with an investment firm that has a shared vision for growth in North America. Lastly, we expect to close the transaction in the middle of this year, subject to customary closing conditions and certain approvals from third parties and regulatory agencies.  
Please turn to the next slide where I will review the financial results. Earlier this morning, we reported first quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $874 million or $2.87 per share. This compares to first quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $760 million or $2.53 per share. On an adjusted basis, first quarter 2021 earnings were $900 million or $2.95 per share. This compares to our first quarter 2020 adjusted earnings of $741 million or $2.47 per share.  
Please turn to the next slide. The variance in the first quarter 2021 adjusted earnings compared to the same period last year was affected by the following key items: $73 million of lower losses at parent and other, primarily due to net investment gains, lower net interest expense, lower retained operating costs and lower preferred dividends; $62 million of higher equity earnings from Cameron LNG JV, primarily due to Phase 1 commencing full commercial operations in August of 2020; $35 million of higher CPUC base operating margin at SoCalGas, net of operating expenses; and $30 million of higher equity earnings at Sempra Texas Utilities, primarily due to increased revenues from rate updates to reflect invested capital and customer growth and higher consumption due to weather. This was partially offset by $56 million of lower earnings due to the sales of our Peruvian and Chilean businesses in April and June of 2020, respectively.  
Please turn to the next slide. We're pleased to report a successful quarter, both operationally and financially, and we are affirming our full year 2021 adjusted EPS guidance range. And with that, this concludes our prepared remarks. However, before moving to the Q&A, I'd like to remind you that we will not be discussing the exchange offer. We'll stop now and take your questions."

This is a conversation that we've had a lot over the last 90-plus days. And I will tell you that I think as you think back over the last 2 or 3 years, you've seen us really focus on funding our utilities, right? So we've got a $32 billion 5-year capital program. It's a very large capital project. Close to $29 billion of that is dedicated to our utilities. So as we think about how we would use those proceeds, certainly, we want to make sure that we're funding growth in our utilities. And there will be opportunities for us to look at paying down parent debt and continue to strengthen our balance sheet.  
We've made great progress also over the last 3 years of improving our equity layer. So what I would say is when we get to our analyst conference, and right now, we're targeting June 29, we'll look forward to reviewing our 2021 guidance by that time to see if there's any adjustments that are needed. We will also, for the first time, Shar, issue our 2022 guidance.

We do a very periodic strategic review with our Board. And I think you've heard us talk a lot about this long-term secular trend toward electrification and how we've continued to reorient our portfolio toward transmission and distribution. So as you think about the outages in California last summer and some of the things that Texas has gone through, we really think the best risk-adjusted returns near term and long term for our investors is to continue to take a leadership position in owning more energy grids.  
So as you think about renewables over the next 20 or 30 years potentially doubling across the country, we really think this grid position is going to be very important. So you're right in your assessment. We find Oncor to be a very attractive investment. It has a wonderful management team. We think it has a really important leadership position in the Texas market.  
We have good relationships with GIC and TTI. As you know, as a matter of convention, we tend not to talk about M&A type of opportunities, but I will -- I do feel comfortable confirming that I think our T&D thesis has been validated several times over the last couple of years, and that will be a continuing priority for our management team."

And just for the benefit of the larger audience, Allen Nye, the CEO of Oncor, is on the phone with us. And I'll just make a quick contextual comment, Steve, before passing to Allen, which is really proud of how our team responded during the crisis in February. I mentioned this in the comment to Shar, but I think the importance of T&D in Texas, as the state thinks about adding new generation, as it thinks about meeting its growth prospects, I think, will become increasingly important.  
One observation I'll note before I hand it off is, there's a lot of conversations around PUC reform or market reform or increased capital spending around weatherization. I think one of the takeaways, Steve, is this was a really remarkable weather event, really, really highly uncommon. And it's very much focused on the supply side and making sure that weatherization is a real priority from the generation assets, Steve, all the way up the value chain going toward the wellhead.  
So I think this is probably, in the long run, going to be more about how we prepare the supply side, including the fuel side more so than expected market reforms. But I think we've talked with Allen and we think we're probably not going to try to front-run the state in terms of what the expected outcomes are, but we have a lot of confidence we'll get to a good outcome from the legislature. But Allen, perhaps you could comment more on the different buckets that you expect conversations to occur in the legislature and at the PUC, if you could."

And I think it's getting an appropriate and a corresponding response from both the legislature and the regulators. We're obviously in the middle of session, getting towards the end. But as of now, we have over 180 bills dealing with issues associated with the winter event.  
To Jeff's point, we're not seeing things that are likely to have significant market redesign type implementation. But generally, we see the current legislative session kind of falling into 6 categories: market governance and oversight, winterization communications, both within the market and the customers; obviously, gas and electric coordination; customer and market protection; and securitization.  
And while we don't see overall market redesign occurring, we think there's significant momentum about -- behind any number of those issues, and we're likely to see -- could see legislation path addressing each of those concerns -- or issues, rather. But frankly, it's too early to tell. We've got session going through May 31 and the possibility of additional special sessions.  
Similarly, the PUC has addressed 8 areas of inquiry. They basically overlap many of the categories coming out of the legislature. Those areas of inquiry could obviously change as we get new commissioners appointed to the commission. So overall, probably not wholesale market change, likely action on each of those topics that I addressed. Many of them, some of them could impact us. Some of them could require additional investment on our system.  
As I said when I testified before the legislature, I believe and I think it shows -- the evidence shows that our system performed very well and we did what we had to do. But obviously, there are things we can improve on and the things that we intend to improve on. And depending on what comes out of the legislative session, we'll make the necessary investment to achieve those ends. Thanks."

You recall on our Q4 call, we commented on some of the spot prices, I think, which set records actually at JKM, at least at that marker in January. And I -- we were talki",476,"Thank you. We continue to be very optimistic about our development portfolio. Steve. You recall on our Q4 call, we commented on some of the spot prices, I think, which set records actually at JKM, at least at that marker in January. And I -- we were talking about looking back at LNG trade last year. And for the first part of this year, it has been one of the bright spots in the overall global energy markets. I think in part, it's attributable to this robust demand response we're seeing in Asia and low inventories in Europe.  
The consultants we work with think that by 2030, you could see the market climb to about 550 million tons per annum, and today, it's right around 365 million. So we're pretty optimistic about where we're at in terms of our development portfolio and particularly being able to access Asia. We talked about, at least Trevor did in his prepared remarks, Port Arthur. Obviously, this is a really large project for the United States and obviously for our company. We expect that we will probably move that FID decision into next year. But one of the things that's interesting is we're trying to improve our portfolio. I'll look at things like carbon capture and move into electric drive supported by renewables. I think the greening up of the value chain here in North America is something that the sell side and the buy side should follow because I expect it will make America increasingly competitive over time.  
I would mention the same that ECA Phase 1 are going very well. In fact, our EPC contractor actually mobilized last month to begin some of the site preparation work, and that's one that we'll look to make updates on going forward. Then at Cameron Phase 2 probably has had the most activity. We're working with our Cameron partners through the funding of the pre-FEED work. This will also help us advance and optimize the overall technical design on that project, which we remain quite bullish on.  
After pre-FEED, the next steps, Steve, will be the engineering work for FEED and moving forward with the EPC contract. And we're also making great progress on the commercial conversations with both Mitsui, Mitsubishi and Total. So that's advancing quite nicely. So I think as we look at it, we think the thesis that we've laid out to Wall Street about this supply-demand gap in the middle of the decade continues to be validated. We've talked about this now for 3 or 4 years.  
So I think our portfolio will be well positioned going forward. And I think as you see, the higher coal use right now in Asia, particularly this year as compared to prior years, I think the importance of LNG as part of the clean energy transition is increasing in importance."

As we've thought about it, you look back over the last 3 years, I think we've shown a real willingness as a management team with our Board, to make changes to the portfolio all through the lens of trying to see if we can improve our financial performance, right? And we found opportunities where we're a seller when other people value our assets at a level higher than we value them. And you've likewise seen us be a buyer, particularly around our T&D thesis where we feel like that we can pick something up at a fair price in a market that's strategic to us.  
And as you think about those activities and being thoughtful about our capital allocation, we've been able to grow our adjusted earnings per share at about a 14% CAGR. So we feel very good about the portfolio. In fact, we did a look back to our portfolio over the last 2 decades, and we've been able to grow our total shareholder return at just over 1,000% versus the S&P 500 is right around a 400% total shareholder return and the S&P utilities at right around 314%. So we've been able to, over 2 decades, outperform our sector by 3x type of performance.  
I think it's this idea that you can put together a portfolio, and if you're really thoughtful and disciplined about capital allocation, you're always taking what the market gives you. And right now, we think we want to focus on growing our utility platform, both in Texas and California. We think we have a leadership position in both markets.  
So I think in the near term, our focus will be on growing our utilities and try to meet and fund the most capital-efficient way that $32 billion capital program. At the end of the day, we're very excited about our partnership with KKR. But this was also an opportunity for us to source the lowest cost of capital to fund our capital program. So we're actually quite bullish on both of these platforms and look forward to growing them into the future."

I think that on prior calls, you may recall that we mentioned that we did not expect to have any cash tax consequences associated with the transaction because of the buildup of NOLs we have the kind of the 2024-2025 time frame. I think the most important takeaway from my earlier remarks is that we're going to be in a position at our analyst conference, Julien, to provide our 2022 guidance. And I think that's the appropriate thing to focus on.  
The use of proceeds for this transaction will be important. I've talked about the importance of making sure that we can fund our capital program. There's nothing unique or nuanced about the balance sheet issue. I think you've seen us go from an equity layer that was closer to 40%, 41%, 42% in Q2 of 2018, and we finished this year -- last year, on December 31 with a balance sheet that had an equity layer at about 51%. So we really have improved our balance sheet and thickened our equity layer.  
But as we look at paying down debt, we'll look at our various maturities, we'll look at our make-whole payments, we'll get to the right economic decision, and we'll balance that with other offensive opportunities to fund our capital programs. So we feel good about the Sempra Infrastructure transaction. It was premised on sourcing lowest cost of capital, right, finding a partner that has a shared vision for growth and it's going to be accretive."

You've got deep capital markets.  
We have always said, and I think most forecasters agree, the United States will lead the world in LNG exports for the next 2 or 3 years. As you think about other competitive advantages, I mentioned this at Port Arthur but also at Cameron specifically, we're looking at opportunities to make sure that we can green up the value chain so we have the most competitive form of LNG possible.  
And I think what you talked about at Shell, that will become increasingly common. But I think the United States, in particular, will take its existing advantages and will become more advantaged relative to our competitors because of the very things you referenced in.

Yes, Jeremy, I think on the 45Q question, yes, we do think that will play an important part as we look at carbon capture around our LNG and I guess, broader within the company. And in terms of what we're doing at our LNG projects, we are always looking for ways to reduce our emissions both on-site and then from the gas coming in as well as the power that's coming into the project. 
So as Jeff mentioned earlier, as we look to potential electric drives, trying to increase the percentage of renewable power that would drive those as well as other ways to capture and reduce methane on our site, I think those are important drivers as we look to keep greening our facilities and frankly, the supply that comes into them. 
In terms of -- you made reference to the Cheniere-Shell deal. I think you will start to see more of that in the LNG marketplace. We are working with our customers and potential customers as to how we will track the emissions associated with that LNG and then as to ways that the emissions with that LNG can be offset. So I do think you will see that play an important role as the market continues to grow. 
But as Jeff mentioned in his earlier remarks, I think what excites us most about LNG is the continued growth you see in the LNG around the world, frankly, as the rest of the world and us move toward energy transition and cleaner energy. Natural gas is clean, affordable. We're seeing it supplement domestic gas resources around the world. We're seeing it provide support for renewables and supporting electrification. So we think LNG will play a critical role and particularly, American LNG in the global energy transition."

And to your point, we have made a commitment to be at 20% renewable natural gas by 2030. I think we're at about the 5% level today. And what's interesting is you get carbon offset credits if you can use renewable natural gas for marine purposes as well as for transportation purposes. And I think there's an opportunity to extend those type of offsets to pipeline utilization. 
We also think there's an opportunity here in California to see us move towards something that looks a lot more like the renewable portfolio standard that was used in 2007 to launch our renewable investments across the state. But we do think capturing biogas from landfill and from dairies has a huge impact on taking uncombusted methane out of the environment. So we're going to be trying to -- we're actually going to try to be a leader in that area. And this is something that we'd be even taking inquiries from, from some of our European partners about the progress and leadership that SoCalGas has shown.

Something like Jeff mentioned around an RPS standard would be very helpful ultimately. 
But this is an issue that we're going to have to tackle in the state, right? Methane is about 80x, or you've seen maybe even more times worse, more times the net worse for the atmosphere and for the climate than CO2. And so there's going to be a need to be a regulatory construct in the end to drive kind of emitters of this -- of methane to capture that and use it or burn it or put it back into the ground. So we're going to see more of that. But like you mentioned, I think an RPS standard will be very helpful in helping us reach our goal."

So these are very, very hard to site and build. These are long lead time projects that can take up to a decade to complete. 
And it's one of the reasons I think that we feel so constructive about the transmission and distribution positions we have in Texas and California because we think the lion's share of these upgrades that will be extended will come from the existing owners of the existing rights way and existing land positions and infrastructure.

So it's very interesting. We had a conversation with Fatih Birol from the IEA not too long ago who met with our Board. And he made the point to us that for the world to reach net 0 by 2050, it's the view of the International Energy Agency that 50% of the required technology, and that includes new fuels, do not exist today. So we think that industry controls the tools of decarbonization. And the research and development and innovation that's needed needs to come from the industry.

Anything else that you're sort of seeing in terms of your dialogue with policymakers?"

But I would tell you that I think we benefited from positive and progressive regulation in the state for a long period of time. And there's no question that electrification will be a dominant near-term and long-term secular trend. 
But what's interesting to me is there's this growing convergence around the role of not just electric infrastructure but natural gas infrastructure because natural gas is what's allowing us to find that efficient frontier. I hosted a guest in our Center of Excellence here yesterday, and we were looking at our real-time board. And I think we were at right around 82% renewable penetration on SDG&E's system at a point in time yesterday afternoon. 
And that's only possible because you've made those investments in a resilient grid backed up by batteries, and you've got all the peaking and necessary load support from your natural gas side. So this was one of the lessons learned from our blackouts in California last summer. So I think there is this kind of convergence that over long periods of time, to continue to push cleaner forms of energy, natural gas has a role, and we're still using a lot of natural gas, obviously, in power production. 
So there will always be points of differences. There will be robust dialogues. There will be conflict of discussions around energy policy. But over long periods of time, I think the state has done a great job. And you'll recall, in the most recent GRC, the PUC approved the largest capital spending program in the history of SoCalGas. And it's really a flexion of their commitment to safety and reliability and I think the long-term importance of that system. And Kevin, would you like to make any more comments about natural gas generally in the state?"

I'll just echo really what you said about it's really clean electrons and clean molecules working in tandem. I think that's becoming clear as we progress on this continuum of the energy transition, Stephen. It's not really binary, it's not electrification and then forget about natural gas or forget about hydrogen or forget about other clean forms of molecules. It's really some combination of both because you can't really decarbonize the industrial sectors, the heavy-duty transportation sectors without the clean molecules. 
And really, what you need to make the clean molecules is more renewable energy. You need more clean electrons, which means more investment in the transmission grids. And so it's really these 2 systems working together, which is going to result in achieving this net 0 GHG emissions by 2045 goal that both the state has but both of our utilities have announced their alignment with as well. So just -- that's the key takeaway, I think."

Do you worry there's a need to diversify further away from California? Meaning do you worry and does the Board have a concern that California Utilities, whether it's due to wildfire risk, whether it's due to the move away from natural gas, whether it's earnings risk due to the cost of capital mechanism kicking in and low interest rates, do you kind of worry that relative to the rest of the sector, that California Utilities are kind of, I guess, use the term discount stocks?"

Well, I would start by saying that -- and you've followed us for a long time, Michael, that we tend to take a long-term view around how we try to create value. And we don't have knee-jerk reactions to short-term changes in the marketplace. And I know that's not what you're implying, but we are always tying ourselves to that long-term view. 
And you'll recall, I went back and looked, at the end of 2017, 88% of our earnings were North America and 12% were in South America, and we had roughly 70% of our earnings composition came from California. And today, that's just less than 50%. So there has been a trend in terms of how we've managed Sempra Infrastructure Partners and how we've managed our growth in Texas, namely through the acquisition of an 80% interest in Oncor. And then as you recall, we also bought InfraREIT, which was a public company. 
And then you've seen at Allen's capital program went from what was about a $7.4 billion commitment in his November of 2017 for a 5-year capital program to today is closer to $12.2 billion. So we're now forecasting $55 billion of utility rate base by the end of 2025 and at least, based upon current returns, is on a weighted ROE basis of about 10.1.
But I think you're on a good point. Look, we're going to continue to manage this portfolio, and we're going to continue to grow at, number one, weighted toward utilities. And number two, if there's opportunities to expand, we have a huge leadership presence in California. We like the state. We think we have the chance to take some of the economies of learning here around sustainability, and that influences why we're a better stakeholder and investor in other parts of our business. Yes, we'll continue to look for opportunities to expand outside of California. And frankly, Mike, when you look back on the last 3 years, you've seen us execute that way."

Well, look, I think what we try to do in our unregulated business is make sure that we exercise our capital allocation strategy to produce cash flows that have substantially similar risk/reward to our utilities, right? So Port Arthur is an opportunity where we've got 7 today. I don't see any scenario that we would probably take FID without having it fully contracted. 
I would mention, one of the things that was attractive, Michael, about the Sempra Infrastructure Partners portfolio is, you're hard-pressed to find someone that owns a business like that, that has average contract tenor across LNG and our contracts in Mexico at 21 years. So all the lessons from last decade and the decade before about merchant positions and commodity exposure and exposure to generation, we paid our tuition back in those decades. And I think what we're focused on right now is aggressively growing our California and Texas utility platform. 
And inside of Sempra Infrastructure Partners, there's no question. We have an industry-leading development platform. But we think that we have competitive positions that will allow us to fully contract those businesses before they go forward. 
And I'll make one last point. You may remember that we announced early on the MOUs, Michael, for ECA Phase 1 and that was fully tied up by MOUs before we progressed to SPAs. We're in that exact same position today with Cameron expansion. So even though we're bullish long term about Port Arthur, that can be a remarkable project. We're even more bullish about Cameron expansion. So that's one that Justin and the team will be speaking more about at our analyst conference."

We also have not really had a return to the office program across Sempra yet. So we're still working more in a virtual mode, except for our central workforce, which is in the field. But things that we're looking at, you may recall, over the last 3 years, we've had these programs we call the Janus program, where we try to take costs, particularly out of the parent company. We've had a consistent process in '18, '19 and '20 of reducing costs at the parent company. 
At our California utilities, they're also being thought. But one area that we're going to track well into the future, Ryan, is our real estate needs. We have a lot of office space, storage facilities all across Southern California. I know Allen has looked at this in Texas. And once we get back to a more normalized return-to-work profile, I think this will be an opportunity to look at our fleet vehicle program. We'll look at our real estate costs.

You've obviously seen it in the pipeline industry as well, but particularly because transmission and pipelines involve interstate commerce, that's one of the reasons that the federal government has such an important role here in terms of policymaking. But a lot of those land and those rights issues fall to the state. 
So I think this is something they're going to continue to grapple with. We found no silver bullet in the last couple of decades in this area. What I would say is the ability to develop, whether it's generation spurs, 230 kV lines, 500 kV lines. It's a little bit different by jurisdiction, whether you're in Louisiana or you're in Texas or Mexico relative to California. You may remember the largest -- the last large-scale transmission line we built here was the Sunrise power line, and it took up almost $1.9 billion to build 90 miles, right? So it is a very costly, challenging permitting project, particularly in California. 
And that's one of the reasons, Ryan, that we have a thesis that when you talk about transmission and distribution and the importance of grids towards accepting more renewables, it will fall largely to upgrading existing facilities and making sure that more renewable clusters can access existing infrastructure."

So here in California, there's a big emphasis around safety and resiliency and reliability. In Texas, Allen's challenge is a little bit more different. He's got really enormous growth challenges in terms of making infrastructure investments to accommodate growth. 
I participated in a Board call with Allen and Trevor recently at Oncor. And in the far west region, they saw something close to 5% to 5.3% quarter-over-quarter electricity growth. So I think the challenge will be different by jurisdiction. I would say this, one thing that intrigues us is, we spend a lot of time not just investing in our high-performing culture but building a business system that allows us to effectively manage our businesses, manage risk effectively, invest in our culture and be good allocators of capital. And I think we have the real opportunity to build a bigger platform of scale. 
I think it was one of the outcomes from the pandemic last year was this belief that it's important to be larger and a market leader in every market. So when you think about our position in California, you think about our position with Allen's business in Texas, and you think about Sempra Infrastructure Partner, we've added scale at all 3 of those growth platforms. And what we want to do is continue to assert those advantages in those markets to meet the needs of our regulators and our customers.

I want to start today by thanking those that attended our virtual Investor Day this past June, and I'll also mention that the team and I really enjoy getting back on the road this past month and seeing many of you in person. As we discussed at our Investor Day, we've simplified our business model, narrowed our investment strategy to attractive markets and improved capital discipline, all with the goal of offering a competitive value proposition, including: consistent and attractive returns, strong earnings visibility and EPS growth and a sustainable and growing dividend. Additionally, at the Investor Day, Allen and I highlighted the robust growth that Oncor continues to see all across its service territory. And as a result, Oncor is increasing its capital plan, which Trevor describes in further detail later in today's presentation. 
Shifting now to the quarter. I'm pleased with our financial results, and I think it's a testament to the affirmative steps we've taken to simplify our business model and focus our capital investments on top-tier infrastructure growth platforms. We're reporting strong earnings and affirming both our increased 2021 adjusted EPS guidance range and our 2022 EPS guidance range. I'm excited about the progress we've made so far this year, and I'm proud of the broad support we're seeing all across our operating businesses. Now please turn to the next slide, where I'll turn the call over to Trevor to provide both business and financial updates."

To begin, we have had several positive developments at our operating companies this past quarter. At SDG&E, in July, we received CPUC approval for our 2021 wildfire mitigation plan update, building on the utility's long-standing commitment to advance fire hardening and public safety. SoCalGas began flowing renewable natural gas at 2 additional biomethane projects in support of their goal to provide 20% RNG to core customers by 2030 to help the state reach its decarbonization goals. 
In Texas, Oncor has provided visibility to their 2022 to 2026 projected capital plan, which has increased to approximately $14 billion over the 5-year period. Additionally, Oncor did receive PUCT approval to extend its rate case filing deadline to June 1, 2022. At Sempra Infrastructure, we completed the exchange offer for IEnova's shares, resulting in a 96.4% ownership interest, and we plan to launch a cash tender offer for the remaining 3.6% interest. We're also advancing the sale of the noncontrolling interest in Sempra Infrastructure Partners to KKR. And while I may have been a bit optimistic at Investor Day, we now expect to close the transaction around the end of the third quarter, subject to the Mexican Competition Commission completing its economic and market analysis and issuing the regulatory approval. 
With that, please turn to the next slide for more details around Oncor's capital plan update. Oncor continues to operate in one of the fastest-growing states with strong macro fundamentals. As a result, Oncor is announcing its 2022 to 2026 projected capital plan of approximately $14 billion, nearly a $2 billion increase over the 2021 to 2025 capital plan. Furthermore, Oncor is increasing its 2021 to 2022 capital plan by approximately $425 million, consistent with what Allen outlined at the Investor Day and is largely incorporated in the new $14 billion 5-year capital plan. 
Oncor's robust capital plan supports the economic development seen throughout its service territory, increases in generation interconnection requests, strong premise growth and investments in grid resiliency. A good example of this robust growth can be seen in new relocations, expansions and electric service to Oncor's system, which are on pace to exceed 2020 values by 70% and to exceed 2019 values by 170%. 
Please turn to the next slide where I will review the financial results. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $424 million or $1.37 per share. This compares to second quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $2,239,000,000 or $7.61 per share. On an adjusted basis, second quarter 2021 earnings were $504 million or $1.63 per share. This compares to our second quarter 2020 adjusted earnings of $501 million or $1.71 per share. 
On a year-to-date basis, 2021 GAAP earnings were $1,298,000,000 or $4.24 per share. This compares to year-to-date 2020 GAAP earnings of $2,999,000,000 or $9.91 per share. Adjusted year-to-date 2021 earnings were $1,404,000,000 or $4.58 per share. This compares to our year-to-date 2020 adjusted earnings of $1,242,000,000 or $4.20 per share. 
Please turn to the next slide. The variance in the second quarter 2021 adjusted earnings compared to the same period last year was affected by the following key items: $126 million from a CPUC decision that resulted in the release of a regulatory liability of the California utilities in 2020 related to prior year's forecasting differences that are not subject to tracking in the income tax expense memorandum account; and $22 million of lower earnings due to the sale of our Peruvian and Chilean businesses in April and June of 2020, respectively. This was more than offset by $38 million higher equity earnings from the Cameron LNG JV primarily due to Phase 1 achieving full commercial operations in August of 2020; $35 million of lower losses at Parent and Other, primarily due to lower preferred dividends and lower net interest expense; $34 million of higher income tax benefits from forecasted flow-through items at SDG&E and SoCalGas; and $22 million income tax benefit in 2021 from the remeasurement of certain deferred income taxes at Sempra LNG. 
Please turn to the next slide. We're pleased with our strong operational and financial performance this quarter and are focused on continuing to execute throughout the remainder of the year. And with that, this concludes our prepared remarks so I now will stop, and we can take your questions."

To be able to produce $4.58 of adjusted EPS in the first half, I think, is an extraordinary outcome. And that does cause us to be fairly bullish against our increased guidance for 2021. And we certainly think there will be some pull-through of that strength into 2022. 
And I think it's a function of the growth that we're seeing in front of all 3 platforms. I think there's a portfolio of opportunities here in California and in Texas and in Sempra Infrastructure, which really highlights why we need to perform and execute well. I could not be more pleased. We obviously did this transaction back in March of 2018 with Oncor. We forecasted internally with our Board that there would be increased capital opportunities. We were pleased at the time that they had a $7.4 billion commitment to the regulator about their capital program. 
In November of 2017, they launched a great CIS program. What we were not prepared for was the quality of that management team. So Al and I is on the call with us today. Don Clevenger, who's the CFO; Matt Henry, the General Counsel; and Jim Greer, the COO, they are knocking the socks off of it. My prioritizing what we think is most important at Sempra, which is strength of operations and safety. 
More to your point on what we can expect next year, you did raise cost of capital. We talked a little bit about that at the analyst conference. And in our assumptions for 2022, we indicated that we did not expect in those assumptions to include any type of triggering at SDG&E or SoCalGas. But we did mention, Shar, that if there is a trigger to occur, which looks more likely now, it would probably be limited only to SDG&E. And within the confines of that business, Kevin Sagara and his team thinks that they can limit the impact to that forward guidance to roughly $0.05 to $0.10. 
So I would just summarize by saying the first half of this year caused us great optimism for our performance even against the increased guidance we provided for this year. I will be disappointed if we're not back in front of our investors, taking an increased view of what our performance might be in 2021. We do expect some of that pull-through to continue into 2022. We're obviously not prepared to revise the guidance for 2022 yet, largely because this cost of capital mechanism is still out there. But we think at least at SDG&E, it's well managed to something around $0.05 to $0.10 of impact."

Let me kind of take a step back and take a little broader view and I'll come right back to your question. We talked a little bit at Investor Day about our focus right now is on making sure that ECA Phase 1 is delivered on time and on budget. We have that coming into our planning period in the second half of 2024 and that's proceeding quite well. We've been managing the COVID environment down there and the work environment, and we remain optimistic about continuing to meet that deadline. 
Secondly, I think we have been consistent really over the last 18 months about continuing to have a more bullish view on Cameron expansion. We're working closely with Mitsui, Mitsubishi and Total. We will continue to have those conversations throughout the fall. We do think that project will have superior returns, which is one of the questions you're indicating. And that's largely because at a high level, you can always expect the economics of brownfield projects to be generally superior to greenfield projects. And the key for greenfield projects like Port Arthur is it's much more advantageous to do that project at multiple phases at scale, which makes it increasingly more economic. 
But right now, bringing online Train 4 at Cameron is a top priority for Justin and Faisel on the team. And being able to do that, Shar, at the same time that you debottleneck Trains 1, 2 and 3 really adds to its cost advantage. And you mentioned Port Arthur. That continues to be a remarkably well-situated site. The team is going to ground right now to make it more competitive, and we've outlined some of the steps that were taken to reduce the emissions profile. 
And I think the recent announcement regarding the Polish oil and gas company really is a reflection of the strength, number one, of that customer relationship and their confidence in our ability to deliver them into a project that meets their long-term needs. So I think that relationship's in good stead. I certainly think ECA 1 is going well. We continue to be quite bullish on Cameron expansion. And Port Arthur is probably a longer-term opportunity but we have more work to be done there."

But let me just start with a couple of highlight points. Number one, Jeremy, the growth that we're talking about and the adjustments to the CALP program are really around number one, strong premise growth; number two, active transmission interconnection requests, primarily focused on renewables and some baseload generation and new T&D investments. 
In terms of the timing around revising our plan, we had a Board meeting in Oncor last week. Allen is very good about bringing back to the Board not only the approval of next year's plan for 2022 but taking the opportunity to review longer term what the opportunity really was to meet some of the growth needs in Texas. So we feel quite bullish about that opportunity. 
I would add 1 final comment. We've seen some questions earlier this morning. But the raised expectation that Allen's team has put forward, and they've also got a press release out that provides more detail, does not impact the continued expectation of incremental capital in the $775 million range to $1.27 billion. So we've had the opportunity to reevaluate the needs of that business and the needs of our customers over the next 5 years. We'll go into the fall planning cycle with the view toward updating our Board in October -- in November. But I thought the opportunity here was really one of providing our latest view as transparently as possible to the Street. Allen, I know I covered a number of these points, but I think if you don't mind, talk a little bit more detail about the growth that you're seeing across your system and maybe kind of your approach to governance with your Board last week."

I think Jeff covered it to a large degree but let me just give you a little bit of color. With regards to why now, it's exactly what Jeff said. I mentioned at the Investor Day that we had a need to go to our Board in",762,"Yes. Thanks, Jeff, and thanks, Jeremy. I think Jeff covered it to a large degree but let me just give you a little bit of color. With regards to why now, it's exactly what Jeff said. I mentioned at the Investor Day that we had a need to go to our Board in July to increase our expectations for 2022 in order to get ahead of the game to make sure we have the resources and the equipment to actually execute next year. 
And so as Jeff said, we did that. We raised [ 22 ] from what we previously said was [ 2.4 to 2.5 ] up to [ 2.8 ]. We also took this opportunity to let you all know that we're seeing some opportunities this year, and so we've upped our 2021 from 2.4, which is what we previously had told you all to 2.5. And then just given the fact that we're going to go ahead and talking about increasing '21 and '22, we had the opportunity to discuss with our Board, things we're seeing some of this growth that Jeff is talking about. And so we've been spending a lot of time on CapEx here at Oncor because of what we're seeing. 
And what we're seeing is, to Jeff's point and Trevor talked about it earlier, premise growth last year, we had the largest organic growth rate ever in our company's history. And we're on pace this year through 2 quarters. Both quarters this year were higher than the corresponding quarters last year. Transmission points of interconnection on both the retail and the generation side are above the levels end of year last year and above the similar quarters of last year. 
Economic development, which I think is in Trevor's earlier remarks, economic development is another thing we look at. Request for information, which are basically project location-specific discussions we're having with potential builders, are up 72% approximately year-over-year. 
And then I always talk about West Texas when we're talking about growth. The West Texas story continues to be really strong. The latest trend is electrification of fields, people considering ESG ramifications, emissions. So we're getting some uptick there, but we have another peak on our Culberson Loop transmission system, in July, hit 760 megawatts versus 678 last year. That's an all-time high. Another peak in the Far West Texas weather zone in June. So we're seeing growth all over our system, really strong, which leads to these CapEx discussions we're having. 
And since I told you all at the investor call, our investor meeting that we are going to address '22 with our Board in July. And since we've adjusted '21 up, we thought now is a good opportunity to just provide you all with our expectations as a management team of what we're seeing with regard to those outer years. And those outer years, as you can see in our documents are, we're looking at [ 2.7 to 3.0 ] for the 4 years of the -- outer years of the plan. 
And that's our expectation right now. But as Jeff said, we're going to go into October, like we always do, and have our meeting on our 5-year plan with our shareholders, with our independent directors and with our Board. And we're going to review the information available to us at that time. And we'll have a number then, it may be [ 14 ] it may be something else. We feel very good about [ 14 ] right now. And we'll see where we are when we get to October and we'll have something to announce after that. 
To Jeff's point as well, we added about $1.8 billion to our 5-year expectation right now. The incremental capital that we have talked about in previous meetings and investor calls in the range of $775 million to $1.275 billion, which I think was on Page 45 of the investor deck last time we talked, that remains available. We have -- sometimes, when we move projects from that incremental kind of bucket into our CapEx plan, sometimes we have CapEx that comes from outside that incremental bucket and it goes into our plan. 
But notwithstanding the fact that we've raised to right now our expectation to around $14 billion over [ 5 ] there are significant -- there remain significant opportunities to invest on our system and those  additional opportunities are in part reflected in that incremental CapEx bucket that we discussed before. I'll be glad to answer any of the questions, but thanks a lot."

And now we're outlining something that looks like on the back end of the plan that could be looking more like $3 billion a year. So that's an almost doubling of the average output in terms of CapEx at that company. So we're very pleased with the growth in the state.

So electrification is going to be a long-term secular trend. We certainly have an opportunity to play that in a big way, just as Allen described, in Texas. We expect to be a leader in that market in connecting renewable grid solutions to our -- to load centers. 
Here in California, we did something that no one else has done across this country. We made a commitment that we would deliver roughly 20% of all of the natural gas delivered on the SoCalGas system by 2030 using renewable natural gas. You may have seen the press release in the last week or so. We just connected 2 new biomethane plants to our system. So whether it's a transportation opportunity, whether it's a maritime opportunity or an opportunity to basically deliver renewable natural gas across our network as the priority. 
We have set a goal of being at the 5% level next year. We remain on track to hit that goal. Scott Drew and his team are doing a hell of a job at SoCalGas to transform that business. And by doing so, as you know, exogenous methane in environment has an 80x higher detriment than gas, which is combusted in ordinary course. And there has been some exciting developments, I think, in terms of how the commission and other stakeholders in the state view RNG. I thought maybe Kevin Sagara, our Group President for California, could talk about the recent report that came out of PUC regarding this."

And yes, as you might expect, we've had a great run so far with the low carbon fuel standard in this state, creating a good amount of demand for RNG, but I think to go to the next level and help meet the state's very ambitious climate goals. We saw that the legislature passed SB 1440 and then recently, the PUC staff -- this PUC Energy Division issued a staff report recommending essentially an RPS for RNG for the California utilities. And really, the levels are based on the California statutory obligation to divert organic waste from landfills. 
So when you look out to 2025, they're supposed to procure -- the utilities are supposed to procure biomethane from organic waste equal to about 75% of the state's obligation to divert this waste from landfills, which is about 5.5% of core load. And by 2030, that goes up to about 12.3% of core load. So you asked about creating more demand, that would be a good opportunity. That staff report hasn't yet been acted upon but we hopeful that it does shortly."

Well, look, this is a great opportunity to go back and talk about our base business model, right? We're a T&D company, right? So one of the things that has privileged our commitment to California and our commitment to Texas is, we've moved away from being an owner and operator of electric generation, either fossil or renewable, with the exception of Mexico. And likewise, we don't have a lot of exposure because we're decoupled whether consumers consume more or less. So we very much like that sweet spot of building that kind of long-term growing bond portfolio and not being exposed to those issues. 
In terms of capital opportunities, there has been a new announcement in the state where they're looking for 11.5 gigawatts of new capacity additions in terms of generation, energy efficiency and long-duration storage. And we certainly think long-duration storage, in particular, is a unique opportunity where we've developed a capability there at San Diego Gas & Electric, and that will be a continued opportunity. But in the near term, the state is really being aggressive about making sure we find more needs, more ways of supporting our resource adequacy. 
And I think one of the great challenges, Jeremy, is traditionally during some of the highest demand times of the year, we're importing about 25% of the state's power needs from outside of California, and it always makes us subject to what's taking place in those other jurisdictions and what their demand needs are. So over a long period of time, California has got to take steps. It's going to take 5 to 7 years to get ahead of these demand needs through new capacity additions."

We feel good about the contract at ECA but that would be a near-term focus for us. 
In terms of input costs for future projects, that goes through our whole FEED and pre-FEED process to make sure we get to the right number. But I think it does go back to this issue, Michael, that greenfield projects, which tend to have a little bit of a higher per-unit cost than brownfield projects, this will continue to put pressure on that dichotomy. But keep in mind that all the other projects in the world are subject to those same cost pressures, right? So at the same time that you're seeing cost pressures around construction, you're still seeing a lot higher LNG spot prices around the world. 
And most people who are observing this industry think it will be the most dominant fuel used in the world by the early part of next decade. And the only way that's going to occur is, is you're going to see a massive build-out of continued LNG development, and the United States should expect to take its fair share."

Thanks, Jeff. I agree with that, the answer on the inflation. And with regards to legislation, there's kind of 2 things to think about here. There's what was passed and has been signed by the governor in the regular session, which has now, to a large degree, been shifted over to the PUC and to ERCOT. There's over 30 rule-makings presently going on at the Public Utility Commission that's basically going to set out how this legislation is going to be implemented. 
And then there are a number of bills that have been filed right now in special session. So I'll address it this way. Special session, the governor did not include electric issues in the charge -- and in the call rather. And the call is what limits the topics that can be addressed by the legislature. So we're monitoring what's going on in the legislature with these bills that relate to the electric industry, but we don't believe they're going anywhere without the charge or the call being changed, which we don't anticipate happening. 
So our focus really is more on the activities at the PUC where the rulemakings are going on. I talked about this, I think, during the investor call. There are quite a few bills, a bunch of rulemakings, a lot of them have to do with PUC and ERCOT issues. There's some coordination between agencies and industry participants. And then there's some general calls for weatherization and things like that. So we'll have to see. It's too early to predict what's going to come out of those rulemakings just at the beginning. But to the extent anything comes out of that, that would be incremental to what we have in our CapEx plan right now. 
The other thing that I mentioned in the investor call, there was another bill that was not related to winter storm Uri but it added an economic benefit test to the transmission approval process at ERCOT. And we think that has the potential to potentially allow us to get more projects, economic projects through ERCOT, but again, we'll have to wait and see how that all shakes out before we know for sure. And that's my answer."

It's something we always look at when we're putting together a rate case. We're probably about even with CenterPoint and AP right now. But now we've got a little time going into June of next year, something we'll spend a lot of time on, figure out what we can accomplish. 
We have a long, long history, as I've said many times on these calls, of working with all the constituents in our cases. And that was demonstrated again by the support we got for pushing this rate case off. And we'll see what we can accomplish. Yes, Uri, things like that, certainly impact our thoughts and our analysis. And -- but yes, maybe cart before the horse a little bit right now seeing as we won't go until June of next year."

So obviously, there are opportunities there around energy efficiency. Primarily at SDG&E, a big focus on long-duration battery storage, which is desperately needed in the state. And the state has circled at about 11.5-gigawatt opportunity for new resources. 
What you're referring to is on the unregulated cyber business in Sempra Infrastructure. You'll recall that Justin Bird is leading 3 separate P&Ls with Tanya and the team, one of which is clean power. So we do have about 3 gigawatts of development opportunities on the border. And we did preview a very interesting project, by the way, at the Investor Day, which is our battery storage projects. You may recall, we have the combined cycle plant on the border. We've got 2 underutilized transmission systems that dispatch directly into the California independent system operator. And that thermal plant also has a second plant that was targeted 15 years ago for construction. We've got all the transmission in place, and that's been redesignated as a 500-megawatt opportunity for battery storage. 
So our goal is to be able to dispatch out of Northern Mexico with both wind and solar resources, backed up and supported with its own resource adequacy from its battery production. So you're making a great point. That is an opportunity. We're going to be active to pursue it."

I want to start today by thanking those that attended our virtual Investor Day this past June, and I'll also mention that the team and I really enjoyed getting back on the road this past month and seeing many of you in person. As we discussed at our Investor Day, we've simplified our business model, narrowed our investment strategy to attractive markets and improved capital discipline, all with the goal of offering a competitive value proposition, including: consistent and attractive returns, strong earnings visibility and EPS growth and a sustainable and growing dividend.  Additionally, at the Investor Day, Allen and I highlighted the robust growth that Oncor continues to see all across its service territory. And as a result, Oncor is increasing its capital plan, which Trevor describes in further detail later in today's presentation.  
Shifting now to the quarter. I'm pleased with our financial results, and I think it's a testament to the affirmative steps we've taken to simplify our business model and focus our capital investments on top-tier infrastructure growth platforms. We're reporting strong earnings and affirming both our increased 2021 adjusted EPS guidance range and our 2022 EPS guidance range. I'm excited about the progress we've made so far this year, and I'm proud of the broad support we're seeing all across our operating businesses. Now please turn to the next slide, where I'll turn the call over to Trevor to provide both business and financial updates."
120622,1674086535,2365198,"Sempra, Q2 2021 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2021",2021-08-05,"Earnings Calls","Sempra","Executives","Thanks, Jeff.

To begin, we have had several positive developments at our operating companies this past quarter. At SDG&E, in July, we received CPUC approval for our 2021 wildfire mitigation plan update, building on the utility's long-standing commitment to advance fire hardening and public safety. SoCalGas began flowing renewable natural gas at 2 additional biomethane projects in support of their goal to provide 20% RNG to core customers by 2030 to help the state reach its decarbonization goals.  
In Texas, Oncor has provided visibility to their 2022 to 2026 projected capital plan, which has increased to approximately $14 billion over the 5-year period. Additionally, Oncor did receive PUCT approval to extend its rate case filing deadline to June 1, 2022. At Sempra Infrastructure, we completed the exchange offer for IEnova's shares, resulting in a 96.4% ownership interest, and we plan to launch a cash tender offer for the remaining 3.6% interest. We're also advancing the sale of the noncontrolling interest in Sempra Infrastructure Partners to KKR. And while I may have been a bit optimistic at Investor Day, we now expect to close the transaction around the end of the third quarter, subject to the Mexican Competition Commission completing its economic and market analysis and issuing the regulatory approval.  
With that, please turn to the next slide for more details around Oncor's capital plan update. Oncor continues to operate in one of the fastest-growing states with strong macro fundamentals. As a result, Oncor is announcing its 2022 to 2026 projected capital plan of approximately $14 billion, nearly a $2 billion increase over the 2021 to 2025 capital plan. Furthermore, Oncor is increasing its 2021 to 2022 capital plan by approximately $425 million, consistent with what Allen outlined at the Investor Day and is largely incorporated in the new $14 billion 5-year capital plan.  
Oncor's robust capital plan supports the economic development seen throughout its service territory, increases in generation interconnection requests, strong premise growth and investments in grid resiliency. A good example of this robust growth can be seen in new relocations, expansions and electric service to Oncor's system, which are on pace to exceed 2020 values by 70% and to exceed 2019 values by 170%.  
Please turn to the next slide where I will review the financial results. Earlier this morning, we reported second quarter 2021 GAAP earnings of $424 million or $1.37 per share. This compares to second quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $2,239,000,000 or $7.61 per share. On an adjusted basis, second quarter 2021 earnings were $504 million or $1.63 per share. This compares to our second quarter 2020 adjusted earnings of $501 million or $1.71 per share.  
On a year-to-date basis, 2021 GAAP earnings were $1,298,000,000 or $4.24 per share. This compares to year-to-date 2020 GAAP earnings of $2,999,000,000 or $9.91 per share. Adjusted year-to-date 2021 earnings were $1,404,000,000 or $4.58 per share. This compares to our year-to-date 2020 adjusted earnings of $1,242,000,000 or $4.20 per share.  
Please turn to the next slide. The variance in the second quarter 2021 adjusted earnings compared to the same period last year was affected by the following key items: $126 million from a CPUC decision that resulted in the release of a regulatory liability at the California utilities in 2020 related to prior year's forecasting differences that are not subject to tracking in the income tax expense memorandum account; and $22 million of lower earnings due to the sale of our Peruvian and Chilean businesses in April and June of 2020, respectively. This was more than offset by: $38 million higher equity earnings from the Cameron LNG JV, primarily due to Phase 1 achieving full commercial operations in August of 2020; $35 million of lower losses at Parent and Other, primarily due to lower preferred dividends and lower net interest expense; $34 million of higher income tax benefits from forecasted flow-through items at SDG&E and SoCalGas; and $22 million income tax benefit in 2021 from the remeasurement of certain deferred income taxes at Sempra LNG.  
Please turn to the next slide. We're pleased with our strong operational and financial performance this quarter and are focused on continuing to execute throughout the remainder of the year. And with that, this concludes our prepared remarks, so I now will stop, and we can take your questions."

To be able to produce $4.58 of adjusted EPS in the first half, I think, is an extraordinary outcome. And that does cause us to be fairly bullish against our increased guidance for 2021. And we certainly think there will be some pull-through of that strength into 2022. And I think it's a function of the growth that we're seeing in front of all 3 platforms. I think there's a portfolio of opportunities here in California and in Texas in the Sempra Infrastructure, which really highlights why we need to perform and execute well. I could not be more pleased. We obviously did this transaction back in March of 2018 with Oncor. We forecasted internally with our Board that there would be increased capital opportunities. We were pleased at the time, that they had a $7.4 billion commitment to the regulator about their capital program.  
In November of 2017, they launched a great CIS program. What we were not prepared for was the quality of that management team. So Allen Nye is on the call with us today. Don Clevenger, who's the CFO; Matt Henry, the General Counsel; and Jim Greer, the COO, they are knocking the socks off of it, by prioritizing what we think is most important at Sempra, which is strength of operations and safety.  
More to your point on what we can expect next year, you did raise cost of capital. We talked a little bit about that at the analyst conference. And in our assumptions for 2022, we indicated that we did not expect in those assumptions to include any type of triggering at SDG&E or SoCalGas. But we did mention, Shar, that if there is a trigger to occur, which looks more likely now, it would probably be limited only to SDG&E. And within the confines of that business, Kevin Sagara and his team thinks that they can limit the impact to that forward guidance to roughly $0.05 to $0.10.  
So I would just summarize by saying the first half of this year caused us great optimism for our performance even against the increased guidance we provided for this year. I will be disappointed if we're not back in front of our investors, taking an increased view of what our performance might be in 2021. We do expect some of that pull-through to continue into 2022. We're obviously not prepared to revise the guidance for 2022 yet, largely because this cost of capital mechanism is still out there. But we think at least at SDG&E, it's well managed to something around $0.05 to $0.10 of impact."

Let me kind of take a step back and take a little broader view and I'll come right back to your question. We talked a little bit at Investor Day about our focus right now is on making sure that ECA Phase 1 is delivered on time and on budget. We have that coming into our planning period in the second half of 2024 and that's proceeding quite well. We've been managing the COVID environment down there and the work environment, and we remain optimistic about continuing to meet that deadline.  
Secondly, I think we have been consistent really over the last 18 months about continuing to have a more bullish view on Cameron expansion. We're working closely with Mitsui, Mitsubishi and Total. We will continue to have those conversations throughout the fall. We do think that project will have superior returns, which is one of the questions you're indicating. And that's largely because at a high level, you can always expect the economics of brownfield projects to be generally superior to greenfield projects. And the key for greenfield projects like Port Arthur is it's much more advantageous to do that project at multiple phases at scale, which makes it increasingly more economic.  
But right now, bringing online Train 4 at Cameron is a top priority for Justin and Faisel and the team. And being able to do that, Shar, at the same time that you debottleneck Trains 1, 2 and 3, really adds to its cost advantage. And you mentioned Port Arthur. That continues to be a remarkably well-situated site. The team is going to ground right now to make it more competitive, and we've outlined some of the steps that were taken to reduce the emissions profile.  
And I think the recent announcement regarding the Polish oil and gas company really is a reflection of the strength, number one, of that customer relationship and their confidence in our ability to deliver them into a project that meets their long-term needs. So I think that relationship's in good stead. I certainly think ECA 1 is going well. We continue to be quite bullish on Cameron expansion. And Port Arthur is probably a longer-term opportunity, but we have more work to be done there."

But let me just start with a couple of highlight points. Number one, Jeremy, the growth that we're talking about and the adjustments to the [indiscernible] program are really around number one, strong premise growth; number two, active transmission interconnection requests, primarily focused on renewables and some baseload generation and new T&D investments.  
In terms of the timing around revising our plan, we had a Board meeting in Oncor last week. Allen is very good about bringing back to the Board not only the approval of next year's plan for 2022 but taking the opportunity to review longer term what the opportunity really was to meet some of the growth needs in Texas. So we feel quite bullish about that opportunity.  
I would add 1 final comment. We've seen some questions earlier this morning. But the raised expectation that Allen's team has put forward, and they've also got a press release out that provides more detail, does not impact the continued expectation of incremental capital in the $775 million range to $1.27 billion. So we've had the opportunity to reevaluate the needs of that business and the needs of our customers over the next 5 years. We'll go into the fall planning cycle with the view toward updating our Board in October -- in November. But I thought the opportunity here was really one of providing our latest view as transparently as possible to the Street. Allen, I know I covered a number of these points, but I think if you don't mind, talk a little bit more detail about the growth that you're seeing across your system and maybe kind of your approach to governance with your Board last week."

We also took this opportunity to let you all know that we're seeing some opportunities this year, and so we've upped our 2021 from 2.4, which is what we previously had told you all, to 2.5. And then just given the fact that we're going to go ahead and talking about increasing '21 and '22, we had the opportunity to discuss with our Board, things we're seeing some of this growth that Jeff is talking about. And so we've been spending a lot of time on CapEx here at Oncor because of what we're seeing.  
And what we're seeing is, to Jeff's point, and Trevor talked about it earlier, premise growth last year, we had the largest organic growth rate ever in our company's history. And we're on pace this year through 2 quarters. Both quarters this year were higher than the corresponding quarters last year. Transmission points of interconnection on both the retail and the generation side are above the levels end of year last year and above the similar quarters of last year.  
The economic development, which I think is in Trevor's earlier remarks, economic development's another thing we look at. Request for information, which are basically project location-specific discussions we're having with potential builders, are up 72% approximately year-over-year.  
And then I always talk about West Texas when we're talking about growth. The West Texas story continues to be really strong. The latest trend is electrification of fields, people considering ESG ramifications, emissions. So we're getting some uptick there, but we have another peak on our Culberson Loop transmission system, in July, hit 760 megawatts versus 678 last year. That's an all-time high. Another peak in the Far West Texas weather zone in June. So we're seeing growth all over our system, really strong, which leads to these CapEx discussions we're having.  
And since I told you all at the investor call, our investor meeting that we are going to address '22 with our Board in July. And since we've adjusted '21 up, we thought now is a good opportunity to just provide you all with our expectations as a management team of what we're seeing with regard to those outer years. And those outer years, as you can see in our documents are, we're looking at 2.7 to 3.0 for the 4 years of the -- outer years of the plan.  
And that's our expectation right now. But as Jeff said, we're going to go into October, like we always do, and have our meeting on our 5-year plan with our shareholders and with our independent directors and with our Board. And we're going to review the information available to us at that time. And we'll have a number then, it may be 14, it may be something else. We feel very good about 14 right now. And we'll see where we are when we get to October and we'll have something to announce after that.  
To Jeff's point as well, we added about $1.8 billion to our 5-year expectation right now. The incremental capital that we have talked about in previous meetings and investor calls, in the range of $775 million to $1.275 billion, which I think was on Page 45 of the investor deck, last time we talked, that remains available. We have -- sometimes, we move projects from that incremental kind of bucket into our CapEx plan, sometimes they have CapEx that comes from outside that incremental bucket and it goes into our plan.  
But notwithstanding the fact that we've raised to, right now our expectation to around $14 billion over 5, there are significant -- there remain significant opportunities to invest on our system and those additional opportunities are in part reflected in that incremental CapEx bucket that we discussed before. I'll be glad to answer any of the questions, but thanks a lot."

And now we're outlining something that looks like on the back end of the plan that could be looking more like $3 billion a year. So that's an almost doubling of the average output in terms of CapEx at that company. So we're very pleased with the growth in the state.

So electrification's going to be a long-term secular trend. We certainly have the opportunity to play that in a big way, just as Allen described, in Texas. We expect to be a leader in that market in connecting renewable grid solutions to our -- to load centers.  
Here in California, we did something that no one else has done across this country. We made a commitment that we would deliver roughly 20% of all of the natural gas delivered on the SoCalGas system by 2030 using renewable natural gas. You may have seen the press release in the last week or so. We just connected 2 new biomethane plants to our system. So whether it's a transportation opportunity, whether it's a maritime opportunity or an opportunity to basically deliver renewable natural gas across our network, it's a priority.  
We have set a goal of being at the 5% level next year. We remain on track to hit that goal. Scott Drew and his team are doing a hell of a job at SoCalGas, to transform that business. And by doing so, as you know, exogenous methane in the environment has an 80x higher detriment than gas, which is combusted in ordinary course. And there has been some exciting developments, I think, in terms of how the commission and the other stakeholders in the state view RNG.

And yes, as you might expect, we've had a great run so far with the low carbon fuel standard in this state, creating a good amount of demand for RNG, but I think to go to the next level and help meet the state's very ambitious climate goals. We saw that the legislature passed SB 1440 and then recently, the PUC staff -- this PUC Energy Division issued a staff report recommending, essentially an RPS for RNG for the California utilities. And really, the levels are based on the California statutory obligation to divert organic waste from landfills. 
So when you look out to 2025, they're supposed to procure -- the utilities are supposed to procure biomethane from organic waste equal to about 75% of the state's obligation to divert this waste from landfills, which is about 5.5% of core load. And by 2030, that goes up to about 12.3% of core load. So you asked about creating more demand, that would be a good opportunity. That staff report hasn't yet been acted upon but we are hopeful that it does shortly."

Well, look, this is a great opportunity to go back and talk about our base business model, right? We're a T&D company, right? So one of the things that has privileged our commitment to California and our commitment to Texas is, we've moved away from being an owner and operator of electric generation, either fossil or renewable, with the exception of Mexico. And likewise, we don't have a lot of exposure because we're decoupled whether consumers consume more or less. So we very much like that sweet spot of building that kind of long-term growing bond portfolio and not being exposed to those issues. 
In terms of capital opportunities, there has been a new announcement in the state where they're looking for 11.5 gigawatts of new capacity additions in terms of generation, energy efficiency and long-duration storage. And we certainly think long-duration storage in particular, is a unique opportunity where we've developed a capability there at San Diego Gas & Electric, and that will be a continued opportunity. But in the near term, the state is really being aggressive about making sure we find more needs, more ways of supporting our resource adequacy. 
And I think one of the great challenges, Jeremy, is traditionally during some of its highest demand times of the year, we're importing about 25% of the state's power needs from outside of California, and it always makes us subject to what's taking place in those other jurisdictions and what their demand needs are. So over a long period of time, California has got to take steps. It's going to take 5 to 7 years to get ahead of these demand needs through new capacity additions."

We feel good about the contract at ECA but that would be a near-term focus for us. 
In terms of input costs for future projects, that goes through our whole FEED and pre-FEED process to make sure we get to the right number. But I think it does go back to this issue, Michael, that greenfield projects, which tend to have a little bit of a higher per-unit cost than brownfield projects, this will continue to put pressure on that dichotomy. But keep in mind that all the other projects in the world are subject to those same cost pressures, right? So at the same time that you're seeing cost pressures around construction, you're still seeing a lot higher LNG spot prices around the world. 
And most people who are observing this industry think it will be the most dominant fuel used in the world by the early part of next decade. And the only way that's going to occur is, is you're going to see a massive build-out of continued LNG development, and the United States should expect to take its fair share."

In other words, there are some inflationary and competitive pressures to access the equipment and materials they need to meet their growth needs in the state. And they deserve a lot of credit for being proactive, to go ahead and secure and lap those resources well in advance. But I don't think beyond that, it's had any influence in terms of how we're thinking about the recast over 5 years.

Thanks, Jeff. Yes, I agree with that, the answer on the inflation. And with regards to legislation, there's kind of 2 things to think about here. There's what was passed and has been signed by the governor in the regular session, which has now, to a large degree, been shifted over to the PUC and to ERCOT. There's over 30 rule-makings presently going on at the Public Utility Commission that's basically going to set out how this legislation is going to be implemented. 
And then there are a number of bills that have been filed right now in special session. So I'll address it this way: special session, the governor did not include electric issues in the charge -- in the call, rather. And the call is what limits the topics that can be addressed by the legislature. So we're monitoring what's going on in the legislature with these bills that relate to the electric industry, but we don't believe they're going anywhere without the charge or the call being changed, which we don't anticipate happening. 
So our focus really is more on the activities at the PUC where the rulemakings are going on. I talked about this, I think, during the investor call. There are quite a few bills, a bunch of rulemakings, a lot of them have to do with PUC and ERCOT issues. There's some coordination between agencies and industry participants. And then there's some general calls for weatherization and things like that. So we'll have to see. It's too early to predict what's going to come out of those rulemakings, they're just at the beginning. But to the extent anything comes out of that, that would be incremental to what we have in our CapEx plan right now. 
The other thing that I mentioned in the investor call, there was another bill that was not related to winter storm Uri, but it added an economics benefit test to the transmission approval process at ERCOT.

So as you think about in California, the blackouts that happened last summer, you think about how we operated through the pandemic here in California and in Texas and you think about storm Uri, which you referenced, all we've really done is raise our guidance and exceed our guidance, right? So this is the strength of having a T&D model that we think gives us unique visibility to consistent financial performance. 
So I just want to make that point because, we talk very consistently about the value of the model that we're pursuing, and why we think it deserves a higher valuation.

So obviously, there are opportunities there around energy efficiency. Primarily at SDG&E, a big focus on long-duration battery storage, which is desperately needed in the state. And the state has circled at about 11.5-gigawatt opportunity for new resources. 
What you're referring to is on the unregulated cyber business in Sempra Infrastructure. You'll recall that Justin Bird is leading 3 separate P&Ls with Tanya and the team, one of which is clean power. So we do have about 3 gigawatts of development opportunities on the border. And we did preview a very interesting project, by the way, at the Investor Day, which is our battery storage projects. You may recall, we have a combined cycle plant on the border. We've got 2 underutilized transmission systems that dispatch directly into the California independent system operator. And that thermal plant also has a second plant that was targeted 15 years ago for construction. We've got all the transmission in place, and that's been redesignated as a 500-megawatt opportunity for battery storage. 
So our goal is to be able to dispatch out of Northern Mexico with both wind and solar resources, backed up and supported with its own resource adequacy from its battery production. So you're making a great point. That is an opportunity. We're going to be active to pursue it."

Several years ago, we revised our business strategy to narrow the focus of the company to invest in an energy infrastructure and markets where we expect high growth.

Several years ago, we revised our business strategy to narrow the focus of the company to invest in an energy infrastructure and markets where we expect high growth. Today, there's a growing recognition about why these types of investments are increasingly important. Whether it's the current dislocation in European energy markets or high prices for LNG in Asia or even challenging weather events here at home that call for greater resiliency, new investments in energy infrastructure are certainly needed. Bipartisan support in Washington for the pending infrastructure bill provides further validation of this trend. 
In addition to help meet the needs of the market, at Sempra, we certainly believe energy infrastructure right here in North America is a key driver of job creation, economic growth and competitiveness across the economy. Moreover, maintaining a modern, flexible and secure network of electric transmission and distribution lines, natural gas pipelines and storage facilities is essential to delivering affordable and increasingly clean energy to U.S. businesses and consumers while promoting growth across all sectors of our economy. 
Against that backdrop, we'll provide a business update today on the key activities in our California and Texas utilities. Also, Justin Bird, our new CEO of Sempra Infrastructure, will provide an update on how he's organized that business to capture exciting new growth opportunities. This will be followed by a summary of our financial performance. 
As an overview for the quarter, our strategic focus on investing in energy infrastructure across each of our 3 growth platforms, together with a commitment to operational excellence, continue to drive strong financial performance. As you know, we have a long track record of continuing to raise our guidance and then working hard to meet or exceed that guidance. This is a result of our high-performing culture and continuous focus on improving the quality of our operations. As a result of these efforts, we expect to be at the upper end of our full year 2021 adjusted EPS guidance range and we're reaffirming our full year 2022 EPS guidance range. 
Now please turn to the next slide, where Justin and I will provide business updates. Let me start with our California utilities. In August, SDG&E filed an off-cycle application with the CPUC to update its cost of capital effective January 1, 2022. This application would increase SDG&E's equity ratio from 52% to 54%, ROE from 10.2% to 10.55% while also lowering cost of debt from 4.59% to 3.84%. The application, if accepted by the CPUC, would supersede the automatic cost of capital adjustment mechanism. In terms of timing, SDG&E has requested a decision in the first half of 2022. 
Also at SoCalGas, we recently announced agreements expected to resolve substantially all material civil litigation against SoCalGas and Sempra related to the 2015 Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility leak with net after-tax cash flows for SoCalGas expected to ultimately be up to $895 million after taking into consideration collection of existing insurance receivables and other adjustments. These agreements are important milestones that will help the community and our company work toward putting this difficult chapter behind us. 
In addition, last month, SoCalGas issued an important technical analysis underscoring the essential role of clean fuel networks that leverage existing gas infrastructure to help California achieve its net zero goals and, more importantly, to do so more affordably and more efficiently than other alternatives. 
Moving now to Texas. Oncor announced its updated 2022 to 2026 capital plan of approximately $15 billion. It's important to note that this plan is a $2.8 billion increase over its 2021 to 2025 capital plan that was presented at the 2021 Investor Day in June. At Sempra Infrastructure, we recently finalized a series of transactions, including the sale of a noncontrolling interest to KKR, completing the exchange offer and subsequent cash tender offer to purchase the publicly-owned IEnova shares and delisting IEnova shares from the Mexican Stock Exchange. 
Additionally, I'd like to note related to the formation of Sempra Infrastructure, we've updated our GAAP guidance range for 2021 to include items expected to be reflected in our fourth quarter results. You can find the GAAP reconciliation in the appendix to the slide deck. 
Please turn to the next slide. Before I hand the call over to Justin, I want to make 1 follow-on point about Oncor. We've talked a lot in the past about being in the most attractive energy markets in North America, and Texas is certainly an example. Oncor today operates in one of the fastest-growing markets in the country, with some forecasts estimating that the Texas population will nearly double by 2050. With strong macro fundamentals across its service territory, Oncor just announced a record-high 5-year capital plan of $15 billion. This capital plan is primarily earmarked to meet load growth, with 2/3 of the plan dedicated to expansions of the company's transmission and distribution network. 
Oncor's robust projected capital plan and rate base figures are expected to support economic development across its service territory, increases in generation interconnections, strong premise growth and critical new investments in grid modernization and resiliency. And finally, Oncor now expects to grow its rate base to nearly $28 billion by 2026, which reflects a compound annual growth rate of about 8% over the 5-year period. The growth the company is experiencing is just remarkable. Please turn to the next slide, where I'll pass the call over to Justin to review the latest updates at Sempra Infrastructure."

I'm excited to present the newly formed Sempra Infrastructure platform. We expect the formation of Sempra Infrastructure, along with the financial strength of KKR, to give us added scale to execute on a wide range of energy infrastructure opportunities across Sempra Infrastructure's 3 business lines. 
Since closing this transaction a month ago, we're already seeing the benefits of combining the 2 organizations through financial synergies and commercial optimization. For example, we've been able to restack our capital structure to create meaningful cost savings. To capture new development opportunities, we've organized into 3 business lines: LNG and net-zero solutions, energy networks and clean power. We expect this structure will enhance growth and quality execution. 
This also strategically positions us to benefit from North America's continued trend towards a clean energy transition by optimizing the natural partnership between natural gas and renewables to help meet decarbonization goals here in North America and abroad. Energy infrastructure, as Jeff described at the top of today's call, is the focus of our development program. 
Now please turn to the next slide, where I'll briefly discuss how we're advancing growth in each of our business lines. First, at LNG and net-zero solutions, the LNG market has recovered quite dramatically as evidenced by the spot market with record high prices being seen in Europe and Asia and a recent uptick in long-term contracting activity around the world. With that constructive backdrop, our LNG development portfolio is expected to benefit from the strategic advantage of being situated on both the Pacific and Gulf Coast with direct access to both Asian and European markets. 
As a reminder, ECA LNG Phase 1 was the only LNG export project in the world to take a final investment decision last year, which reinforces the competitive advantage of brownfield sites that can dispatch into the Atlantic and Pacific basins. Now looking forward, we remain focused on the construction of ECA LNG Phase 1, working with our partners to optimize Cameron LNG's current operations as well as the development of the Cameron LNG expansion and, finally, working on an exciting new Pacific opportunity in Topolobampo, Mexico called Vista Pacifico LNG. 
At ECA LNG Phase 1, engineering, equipment fabrication and site preparation are well underway. The project is on time and on budget, and we continue to expect first LNG production by the end of 2024. At Cameron LNG, the current facility is running well and hit record production levels during the month of October. Together with our partners, we're developing a projected 7 million [ tons ] per annum expansion project, benefiting from 1 million tons per annum of debottlenecking Trains 1 to 3. With innovations in train design, coupled with the high performance of Trains 1 through 3, we expect this to be a very competitive, capital-efficient expansion. 
In terms of next steps, we plan to move to FEED early next year, to file an amendment with FERC to build Train 4 with electric drives in order to reduce Scope 1 emissions and to work closely with our partners as we advance towards FID. Lastly, Vista Pacifico LNG is a new development project located adjacent to our Topolobambo refined products terminal. This new project is expected to be a mid-scale facility connected to 2 existing pipelines, one of them being the high-pressure pipeline system we own in SONORA. The project would source lower-cost natural gas from the Permian Basin for export to high-demand Asian markets. 
At our energy networks and clean power businesses, I'd like to highlight 2 important projects: the expansion of the GRO pipeline and the expansion of our ESJ wind farm. The GRO expansion is a pipeline project in development that is expected to increase gas delivery capacity to the Baja Peninsula and play a critical role in supplying gas to the ECA LNG Phase 1 project. We continue to advance a series of our cross-border renewable projects that are expected to dispatch directly into California. 
Specifically, the ESJ expansion leverages the existing power transmission capacity that we own on the U.S. and Mexico border. We're the only company that owns cross-border transmission lines that can connect into the California electric grid and that allow us to have a competitive advantage in helping the state meet its growing need for new renewable energy resources. 
I'm excited about the team we've put together and about the business we're building. It's a unique opportunity. We're well situated to compete, and we certainly expect to play a crucial role in investing in energy infrastructure right here in North America that supports the global energy transition. Please turn to the next slide where I'll pass the call to Trevor to review our financial results."

This compares to our third quarter 2020 adjusted earnings of $432 million or $1.49 per share. 
Please turn to the next slide. The variance in the third quarter 2021 adjusted earnings compared to the same period last year was affected by the following key items: $35 million of higher earnings at Sempra Mexico due to higher ownership of IEnova; $35 million of higher CPUC base operating margin, net of operating expenses at SDG&E and SoCalGas; $29 million of lower losses at Parent and Other, primarily due to lower preferred dividends; and $29 million related to the energy efficiency program refund in the third quarter of 2020 at SDG&E.

Also importantly, we're seeing higher forward curves over the next few years for deliveries into Asia and Europe. And I'd say the final thing that we're seeing that I think is important is you're seeing China is reentering the long-term market. 
We are seeing a real uptick in our discussions both in Asia and Europe and frankly, as well as South America. So I think we're going to see some exciting things coming out of our LNG portfolio, and we should benefit from this constructive market backdrop. Again, we think we have a competitive advantage, the ability to dispatch directly into Europe and Asia. And again, over the long term, it's nice to see that we still see demand for LNG growing mid- to high single digits, which supports our long-term very bullish view on LNG development."

We're actually quite constructive on California. A couple of things I'd mention. As you may have seen the decision yesterday where the PUC approved increasing the capacity utilization at Aliso Canyon. I think they increased it from roughly 34 Bcf to 41 Bcf. And I would tell you, we are certainly committed to supporting a much cleaner economy in California. 
But the expectations today, Jeremy, is that traditionally, California uses roughly 39% to 41% of natural gas for its electricity production in the winter time. Because of low hydro levels, I think there's much more focus now on that being closer to 45%. We could see record utilization of natural gas here in California in the winter. I think the PUC decision kind of reflects that. 
More broadly, I think both SoCalGas and SDG&E have made a commitment to be a leader in the clean energy transition. And this is going to inform not only our current investments but how we're stacking capital investments going to the GRC next year. And Kevin, maybe you can talk about some of the things that you're seeing around battery storage and other things that could be near-term opportunities for SDG&E."

And so at SDG&E, we're seeing a big push in the state, given what we've seen in the last couple of tight summers around more storage capacity, more generation capacity, I think SDG&E will have some filings in the next few weeks around more utility-owned battery storage. 
I think you'll also see a lot more activity in the coming months and years around electric vehicles, too. California has made a lot of bold commitments to move much more strongly towards electric vehicles. And I think you'll see a lot of grid enhancements and grid modifications in that area. But I'd also remind you that climate resilience is a big thing here, and so there continues to be a lot of wildfire mitigation opportunities to invest capital as well."

What I would probably say is in this midstream space, we target mid-double-digit levered type of returns. We think those are consistent across all those. Interestingly, on the clean power side, you may recall that we've seen returns come in here in the United States. It's one of the reasons we exited that business 2 or 3 years ago. 
In Mexico, because of our border position and the access we have to 2 very important transmission lines that bring power into the United States, we think we have a real competitive advantage in that region. So we expect relatively higher returns in which you might find in renewables here in the United States. So I would stick to say and overall, Justin's portfolio is going to manage toward mid-double-digit equity returns. 
One other thing I'll mention, too, to the broader LNG story. Justin and I got back from a recent trip to Europe, where we visited Warsaw and Dusseldorf and Berlin and Brussels and other places. There's a tremendous amount of recognition in Europe about the role for natural gas and specifically, LNG. And there's certainly a new risk premium being assigned to pipeline gas. There's even discussions at the highest level of the EU about creating a strategic natural gas reserve. We've got a team on the ground next week in Asia. So I think going back to the original point with Jeremy, there's a tremendous amount of conversations today, and I think this continues to reinforce our bullish case for LNG."

I think there's been a lot of interest as people have engaged with us over the last couple of months about having better visibility into Sempra's long-term growth rate. You've heard us talk about our track record in the past of growing this business, whether it's a 10-year period or 20-year period at an EPS growth rate of around 7% or 8%. 
I must tell you, we feel fairly confident in our ability to produce similar growth in the future over a 7- to 10-year period of time. And part of that is bolstered by this continued point that we make about the quality of the markets we're participating in, right? So you've got the #1 market in America is California and the #2 market is Texas. And I think Allen just has a remarkable story in Texas, which keeps getting better. 
And to your point, we're going to have an opportunity to restack our capital program here in California as part of our GRC filing next year. And I think you should expect to see us to make filing requests around many of the things that Allen's doing, which is around resiliency, modernization of the grid and making sure we're making those investments today that are -- ensure that our infrastructure is future-ready for what we need in the future, such as hydrogen and other things on the system. 
So we have a fairly clear pathway to grow the business in California, very similar to Texas. I think one of the things you're seeing on today's call is a pretty bullish case by Justin about what we can do in the separate infrastructure business as well."

The 5-year strip going back to June has increased about $2.8 billion for Allen's organization.

And maybe, Allen, it would be helpful if this is the right time to maybe do things for -- 2 things for our listening audience, Allen. Maybe talk a little bit about what's in your $15 billion CapEx plan, and separately, what's not in the plan related to future rulemaking and related to your incremental bucket, which I think is the nature of the question."

I mean, what we've done today is announced another $1 billion of Oncor CapEx over 5 years or $2.8 billion since the Investor Day, like Jeff said. That is really backed up by what Jeff mention",696,"Sure, Jeff. Yes, thanks. So I think you described it very well. I mean, what we've done today is announced another $1 billion of Oncor CapEx over 5 years or $2.8 billion since the Investor Day, like Jeff said. That is really backed up by what Jeff mentioned in his opening remarks, just tremendous growth that we can talk about across our system in a minute. 
But that 15% over 5 is our new plan. To Jeff's point, a couple of years ago, we introduced this idea that we had this other bucket, this incremental bucket of potential CapEx. And to Jeff's point, that incremental bucket, which we, I think, announced at $725 million to $1.275 billion remains there and available. And so how does that work? Well, what we do every year when we sit down with our Board and come up with what is now the $15 billion plan, there'll be some projects that come out of that incremental bucket and go into that $15 billion plan. 
However, at the same time, we're also looking out further on the horizon and seeing things that we think can be included in that second bucket, which is the incremental bucket. So that is separate and apart, as Jeff said. We have announced a 5-year $15 billion plan. That's where we are today. We, in addition, have another bucket, which remains around, I mean, these are estimates, of $725 million to $1.275 billion that is available. And in that incremental bucket, in case we get to this in a minute, are also things -- another thing that we've added to that bucket is potential CapEx related to legislative activities in Texas, and those fall in several categories. 
One is this possibility that we can participate a little bit in the storage market in Texas. There's 100 megawatts available for the entire state. So we think there is an opportunity there, about $20 million for RPs, and we're hopeful that, that will grow over time. The second bill, SB1281, which is related to CCNs and an economic benefit test specifically related to those CCNs, we think there's about probably $50 million a year in those incremental transmission projects. 
On the emergency generation side, I know there's been a lot of interest in that. We're working through acquiring some capital leases on the emergency generation side right now. We're planning on having about 10 megawatts under contract by January 1. The CapEx impact of what we do on emergency gen, like several of these categories, will depend on how much we ultimately end up leasing. But right now, the -- we're seeing kind of 5-megawatt emergency gen, 2 to 5 megawatts around $2 million and bigger 30-megawatt kind of on the back of trailers around $10 million. So we'll make an appropriate and reasonable decision for our customers in the ERCOT market on how much of that we will acquire, and that will determine the ultimate CapEx impacts of emergency gen. 
Then on similar, that same bill also provides us the opportunity to acquire long lead time equipment that we might need for service restoration. We think we're probably around, what I would call, $10 million for a general kind of plant for 2022 with an additional potential $100 million on top of that for the remainder of the 5-year plan, $100 million worth of equipment. But again, that ultimate number is going to depend. $10 million on general equipment is 1 thing, but if we get into stack comps and SBCs and some of the larger equipment, that equipment goes from -- it can be anywhere from $50 million to $70 million per site. 
And so we're still looking at all these legislative opportunities. That's kind of just a general approach of what we're thinking right now on each of those. And as I said, these dollars associated with potential CapEx associated with the legislation coming out of Storm Uri are, right now, in our incremental bucket. But as we refine them, they will ultimately be moved at some point -- could be moved at some point into our 5-year plan. Jeff, is that what you're asking for?"

Of the $15 billion over 5 that we're talking about today, about 2/3 of that is growth-related, so new customers, more or less, or expansion of customers. Of the increase that we're talking about today, t",193,"You bet, Jeff. So here's how the rate impact works. Of the $15 billion over 5 that we're talking about today, about 2/3 of that is growth-related, so new customers, more or less, or expansion of customers. Of the increase that we're talking about today, the $1 billion increase, about 80% of that increase is directly related to growth. And I should mention also, 97% of that total amount of the $15 billion over 5 is tracker-eligible. 
So as we make these investments, keep in mind that we are presently the low-cost investor-owned utility in the state. We have the lowest rates of all the investor-owned utilities. We believe that because of the substantial growth we're seeing on our system, even after $15 billion over 5, we will remain the low-cost provider or at least close to the low-cost provider on the right side of that chart of the rates for all the investor-owned utilities. 
Generally, I think we're probably thinking rates could increase somewhat similar to inflation. But again, we're the low-cost provider now, and we believe we'll be the low-cost provider at the end of 5 years and $15 billion. Thanks."

I think back in 2018, you may remember, Stephen, that there was a lot of discussion around being in regulated businesses, unregulated businesses.

I think back in 2018, you may remember, Stephen, that there was a lot of discussion around being in regulated businesses, unregulated businesses. And I think we took the opportunity to kind of redefine an investment class that said at the end of the day, these are all energy infrastructure investments. And how you make money may be different in the regulated framework versus outside the regulated framework. 
And we really went to ground this idea of being ahead of others in defining the markets where energy infrastructure would grow the most. And I think in my opening remarks today, I tried to really emphasize the point that energy infrastructure is quite hot in Europe and Asia and the United States. I think it was really well positioned. And the infrastructure bill that you're referring to is certainly strong confirmation bias of the importance of this to the United States. 
And there's really a tailwind for Sempra around this clean energy transition. So 4 topics, I think, come out of today's bill could pass as early today out of the House, one of which is we're tracking the private activity bonds. These are ones that allow you to finance carbon sequestration and carbon storage devices. We think that's important for the sector. The IEA says there will not be a net zero 2050 without carbon sequestration. And that's one of the reasons that Justin's business is focusing on this opportunity. 
Second, to your very point, green hydrogen is a big part of our country's future. We've made a decision to participate in all the appropriate trade associations. We've got something like 10 to 12 different R&D projects in hydrogen today. But specifically in the legislation, the bill contemplates 4 regional hydrogen hubs in the country. We think this will be important as you think about distribution centers. And 1 thing that people sometimes miss, Stephen, is the #1 manufacturing facility in the United States, by a wide margin, is the L.A. Basin, and the #1 industrial segment for the United States is the Gulf region between Texas and Louisiana. 
So both of these are areas that geographically, we have a vested interest in. I think we've got a leadership interest in. So I think hydrogen in both of those markets will be important. Two other quick points from today's bill. One is the focus on wildfire management. We talk about this, Stephen, a lot in California. It's obviously a Western region issue. It's an issue today in Europe and Australia and Ukraine in different parts of the world. But the bill does contemplate support for vegetation management and improving resiliency, which is a very important topic here in California. 
And lastly, there's a lot of focus on the bill in electric vehicles. Trevor and I participated in the strategy session with Allen's Board last week in Texas. The electric vehicle market in Texas is enormous. Today, there's about 30,000 vehicles on Oncor's system. In comparison, we're 1/20th the size of Oncor's system here at SDG&E, and they've got 70,000 vehicles on our system. So I think electric vehicles will be very, very important.

Helpful to kind of understand the areas you're focused on. And shifting gears just back to LNG. You raised a lot of good points earlier about the strength of this market, the excitement around this market and you guys are well positioned. Does that sort of level of excitement globally provide additional opportunities to either monetize some of your assets or to find just very low-cost ways, low cost of capital ways to pursue additional growth like the additional opportunity in Mexico you mentioned? In other words, could this be both a way to monetize as well as sort of use other people's money to help achieve better growth and better returns overall?"

One of the things I would start with saying is the priority of our capital program is our U.S. utilities. And what we want to do is be able to grow our utilities at a rate faster than our peers and do that without coming back to the capital markets to issue Sempra equity. And that's one of the reasons that the KKR transaction was so important. It gave us a chance to crystallize and highlight value in that business and recycle capital back into reducing parent debt and meeting some of the capital needs like Allen described today. 
But I would tell you, I don't think we're finished, right? That business now has been valued at roughly an enterprise value of $25 billion. So we think about going forward, we think there will be strategic opportunities to bring that business to the market. Those are conversations we would obviously have with KKR. And to your point, if we have the chance to further diversify the capital structure at higher valuations, that's something you should look for us to do. 
And we will be looking under Faisel and Justin's leadership at bringing in project equity on some of these projects to reduce the call of capital from Sempra Infrastructure. But right now, they're very, very focused on growth and there's a lot of enthusiasm of what they think they can accomplish."

I would remind you that the SoCalGas mechanism did not trigger. We're going to follow this closely. I think the key gating item that everyone in the state is following is the forthcoming scoping memo that we expect from the commission. 
But in terms of forward guidance, what we've indicated in the past, Michael, was that whether we get the automatic triggering mechanism or whether our application is approved, it's contemplated within our guidance for next year. And because of some other steps that the business has taken to mitigate and become more -- mitigate costs and become more efficient, it's probably in the range of $0.05 to $0.10 either way, but well within our guidance range. And we would not expect to update guidance independent of that outcome. 
And then, Justin, I think a lot of times, particularly in domestic LNG development, there's always issues related to pipeline development. I think it would be helpful to help our listening audience better understand what's unique about the pipeline system that supports Vista Pacifico."

Yes, Vista Pacifico would effectively source gas from the Permian from the U.S. basin and deliver it in the form of LNG to Asia. There are 2 existing pipelines that basically converge very close to the site, so there would be a very small spur-type pipeline that we would build that we connect based to Pacifico to existing pipelines, both of which are underutilized on a transmission capacity basis. 
So I think very little pipeline construction associated with this. This is part of the strategic location of the project is its proximity to pipelines and the fact that 2 of those pipelines are very underutilized."

I would start with your second question, which is KKR has their own infrastructure presence in Mexico, both on the refined product side of the value chain as well as with renewables. They are certainly collaborating with us constructively with CFE. So that's been helpful. 
I can make a couple of comments, too, Ryan, that because of our headquarters being here in San Diego, you'll recall that we've been investing pretty consistently down in Mexico for close to 25 years. And what excites us back then still excites us today is you've got about 130 million consumers. It's one of the fastest-growing consumer markets in the Western Hemisphere. And most importantly, it's the largest energy export partner for the United States at about 7 to 8 Bcf per day. 
I think even though we've got kind of leading scale and expertise at Sempra Infrastructure, we're still very selective about the projects we expect to invest in. And even the Vista Pacifico project that Justin was describing, those capacity releases on some of those pipelines that would be needed would come from the government. And this is really a government-sponsored project and one that they've been quite public about supporting from a permit and pipeline capacity standpoint. 
But pure issue, I think, it's quite topical that there are reforms being proposed in electricity market. I think you'll expect to see the lower house load on that in the fourth quarter, but it would not clear the legislature until probably April of next year and we handicap that into low probability. And what's interesting about this is, those reforms largely target, to the point you made, Ryan, generation assets that are connected to the CFE system. And today, we have a relatively small footprint in generation across all of Sempra because we're a T&D business. 
I think the electric investments in Mexico account for roughly 1% of our consolidated earnings, and more importantly, the vast majority of all those projects, something like 80% are on the border with California, are not connected to CFE and dispatched directly into the Cal ISO. 
But I would leave you with 1 thought, which is probably the most important. We made the decision several years ago that what we really want to do is help President López Obrador be successful. So the majority of our conversations are focused on ways that we can partner with his cabinet to make PEMEX be successful and make CFE be successful. So when you see us announce projects like Vista Pacifico is because those will be done largely in tandem with the objectives of the government. That's one of the reasons we still feel good about those types of projects in Mexico."

Number one is this issue of inflation are we seeing in terms of how we source our soft and hard cost at any of our projects, including our utilities. And we've got obviously some built-in mechanisms that help us with that on the utility side. In Justin's business, you recall that we're very reliant on EPC wrap contracts. So the procurement and exposure to costs, we shift that risk to the construction contractor, and that's why it's important that they have strong credit counterparties. 
But in terms of brownfield versus greenfield, I think the way I would answer that at a very general level is to say, brownfield projects always have a cost advantage, and greenfield projects can be also quite viable. Typically, they need to be done at scale and Port Arco will be an example of that. But coming back to our projects, think about this. For us to have the opportunity to turnkey 6 to 7 Bcf -- I mean, 6 to 7 MTPA at Cameron expansion, our view internally is it could be one of the lowest-cost projects for new capacity in the world. 
So our likelihood of going forward there, we account as being relatively high, and that's why we've got 100% of the MOUs in place to go to the next step and move to agreements and SPAs there. And then at Vista Pacifico, this is the type of project very similar to ECA Phase 1, our expectation is it will be oversubscribed. It is a greenfield project but the geographic location to be able to have direct pipeline access from 2 different pipelines to Waha and to be able to dispatch directly into the Pacific will be a tremendous and competitive advantage when we market that project."

I mean, it wasn't that they had an ongoing process just to update their plan. They were looking at issues in the market around inflation and how they saw supply chain issues in advance. So the real genesis of Allen updating CapEx guidance was he came back to the Board so that they can make forward purchases that allow them to keep their 2021 and 2022 capital plans in place. 
So what they were doing is they were reaching forward to source what they needed to execute those capital plans. So I think you would expect his team to do something very similar is they're watching the marketplace. If there's opportunities to adjust it, they will. And I think he made a great case for we didn't cannibalize that incremental bucket list. That's been replenished.

In terms of equity, we are very comfortable with the level we're at today with KKR. Certainly, if we saw opportunities to diversify the capital structure at Sempra Infrastructure at points in the future at higher valuations, we would evaluate that against the opportunity to bring in equity down to the project level.

Several years ago, we revised our business strategy to narrow the focus of the company to invest in an energy infrastructure and markets where we expect high growth. Today, there's a growing recognition about why these types of investmen",909,"Thank you, Nelly. Several years ago, we revised our business strategy to narrow the focus of the company to invest in an energy infrastructure and markets where we expect high growth. Today, there's a growing recognition about why these types of investments are increasingly important. Whether it's the current dislocation in European energy markets or high prices for LNG in Asia or even challenging weather events here at home that call for greater resiliency, new investments in energy infrastructure are certainly needed. Bipartisan support in Washington for the pending infrastructure bill provides further validation of this trend.  
In addition to help meet the needs of the market, at Sempra, we certainly believe energy infrastructure right here in North America is a key driver of job creation, economic growth and competitiveness across the economy. Moreover, maintaining a modern, flexible and secure network of electric transmission and distribution lines, natural gas pipelines and storage facilities is essential to delivering affordable and increasingly clean energy to U.S. businesses and consumers while promoting growth across all sectors of our economy.  
Against that backdrop, we'll provide a business update today on the key activities in our California and Texas utilities. Also, Justin Bird, our new CEO of Sempra Infrastructure, will provide an update on how he's organized that business to capture exciting new growth opportunities. This will be followed by a summary of our financial performance.  
As an overview for the quarter, our strategic focus on investing in energy infrastructure across each of our 3 growth platforms, together with a commitment to operational excellence, continue to drive strong financial performance. As you know, we have a long track record of continuing to raise our guidance and then working hard to meet or exceed that guidance. This is a result of our high-performing culture and continuous focus on improving the quality of our operations. As a result of these efforts, we expect to be at the upper end of our full year 2021 adjusted EPS guidance range and we're reaffirming our full year 2022 EPS guidance range.  
Now please turn to the next slide, where Justin and I will provide business updates. Let me start with our California utilities. In August, SDG&E filed an off-cycle application with the CPUC to update its cost of capital effective January 1, 2022. This application would increase SDG&E's equity ratio from 52% to 54%, ROE from 10.2% to 10.55% while also lowering cost of debt from 4.59% to 3.84%. The application, if accepted by the CPUC, would supersede the automatic cost of capital adjustment mechanism. In terms of timing, SDG&E has requested a decision in the first half of 2022.  
Also at SoCalGas, we recently announced agreements expected to resolve substantially all material civil litigation against SoCalGas and Sempra related to the 2015 Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility leak with net after-tax cash flows for SoCalGas expected to ultimately be up to $895 million after taking into consideration collection of existing insurance receivables and other adjustments. These agreements are important milestones that will help the community and our company work toward putting this difficult chapter behind us.  
In addition, last month, SoCalGas issued an important technical analysis underscoring the essential role of clean fuel networks that leverage existing gas infrastructure to help California achieve its net zero goals and, more importantly, to do so more affordably and more efficiently than other alternatives.  
Moving now to Texas. Oncor announced its updated 2022 to 2026 capital plan of approximately $15 billion. It's important to note that this plan is a $2.8 billion increase over its 2021 to 2025 capital plan that was presented at the 2021 Investor Day in June. At Sempra Infrastructure, we recently finalized a series of transactions, including the sale of a noncontrolling interest to KKR, completing the exchange offer and subsequent cash tender offer to purchase the publicly-owned IEnova shares and delisting IEnova shares from the Mexican Stock Exchange.  
Additionally, I'd like to note related to the formation of Sempra Infrastructure, we've updated our GAAP guidance range for 2021 to include items expected to be reflected in our fourth quarter results. You can find the GAAP reconciliation in the appendix to the slide deck.  
Please turn to the next slide. Before I hand the call over to Justin, I want to make one follow-on point about Oncor. We've talked a lot in the past about being in the most attractive energy markets in North America, and Texas is certainly an example. Oncor today operates in one of the fastest-growing markets in the country, with some forecasts estimating that the Texas population will nearly double by 2050. With strong macro fundamentals across its service territory, Oncor just announced a record-high 5-year capital plan of $15 billion. This capital plan is primarily earmarked to meet load growth, with 2/3 of the plan dedicated to expansions of the company's transmission and distribution network.  
Oncor's robust projected capital plan and rate base figures are expected to support economic development across its service territory, increases in generation interconnections, strong premise growth and critical new investments in grid modernization and resiliency. And finally, Oncor now expects to grow its rate base to nearly $28 billion by 2026, which reflects a compound annual growth rate of about 8% over the 5-year period. The growth the company is experiencing is just remarkable. Please turn to the next slide, where I'll pass the call over to Justin to review the latest updates at Sempra Infrastructure."

I'm excited to present the newly formed Sempra Infrastructure platform. We expect the formation of Sempra Infrastructure, along with the financial strength of KKR, to give us added scale to execute on a wide range of energy infrastructure opportunities across Sempra Infrastructure's 3 business lines.  
Since closing this transaction a month ago, we're already seeing the benefits of combining the 2 organizations through financial synergies and commercial optimization. For example, we've been able to restack our capital structure to create meaningful cost savings. To capture new development opportunities, we've organized into 3 business lines: LNG and net-zero solutions, energy networks and clean power. We expect this structure will enhance growth and quality execution.  
This also strategically positions us to benefit from North America's continued trend towards a clean energy transition by optimizing the natural partnership between natural gas and renewables to help meet decarbonization goals here in North America and abroad. Energy infrastructure, as Jeff described at the top of today's call, is the focus of our development program.  
Now please turn to the next slide, where I'll briefly discuss how we're advancing growth in each of our business lines. First, at LNG and net-zero solutions, the LNG market has recovered quite dramatically as evidenced by the spot market with record high prices being seen in Europe and Asia and a recent uptick in long-term contracting activity around the world. With that constructive backdrop, our LNG development portfolio is expected to benefit from the strategic advantage of being situated on both the Pacific and Gulf Coasts with direct access to both Asian and European markets.  
As a reminder, ECA LNG Phase 1 was the only LNG export project in the world to take a final investment decision last year, which reinforces the competitive advantage of brownfield sites that can dispatch into the Atlantic and Pacific basins. Now looking forward, we remain focused on the construction of ECA LNG Phase 1, working with our partners to optimize Cameron LNG's current operations as well as the development of the Cameron LNG expansion and, finally, working on an exciting new Pacific opportunity in Topolobampo, Mexico called Vista Pacifico LNG.  
At ECA LNG Phase 1, engineering, equipment fabrication and site preparation are well underway. The project is on time and on budget, and we continue to expect first LNG production by the end of 2024. At Cameron LNG, the current facility is running well and hit record production levels during the month of October. Together with our partners, we're developing a projected 7 million tonnes per annum expansion project, benefiting from 1 million tonnes per annum of debottlenecking Trains 1 to 3. With innovations in train design, coupled with the high performance of Trains 1 through 3, we expect this to be a very competitive, capital-efficient expansion. 
In terms of next steps, we plan to move to FEED early next year to file an amendment with FERC to build Train 4 with electric drives in order to reduce Scope 1 emissions and to work closely with our partners as we advance towards FID. 
Lastly, Vista Pacifico LNG is a new development project located adjacent to our Topolobampo refined products terminal. This new project is expected to be a mid-scale facility connected to 2 existing pipelines, one of them being the high-pressure pipeline system we own in Sonora. The project would source lower-cost natural gas from the Permian Basin for export to high-demand Asian markets. 
At our energy networks and clean power businesses, I'd like to highlight 2 important projects: the expansion of the GRO pipeline and the expansion of our ESJ wind farm. The GRO expansion is a pipeline project in development that is expected to increase gas delivery capacity to the Baja Peninsula and play a critical role in supplying gas to the ECA LNG Phase 1 project. We continue to advance a series of our cross-border renewable projects that are expected to dispatch directly into California. 
Specifically, the ESJ expansion leverages the existing power transmission capacity that we own on the U.S. and Mexico border. We're the only company that owns cross-border transmission lines that can connect into the California electric grid and that allow us to have a competitive advantage in helping the state meet its growing need for new renewable energy resources. 
I'm excited about the team we've put together and about the business we're building. It's a unique opportunity. We're well situated to compete, and we certainly expect to play a crucial role in investing in energy infrastructure right here in North America that supports the global energy transition. Please turn to the next slide where I'll pass the call to Trevor to review our financial results."

This compares to third quarter 2020 GAAP earnings of $351 million or $1.21 per share. On an adjusted basis, third quarter 2021 earnings were $545 million or $1.70 per share. This compares to our third quarter 2020 adjusted earnings of $432 million or $1.49 per share. 
Please turn to the next slide. The variance in the third quarter 2021 adjusted earnings compared to the same period last year was affected by the following key items: $35 million of higher earnings at Sempra Mexico due to higher ownership of IEnova; $35 million of higher CPUC base operating margin, net of operating expenses at SDG&E and SoCalGas; $29 million of lower losses at Parent and Other, primarily due to lower preferred dividends; and $29 million related to the energy efficiency program refund in the third quarter of 2020 at SDG&E. 
Please turn to the next slide. We are pleased with our operational and financial performance this quarter and are focused on continuing to execute through the remainder of the year. We also think our strong year-to-date performance sets us up well to have a great year in 2022. With that, this concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now stop and take your questions."

Also importantly, we're seeing higher forward curves over the next few years for deliveries into Asia and Europe. And I'd say the final thing that we're seeing that I think is important is you're seeing China is reentering the long-term market. 
We are seeing a real uptick in our discussions both in Asia and Europe and frankly, as well as South America. So I think we're going to see some exciting things coming out of our LNG portfolio, and we should benefit from this constructive market backdrop. Again, we think we have a competitive advantage, the ability to dispatch directly into Europe and Asia. And again, over the long term, it's nice to see that we still see demand for LNG growing mid- to high single digits, which supports our long-term very bullish view on LNG development."

We're actually quite constructive on California. A couple of things I'd mention. As you may have seen the decision yesterday where the PUC approved increasing the capacity utilization at Aliso Canyon. I think they increased it from roughly 34 Bcf to 41 Bcf. And I would tell you, we are certainly committed to supporting a much cleaner economy in California. 
But the expectations today, Jeremy, is that traditionally, California uses roughly 39% to 41% of natural gas for its electricity production in the winter time. Because of low hydro levels, I think there's much more focus now on that being closer to 45%. We could see record utilization of natural gas here in California in the winter. I think the PUC decision kind of reflects that. 
More broadly, I think both SoCalGas and SDG&E have made a commitment to be a leader in the clean energy transition. And this is going to inform not only our current investments but how we're stacking capital investments going to the GRC next year. And Kevin, maybe you can talk about some of the things that you're seeing around battery storage and other things that could be near-term opportunities for SDG&E."

And so at SDG&E, we're seeing a big push in the state, given what we've seen in the last couple of tight summers around more storage capacity, more generation capacity, I think SDG&E will have some filings in the next few weeks around more utility-owned battery storage. 
I think you'll also see a lot more activity in the coming months and years around electric vehicles, too. California has made a lot of bold commitments to move much more strongly towards electric vehicles. And I think you'll see a lot of grid enhancements and grid modifications in that area. But I'd also remind you that climate resilience is a big thing here, and so continues to be a lot of wildfire mitigation opportunities to invest capital as well."

What I would probably say is in this midstream space, we target mid-double-digit levered type of returns. We think those are consistent across all those. Interestingly, on the clean power side, you may recall that we've seen returns come in here in the United States. It's one of the reasons we exited that business 2 or 3 years ago. 
In Mexico, because of our border position and the access we have to 2 very important transmission lines that bring power into the United States, we think we have a real competitive advantage in that region. So we expect relatively higher returns in which you might find in renewables here in the United States. So I would stick to say and overall, Justin's portfolio is going to manage toward mid-double-digit equity returns. 
One other thing I'll mention, too, to the broader LNG story. Justin and I got back from a recent trip to Europe, where we visited Warsaw and Dusseldorf and Berlin and Brussels and other places. There's a tremendous amount of recognition in Europe about the role for natural gas and specifically, LNG. And there's certainly a new risk premium being assigned to pipeline gas. There's even discussions at the highest level of the EU about creating a strategic natural gas reserve. We've got a team on the ground next week in Asia. So I think going back to the original point with Jeremy, there's a tremendous amount of conversations today, and I think this continues to reinforce our bullish case for LNG."

I think there's been a lot of interest as people have engaged with us over the last couple of months about having better visibility into Sempra's long-term growth rate. You've heard us talk about our track record in the past of growing this business, whether it's a 10-year period or 20-year period at an EPS growth rate of around 7% or 8%. 
I must tell you, we feel fairly confident in our ability to produce similar growth in the future over a 7- to 10-year period of time. And part of that is bolstered by this continued point that we make about the quality of the markets we're participating in, right? So you've got the #1 market in America is California and the #2 market is Texas. And I think Allen just has a remarkable story in Texas, which keeps getting better. 
And to your point, we're going to have an opportunity to restack our capital program here in California as part of our GRC filing next year. And I think you should expect to see us to make filing requests around many of the things that Allen's doing, which is around resiliency, modernization of the grid and making sure we're making those investments today that are -- ensure that our infrastructure is future-ready for what we need in the future, such as hydrogen and other things on the system.

That is really backed up by what Jeff mentione",700,"Sure, Jeff. Yes, thanks. So I think you described it very well. I mean what we've done today is announced another $1 billion of Oncor CapEx over 5 years or $2.8 billion since the Investor Day, like Jeff said. That is really backed up by what Jeff mentioned in his opening remarks, just tremendous growth that we can talk about across our system in a minute. 
But that $15 billion over 5 is our new plan. To Jeff's point, a couple of years ago, we introduced this idea that we had this other bucket, this incremental bucket of potential CapEx. And to Jeff's point, that incremental bucket, which we, I think, announced at $725 million to $1.275 billion remains there and available. And so how does that work? Well, what we do every year when we sit down with our Board and come up with what is now the $15 billion plan, there'll be some projects that come out of that incremental bucket and go into that $15 billion plan. 
However, at the same time, we're also looking out further on the horizon and seeing things that we think can be included in that second bucket, which is the incremental bucket. So that is separate and apart, as Jeff said. We have announced a 5-year $15 billion plan. That's where we are today. We, in addition, have another bucket, which remains around, I mean, these are estimates, the $725 million to $1.275 billion that is available. And in that incremental bucket, in case we get to this in a minute, are also things -- another thing that we've added to that bucket is potential CapEx related to legislative activities in Texas, and those fall in several categories. 
One is this possibility that we can participate a little bit in the storage market in Texas. There's 100 megawatts available for the entire state. So we think there is an opportunity there, about $20 million for RPs, and we're hopeful that, that will grow over time. The second bill, SB 1281, which is related to CCNs and an economic benefit test specifically related to those CCNs, we think there's about probably $50 million a year in those incremental transmission projects. 
On the emergency generation side, I know there's been a lot of interest in that. We're working through acquiring some capital leases on the emergency generation side right now. We're planning on having about 10 megawatts under contract by January 1. The CapEx impact of what we do on emergency gen, like several of these categories, will depend on how much we ultimately end up leasing. But right now, the -- we're seeing kind of 5-megawatt emergency gen, 2 to 5 megawatts around $2 million and bigger 30-megawatt kind of on the back of trailers around $10 million. So we'll make an appropriate and reasonable decision for our customers in the ERCOT market on how much of that we will acquire, and that will determine the ultimate CapEx impacts of emergency gen. 
Then on a similar -- that same bill also provides us the opportunity to acquire long lead time equipment that we might need for service restoration. We think we're probably around, what I would call, $10 million for a general kind of plant for 2022 with an additional potential $100 million on top of that for the remainder of the 5-year plan, $100 million worth of equipment. But again, that ultimate number is going to depend. $10 million on general equipment is one thing, but if we get into stack comps and SBCs in some of the larger equipment, that equipment goes from -- it can be anywhere from $50 million to $70 million per site. 
And so we're still looking at all these legislative opportunities. That's kind of just a general approach of what we're thinking right now on each of those. And as I said, these dollars associated with potential CapEx associated with the legislation coming out of Storm Uri are, right now, in our incremental bucket. But as we refine them, they will ultimately be moved at some point -- could be moved at some point into our 5-year plan. Jeff, is that what you're asking for?"

Of the $15 billion over 5 that we're talking about today, about 2/3 of that is growth-related, so new customers, more or less, or expansion of customers. Of the increase that we're talking about today, the $1 billion increase, about 80% of that increase is directly related to growth. And I should mention also, 97% of that total amount of the $15 billion over 5 is tracker-eligible. 
So as we make these investments, keep in mind that we are presently the low-cost investor-owned utility in the state. We have the lowest rates of all the investor-owned utilities. We believe that because of the substantial growth we're seeing on our system, even after $15 billion over 5, we will remain the low-cost provider or at least close to the low-cost provider on the right side of that chart of the rates for all the investor-owned utilities. 
Generally, I think we're probably thinking rates could increase somewhat similar to inflation. But again, we're the low-cost provider now, and we believe we'll be the low-cost provider at the end of 5 years and $15 billion. Thanks."

I think back in 2018, you may remember, Stephen, that there was a lot of discussion around being in regulated businesses, unregulated businesses. And I think we took the opportunity to kind of redefine an investment class that said at the end of the day, these are all energy infrastructure investments. And how you make money may be different in the regulated framework versus outside the regulated framework. 
And we really went to ground this idea of being ahead of others in defining the markets where energy infrastructure would grow the most. And I think in my opening remarks today, I tried to really emphasize the point that energy infrastructure is quite hot in Europe and Asia and the United States. I think that we're just really well positioned. And the infrastructure bill that you're referring to is certainly strong confirmation bias of the importance of this to the United States. 
And there's really a tailwind for Sempra around this clean energy transition. So 4 topics, I think, come out of today's bill could pass as early today out of the House, one of which is we're tracking the private activity bonds. These are ones that allow you to finance carbon sequestration and carbon storage devices. We think that's important for the sector. The IEA says there will not be a net zero 2050 without carbon sequestration. And that's one of the reasons that Justin's business is focusing on this opportunity. 
Second, to your very point, green hydrogen is a big part of our country's future. We've made a decision to participate in all the appropriate trade associations. We've got something like 10 to 12 different R&D projects in hydrogen today. But specifically in the legislation, the bill contemplates 4 regional hydrogen hubs in the country. We think this will be important as you think about distribution centers. And one thing that people sometimes miss, Stephen, is the #1 manufacturing facility in the United States, by a wide margin, is the L.A. Basin, and the #1 industrial segment for the United States is the Gulf region between Texas and Louisiana. 
So both of these are areas that geographically, we have a vested interest in. I think we've got a leadership interest in. So I think hydrogen in both of those markets will be important. Two other quick points from today's bill. One is the focus on wildfire management. We talk about this, Stephen, a lot in California. It's obviously a Western region issue. It's an issue today in Europe and Australia and Ukraine in different parts of the world. But the bill does contemplate support for vegetation management and improving resiliency, which is a very important topic here in California. 
And lastly, there's a lot of focus on the bill in electric vehicles. Trevor and I participated in the strategy session with Allen's Board last week in Texas. The electric vehicle market in Texas is enormous. Today, there's about 30,000 vehicles on Oncor's system. In comparison, we're 1/20th the size of Oncor's system here at SDG&E, and they've got 70,000 vehicles on our system. So I think electric vehicles will be very, very important. And the bill is very specific about funding opportunities all across the country to promote electric vehicles. So those are the 4 we're probably following most closely, but we do share your optimism around green hydrogen."

And what we want to do is be able to grow our utilities at a rate faster than our peers and do that without coming back to the capital markets to issue Sempra equity. And that's one of the reasons that the KKR transaction was so important. It gave us a chance to crystallize and highlight the value in that business and recycle capital back into reducing parent debt and meeting some of the capital needs like Allen described today. 
But I would tell you, I don't think we're finished, right? That business now has been valued at roughly an enterprise value of $25 billion. So we think about going forward, we think there will be strategic opportunities to bring that business to the market. Those are conversations we would obviously have with KKR. And to your point, if we have the chance to further diversify the capital structure at higher valuations, that's something you should look for us to do. 
And we will be looking under Faisel and Justin's leadership at bringing in project equity on some of these projects to reduce the call of capital from Sempra Infrastructure. But right now, they're very, very focused on growth and there's a lot of enthusiasm of what they think they can accomplish."

But in terms of forward guidance, what we've indicated in the past, Michael, was that whether we get the automatic triggering mechanism or whether our application is approved, it's contemplated within our guidance for next year. And because of some other steps that the business has taken to mitigate and become more -- mitigate costs and become more efficient, it's probably in the range of $0.05 to $0.10 either way, but well within our guidance range. And we would not expect to update guidance independent of that outcome.

I would start with your second question, which is KKR has their own infrastructure presence in Mexico, both on the refined product side of the value chain as well as with renewables. They are certainly collaborating with us constructively with CFE. So that's been helpful. 
I can make a couple of comments, too, Ryan, that because of our headquarters being here in San Diego, you'll recall that we've been investing pretty consistently down in Mexico for close to 25 years. And what excites us back then still excites us today is you've got about 130 million consumers. It's one of the fastest-growing consumer markets in the Western Hemisphere. And most importantly, it's the largest energy export partner for the United States at about 7 to 8 Bcf per day. 
I think even though we've got kind of leading scale and expertise at Sempra Infrastructure, we're still very selective about the projects we expect to invest in. And even the Vista Pacifico project that Justin was describing, those capacity releases on some of those pipelines that would be needed would come from the government. And this is really a government-sponsored project and one that they've been quite public about supporting from a permit and pipeline capacity standpoint. 
But pure issue, I think, it's quite topical that there are reforms being proposed in electricity market. I think you'll expect to see the lower house vote on that in the fourth quarter, but it would not clear the legislature until probably April of next year and we handicap that as a low probability. And what's interesting about this is, those reforms largely target, to the point you made, Ryan, generation assets that are connected to the CFE system. And today, we have a relatively small footprint in generation across all of Sempra because we're a T&D business. 
I think the electric investments in Mexico account for roughly 1% of our consolidated earnings, and more importantly, the vast majority of all those projects, something like 80% are on the border with California, are not connected to CFE and dispatched directly into the Cal ISO. 
But I would leave you with one thought, which is probably the most important. We made the decision several years ago that what we really want to do is help President López Obrador be successful. So the majority of our conversations are focused on ways that we can partner with his cabinet to make PEMEX be successful and make CFE be successful. So when you see us announce projects like Vista Pacifico is because those will be done largely in tandem with the objectives of the government. That's one of the reasons we still feel good about those types of projects in Mexico."

Number one is this issue of how much inflation are we seeing in terms of how we source our soft and hard cost at any of our projects, including our utilities. And we've got obviously some built-in mechanisms that help us with that on the utility side. In Justin's business, you recall that we're very reliant on EPC wrap contracts. So the procurement and exposure to costs, we shift that risk to the construction contractor, and that's why it's important that they have strong credit counterparties. 
But in terms of brownfield versus greenfield, I think the way I would answer that at a very general level is to say, brownfield projects always have a cost advantage, and greenfield projects can be also quite viable. Typically, they need to be done at scale and Port Arthur will be an example of that. But coming back to our projects, think about this. For us to have the opportunity to turnkey 6 to 7 Bcf -- I mean, 6 to 7 MTPA at Cameron expansion, our view internally is it could be one of the lowest-cost projects for new capacity in the world. 
So our likelihood of going forward there, we account as being relatively high, and that's why we've got 100% of the MOUs in place to go to the next step and move [ ahead to ] agreements and SPAs there. And then at Vista Pacifico, this is the type of project very similar to ECA Phase 1, our expectation is it will be oversubscribed. It is a greenfield project but the geographic location to be able to have direct pipeline access from 2 different pipelines to Waha and to be able to dispatch directly into the Pacific will be a tremendous and competitive advantage when we market that project."

So what they were doing is they were reaching forward to source what they needed to execute those capital plans.

We certainly are quite bullish both on Cameron expansion, which is 6 to 7 MTPA as well as the Vista Pacifico project, which is closer to 4 million tons per annum. 
In terms of equity, we are very comfortable with the level we're at today with KKR. Certainly, if we saw opportunities to diversify the capital structure at Sempra Infrastructure at points in the future at higher valuations, we would evaluate that against the opportunity to bring in equity down to the project level. But definitely, there's an interest to attract equity participation at the project level, given the size and scale of our expectations around LNG."

That's very helpful. And my last question, maybe Justin, if you want to opine, but we've kind of noticed that equity cargo capacity, it can be delivered years in advance of new train construction appears to be a major selling point for new long-term contracting, like the latest venture global announcement included some short-term supply off of their [indiscernible] pass.

And I think you even saw Cheniere's deal today had kind of a lead into the bigger capacity coming at the long term.

And I think you even saw Cheniere's deal today had kind of a lead into the bigger capacity coming at the long term. So I would say I wish I had capacity I could sell right now to bridge some of the construction on these other projects because I do think it is a competitive advantage. The market is very hot right now and people are looking for volumes in the next few years. 
I think for us, it's a question of maintaining our financial discipline, potentially looking for partners where we can provide some bridge volumes into volumes coming from our facilities, and then looking for potential excess volumes that could be available via the partners out of Cameron or when ECA Phase 1 comes online, looking for some additional volumes as production actually starts and we see what production looks like. 
So yes, I think you raised a great point. Having volumes to bridge into these long-term contracts, I would say, is a competitive advantage, and it's something that we're focused on and looking for opportunities to find those types of bridging arrangements."
