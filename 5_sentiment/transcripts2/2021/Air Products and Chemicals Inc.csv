We are living at a time that all humanity faces significant challenges. The most important and immediate one is the battle against the deadly virus that has already taken many lives and continues to ravage communities around the globe. We can only fight this deadly and global virus if we work together and stay united. In my more than 45 years in business, I have learned that all problems, no matter how challenging, can be solved if we stay focused and united working toward the common goal. 
So it is in this spirit of working together as a team that I want to acknowledge the united and extraordinary efforts of all the talented, committed and resilient people of Air Products around the world. They work hard every day to provide critical products and services to our customers. Our people working in solidarity and in a determined way, have made it possible for us to keep our 750 facilities around the world operating during this unprecedented crisis. They are the ones who are making it possible for us to deliver the good results we see this quarter. And they are the ones who are pushing forward with developing and executing major world-class projects to ensure our growth in the future. They are the ones who, through their actions every day, give meaning to our higher purpose as a company, which is to help humanity move forward in a sustainable way and bring people together to help solve energy and environmental challenges. Our people are the soul of our company, and I am very proud to stand with them. 
Now please turn to Slide #3. As always, safety is the most important focus for all of us at Air Products. It's a moral responsibility to keep our people safe and our goal will always be 0 accidents and incidents. Despite the challenging COVID-19 conditions, our team continues to focus on working safely, following our strict protocols to help protect themselves, our customers and our communities. 
On Slides 4, 5 and 6, you can again see our goal, our management philosophy, and our 5-point plan for moving forward. These are the principles that we follow every day. They drove our performance improvement in the past and will continue to guide us in the future. While we have accomplished a great deal in the past 6 years, transforming Air Products and delivering superior performance, I always prefer to focus on the future because I prepare the dreams of the future through the history of the past. 
I have shared our dreams of the future to you before, which you can see highlighted on Slide #7. I would like to repeat them again. Our dream of the future is to be the safest, most diverse and most profitable industrial gas company in the world. Our dream of the future is to be the largest American chemical company as measured by market capitalization. Our dream of the future is to be the leader in providing solutions to the world's significant energy and environmental challenges. And we believe Air Products has a higher purpose beyond delivering superior financial results, bringing people together to work together and deliver sustainable solutions that benefit our customers and our world. This is what drives us every day. 
Now please turn to Slide #8. I'm proud to say that during the past 12 months, we have made significant progress in making these dreams a reality. We have significantly improved our safety record. Our margins remain highest in the industry. We announced our new sustainability goals, including carbon intensity reduction and diversity goals. These are consistent with our growth opportunities and our higher purpose. We helped drive our market cap increase by improving our earnings per share by over 10% on average over the last 6 years, with positive EPS growth in 2020 despite the negative impact of COVID-19 pandemic. We have continued to create and bring projects that help customers and countries meet their growing needs for cleaner energy and environmental solutions. 
Let me share a few of the examples of these large important projects that demonstrate progress on our strategy. We've won 4 world-scale LNG heat exchanger projects over the last year, including the Qatargas mega project, and the project in Mexico that we announced earlier this week. These projects are already contributing to our bottom line as we continue to complete them for our customers. We are executing the Gulf Coast ammonia project in the U.S. Gulf Coast and have acquired the hydrogen assets of our PBF customer in California and Delaware. These projects will further enhance our hydrogen leadership position in the United States.  We announced the $2 billion coal to methanol project, categorized as a national strategic project by the Indonesian government to support energy development and transition and reduce the country's reliance on fuel imports. We also announced the innovative NEOM project in Saudi Arabia to provide the world with a robot map to transition to carbon-free that is green hydrogen, the energy source of the future. 
Now please turn to Slide #9. We remain committed to delivering superior financial performance. And as I said, our people also know they are supporting the higher purpose in the work they do every day. Our industrial gas enterprise is critical to the success of dozen industries and the scope and complexity of our mega projects require talented people with a variety of skills and backgrounds from different parts of the world to work together as one team. We are proud to bring people from diverse backgrounds and experiences together to collaborate and develop these innovative solutions for some of the most significant energy and environmental challenges in the world. That is our higher purpose that inspires our team and drives us every day. 
Now please turn to Slide #10, which highlights our key gasification projects. We are committed to our gasification strategy and are pursuing exciting projects around the world. We continue to see countries and large companies, driving to convert low-value feed stock into high-value products. They have identified gasification as the best way to use abundant, low-value resources like coal, pet coke and refinery volumes in a sustainable manner. And we are in the best position to work with them and help them deliver better, more sustainable solutions that benefit their economies and their people. We do expect to announce additional gasification projects in the future. 
Now specifically, I would like to give you an update on the 2 largest gasification projects, which I discussed during our last earnings call. First, our $12 billion acquisition of the Jazan Gasifier and Power Plant from Saudi Aramco. Since our last call with investors on November 11, 2020, we have continued our discussions with Saudi Aramco to finalize all of the contracts, arrange the financing and move towards the financial close. I am encouraged by the progress we have made in the last 3 months. And I would especially like to thank the Saudi Aramco very senior management for the positive steps they have taken to move this transaction forward. We obviously still have work to do to bring this significant project to a final conclusion. But I am more optimistic than I was 3 months ago. 
The second project we discussed on the last earnings call was Lu'An. We have reached an agreement with Lu'An to temporarily reduce our fixed monthly fee during the time that the plant is shut down. And Lu'An has agreed to extend the length of the contract, which improves our return. Lu'An did pay us the reduced monthly fee for the months of October, November and December. We continue to believe that the plan will be restarted during this fiscal year. 
Now please turn to Slide #11, which reflects our recently announced 12% dividend increase, raising our quarterly dividend to $1.50 per share for an annual rate of $6 a share. This dividend increase is a reminder that while we continue to develop our exciting growth opportunities, we have significant cash flow that supports this substantial dividend increase, the 39th consecutive year of increase for Air Products. 
And finally, Slide #12, shows our EBITDA margin. As always, my favorite slide, that it shows that the margin is up over 1,400 basis points since 2014. I am very proud of our team who continue to deliver EBITDA margins of nearly 40% for the quarter despite the challenges facing us. 
Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to provide a financial overview. Scott?"

As Seifi stated earlier, our company continued to demonstrate resilience, delivering both higher sales and EBITDA this quarter despite the challenges of the pandemic. Our business, which is about half on site, continue to deliver stable cash flow in spite of the difficult conditions continuing around the world. 
Now please turn to Slide 13 for a brief discussion of our first quarter results. Sales of $2.4 billion were up 5% compared to prior year, driven by strong price, higher energy pass-through and a positive currency impact. Price actions continue to be an area of focus for us and improved in all 3 regions. This is the 14th consecutive quarter of year-over-year price gain. Volume was relatively stable, down 1% as the additions of new plants, acquisitions and increased sale of equipment activities were more than offset by COVID-19 impacts and the reduced Lu'An contribution that Seifi mentioned. 
EBITDA of $932 million was up 3% as favorable price, currency and equity affiliate income more than offset the impact of lower volume and higher cost primarily due to higher planned maintenance outages. EBITDA margin declined about 100 basis points as lower volumes, including Lu'An and higher costs driven by increased planned maintenance in North America, more than offset the positive price impact. Operating income was 4% lower, while EBITDA was higher compared to last year, largely due to depreciation on new plants, particularly the PBF hydrogen plants that we acquired last year. 
COVID-19 continued to negatively impact our business. We estimate the pandemic reduced overall sales by about 4% and EPS by about $0.10 to $0.15. ROCE was 250 basis points lower, negatively impacted by the step-up in the denominator from the additional $5 billion of debt. Sequentially, the 3% weaker volume was driven primarily by seasonality, loan and lower sale of equipment activities. However, sales were up overall sequentially as this lower volume was more than offset by favorable currency, higher energy pass-through and positive price. 
Now please turn to Slide 14. Our first quarter adjusted EPS of $2.12 was comparable to last year, despite the negative $0.10 to $0.15 impact of COVID-19. Volume was unfavorable $0.25. The negative impacts of COVID-19 and Lu'An more than offset the PBF acquisition and new plants. Volume was nearly flat in sales, but unfavorable in EPS due to business mix. Price, net of variable costs, contributed $0.17, with increases in all regions. Cost was unfavorable $0.06 as we executed planned maintenance projects and added new resources for future growth. 
For this quarter, we also benefited from the settlement of a supply contract. Currency and foreign exchange contributed $0.06, primarily due to appreciation of the Chinese RMB and euro relative to the U.S. dollar. Equity affiliate income added $0.04 due to strong underlying business results, while noncontrolling interest was also favorable $0.04 on lower profits in our consolidated joint ventures, primarily due to Lu'An. As a reminder, we consolidate 100% of Lu'An's results, given our 60% majority ownership of the joint venture and deduct our partners' 40% interest in the noncontrolling interest line. Interest expense was $0.07 unfavorable due to the costs associated with the additional $5 billion of debt. The remaining $0.05 includes a favorable $0.04 pension impact and a favorable $0.01 impact from a lower tax rate. The effective tax rate of 19.3% was down 50 basis points from prior year. We still expect our effective tax rate to be around 20% to 21% in fiscal year '21. 
Now please turn to Slide 15. We continue to generate strong cash flow, underscoring the stability of our business. Over the last 12 months, we generated almost $2.6 billion of distributable cash flow or about $0.115 -- $11.50 per share. From our EBITDA of over $3.6 billion, we paid interest, taxes and maintenance capital. Note, our maintenance CapEx is a little higher than usual, driven in part by spending on our new corporate headquarters. From the distributable cash flow, we paid over 40% or over $1.1 billion as dividends to our shareholders and still have about $1.4 billion available for high-return industrial gas investments. This strong cash flow, even in uncertain times, enables us to continue to create shareholder value through increasing dividends and capital deployment. 
Slide #16 provides additional details on our capital deployment. We continue to have substantial investment capacity remaining. As you can see, we expect about $18 billion of investment capacity available over the 5-year period from FY '18 through FY '22. The $18 billion includes over $9 billion of cash and additional debt capacity available today; about $2.5 billion of investable cash flow between now and the end of FY '22; and about $6 billion already spent. Additionally, we will generate more cash and borrowing capacity as projects come on stream. And some of the spending in our backlog extends beyond FY '22. We expect to reframe this potential for you later in 2021. We will continue to focus on managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted A/A2 rating. With a few new projects signed and some coming on stream, our total project and M&A commitments increased slightly to $12.7 billion, with about $11 billion remaining to spend on them. So you can see, we have already spent almost 35% and already committed 95% of the capacity we show here. 
Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call back over to Seifi."

Compared to last year, currency, price and energy pass-through resulted in a 4% increase in sales despite weaker volumes. Currency, favorable across most key countries, contributed 6%. Overall, price rose 1% for the region, which represents a 3% increase for merchant products. I'd like to remind you that pricing was positive for Asia for the 15th consecutive quarter and particularly strong in Korea and Taiwan this quarter. 
Volumes were down 4%, with new plants more than offset by Lu'An, while the merchant business remained stable. Despite the impact of lower volumes, a strong price and favorable currencies kept EBITDA -- we kept EBITDA relatively stable. EBITDA margin at almost 48% was 240 basis points lower, primarily driven by lower volumes, mostly from Lu'An. Sequentially, sales were up 1% with favorable currencies more than offsetting the weaker volumes, EBITDA increased 4%, primarily driven by lower costs, while favorable currency offset the negative impact of weaker volumes.

Higher price and energy pass-through were offset by lower volumes. Price was again better across all major product lines. The 3% increase for the region was equivalent to 7% for merchant. This is the tenth consecutive quarter of year-on-year price improvement. 
Volume was down, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19, but partially offset by the PBF acquisition. EBITDA of $400 million was 2% below last year's level as better price and the PBF acquisition were offset by this volume shortfall and higher maintenance costs. For the quarter, although Americas' planned maintenance was higher than last year, it is consistent with what we expect in Q2. EBITDA margin dipped 90 basis points, with a negative 80 basis point impact from higher energy pass-through, while the unfavorable cost impact was largely offset by other favorable factors, including price and acquisitions. 
Now I'll make some comments on our sequential results. Sales increased 2% as higher energy pass-through and positive price overcame negative volume. Price was up across all major product lines, while volume was weaker primarily due to seasonality. EBITDA declined 3% as weaker volume was partially offset by better price. Margin was down primarily on higher energy pass-through, which had about a 200 basis point impact. 
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Simon to discuss our other segments. Simon?"

Now please turn to Slide 19 for a review of our Europe, Middle East and Africa region results. Our EMEA team delivered outstanding results this quarter. Both sales and profits grew double-digit compared to both last year and last quarter. Price, volume and currency were all favorable and contributed to the 13% year-on-year sales growth. Volumes grew 5%, principally due to acquisitions and higher on-site volumes, which offset the adverse impact of COVID-19, predominantly in our packaged gas business. Price increased 3% for the region and 4% for merchant, with improvement across most major product lines and subregions. This is the 12th consecutive quarter of year-on-year price improvement. 
Currencies were favorable 6%, primarily due to the euro strength versus the U.S. dollar. EBITDA surged 18% to more than $220 million, supported by price increases, favorable currency and acquisitions. EBITDA margin improved 170 basis points. Sequentially, volume improvement was driven by a modest COVID-19-related recovery in our merchant business, acquisitions and higher on-site volumes. EBITDA was also up sequentially and margins remained about flat. 
Now please turn to Slide 20, global gases, which includes our non LNG sale of equipment business as well as central costs. Sales increased due to higher sale of equipment project activity, but profit was lower due to business mix and higher product development spending. As mentioned earlier, we also benefited from the settlement of a supply contract, which offset the gains in project activities last year. 
Please turn to Slide 21, corporate, which includes LNG and other businesses as well as our corporate costs. Sales and profits were higher this quarter versus prior year, driven by LNG project activities as we continue to execute multiple large projects, including Golden Pass and Mozambique, the massive Qatargas project also began to contribute this quarter. Sales and profits were both down versus prior quarter, primarily due to timing of percent complete activity on the LNG projects. We were excited to announce another new project earlier this week for the Energia Costa Azul LNG export terminal in Ensenada, Mexico. This represents the fourth LNG project we've announced in the last year. 
Now to provide some additional thoughts, I'll turn the call back over to Seifi."

As we look forward, unfortunately, we do not expect the COVID-19 global crisis to moderate anytime soon. This will continue to have a negative impact on the economies of most of the countries we operate. We have confidence that the vaccine will help to reverse the course, but the rollout is still in early stages and the pace of vaccination is hard to predict. As a result, we continue to find it very difficult to make any reasonable projections about the course of economic activity around the world. Therefore, we are not providing EPS guidance or CapEx guidance for quarter 2 or for our fiscal year 2021 at this time. We hope the outlook will be less uncertain in April. And if so, we look forward to providing you guidance then. 
However, I want to share with you what we are seeing so far this quarter, that is in the month of January and as of today in February. Representing about half of our sales, our on-site business has been stable, and we expect this to continue. With respect to our merchant business, in Asia, our merchant volumes are down slightly versus where they were at the same time last year, which is before the virus crisis began. So the volumes have reached almost precrisis metals. In Europe, we are off to a weaker start following the holiday season and continue to see a larger impact on our packaged gases business versus the liquid bulk business. In Americas, merchant volumes remain down, and I would like to remind you again that we do not have a packaged gas business in North America. 
As we move forward, we remain committed to executing our growth strategy, providing sustainable solutions to help the world meets its increasing needs for cleaner energy. With our strong portfolio, we are able to meet customers' and countries' drive for cleaner and more sustainable solutions. We see great opportunities ahead in gasification, carbon capture and hydrogen for mobility, and we continue to develop and invest in strategic opportunity to drive our growth for decades to come. 
As always, the continued success -- the continue -- I'm sorry, as always, the continued success of this strategy, is rooted in the commitment and motivation of the great team we have at Air Products. Our resilient and focused people understand the critical role they play in safely operating more than 750 facilities around the world, executing broader scale projects that support economic and social development. As Air Products, we will work together to deliver these solutions to our customers and to the world. 
I am proud to say that unlike many other companies, we have not reduced staff or reduced the salary of our people during this pandemic. Indeed, we have continued to strengthen our organization by adding the resources necessary to pursue great opportunities. We have stood by our people. 
In closing today, I would like to thank all of our dedicated and hard-working people around the world who continue to deliver despite these challenging times. I am proud to be working with them every single day. Now we are pleased to answer your questions."

Today, because of the market condition, the actual interest rates are obviously lower than that. So the issue that we have had to negotiate and we have negotiated that, but is -- how much of that saving goes to each party. That's basically -- I mean, we were assuming X amount of interest. Now it is lower, therefore, the -- so who gets the benefit of it and how much of it. So that was one issue in terms of negotiation. The second thing is that we are trying to eras $7.2 billion of debt. That is not an easy task with a lot of banks involved and all of that, and that, the terms, conditions and all of that.

I think we'll get this thing done at some point in time. But the issue -- those are the 2 issues that we are working on. I think one of them, we have worked on. I think you have an understanding with the senior management of Aramco in terms of what we're going to do in terms of sharing of the profit. But the devil is in the details, all of this has to be translated into actual contract language and the debt has to be a arranged. So that's what is taking time."

Things look even rosier than before because one thing is capturing carbon to help environments and all that. But there is a significant push right now, as I talked to the investors in the last 1.5 years to the last 2 years, that the transition to the hydrogen economy will be gray hydrogen then blue hydrogen and then green hydrogen. There is a significant demand now for so-called blue hydrogen. That people are thinking about making ammonia where you capture the CO2 that is generated, then you make the hydrogen. And therefore, the ammonia is called blue and then especially Japan wants to take that ammonia and blow it directly into their boilers for their power plants, and that is how they are going to decarbonize. 
So there is significant demand, a lot of conversations about so-called blue ammonia and blue hydrogen and all of that. We are working our carbon capture. We continue to work on carbon capture. And as I said, we will, in time, announce appropriate projects of the meaningful size to show you that we are making progress on this thing.

You cann",661,"Well, the way they are different is the same thing with gasification and everything else. The main reason that we are doing what we are doing is that we want to be competitive and put our customers in a competitive position to use green hydrogen. You cannot do it at small scale. The scale-up that we are doing is that it's not as if you are taking a technological risk . We are not. I mean, what are we doing at NEOM. We are building, yes, 4 gigawatts [indiscernible] have 4 gigawatts of wind and solar. That's known technology. It's no big deal. Then we are building [ 650-ton ] a day electrolyzers. And everyone says, ""Oh, my God."" Yes, but how are we doing that? We are going to take [ 30 ] of those 20-megawatt things that you set and put them together. So there is no risk in there. And then the ammonia plant, we are building [ 1 million-ton ] ammonia plants all over the place. So we are not taking any technological risk. What we are doing is that we are creating a mega project so that we get the benefit of the economy of scale. That's number one. 
And then the second thing is that all of these people who are announcing these different plants, the source of electricity is not green, and we are creating a green source of electricity. But the main thing is we are doing mega projects because that is how you, number one, make it economically feasible. And number two, unless somebody like us makes a commitment to make a big project, people are not going to convert. I mean, if you own buses in San Francisco, you are not going to go and convert them to fuel cell vehicles, if you don't have an assurance that you will have the green hydrogen to put in, then what's the point of converting? So when you know that somebody is spending $6 billion, $7 billion to build the infrastructure, then you get the confidence. That is the difference in terms of what we are doing and what they are doing. It's not a big technological risk, but it's being the first and being the people, the first ones would develop the infrastructure. 
I mean, I don't want to make big comparisons here, but what is to making an electric car, I mean, my God, it's a motor and a gearbox, right? But look at the Tesla and look at the GM and Volkswagen. Those guys took the decision that first and everybody said, well, this is not going to work out because it's no big deal. GM can do this anytime. You look at the where their stock is and where GM's stock is. There is significant advantage to be the first mover and you have to move on a big scale in order to make it economical for your customers to have confidence that you're going to have the product, then they convert their fleet. So that is what we are doing. 
I have no comment about what our competitors are doing. They are -- I'm sure they are very smart people. And people like yourself, you question them about what they are doing and what they are not doing, and I don't want to make any comment on that. But for sure, I hope we know what we are doing and what we are doing is go for a scale, go for economy of scale, when you have the opportunity and produce a real green hydrogen, not these toy things [ at 10-ton  and 20-ton ] a day, that really doesn't -- but beside that, we are doing those things. We are building a [ 30-tonne ] a day plan hydrogen in for auto. We are building 30-tonne plant hydrogen in other parts of the world. So that's not a big deal. But the mega scale is the future."

On Slides 4, 5 and 6, you can again see our goal, our management philosophy, and our 5-point plan for moving forward. These are the principles that we follow every day. They drove our performance improvement in the past and will continue to guide us in the future. While we have accomplished a great deal in the past 6 years, transforming Air Products and delivering superior performance, I always prefer to focus on the future because I prepare the dreams of the future through the history of the past. 
I have shared our dreams of the future with you before, which you can see highlighted on Slide #7. I would like to repeat them again. Our dream of the future is to be the safest, most diverse and most profitable industrial gas company in the world. Our dream of the future is to be the largest American chemical company as measured by market capitalization. Our dream of the future is to be the leader in providing solutions to the world's significant energy and environmental challenges. And we believe Air Products has a higher purpose beyond delivering superior financial results, bringing people together to work together and deliver sustainable solutions that benefit our customers and our world. This is what drives us every day. 
Now please turn to Slide #8. I'm proud to say that during the past 12 months, we have made significant progress in making these dreams a reality. We have significantly improved our safety record. Our margins remain highest in the industry. We announced our new sustainability goals, including carbon intensity reduction and diversity goals. These are consistent with our growth opportunities and our higher purpose. We helped drive our market cap increase by improving our earnings per share by over 10% on average over the last 6 years, with positive EPS growth in 2020 despite the negative impact of COVID-19 pandemic. We have continued to create and win projects that help customers and countries meet their growing needs for cleaner energy and environmental solutions. 
Let me share a few of the examples of these large important projects that demonstrate progress on our strategy. We've won 4 world-scale LNG heat exchanger projects over the last year, including the Qatargas megaproject, and the project in Mexico that we announced earlier this week. These projects are already contributing to our bottom line as we continue to complete them for our customers. We are executing the Gulf Coast Ammonia project in the U.S. Gulf Coast and have acquired the hydrogen assets of our PBF customer in California and Delaware. These projects will further enhance our hydrogen leadership position in the United States.  We announced the $2 billion coal-to-methanol project, categorized as a national strategic project by the Indonesian government to support energy development and transition and reduce the country's reliance on fuel imports. We also announced the innovative NEOM project in Saudi Arabia to provide the world with a robot map to transition to carbon-free that is green hydrogen, the energy source of the future. 
Now please turn to Slide #9. We remain committed to delivering superior financial performance. And as I said, our people also know they are supporting the higher purpose in the work they do every day. Our industrial gas enterprise is critical to the success of dozen industries and the scope and complexity of our megaprojects require talented people with a variety of skills and backgrounds from different parts of the world to work together as one team. We are proud to bring people from diverse backgrounds and experiences together to collaborate and develop these innovative solutions for some of the most significant energy and environmental challenges in the world. That is our higher purpose that inspires our team and drives us every day. 
Now please turn to Slide #10, which highlights our key gasification projects. We are committed to our gasification strategy and are pursuing exciting projects around the world. We continue to see countries and large companies, driving to convert low-value feedstock into high-value products. They have identified gasification as the best way to use abundant, low-value resources like coal, petcoke and refinery volumes in a sustainable manner. And we are in the best position to work with them and help them deliver better, more sustainable solutions that benefit their economies and their people. We do expect to announce additional gasification projects in the future. 
Now specifically, I would like to give you an update on the 2 largest gasification projects, which I discussed during our last earnings call. First, our $12 billion acquisition of the Jazan Gasifier and Power Plant from Saudi Aramco. Since our last call with investors on November 11, 2020, we have continued our discussions with Saudi Aramco to finalize all of the contracts, arrange the financing and move towards the financial close. I am encouraged by the progress we have made in the last 3 months. And I would especially like to thank the Saudi Aramco very senior management for the positive steps they have taken to move this transaction forward. We obviously still have work to do to bring this significant project to a final conclusion. But I am more optimistic than I was 3 months ago. 
The second project we discussed on the last earnings call was Lu'An. We have reached an agreement with Lu'An to temporarily reduce our fixed monthly fee during the time that the plant is shut down. And Lu'An has agreed to extend the length of the contract, which improves our return. Lu'An did pay us the reduced monthly fee for the months of October, November and December. We continue to believe that the plan will be restarted during this fiscal year. 
Now please turn to Slide #11, which reflects our recently announced 12% dividend increase, raising our quarterly dividend to $1.50 per share for an annual rate of $6 a share. This dividend increase is a reminder that while we continue to develop our exciting growth opportunities, we have significant cash flow that supports this substantial dividend increase, the 39th consecutive year of increase for Air Products. 
And finally, Slide #12, shows our EBITDA margin. As always, my favorite slide, that it shows that the margin is up over 1,400 basis points since 2014. I am very proud of our team who continue to deliver EBITDA margins of nearly 40% for the quarter despite the challenges facing us. 
Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to provide a financial overview. Scott?"

As Seifi stated earlier, our company continued to demonstrate resilience, delivering both higher sales and EBITDA this quarter despite the challenges of the pandemic. Our business, which is about half on-site, continue to deliver stable cash flow in spite of the difficult conditions continuing around the world. 
Now please turn to Slide 13 for a brief discussion of our first quarter results. Sales of $2.4 billion were up 5% compared to prior year, driven by strong price, higher energy pass-through and a positive currency impact. Price actions continue to be an area of focus for us and improved in all 3 regions. This is the 14th consecutive quarter of year-over-year price gain. Volume was relatively stable, down 1% as the additions of new plants, acquisitions and increased sale of equipment activities were more than offset by COVID-19 impacts and the reduced Lu'An contribution that Seifi mentioned. 
EBITDA of $932 million was up 3% as favorable price, currency and equity affiliate income more than offset the impact of lower volume and higher cost primarily due to higher planned maintenance outages. EBITDA margin declined about 100 basis points as lower volumes, including Lu'An and higher costs driven by increased planned maintenance in North America, more than offset the positive price impact. Operating income was 4% lower, while EBITDA was higher compared to last year, largely due to depreciation on new plants, particularly the PBF hydrogen plants that we acquired last year. 
COVID-19 continued to negatively impact our business. We estimate the pandemic reduced overall sales by about 4% and EPS by about $0.10 to $0.15. ROCE was 250 basis points lower, negatively impacted by the step-up in the denominator from the additional $5 billion of debt. Sequentially, the 3% weaker volume was driven primarily by seasonality, Lu'An and lower sale of equipment activities. However, sales were up overall sequentially as this lower volume was more than offset by favorable currency, higher energy pass-through and positive price. 
Now please turn to Slide 14. Our first quarter adjusted EPS of $2.12 was comparable to last year, despite the negative $0.10 to $0.15 impact of COVID-19. Volume was unfavorable $0.25. The negative impacts of COVID-19 and Lu'An more than offset the PBF acquisition and new plants. Volume was nearly flat in sales, but unfavorable in EPS due to business mix. Price, net of variable costs, contributed $0.17, with increases in all regions. Cost was unfavorable $0.06 as we executed planned maintenance projects and added new resources for future growth. 
For this quarter, we also benefited from the settlement of a supply contract. Currency and foreign exchange contributed $0.06, primarily due to appreciation of the Chinese RMB and euro relative to the U.S. dollar. Equity affiliate income added $0.04 due to strong underlying business results, while noncontrolling interest was also favorable $0.04 on lower profits in our consolidated joint ventures, primarily due to Lu'An. As a reminder, we consolidate 100% of Lu'An's results, given our 60% majority ownership of the joint venture and deduct our partners' 40% interest in the noncontrolling interest line. 
Interest expense was $0.07 unfavorable due to the costs associated with the additional $5 billion of debt. The remaining $0.05 includes a favorable $0.04 pension impact and a favorable $0.01 impact from a lower tax rate. The effective tax rate of 19.3% was down 50 basis points from prior year. We still expect our effective tax rate to be around 20% to 21% in fiscal year '21. 
Now please turn to Slide 15. We continue to generate strong cash flow, underscoring the stability of our business. Over the last 12 months, we generated almost $2.6 billion of distributable cash flow or about $0.115 -- $11.50 per share. From our EBITDA of over $3.6 billion, we paid interest, taxes and maintenance capital. Note, our maintenance CapEx is a little higher than usual, driven in part by spending on our new corporate headquarters. 
From the distributable cash flow, we paid over 40% or over $1.1 billion as dividends to our shareholders and still have about $1.4 billion available for high-return industrial gas investments. This strong cash flow, even in uncertain times, enables us to continue to create shareholder value through increasing dividends and capital deployment. 
Slide #16 provides additional details on our capital deployment. We continue to have substantial investment capacity remaining. As you can see, we expect about $18 billion of investment capacity available over the 5-year period from FY '18 through FY '22. The $18 billion includes over $9 billion of cash and additional debt capacity available today; about $2.5 billion of investable cash flow between now and the end of FY '22; and about $6 billion already spent. 
Additionally, we will generate more cash and borrowing capacity as projects come on stream. And some of the spending in our backlog extends beyond FY '22. We expect to reframe this potential for you later in 2021. We will continue to focus on managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted A/A2 rating. With a few new projects signed and some coming on stream, our total project and M&A commitments increased slightly to $12.7 billion, with about $11 billion remaining to spend on them. So you can see, we have already spent almost 35% and already committed 95% of the capacity we show here. 
Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call back over to Seifi."

Compared to last year, currency, price and energy pass-through resulted in a 4% increase in sales despite weaker volumes. Currency, favorable across most key countries, contributed 6%. Overall, price rose 1% for the region, which represents a 3% increase for merchant products. I'd like to remind you that pricing was positive for Asia for the 15th consecutive quarter and particularly strong in Korea and Taiwan this quarter. 
Volumes were down 4%, with new plants more than offset by Lu'An, while the merchant business remained stable. Despite the impact of lower volumes, a strong price and favorable currencies kept EBITDA -- we kept EBITDA relatively stable. EBITDA margin at almost 48% was 240 basis points lower, primarily driven by lower volumes, mostly from Lu'An. Sequentially, sales were up 1% with favorable currencies more than offsetting the weaker volumes, EBITDA increased 4%, primarily driven by lower costs, while favorable currency offset the negative impact of weaker volumes.

Higher price and energy pass-through were offset by lower volumes. Price was again better across all major product lines. The 3% increase for the region was equivalent to 7% for merchant. This is the tenth consecutive quarter of year-on-year price improvement. 
Volume was down, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19, but partially offset by the PBF acquisition. EBITDA of $400 million was 2% below last year's level as better price and the PBF acquisition were offset by this volume shortfall and higher maintenance costs. 
For the quarter, although Americas' planned maintenance was higher than last year, it is consistent with what we expect in Q2. EBITDA margin dipped 90 basis points, with a negative 80 basis point impact from higher energy pass-through, while the unfavorable cost impact was largely offset by other favorable factors, including price and acquisitions. 
Now I'll make some comments on our sequential results. Sales increased 2% as higher energy pass-through and positive price overcame negative volume. Price was up across all major product lines, while volume was weaker primarily due to seasonality. EBITDA declined 3% as weaker volume was partially offset by better price. Margin was down primarily on higher energy pass-through, which had about a 200 basis point impact. 
Now I'd like to turn the call back over to Simon to discuss our other segments. Simon?"

Now please turn to Slide 19 for a review of our Europe, Middle East and Africa region results. Our EMEA team delivered outstanding results this quarter. Both sales and profits grew double-digit compared to both last year and last quarter. Price, volume and currency were all favorable and contributed to the 13% year-on-year sales growth. Volumes grew 5%, principally due to acquisitions and higher on-site volumes, which offset the adverse impact of COVID-19, predominantly in our packaged gas business. Price increased 3% for the region and 4% for merchant, with improvement across most major product lines and subregions. This is the 12th consecutive quarter of year-on-year price improvement. 
Currencies were favorable 6%, primarily due to the euro strength versus the U.S. dollar. EBITDA surged 18% to more than $220 million, supported by price increases, favorable currency and acquisitions. EBITDA margin improved 170 basis points. Sequentially, volume improvement was driven by a modest COVID-19-related recovery in our merchant business, acquisitions and higher on-site volumes. EBITDA was also up sequentially and margins remained about flat. 
Now please turn to Slide 20, global gases, which includes our non-LNG sale of equipment business as well as central costs. Sales increased due to higher sale of equipment project activity, but profit was lower due to business mix and higher product development spending. As mentioned earlier, we also benefited from the settlement of a supply contract, which offset the gains in project activities last year. 
Please turn to Slide 21, corporate, which includes LNG and other businesses as well as our corporate costs. Sales and profits were higher this quarter versus prior year, driven by LNG project activities as we continue to execute multiple large projects, including Golden Pass and Mozambique, the massive Qatargas project also began to contribute this quarter. Sales and profits were both down versus prior quarter, primarily due to timing of percent complete activity on the LNG projects. We were excited to announce another new project earlier this week for the Energia Costa Azul LNG Export terminal in Ensenada, Mexico. This represents the fourth LNG project we've announced in the last year. 
Now to provide some additional thoughts, I'll turn the call back over to Seifi."

As we look forward, unfortunately, we do not expect the COVID-19 global crisis to moderate anytime soon. This will continue to have a negative impact on the economies of most of the countries we operate. We have confidence that the vaccine will help to reverse the course, but the rollout is still in early stages and the pace of vaccination is hard to predict. As a result, we continue to find it very difficult to make any reasonable projections about the course of economic activity around the world. Therefore, we are not providing EPS guidance or CapEx guidance for quarter 2 or for our fiscal year 2021 at this time. We hope the outlook will be less uncertain in April. And if so, we look forward to providing you guidance then. 
However, I want to share with you what we are seeing so far this quarter, that is in the month of January and as of today in February. Representing about half of our sales, our on-site business has been stable, and we expect this to continue. With respect to our merchant business, in Asia, our merchant volumes are down slightly versus where they were at the same time last year, which is before the virus crisis began. So the volumes have reached almost precrisis levels. 
In Europe, we are off to a weaker start following the holiday season and continue to see a larger impact on our packaged gases business versus the liquid bulk business. In Americas, merchant volumes remain down, and I would like to remind you again that we do not have a packaged gas business in North America. 
As we move forward, we remain committed to executing our growth strategy, providing sustainable solutions to help the world meets its increasing needs for cleaner energy. With our strong portfolio, we are able to meet customers' and countries' drive for cleaner and more sustainable solutions. We see great opportunities ahead in gasification, carbon capture and hydrogen for mobility, and we continue to develop and invest in strategic opportunity to drive our growth for decades to come. 
As always, the continued success -- the continue -- I'm sorry, as always, the continued success of this strategy is rooted in the commitment and motivation of the great team we have at Air Products. Our resilient and focused people understand the critical role they play in safely operating more than 750 facilities around the world, executing broader scale projects that support economic and social development. As Air Products, we will work together to deliver these solutions to our customers and to the world. 
I am proud to say that unlike many other companies, we have not reduced staff or reduced the salary of our people during this pandemic. Indeed, we have continued to strengthen our organization by adding the resources necessary to pursue great opportunities. We have stood by our people.

Today, because of the market condition, the actual interest rates are obviously lower than that. So the issue that we have had to negotiate and we have negotiated that, but is -- how much of that saving goes to each party. That's basically -- I mean, we were assuming X amount of interest. Now it is lower, therefore, the -- so who gets the benefit of it and how much of it. So that was one issue in terms of negotiation. 
The second thing is that we are trying to erase $7.2 billion of debt. That is not an easy task with a lot of banks involved and all of that, and that, the terms, conditions and all of that. So those are the 2 issues that we need to work out. 
In terms of how long it takes I think -- I'm hoping that we will be done with this thing by the May, June. But it takes time and it is unpredictable. There is a lot of factors. This is a geopolitical thing. The view of the banks changes every day, the view of Saudi Aramco changes every day. So I'm not pessimistic. I'm actually optimistic. I think we'll get this thing done at some point in time. But the issue -- those are the 2 issues that we are working on. I think one of them, we have worked on. I think you have an understanding with the senior management of Aramco in terms of what we're going to do in terms of sharing of the profit. But the devil is in the details, all of this has to be translated into actual contract language and the debt has to be a arranged. So that's what is taking time."

Things look even rosier than before because one thing is capturing carbon to help environments and all that. But there is a significant push right now, as I talked to the investors in the last 1.5 years to the last 2 years, that the transition to the hydrogen economy will be gray hydrogen then blue hydrogen and then green hydrogen. There is a significant demand now for so-called blue hydrogen. That people are thinking about making ammonia where you capture the CO2 that is generated, then you make the hydrogen. And therefore, the ammonia is called blue and then especially Japan wants to take that ammonia and blow it directly into their boilers for their power plants, and that is how they are going to decarbonize. 
So there is significant demand, a lot of conversations about so-called blue ammonia and blue hydrogen and all of that. We are working our carbon capture. We continue to work on carbon capture. And as I said, we will, in time, announce appropriate projects of the meaningful size to show you that we are making progress on this thing.

You cann",647,"Well, the way they are different is the same thing with gasification and everything else. The main reason that we are doing what we are doing is that we want to be competitive and put our customers in a competitive position to use green hydrogen. You cannot do it at small scale. The scale-up that we are doing is that it's not as if you are taking a technological risk . We are not. I mean, what are we doing at NEOM. We are building, yes, 4 gigawatts, 3.5 gigawatts, 4 gigawatts of wind and solar. That's known technology. It's no big deal. Then we are building 650-tonne a day electrolysis. And everyone says, ""Oh, my God."" Yes, but how are we doing that? We are going to take 30 of those 20-megawatt things that you said and put them together. So there is no risk in there. 
And then the ammonia plant, we are building 1 million-tonne ammonia plants all over the place. So we are not taking any technological risk. What we are doing is that we are creating a megaproject so that we get the benefit of the economy of scale. That's number one. 
And then the second thing is that all of these people who are announcing these different plants, the source of electricity is not green, and we are creating a green source of electricity. But the main thing is we are doing megaprojects because that is how you, number one, make it economically feasible. And number two, unless somebody like us makes a commitment to make a big project, people are not going to convert. 
I mean, if you own buses in San Francisco, you are not going to go and convert them to fuel cell vehicles, if you don't have an assurance that you will have the green hydrogen to put in, then what's the point of converting? So when you know that somebody is spending $6 billion, $7 billion to build the infrastructure, then you get the confidence. That is the difference in terms of what we are doing and what they are doing. It's not a big technological risk, but it's being the first and being the people, the first ones who develop the infrastructure. 
I mean, I don't want to make big comparisons here, but what is to making an electric car, I mean, my God, it's a motor and a gearbox, right? But look at the Tesla and look at the GM and Volkswagen. Those guys took the decision that first and everybody said, well, this is not going to work out because it's no big deal. GM can do this anytime. Well look at the where their stock is and where GM's stock is. There is significant advantage to be the first mover and you have to move on a big scale in order to make it economical for your customers to have confidence that you're going to have the product when they convert their fleet. So that is what we are doing. 
I have no comment about what our competitors are doing. They are -- I'm sure they are very smart people. And people like yourself, you question them about what they are doing and what they are not doing, and I don't want to make any comment on that. But for sure, I hope we know what we are doing and what we are doing is go for a scale, go for economy of scale, when you have the opportunity and produce a real green hydrogen, not these toy things at 10-tonne and 20-tonne a day, that really doesn't -- but beside that, we are doing those things. We are building a 30-tonne a day plant hydrogen in [indiscernible]. We are building 30-tonne plant hydrogen in other parts of the world. So that's not a big deal. But the mega-scale is the future."

We thank you for taking time from your very busy schedule to be on our call today. To start, I want to acknowledge the united and extraordinary efforts of all of the talented, committed and resilient people of Air Products around the world. They work hard every day to provide critical products and services to our customers. Our people, working in solidarity and in a determined way have made it possible for us to keep our 750 facilities around the board operating throughout this unprecedented crisis. And I want to particularly thank our team who worked through the very challenging severe winter storm in the U.S. Gulf Coast.
Our people are the ones who are making it possible for us to continue to deliver our near-term business results, while also pushing forward to develop, execute and operate major world-class projects to ensure our growth in the future. Our people are the bonds who make our higher purpose real every day, that is to help you manage move forward in a sustainable way and bring people together to help solve energy and environmental challenges.
Now please turn to Slide #3. As always, safety is the most important focus for all of us at Air Products. It is a moral responsibility to keep our people safe, and our goal will always be 0 accidents and 0 incidents. Despite the challenging COVID-19 conditions, our team continues to focus on working safely, following on strict protocols to help protect themselves, our customers and our communities. I also want to emphasize that sustainability is at the core of our DNA, and it drives our growth opportunities. We will be issuing our core sustainability report later this month, and I look forward to continuing this very important conversation with you.
Now please turn to Slides 4, 5 and 6. You can again see our goal, our management philosophy and our 5-point plan for moving forward. These are the guiding principles that they follow every day and that will continue to guide us in the future.
Now please turn to Slide #7. We remain committed to delivering superior financial performance. And as I said, our people also know they are supporting a higher purpose in the work they do every day. Our industrial gas expertise in many areas is critical to the success of dozens of industries. And the scope and complexity of our mega projects require talented people with a variety of skills and backgrounds from different parts of the world to work together as one team. We are proud to bring people from diverse backgrounds and experiences together to collaborate and develop innovative solutions for some of the most challenging energy and environmental problems in the world. That is our higher purpose, and it inspires our team and drives us forward every day.
Now please turn to Slide #8, which highlights our gasification projects. We are committed to our gasification strategy and are pursuing exciting projects around the world. We continue to see countries and large companies driving to convert low value of feedstock into high-value finished products. They have identified gasification as the best way to use abundant, low-value resources, like coal, pet coke and refinery bonds in a sustainable manner. And we are in the best position to work with them and help them deliver better, more sustainable solutions that benefit their economies and their people.
Consistent with our strategy, we are pleased to have completed the acquisition of the remaining 50% share of our gasification technology joint venture in China. Now that this team will be 100% part of Air Products, we are confident this will make us even more successful to pursue and win new large-scale gasification projects. We do expect to announce additional gasification projects in the future.
Now specifically, I would like to give you an update on the 2 large gasification projects, which I have discussed during our last 2 earnings calls. First, our $12 billion acquisition of the Jazan gasifier and power plant from Saudi Aramco. We have continued to make significant progress working with our partners and the lenders since our last update. The team has worked hard to bring the project to the final stage of project financing. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, we expect this project to reach financial close in this fiscal year.
I also want to provide you an update on Lu'An. During our second quarter, we continue to recognize a reduced monthly fee and there our interim agreement while our customers' plans were shut down. But I am very pleased to announce that our customers has requested the start-up of our facility, and we are proceeding with the commissioning of our plan. Since our equipment has been idled for several quarters, it will require a period of time to bring all 4 gasifiers back on. But for your information, as of this morning, the first gasifier was online, making synthetic gas and supplying our customers. So we are encouraged by this development.
Now please turn to Slide #9, which shows our EPS growth. As you can see, we have delivered greater than 10% annual EPS growth since 2014, despite the adversities presented by the recent external challenges. This is a testament to the hard work of our people and the stability of our business. This year, again, we expect to achieve nearly 10% EPS growth in challenging conditions. I will discuss our expectation for this year in more detail later in the call.
Now please turn to Slide #10. A reminder that we share our earnings and its growth with our investors. Both our EPS and dividends have grown double digits since 2014. While we continue to develop our exciting growth opportunities, we have significant cash flow that supports our substantial dividend that we have increased for the last 39 consecutive years.
And finally, Slide #11, shows our EBITDA margin. As always, my favorite slide, where it shows that the margin is up over 1,200 basis points since 2014. Margin is down slightly, primarily due to the significantly higher energy pass-through for natural gas, which increases our sales but doesn't impact profits. I'm very proud of our team who delivered EBITDA margin over 37% for the quarter despite the challenges of the pandemic and the winter storm affecting the U.S. Gulf Coast.
Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to provide a financial review. Scott?"

Sales topped $2.5 billion, up 13% compared to prior year, driven by strong prices, higher energy pass-through and favorable currencies. Volume was flat as the additions of new plants, acquisitions and increased sales of equipment activities were offset by reduced Lu'An contributions, COVID-19 impacts and the winter storm. Prices were again up versus prior year with improvements in all 3 regions. This is the 15th consecutive quarter of year-over-year pricing gains. 
Overall, prices were up 2% in total, which represents a 5% increase for the merchant business. COVID-19 continued to negatively impact our business. We estimate the pandemic reduced overall sales by about 3% and EPS by about $0.10 to $0.15. The U.S. Gulf Coast winter storm disrupted our customers, interfered with our operations and caused the sharp spike in local energy prices. However, we were able to mitigate much of the negative impact through operational actions and contractual pass-through to customers.
Our people work tirelessly overcoming these challenges during this time, restarting our plants quickly and restoring supply to our customers as they also recovered from the weather impacts. I want to extend my sincere gratitude to our people for a job well done.
The adverse weather, in addition to having a modest negative impact on sales and profits, also reduced our margin. Higher energy cost pass-through, primarily due to the storm, decreased the EBITDA margin by about 300 basis points this quarter. As a reminder, this contractual pass-through increases sales but not profits. EBITDA of $934 million improved 5% as favorable price, currency and equity affiliate income more than offset the negative impact of volume, the winter storm in the U.S. and higher development costs.
Operating income was 2% lower, while EBITDA was higher compared to last year, largely due to depreciation on new plants, particularly the PBF hydrogen plants that we acquired last year. ROCE was 320 basis points lower, primarily due to the increase in the denominator from the additional $5 billion of debt. Sequentially, sales were up 5%, primarily driven by 4% higher energy cost pass-through. Price was up 1%, but volume was down 1%, driven primarily by the Lunar New Year slowdown in Asia.
Now please turn to Slide 13. Our second quarter GAAP EPS was $2.13, which included 2 non-GAAP items, a $0.12 gain on an exchange with a joint venture partner in Europe and an $0.08 loss from a facility closure. Excluding the non-GAAP items in both periods, our second quarter adjusted EPS of $2.08 was $0.04 above last year despite the negative $0.10 to $0.15 impact of COVID-19 and lower Lu'An contribution. Volume was unfavorable $0.19. The negative impacts of COVID-19 and Lu'An more than offset gains from the PBF acquisition as well as a number of small new plants, particularly in Asia. Volume was flat in sales, but unfavorable in EPS due to business mix.
It is important to recognize that as the 60% majority owner of the Lu'An joint venture, 100% of the negative impact from Lu'An is included in this volume line because we consolidate the operating results. However, this was partially offset by the positive impact reflected in the noncontrolling interest line as the net income shared by our partner is also reduced. In other words, the negative $0.19 volume overstates the overall EPS impact to Air Products from Lu'An. Price net of variable costs contributed $0.09, demonstrating the value we deliver to customer and includes the higher energy costs associated with the winter storm. Cost was modestly unfavorable as we continue to add new resources for future growth and incur additional development costs. Currency and foreign exchange contributed $0.10, primarily due to appreciation of the Chinese RMB, euro, British pound and the South Korean won relative to the U.S. dollar.
Equity affiliate income added $0.05 on strong underlying business results, while noncontrolling interest was also favorable $0.04 on lower profits in our consolidated joint ventures, primarily Lu'An, as I mentioned previously. Interest expense was $0.06 unfavorable due to the costs associated with the additional $5 billion of debt. The remaining $0.04 includes a favorable $0.03 nonoperating income impact and a favorable $0.01 impact from a lower tax rate. The effective tax rate of 20.2% was 30 basis points lower than last year. We still expect our effective tax rate to be around 20% to 21% in fiscal year '21.
Now please turn to Slide 14. The stability of our business allows us to continue to generate strong cash flow. Over the last 12 months, we generated almost $2.6 billion of distributable cash flow or about $11.60 per share. From our EBITDA of almost $3.7 billion, we paid interest, taxes and maintenance capital. Note that our maintenance CapEx is a little higher than usual, driven in part by spending on our new global headquarters.
From the distributable cash flow, we paid over 45% or almost $1.2 billion as dividends to our shareholders and still have about $1.4 billion available for high-return industrial gas investments. This strong cash flow, even in uncertain times, enables us to continue to create shareholder value through increasing dividends and capital deployment.
Slide #15 provides additional details on our capital deployment. As I said last quarter, Air Products continues to have substantial investment capacity remaining and available to deploy into high-return projects consistent with our strategy. As you can see, we expect about $18 billion of investment capacity available over the 5-year period from FY '18 through FY '22. The $18 billion includes over $9 billion of cash and additional debt capacity available today, over $2 billion of investable cash flow between now and the end of FY '22 and over $6 billion already spent. Additionally, we anticipate generating more cash and borrowing capacity as projects come on stream and contribute to the growth in our results, and some of the spending on our backlog extends beyond FY '22. We expect to reframe this potential for you later this year.
We continue to focus on managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted A/A2 rating. With a few smaller new projects signed and some coming on stream, our total project and M&A commitments remained about $12.7 billion, with about $10.5 billion remaining to spend on them. So you can see, we've already spent over 35% and have already committed 95% of the capacity we show here.
Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call back over to Seifi."

Sales increased 6% compared to last year as favorable currency and price more than offset weaker volume. Pricing up in all countries added 1%, which represents a 3% increase for the merchant business. This was the 16th consecutive quarter of year-on-year price improvement. Sequentially price was also positive, but rounded to 0. 
Volumes are down 2% as higher merchant volumes -- I'd like to repeat, higher merchant volumes and new plants partially offset the impact of Lu'An being shut down. Merchant volume improvement in the region has been encouraging, particularly in light of the strong rebound following the expected Lunar New Year slowdown. But the recovery is not consistent across all product lines.
Additionally, we brought on stream a number of new smaller plants that contributed to our results. EBITDA was similar to last year, as strong price and favorable currency helped offset the impact of lower volumes. EBITDA margin of 46.4% was 330 basis points lower than last year, primarily due to lower volume driven value Lu'An. Sales and profit were down sequentially, primarily due to Lunar New Year.
Now I would like to turn the call back to Scott to talk about our Americas results. Scott?"

Sales increased 13% compared to last year as strong price and significantly higher energy pass-through more than offset lower volumes. Volume was down 6%, primarily due to the continuing negative impact of COVID-19 and the winter storm in the U.S. Gulf Coast. Although there are signs of overall economic improvements in the U.S., the operating results for U.S. refineries remained low. 
The winter storm this quarter further reduced the demand for hydrogen in the Gulf Coast, in addition to pressuring the merchant products. We have also seen some transitory contractual reduction in our hydrogen business recently, as some refineries are reconfiguring their operations to produce renewable fuels. However, such production will use hydrogen once the process is completed. The uses of hydrogen for renewable fuel per unit is, in fact, 4 to 5x more than conventional fuel.
Price is again better across most major product lines. The 3% increase for the region was equivalent to a 7% increase on the merchant business. This is the 11th consecutive quarter of year-on-year price improvement. Higher energy pass-through increased sales by 15%. The higher energy prices through the rest of the quarter were exacerbated by the record high prices during the winter storm, which much of this contractually passed through to customers. EBITDA reached nearly $450 million, a 6% increase over last year as better price, higher equity affiliate income and the PBF acquisition more than offset the volume shortfall, including the adverse impact of the winter storm. EBITDA margin declined 310 basis points. Higher energy pass-through, which increased sales but not profits, reduced margin by 650 basis points. In other words, margins were up over 300 basis points excluding the energy cost pass-through impact.
Compared to last quarter, Americas volumes increased 2% following the holiday season and continued the gradual COVID recovery. Price also improved 1%. EBITDA improved double digits sequentially, supported by improved volume, lower maintenance and higher equity affiliate income. EBITDA margin was almost flat sequentially, which included a negative 450 basis point impact from higher energy pass-through.

Our EMEA team delivered another set of outstanding results this quarter. Sales and EBITDA both improved nearly 20% versus last year. Volume plus price was up 7%. As volume grew 5%, principally due to acquisitions and higher on-site volumes, which more than overcame the adverse impact of COVID-19, predominantly in our packaged gas business. Price increased for the 13th consecutive quarter and was higher across most major product lines and subregions. The 2% price gain for the region corresponds to a 3% improvement for the merchant business.
Currencies were favorable 9%, primarily due to the strong euro and British pound. EBITDA jumped 17% to nearly $220 million, supported by favorable price volume, currencies and equity affiliate income. EBITDA margin dipped 50 basis points, primarily due to a negative 100 basis point impact from higher energy cost pass-through. EBITDA was down 2% compared to last quarter, primarily due to seasonally lower equity affiliate income, while margin decreased 220 basis points, including a 70 basis point negative impact from higher energy cost pass-through.
Now please turn to Slide 19, global gases, which includes our non-LNG sale of equipment businesses as well as central costs. Sales increased due to higher sale of equipment project activity, but profit was lower due to business mix and higher product development spending.
Please turn to Slide 20, corporate, which includes LNG and other businesses as well as our corporate costs. Sales were higher this quarter, driven by increased project activities as we continue to execute multiple large LNG and other projects. Profit dipped slightly on higher corporate costs.
Now to provide some additional thoughts, I'll turn the call back over to Seifi."

Unfortunately, as everybody knows, the world continues to struggle with the COVID-19 pandemic. With widespread vaccination efforts, some regions have been able to reduced the spread of the virus, while others are experiencing an increase in number of cases. Against this backdrop, we take pride in our ability to deliver consistent earnings and cash flow. Our on-site business, roughly half of our total sales, remained stable and our price continued to be strong. We have also seen signs of improvement in merchant volumes.
As we look forward, although we still see uncertainties ahead, our confidence in major economies around the world is growing, particularly in light of the increasing pace of vaccination. Therefore, we have resumed providing EPS guidance this quarter. As I mentioned earlier, Lu'An has asked us to restart our facilities and we expect Jazan to close during this fiscal year. 
However, there remains some uncertainty to the exact timing of these events; therefore, we are providing our EPS and CapEx guidance, excluding Jazan and Lu'An restart. In other words, the restart of Lu'An and the financial close of Jazan, if they happened within this fiscal year, they will be accretive to the guidance that I'm giving you.
Our quarter -- for quarter 3 of fiscal year 2021, our earnings per share guidance is $2.30 to $2.40 per share, which is up 14% to 19% over last year. And the guidance for our fiscal year 2021 is $8.95 to $9.10, up 7% to 9% over last year. We see our CapEx at approximately $2.5 billion for this year, again, excluding Jazan. Meanwhile, we continue to execute our other projects, bringing them on stream and finalizing agreements with our customers. We are committed to the capital deployment strategy and to growing our pipeline of our projects.
Please turn to Slide #22. As always, the success of our strategy is rooted in the great team who have added products. We believe strongly that our only sustainable long-term competitive advantage is the degree of commitment and motivation of our people, the people who work hard every day to bring our strategy to life. I am very proud to be working with this team.
Our deep commitment to sustainability creates exciting growth opportunities driven by the energy transition to a lower carbon board. Our gasification, carbon capture and hydrogen growth platforms are at the core of this transition. In the past 5 years, our differentiated strategy and our core competencies have positioned Air Products to lead across these areas.
Now at this time, we are very pleased to answer any of your questions."

Then in terms of the other 3 opportunities, in terms of capital allocation, I don't want to kind of prefer one over the other because it depends in different parts of the world. Obviously, we are not going to spend any money on significant gasification project in some of the more developed core gasification in, for example, Europe or in the U.S., but there will be coal gasification projects in India and Indonesia and the other China.
Carbon capture is going to record a lot of capital, and that will be very, very prevalent in -- I foresee in Europe and in the United States, specifically. And then obviously, green hydrogen and blue hydrogen, it will be all over the world. So I would have a balance with them. But since these are all mega projects, for 1 year or 2, one of them might be higher than the other one. But in the course of 5 to 10 years, if you take all of the capital allocation, I think that most of the capital will go to carbon capture, then hydrogen and then gasification."

Number one, the margin comes down when Lu'An is shut down because Lu'An is a very, very high-margin business. So that -- Lu'An, by itself, has a significant effect when it is down.
The second thing is that then natural gas prices go up, we end up showing more sales because we are buying natural gas and then the customer reimburses us for that. But it shows us higher sales, but it doesn't affect the profit line. So if natural gas, every dollar of natural gas going up, affects our sales by $350 million. So if natural gas prices continue to go up, then our margins for our hydrogen business looks lower because the profit doesn't change, but the sales go up. So those are the 2 effects that you need to think about.
So as we go forward, if natural gas prices come back to the levels they were, and Lu'An starts up, then you're going to see our margins go up. So I still feel very good about our margins. We haven't seen a fundamental change in the profitability of our business."

Interesting where you highlighted carbon capture as being potentially the largest bucket. And I wanted to just drill into that a little bit. Would you say that is potentially the largest because of the interest in it as from customers that see it as a way to meet some carbon reduction targets in a relatively inexpensive way? Or would you say that you have something to bring that's really somewhat differentiated in the capacity of either your technology or your access to these CO2-rich streams coming out of the SMRs that you could target? And just anything that you might have to add on that with perspective of any limitations to where you can sequester the CO2."

And also thank you for providing the answer because you kind of answered the question by saying that we are in a unique position. We are operating the largest carbon capture facility in the world right now. Operational, we have been running it for several years. We captured 1 million ton a year of CO2 from the SMRs that we have in Port Arthur. So we know how to do this thing. 
Secondly is that we have many, many SMR that put out CO2. Therefore, the CO2 is there that can be captured. The other thing is the fact that there is significant focus on this because by capturing CO2, you can make blue hydrogen. And therefore, the transition to the hydrogen economy can happen very quickly using hydrocarbons and a lot of people are very interested in that. People who make hydrocarbons are very interested in finding a way to produce hydrogen, capture the carbon and say he's hydrogen which is almost -- is not as good as green hydrogen, but it is hydrogen with significantly reduced carbon footprint. So that is why I am -- I think that there will be a lot of big investments in that area, and we are very well positioned with our core competency with the plants that we have around the world to be a major player on that, and we intend to be a major player on that.
Our goal is very simple, gasification, we have put ourselves in a position that we are the major -- the leading company for gasification. Any gasification project in the project -- in the world, probably Air Products will do that. We plan to be the leader in blue hydrogen, which means CO2 capture, and we plan to be the leader in green hydrogen, which you already are with the plant that we are building in NEOM."

And I just wanted to get your view on whether that opportunity is potentially more attractive in the U.S. because the cities can start with gray hydrogen that's relatively less expensive than if it was sourced from natural gas in Europe at 3x the price? Is it the attraction starting gray? Or do you see, longer term, the fuel cell buses in regions like Europe is potentially larger in that green hydrogen could be more comparably -- comparably cost and priced relative to gray?"

The issue is that, in terms of the economics, you would expect that U.S. will be ahead of Europe because of the cheap natural gas that you can convert and all of that, you can capture the carbon and have blue hydrogen and all that. But then there is the fundamental element of the government interest. And what we are finding out is that the governments in Europe are a lot more committed to green hydrogen. They are really committed to green hydrogen, not blue. They won't bring. 
And as a result, I think our hydrogen business -- our green hydrogen business, the biggest potential will be in Europe rather than in the U.S. or any other part of the world. That's the way it is developing right now. But things can change. Government policies can change. If in the United States, all of the states or at least the majority of the states adopt the LCFS plan that California has put in place, then you are going to see a boom in terms of hydrogen in the U.S., but I don't know whether that happens or if that happens.
But in Europe, we see that. And then in Japan, they are going with the idea of taking blue ammonia and putting it in their power plants to reduce their carbon footprint. So the different parts of the world are doing different things. But what you are delineating is a very logical economic thing, but on top of that, you have to put the layer where the government pressure is. And I think for a project like NEOM, the biggest potential market will probably be Europe."

It would appear that you responded to the earlier question discussing blue hydrogen, but it would appear there's quite an opportunity for stacking some of these carbon capture credits for renewable diesel.

Why aren't we seeing that occur right now? You mentioned there's a lot of talk about projects, but maybe things aren't happening. I'm curious what bottlenecks might exist? And if that involves perhaps some takeaway capacity for CO2 that maybe needs to be built by someone else before those can move forward?"

You are saying how come these renewable These are projects are not happening faster? I think the main reason is that right now, the only place that it makes sense to sell renewable diesel and still be profitable is in California. 
So people -- I mean, the [indiscernible] when they are producing this thing in Texas, they don't sell it in Texas, they sell it in California because if they sell it in Texas, they lose money because just the cost of the raw material for making renewable diesel is probably $2.50, $3 a gallon. 
So -- and so right now, everybody is making things to go to California and sell it in California. And therefore, people are sitting down and saying, ""How many -- how much capacity does scale out on you have?"" Because if you add all of these renewable diesels in 4 or 5 years, 100% of the diesel sold in California will be renewable. Then what do you do? 
So people need to get themselves comfortable that this policy that California has will be picked up by Oregon and Colorado and New York and all of that, which I think it will be. But until it is done, I think you're not going to see a significant growth on this thing because people are going to say, ""Well, am I going to sell it?"""

We thank you for taking time from your very busy schedule to be on our call today. To start, I want to acknowledge the united and extraordinary efforts of all of the talented, committed and resilient people of Air Products around the world. They work hard every day to provide critical products and services to our customers. Our people, working in solidarity and in a determined way, have made it possible for us to keep our 750 facilities around the world operating throughout this unprecedented crisis. And I want to particularly thank our team who worked through the very challenging severe winter storm in the U.S. Gulf Coast.
Our people are the ones who are making it possible for us to continue to deliver our near-term business results, while also pushing forward to develop, execute and operate major world-class projects to ensure our growth in the future. Our people are the ones who make our higher purpose real every day, that is to help humanity move forward in a sustainable way and bring people together to help solve energy and environmental challenges.
Now please turn to Slide #3. As always, safety is the most important focus for all of us at Air Products. It is a moral responsibility to keep our people safe, and our goal will always be 0 accidents and 0 incidents. Despite the challenging COVID-19 conditions, our team continues to focus on working safely, following our strict protocols to help protect themselves, our customers and our communities. I also want to emphasize that sustainability is at the core of our DNA, and it drives our growth opportunities. We will be issuing our annual sustainability report later this month, and I look forward to continuing this very important conversation with you.
Now please turn to Slides 4, 5 and 6. You can again see our goal, our management philosophy and our 5-point plan for moving forward. These are the guiding principles that we follow every day and that will continue to guide us in the future.
Now please turn to Slide #7. We remain committed to delivering superior financial performance. And as I said, our people also know they are supporting a higher purpose in the work they do every day. Our industrial gas expertise in many areas is critical to the success of dozens of industries. And the scope and complexity of our mega projects require talented people with a variety of skills and backgrounds from different parts of the world to work together as one team. We are proud to bring people from diverse backgrounds and experiences together to collaborate and develop innovative solutions for some of the most challenging energy and environmental problems in the world. That is our higher purpose, and it inspires our team and drives us forward every day.
Now please turn to Slide #8, which highlights our gasification projects. We are committed to our gasification strategy and are pursuing exciting projects around the world. We continue to see countries and large companies driving to convert low-value feedstock into high-value finished products. They have identified gasification as the best way to use abundant, low-value resources, like coal, pet coke and refinery bottoms in a sustainable manner. And we are in the best position to work with them and help them deliver better, more sustainable solutions that benefit their economies and their people.
Consistent with our strategy, we are pleased to have completed the acquisition of the remaining 50% share of our gasification technology joint venture in China. Now that this team will be 100% part of Air Products, we are confident this will make us even more successful to pursue and win new large-scale gasification projects. We do expect to announce additional gasification projects in the future.
Now specifically, I would like to give you an update on the 2 large gasification projects, which I have discussed during our last 2 earnings calls. First, our $12 billion acquisition of the Jazan gasifier and power plant from Saudi Aramco. We have continued to make significant progress working with our partners and lenders since our last update. The team has worked hard to bring the project to the final stage of project financing. Barring any unforeseen circumstances, we expect this project to reach financial close in this fiscal year.
I also want to provide you an update on Lu'An. During our second quarter, we continue to recognize a reduced monthly fee under our interim agreement while our customers' plants were shut down. But I am very pleased to announce that our customers has requested the start-up of our facility, and we are proceeding with the commissioning of our plant. Since our equipment has been idled for several quarters, it will require a period of time to bring all 4 gasifiers back on. But for your information, as of this morning, the first gasifier was online, making synthetic gas and supplying our customers. So we are encouraged by this development.
Now please turn to Slide #9, which shows our EPS growth. As you can see, we have delivered greater than 10% annual EPS growth since 2014, despite the adversities presented by the recent external challenges. This is a testament to the hard work of our people and the stability of our business. This year, again, we expect to achieve nearly 10% EPS growth in challenging conditions. I will discuss our expectation for this year in more detail later in the call.
Now please turn to Slide #10. A reminder that we share our earnings and its growth with our investors. Both our EPS and dividends have grown double digits since 2014. While we continue to develop our exciting growth opportunities, we have significant cash flow that supports our substantial dividend that we have increased for the last 39 consecutive years.
And finally, Slide #11, shows our EBITDA margin. As always, my favorite slide, where it shows that the margin is up over 1,200 basis points since 2014. Margin is down slightly, primarily due to the significantly higher energy pass-through for natural gas, which increases our sales but doesn't impact profits. I'm very proud of our team who delivered EBITDA margin over 37% for the quarter despite the challenges of the pandemic and the winter storm affecting the U.S. Gulf Coast.
Now I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Scott Crocco, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to provide a financial review. Scott?"

We continue to demonstrate the resilience of our company, our business and most importantly, our people. EPS increased despite the ongoing COVID impact, lower earnings from Lu'An and the extreme U.S. Gulf Coast weather during the quarter. Our business, which is about half on-site, continued to deliver stable cash flow in spite of difficult conditions continuing around the world. 
Now please turn to Slide 12, for a brief discussion of our second quarter results. Sales topped $2.5 billion, up 13% compared to prior year, driven by strong prices, higher energy pass-through and favorable currencies. Volume was flat as the additions of new plants, acquisitions and increased sale-of-equipment activities were offset by reduced Lu'An contributions, COVID-19 impacts and the winter storm. Prices were again up versus prior year with improvements in all 3 regions. This is the 15th consecutive quarter of year-over-year pricing gains. 
Overall, prices were up 2% in total, which represents a 5% increase for the merchant business. COVID-19 continued to negatively impact our business. We estimate the pandemic reduced overall sales by about 3% and EPS by about $0.10 to $0.15. The U.S. Gulf Coast winter storm disrupted our customers, interfered with our operations and caused the sharp spike in local energy prices. However, we were able to mitigate much of the negative impact through operational actions and contractual pass-through to customers.
Our people work tirelessly overcoming these challenges during this time, restarting our plants quickly and restoring supply to our customers as they also recovered from the weather impacts. I want to extend my sincere gratitude to our people for a job well done.
The adverse weather, in addition to having a modest negative impact on sales and profits, also reduced our margin. Higher energy cost pass-through, primarily due to the storm, decreased the EBITDA margin by about 300 basis points this quarter. As a reminder, this contractual pass-through increases sales but not profits. EBITDA of $934 million improved 5% as favorable price, currency and equity affiliate income more than offset the negative impact of volume, the winter storm in the U.S. and higher development costs.
Operating income was 2% lower, while EBITDA was higher compared to last year, largely due to depreciation on new plants, particularly the PBF hydrogen plants that we acquired last year. ROCE was 320 basis points lower, primarily due to the increase in the denominator from the additional $5 billion of debt. Sequentially, sales were up 5%, primarily driven by 4% higher energy cost pass-through. Price was up 1%, but volume was down 1%, driven primarily by the Lunar New Year slowdown in Asia.
Now please turn to Slide 13. Our second quarter GAAP EPS was $2.13, which included 2 non-GAAP items, a $0.12 gain on an exchange with a joint venture partner in Europe and an $0.08 loss from a facility closure. Excluding the non-GAAP items in both periods, our second quarter adjusted EPS of $2.08 was $0.04 above last year despite the negative $0.10 to $0.15 impact of COVID-19 and lower Lu'An contribution. Volume was unfavorable $0.19. The negative impacts of COVID-19 and Lu'An more than offset gains from the PBF acquisition as well as a number of small new plants, particularly in Asia. Volume was flat in sales, but unfavorable in EPS due to business mix.
It is important to recognize that as the 60% majority owner of the Lu'An joint venture, 100% of the negative impact from Lu'An is included in this volume line because we consolidate the operating results. However, this was partially offset by the positive impact reflected in the noncontrolling interest line as the net income shared by our partner is also reduced. In other words, the negative $0.19 volume overstates the overall EPS impact to Air Products from Lu'An. Price net of variable costs contributed $0.09, demonstrating the value we deliver to customer and includes the higher energy costs associated with the winter storm. Cost was modestly unfavorable as we continue to add new resources for future growth and incur additional development costs. Currency and foreign exchange contributed $0.10, primarily due to appreciation of the Chinese RMB, euro, British pound and the South Korean won relative to the U.S. dollar.
Equity affiliate income added $0.05 on strong underlying business results, while noncontrolling interest was also favorable $0.04 on lower profits in our consolidated joint ventures, primarily Lu'An, as I mentioned previously. Interest expense was $0.06 unfavorable due to the costs associated with the additional $5 billion of debt. The remaining $0.04 includes a favorable $0.03 nonoperating income impact and a favorable $0.01 impact from a lower tax rate. The effective tax rate of 20.2% was 30 basis points lower than last year. We still expect our effective tax rate to be around 20% to 21% in fiscal year '21.
Now please turn to Slide 14. The stability of our business allows us to continue to generate strong cash flow. Over the last 12 months, we generated almost $2.6 billion of distributable cash flow or about $11.60 per share. From our EBITDA of almost $3.7 billion, we paid interest, taxes and maintenance capital. Note that our maintenance CapEx is a little higher than usual, driven in part by spending on our new global headquarters.
From the distributable cash flow, we paid over 45% or almost $1.2 billion as dividends to our shareholders and still have about $1.4 billion available for high-return industrial gas investments. This strong cash flow, even in uncertain times, enables us to continue to create shareholder value through increasing dividends and capital deployment.
Slide #15 provides additional details on our capital deployment. As I said last quarter, Air Products continues to have substantial investment capacity remaining and available to deploy into high-return projects consistent with our strategy. As you can see, we expect about $18 billion of investment capacity available over the 5-year period from FY '18 through FY '22. The $18 billion includes over $9 billion of cash and additional debt capacity available today, over $2 billion of investable cash flow between now and the end of FY '22 and over $6 billion already spent. Additionally, we anticipate generating more cash and borrowing capacity as projects come on stream and contribute to the growth in our results, and some of the spending on our backlog extends beyond FY '22. We expect to reframe this potential for you later this year.
We continue to focus on managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted A/A2 rating. With a few smaller new projects signed and some coming on stream, our total project and M&A commitments remained about $12.7 billion, with about $10.5 billion remaining to spend on them. So you can see, we've already spent over 35% and have already committed 95% of the capacity we show here.
Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call back over to Seifi."

Sales increased 6% compared to last year as favorable currency and price more than offset weaker volume. Pricing up in all countries added 1%, which represents a 3% increase for the merchant business. This was the 16th consecutive quarter of year-on-year price improvement. Sequentially, price was also positive, but rounded to 0. 
Volumes are down 2% as higher merchant volumes, I'd like to repeat, higher merchant volumes and new plants partially offset the impact of Lu'An being shut down. Merchant volume improvement in the region has been encouraging, particularly in light of the strong rebound following the expected Lunar New Year slowdown. But the recovery is not consistent across all product lines.
Additionally, we brought on stream a number of new smaller plants that contributed to our results. EBITDA was similar to last year, as strong price and favorable currency helped offset the impact of lower volumes. EBITDA margin of 46.4% was 330 basis points lower than last year, primarily due to lower volume driven by Lu'An. Sales and profit were down sequentially, primarily due to Lunar New Year.
Now I would like to turn the call back to Scott to talk about our Americas results. Scott?"

Sales increased 13% compared to last year as strong price and significantly higher energy pass-through more than offset lower volumes. Volume was down 6%, primarily due to the continuing negative impact of COVID-19 and the winter storm in the U.S. Gulf Coast. Although there are signs of overall economic improvements in the U.S., the operating results for U.S. refineries remained low. 
The winter storm this quarter further reduced the demand for hydrogen in the Gulf Coast, in addition to pressuring the merchant products. We have also seen some transitory contractual reduction in our hydrogen business recently, as some refineries are reconfiguring their operations to produce renewable fuels. However, such production will use hydrogen once the process is completed. The usage of hydrogen for renewable fuel per unit is, in fact, 4 to 5x more than conventional fuel.
Price was again better across most major product lines. The 3% increase for the region was equivalent to a 7% increase on the merchant business. This is the 11th consecutive quarter of year-on-year price improvement. Higher energy pass-through increased sales by 15%. The higher energy prices through the rest of the quarter were exacerbated by the record high prices during the winter storm, which much of this contractually passed through to customers.
EBITDA reached nearly $450 million, a 6% increase over last year as better price, higher equity affiliate income and the PBF acquisition more than offset the volume shortfall, including the adverse impact of the winter storm. EBITDA margin declined 310 basis points. Higher energy pass-through, which increased sales but not profits, reduced margin by 650 basis points. In other words, margins were up over 300 basis points, excluding the energy cost pass-through impact.
Compared to last quarter, Americas volumes increased 2% following the holiday season and continued the gradual COVID recovery. Price also improved 1%. EBITDA improved double digits sequentially, supported by improved volume, lower maintenance and higher equity affiliate income. EBITDA margin was almost flat sequentially, which included a negative 450 basis point impact from higher energy pass-through.

Our EMEA team delivered another set of outstanding results this quarter. Sales and EBITDA both improved nearly 20% versus last year. Volume plus price was up 7%, as volume grew 5%, principally due to acquisitions and higher on-site volumes, which more than overcame the adverse impact of COVID-19, predominantly in our packaged gas business. Price increased for the 13th consecutive quarter and was higher across most major product lines and subregions. The 2% price gain for the region corresponds to a 3% improvement for the merchant business.
Currencies were favorable 9%, primarily due to the strong euro and British pound. EBITDA jumped 17% to nearly $220 million, supported by favorable price, volume, currencies and equity affiliate income. EBITDA margin dipped 50 basis points, primarily due to a negative 100 basis point impact from higher energy cost pass-through. EBITDA was down 2% compared to last quarter, primarily due to seasonally lower equity affiliate income, while margin decreased 220 basis points, including a 70 basis point negative impact from higher energy cost pass-through.
Now please turn to Slide 19, global gases, which includes our non-LNG sale of equipment businesses as well as central costs. Sales increased due to higher sale of equipment project activity, but profit was lower due to business mix and higher product development spending.
Please turn to Slide 20, corporate, which includes LNG and other businesses as well as our corporate costs. Sales were higher this quarter, driven by increased project activities as we continued to execute multiple large LNG and other projects. Profit dipped slightly on higher corporate costs.
Now to provide some additional thoughts, I'll turn the call back over to Seifi."

Unfortunately, as everybody knows, the world continues to struggle with the COVID-19 pandemic. With widespread vaccination efforts, some regions have been able to reduce the spread of the virus, while others are experiencing an increase in number of cases. Against this backdrop, we take pride in our ability to deliver consistent earnings and cash flow. Our on-site business, roughly half of our total sales, remained stable and our price continued to be strong. We have also seen signs of improvement in merchant volumes.
As we look forward, although we still see uncertainties ahead, our confidence in major economies around the world is growing, particularly in light of the increasing pace of vaccination. Therefore, we have resumed providing EPS guidance this quarter. As I mentioned earlier, Lu'An has asked us to restart our facilities, and we expect Jazan to close during this fiscal year. 
However, there remains some uncertainty to the exact timing of these events; therefore, we are providing our EPS and CapEx guidance, excluding Jazan and Lu'An restart. In other words, the restart of Lu'An and the financial close of Jazan, if they happen within this fiscal year, they will be accretive to the guidance that I'm giving you.
Our quarter -- for quarter 3 of fiscal year 2021, our earnings per share guidance is $2.30 to $2.40 per share, which is up 14% to 19% over last year. And the guidance for our fiscal year 2021 is $8.95 to $9.10, up 7% to 9% over last year. We see our CapEx at approximately $2.5 billion for this year, again, excluding Jazan. Meanwhile, we continue to execute our other projects, bringing them on stream and finalizing agreements with our customers. We are committed to the capital deployment strategy and to growing our pipeline of our projects.
Please turn to Slide #22. As always, the success of our strategy is rooted in the great team we have at Air Products. We believe strongly that our only sustainable long-term competitive advantage is the degree of commitment and motivation of our people, the people who work hard every day to bring our strategy to life. I am very proud to be working with this team.
Our deep commitment to sustainability creates exciting growth opportunities driven by the energy transition to a lower carbon world. Our gasification, carbon capture and hydrogen growth platforms are at the core of this transition. In the past 5 years, our differentiated strategy and our core competencies have positioned Air Products to lead across these areas.
Now at this time, we are very pleased to answer any of your questions."

Then in terms of the other 3 opportunities, in terms of capital allocation, I don't want to kind of prefer one over the other because it depends different parts of the world. Obviously, we are not going to spend any money on significant gasification project in some of the more developed coal gasification in, for example, Europe or the U.S., but there will be coal gasification projects in India and Indonesia and the other -- and China.
Carbon capture is going to require a lot of capital, and that will be very, very prevalent in -- I foresee, in Europe and in the United States, specifically. And then obviously, green hydrogen and blue hydrogen, it will be all over the world. So I would have a balance with them. But since these are all mega projects, for 1 year or 2, one of them might be higher than the other one. But in the course of 5 to 10 years, if you take all of the capital allocation, I think that most of the capital will go to carbon capture, then hydrogen and then gasification."

Number one, the margin comes down when Lu'An is shut down because Lu'An is a very, very high-margin business. So that Lu'An, by itself, has a significant effect when it is down.
The second thing is that when natural gas prices go up, we end up showing more sales because we are buying natural gas and then the customer reimburses us for that. But it shows us higher sales, but it doesn't affect the profit line. So if natural gas, every dollar of natural gas going up, affects our sales by $350 million in a year. So if natural gas prices continue to go up, then our margins for our hydrogen business looks lower because the profit doesn't change, but the sales go up. So those are the 2 effects that you need to think about.
So as we go forward, if natural gas prices come back to the levels they were, and if Lu'An starts up, then you're going to see our margins go up. So I still feel very good about our margins. We haven't seen a fundamental change in the profitability of our business."

And also thank you for providing the answer because you kind of answered the question by saying that we are in a unique position. We are operating the largest carbon capture facility in the world right now. Operational. We have been running it for several years. We capture 1 million ton a year of CO2 from the SMRs that we have in Port Arthur. So we know how to do this thing. 
Secondly is that we have many, many SMRs that put out CO2. Therefore, the CO2 is there that can be captured. The other thing is the fact that there is significant focus on this because by capturing CO2, you can make blue hydrogen. And therefore, the transition to the hydrogen economy can happen very quickly using hydrocarbons. And a lot of people are very interested in that. People who make hydrocarbons are very interested in finding a way to produce hydrogen, capture the carbon and say here is the hydrogen, which is almost -- is not as good as green hydrogen, but it is hydrogen with significantly reduced carbon footprint. So that is why I am -- I think that there will be a lot of big investments in that area, and we are very well positioned with our core competency, with the plants that we have around the world to be a major player on that, and we intend to be a major player on that.
Our goal is very simple. Gasification, we have put ourselves in a position that we are the major -- the leading company for gasification. Any gasification project in the project -- in the world, probably Air Products will do that. We plan to be the leader in blue hydrogen, which means CO2 capture, and we plan to be the leader in green hydrogen, which we already are with the plant that we are building in NEOM."

And I just wanted to get your view on whether that opportunity is potentially more attractive in the U.S. because the cities can start with gray hydrogen that's relatively less expensive than if it were sourced from natural gas in Europe at 3x the price? Is it the attraction starting gray? Or do you see, longer term, the fuel cell buses in regions like Europe is potentially larger in that green hydrogen could be more comparably cost and priced relative to gray?"

The issue is that, in terms of the economics, you would expect that U.S. will be ahead of Europe because of the cheap natural gas that you can convert and all of that, you can capture the carbon and have blue hydrogen and all of that. But then there is the fundamental element of the government interest. And what we are finding out is that the governments in Europe are a lot more committed to green hydrogen. They are really committed to green hydrogen, not blue. They want green. 
And as a result, I think our hydrogen business, our green hydrogen business, the biggest potential will be in Europe rather than in the U.S. or any other part of the world. That's the way it is developing right now. But things can change. Government policies can change. If in the United States, all of the states or at least the majority of the states adopt the LCFS plan that California has put in place, then you are going to see a boom in terms of hydrogen in the U.S., but I don't know whether that happens or if that happens.
But in Europe, we see that. And then in Japan, they are going with the idea of taking blue ammonia and putting it in their power plants to reduce their carbon footprint. So the different parts of the world are doing different things. But what you are delineating is a very logical economic thing, but on top of that, you have to put the layer of where the government pressure is. And I think for a project like NEOM, the biggest potential market will probably be Europe."

It would appear that -- you responded to the earlier question discussing blue hydrogen, but it would appear there's quite an opportunity for stacking some of these carbon capture credits for renewable diesel.

Why aren't we seeing that occur right now? You mentioned there's a lot of talk about projects, but maybe things aren't happening. I'm curious what bottlenecks might exist? And if that involves perhaps some takeaway capacity for CO2 that maybe needs to be built by someone else before those can move forward?"

You are saying how come these renewable diesel projects are not happening faster? I think the main reason is that right now, the only place that it makes sense to sell renewable diesel and still be profitable is in California. 
So people -- I mean, Valero, when they are producing this thing in Texas, they don't sell it in Texas, they sell it in California because if they sell it in Texas, they lose money because just the cost of the raw material for making renewable diesel is probably $2.50, $3 a gallon. 
So -- and so right now, everybody is making things to go to California and sell it in California. And therefore, people are sitting down and saying, ""How many -- how much capacity does California have?"" Because if you add all of these renewable diesels in 4 or 5 years, 100% of the diesel sold in California will be renewable. Then what do you do? 
So people need to get themselves comfortable that this policy that California has will be picked up by Oregon and Colorado and New York and all of that, which I think it will be. But until it is done, I think you're not going to see a significant growth on this thing because people are going to say, well, how am I going to -- where am I going to sell it?"

Scott is retired from Air Products on September 30 as part of this smooth transition. Today, I want to recognize and thank Scott, who has had a distinguished 31-year career with Air Products. Scott started in our career development program and ultimately progressed to the highest role in finance, serving as our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Clearly, that achievement is a testament to Scott, particularly his strong work ethic, his drive to deliver and his focus on creating shareholder value. Scott, I would like to say publicly what I have told you privately that it has been a privilege working with you for these past 7 years, particularly as we have executed our growth strategy and [indiscernible] world-class projects in gasification, carbon capture and hydrogen. These projects continue to differentiate the company and position Air Products for significant growth into the future. Particularly, I want to thank you for leading our effort to position us for the successful closing of the Jazan gasification and power project and for your efforts related to the project financing of this significant investment. I appreciate all you have done to help us move forward, and I wish you great health and happiness in the future. Thank you again for all you have done for Air Products.

And now let's turn to our business results. 
The stability of our business and the dedication of our people have been on full display as the talented and committed people of Air Products delivered good results again this quarter. Our people working together have kept our 750 facilities around the world operating and our customers supplied through the COVID-19 pandemic. In support of the hard work and dedication demonstrated by our employees, we have not reduced our staff or cut salaries during this difficult period. I am proud to say that Air Products is emerging from this crisis an even a stronger company than before. 
We have continued to acquire new assets and businesses, successfully raised prices and brought new plants onstream. We have also strengthened our organization by adding resources in various functions, mostly in engineering and project development, to help us successfully pursue and execute the many exciting future projects we had in front of us. 
At the same time, we also delivered earnings per share of $2.31 this quarter, which is 15% higher than last year, despite absorbing costs related to our growth-driven development efforts. I am extremely proud of the accomplishments that we have achieved as a team, and I would like to thank all of our employees at Air Products for their dedication and hard work. We continue to execute projects and deliver strong financial results while maintaining our unwavering focus on safety. 
As Slide #4 shows, despite the challenging COVID-19 conditions, our team continues to focus on working safely, following our strict protocols to help protect themselves, our customers and our communities. As always, safety is the most important focus for all of us at Air Products, and our goal will always be 0 accidents and 0 incidents. 
Slides #5, 6 and 7 include our goal, our management philosophy and our 5-point strategic plan. These are the -- you have seen this before, and these are the principles that we will follow every day, and they will continue to guide us in the future. 
Now please turn to Slide #8. We believe the environmental sustainability challenges facing the world are significant. The scope and complexity of the mega projects necessary to address these challenges requires talented people with a variety of skills and backgrounds from different parts of the world to work together as 1 team. As I mentioned earlier, we can solve these problems no matter how challenging as long as the older stay focused and united working toward a common goal on a global basis. We believe this is the calling of our company and the higher purpose for all of us at Air Products. 
Now please turn to Slide #9. We recently published an annual sustainability report, which highlights our sustainability-driven growth opportunities and our many accomplishments in this area. For instance, our products help our customers avoid 72 million tons of CO2-equivalent emissions, which means that for every ton of CO2 that we emit in making our products, we help our customers avoid 3 tons of CO2 emissions. In addition, more than half of our offerings are sustainable. And close to 1/4 of our electricity purchases are from renewable sources. 
We have also set new sustainability goals, which are very much aligned with our growth strategy. Our Third by '30 goal aims to reduce our carbon intensity by [ 1/3 ] by 2030. Our growth opportunities will enable progress towards this goal. And therefore, we expect to see significant progress later in the decade as our major projects come onstream and start to positively benefit our results. At Air Products, sustainability is our growth strategy in sustainability and our growth go hand in hand. As we strive to solve the world's environmental sustainability problems, we are also creating growth opportunities for the company. A prime example of such an opportunity is our innovative world-class net-zero hydrogen project in Edmonton, Alberta, as we announced last June and I will talk about a little bit more later on. 
Now please turn to Slide #10, which highlights our key gasification projects. We are committed to our gasification and strategy and are pursuing exciting projects around the world. We do expect to announce additional gasification projects in the future. 
Now specifically, I would like to give you an update on the 2 large gasification projects, which I have discussed on previous earnings calls. First, our $12 billion acquisition of Jazan gasifier and power plant from Saudi Aramco. We continue to make significant progress working with our partners and the lenders. The team has worked hard to bring the project to the final stages of project financing, and we still expect this project to reach financial close by the end of our fiscal year, that is September 30, 2021. 
Second, regarding Lu'An, the plant is operating at full capacity. As I mentioned last quarter, we expect to recognize reduced fees through fiscal year '22 before we return to the full [ fee ] in 2023. 
Now I would like to provide an overview of 2 new and very exciting developments before I discuss the major announcement we are making today, which is our capital deployment plans for the next 6 years. 
First, on Slide 11, you can see the overview of the Alberta project that we announced last month. This innovative project includes gasification, carbon capture and hydrogen, the 3 pillars of our growth strategy coming together in 1 project to support the energy transition. This project is fully aligned with Canada's green energy diversification strategy and enables Canada to advance its competitive low-carbon economy. It uses locally available hydrates to make net-zero hydrogen. 
As summarized on Slide 12, the hydrogen will be produced using auto-thermal reforming technology enabling 95% of the CO2 produced by the project to be captured and stored. To achieve net zero, the remaining 5% carbon footprint will be offset by exporting the electricity generated by this net-zero hydrogen. The output will be supply -- the output, the net-zero hydrogen will be supplied to our customers on our existing pipeline in Alberta as well as use to produce liquid hydrogen for the mobility and merchant markets. The project represents a CAD 1.3 billion investment and is expected to come in stream in 2024. 
We also -- as you can see on Slide #13, we continue to focus on the very exciting hydrogen for mobility market, and we are pleased to announce a project with Cummins to accelerate the integration of hydrogen fuel cell trucks globally. Cummins will provide hydrogen fuel cell electric powertrain and integrated into heavy-duty trucks for Air Products, as we begin the process of converting our global fleet of 2,000 distribution vehicles to hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. We expect the first unit to be online in 2022 and the full conversion before 2030. 
Now let me give you the highlights of our significant announcement today. 3.5 years ago, in 2018, we announced publicly that Air Products growth strategy, guided by the global energy transition and based on the 3 pillars of gasification, carbon capture and hydrogen, had the potential to create significant growth for our company, and that we could foresee deploying or committing $15 billion of capital in the 5-year period from 2018 to end of 2022. At that time, I remember clearly that our announcement was to see within a degree of skepticism. 
Well, today, I'm happy to show you, as you can see on Slide #14, that we have developed -- we have deployed or committed almost $18 billion of capital, 1.5 years ahead of our plan. And I want to state that on the aggregate, the return on this capital is in line with the guidance we have given our investors before. This validates our long-term strategy. But now that we are ahead of the plan, the question raised by our investors was, ""What about the future?"" I had promised the investors that we would address this question sometime during the summer of 2021. So here we are today, summer of 2021 announcing, as you can see on Slide 15, that based on what we see ahead, implementing our focused strategy and based on a conservative estimate of our financial capacity, Air Products expects to deploy or commit more than $30 billion of capital for the 10-year period from 2018 to the end of 2027. Later in this call, Scott will go through the details. But today, I wanted to make the point that as before, we are pursuing a growth strategy. We do have the right strategy to move forward. We are aided by the mega trends of energy transition. We have the people and the core competencies, and we have the financial strength to make our dream a reality and deliver on what we promised our investors. 
Now at least turn to Slide 16, which shows our EPS growth. As you can see, we have delivered greater-than-10% annual EPS growth since 2014, when I was appointed Chairman, President and CEO of the company. These results are the testament to the hard work and commitment of the people of Air Products. And I want to thank them again for their continued hard work and commitment. 
Now please turn to Slide #17, as a reminder that we share our earnings growth with our investors. Both our EPS and dividends have grown double digits since 2014. We are committed to delivering increased dividend while we continue to develop our exciting growth opportunities. We have significant cash flow that supports our substantial dividend and our growth strategy. 
And finally, Slide #18 shows our EBITDA margins, as always, my favorite slide, where it shows that the margins is up 1,200 basis points since 2014. 
Now I'm happy to turn the call over to Scott to provide a financial overview. Scott?"

As Seifi mentioned earlier, the stability of our business and the dedication of our people have been on full display. We continue to execute projects and deliver strong financial results despite the unprecedented challenges posed by the pandemic. If we compare our volumes this quarter to Q3 of fiscal year 2019, or in other words, before the pandemic, our volumes are up 8%. Our trailing 4-quarter distributable cash flow has held steady at approximately $2.6 billion for the past 2 years. Now Air Products is emerging from this pandemic an even stronger company. Our sales, EBITDA and EPS grew double digits this quarter. All 3 regions reported higher sales and EBITDA. And our price and volume continued to be strong despite lower earnings from Lu'An and the ongoing COVID impact. 
Now please turn to Slide 19 for a brief discussion of our third quarter results. Sales increased 26% compared to prior year, reaching $2.6 billion driven by very strong volume, better pricing, higher energy pass-through and favorable currencies. Volume improved 12% as COVID recovery, new plants and acquisitions more than offset reduced Lu'An contributions. Although the pandemic has eased, the volume recovery has not been consistent across our product lines. We continue to experience the negative impact of COVID-19, although the impact this quarter was more modest than last year. Prices were again up, with improvement in all 3 regions. This is the 16th consecutive quarter of year-over-year price gains. Overall, prices were up 2% in total, which represents a 4% increase for the Merchant business. 
EBITDA climbed 11%, approaching a $1 billion mark, as favorable volume price, currencies and equity affiliate income more than offset higher costs, which were impacted by inflation and higher maintenance. EBITDA margin declined 520 basis points, primarily due to higher costs and higher energy pass-through, which increases sales but not profit. Higher energy pass-through negatively impacted margin by about 200 basis points. Higher costs included higher maintenance spending compared to last year, due mainly to low spending in the prior year, resulting from less access to sites due to COVID-19. 
ROCE was 240 basis points lower. The increase in the denominator from the additional $5 billion of debt reduced ROCE by about 300 basis points. Sequentially, sales were up 4%, supported by 5% seasonally stronger volume and 1% higher price. Energy pass-through was lower by 2% as energy prices returned to a more normal range following the effects of the winter storm in the previous quarter. 
Now please turn to Slide 20. Our third quarter GAAP EPS was $2.36 and included a $0.05 tax benefit, primarily resulting from reserve adjustments related to a 2017 tax election on a non-U.S. subsidiary. Excluding the non-GAAP item, our third quarter adjusted EPS was $2.31 despite the ongoing impacts of the pandemic and was $0.30 above last year. Volume was favorable $0.26. COVID recovery, new plants and acquisitions more than offset reduced the Lu'An contributions. 
As a reminder, it's important to recognize that as the 60% majority owner of the Lu'An joint venture, 100% of the negative impact from Lu'An is included in the volume line because we consolidate the operating results. However, this is partially offset by the positive impact reflected in the noncontrolling interest line as the net income shared by our partner is also reduced. 
Price, net of variable costs, contributed $0.05 as our price increases more than covered variable cost inflation. We continue to execute pricing actions in response to rising variable costs, such as power and fuel. Like the prior few quarters, our plans to add resources and strengthen our organization to support growth have increased our costs. Americas' maintenance costs were lower last year due to COVID-19 limitations, and there were temporary COVID-related government incentives in Asia last year. Currency and foreign exchange contributed $0.12, with the Chinese RMB and euro accounting for roughly half of the impact. Equity affiliate income added $0.04 on strong underlying business results, while noncontrolling interest was also favorable $0.05 on lower profits from our consolidated joint ventures, primarily Lu'An. The effective tax rate of 18.2% was 110 basis points lower than last year due to a change in U.K. tax law. We expect our effective tax rate to be slightly below 20% in fiscal year '21. The remaining $0.04 includes a favorable $0.05 in nonoperating income, primarily driven by lower pension expense and an unfavorable interest expense of $0.01. 
Now please turn to Slide 21. The stability of our business allows us to continue to generate strong cash flow. Over the last 12 months, we generated about $2.6 billion of distributable cash flow or almost $12 per share. From our EBITDA of about $3.8 billion, we paid interest, taxes and maintenance capital. Note that our maintenance CapEx is a little higher than usual, driven in part by spending on our new global headquarters. From a distributable cash flow, we paid over 45% or over $1.2 billion as dividends to our shareholders, and we still have about $1.4 billion available for high-return industrial gas investments. This strong cash flow, even in uncertain times, enables us to continue to create shareholder value through increasing dividends and capital deployment. 
Slide #22 provides an update on our capital deployment. As Seifi mentioned, we have extended our time horizon another 5 years to 2027. Since we see tremendous project opportunities beyond the original capacity of $15 billion, we think it's appropriate to extend the time frame for at least another 5 years. This updated view of our capital deployment potential shows over $30 billion available through fiscal 2027. The $30 billion includes over $9 billion of cash and additional debt capacity available today, almost $15 billion we expect to be available by 2027 and almost $7 billion already spent. We believe this figure is conservative given the potential for additional EBITDA growth, which generates additional cash flow and therefore, additional borrowing capacity. We will continue to focus on managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted [ A/A2 ] rating. So you can see we've already spent 22% and have already committed 57% of the updated capacity we show here. In short, we exceeded the commitment we made to you in 2018 and has substantial capacity available to deploy to support our growth strategy. 
Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call back over to Seifi."

Sales increased 15% compared to last year, supported by strong volume, better price and favorable currencies. Volumes were up 6%, reversing the negative trend of the previous 4 quarters. Base volumes, driven by COVID recovery and the addition of numerous small new plants, more than offset the reduced Lu'An contribution. Asia pricing overall was positive 1%, primarily divided -- driven by good performance in China across most product lines. This was the 17th consecutive quarter of year-on-year price improvement in Asia. Sequentially, price was also positive by 1%. 
EBITDA increased 9%, driven primarily by favorable price, volume, currencies and equity affiliate income. Costs compared unfavorably, partly due to inflation and COVID-related incentives last year -- I should say, COVID-related government incentives and costs last year. EBITDA margin of 47.4% was 270 basis points lower as reduced Lu'An contribution and increased costs more than offset the benefits of higher price, volume and equity affiliate income. Operating income and margin compared unfavorably to EBITDA and EBITDA margin due to higher quality affiliate income and additional depreciation from new plants. Sequentially, sales and profit improved as economic activities rebounded following the Lunar New Year holidays.

Volume, price, energy pass-through and currency were all positive. Volume grew 9%, primarily due to COVID recovery, higher medical gases in South America and onetime items. Most merchant products have returned to their pre-COVID levels, but hydrogen volume has not yet fully caught up. While the demand for transportation fuels has improved as people resume travel, the increases are not even across different types of fuel. Gasoline and diesel volumes have rebounded. However, the demand for jet fuel, which consumes more hydrogen on a per unit basis compared to gasoline, still lags. Furthermore, the industry has shifted to use more light sweet crude, which requires less hydrogen. 
In addition, the industry's inventory level remained high. Price was again strong. The 4% increase for the region was equivalent to 8% on the Merchant business. Price was better across all major product lines, and this is the 12th consecutive quarter of year-on-year price improvement. Energy cost pass-through is again higher as natural gas prices remained elevated versus last year and drove a 10% sales increase. 
EBITDA reached $465 million, a 13% increase over last year, as better volume and price as well as onetime items more than offset power and other cost inflation and higher maintenance. Our maintenance costs were unfavorable versus last year because limited maintenance work was possible last year due to the restrictions imposed by protocols. Following the successful completion of the turnaround this quarter, we expect our maintenance activities to moderate next quarter. Higher energy cost pass-through negatively impacted EBITDA margin by over 400 basis points or almost 90% of the reported decline. Compared to last quarter, Americas volumes increased 6% driven by stronger hydrogen volume, partly helped by recovery following the winter storm and onetime items. Price also improved 1%, up across all major product lines. Energy pass-through was lower sequentially as the natural gas price came back down after the spike caused by the winter storm. EBITDA increased 4% sequentially, supported by improved volume and price as well as onetime items, while cost was unfavorable. EBITDA margin was 120 basis points better, primarily driven by about 350 basis points of favorable energy pass-through, while strong price partially offset higher costs.

COVID recovery and acquisitions primarily drove the 24% volume increase. our liquid bulk business has returned to its pre-COVID level, but the packaged gas business still lagged. Price increased for the 14th consecutive quarter and was higher across most major product lines in all the subregions. The 1% price gain for the region corresponds to a 2% improvement for the Merchant business. Real price increases were partially offset by unfavorable mix since the demand across the product lines was not even. We are also executing additional pricing actions to recover the recent power cost increases. 
Currencies were a favorable 12%, primarily due to the strong euro and British pound versus the U.S. dollar. EBITDA was up 25% to over $210 million, driven primarily by the strong volume. EBITDA margin was down 540 basis points, with higher energy pass-through responsible for about 200 basis points. The remaining roughly 300 basis point reduction was mainly attributable to unfavorable costs, mostly power and other cost inflation. Compared to prior quarter, sales rose 7%, primarily supported by positive 5% volume, but EBITDA was down 2% and margin was about 300 basis points lower as this volume gain was more than offset by higher costs, including power and other cost inflation and lower equity affiliate income. 
Now please turn to Slide 26, Global Gases, which includes our non-LNG sale of equipment businesses as well as central costs.

As I mentioned earlier, Lu'An facility is operating at full capacity, and we expect the Jazan transaction to achieve financial close by the end of September 2021. For quarter 4 of fiscal year 2021, our earnings per share guidance is $2.44 to $2.54, up 11% to 16% over last year. This makes our guidance for our fiscal year to be $8.95 to $9.05, up approximately 8% over last year and within the range we shared with you last quarter.

And in terms of the focus, we are going to stay very focused, Vincent, and spend our money on gasification; hydrogen, which is blue and green; and CO2 capture. We are going to try not to venture too much outside of those 3 specific areas. And there is significant opportunity. 
Now that you asked the question, it gives me -- we came up with the $30 billion not because of lack of projects. It is because of we wanted to demonstrate what is our financial capacity to maintain our A rating. As we go forward, obviously, we will get it. We cannot project your EBITDA for 2030. So that's why we are constrained. There are a lot of projects in the areas of gasification, hydrogen and CO2, as you will see in the future, and we are going to stay focused on that because I believe by being focused, you get results rather than being all over the place."

The Asian EBITDA is a little bit better. The European EBITDA is not. Why is that the case, given that the global economy has been improving? And secondly, in your reconciliation tables, in your return on capital, your return on capital has gone from 12.4% a year ago to 10%. It's kind of moved down sequentially. Why is that?

Two very good questions. Number one, when you look at it the way you say that it is flat, the global economy is improving, please take note that the global economy is improving and people going to restaurants and flying around. In the major economies that we are operating, the industrial economy has not improved that much. That's number one. 
The second thing, our results are significantly affected by Lu'An. You know that very well because Lu'An had an EBITDA contribution every year at full capacity under normal circumstances of almost $150 million, $160 million a year. When you -- when that number comes down, then it distorts all of the numbers. But please look at our volumes. 
And another thing is that our results are affected by another significant item, which I have mentioned many times before. We are investing in [ increased ] organization significantly to develop these new projects. When [indiscernible] project like Canada, we have been working on 4 other projects. Each 1 of these projects costs 4 or 5, $10 [ billion ], $10 million to develop. We are spending that money because we are investing for the future. So that is taking, also hitting our results. 
But look at our volumes you look at our volumes, our volumes are better than all of our competitors during that period. We have grown our base volumes. If you take all of the mumbo-jumbo out of people's results and our result, our volume growth has improved later than anybody else. It's 12%. So therefore, I don't [indiscernible] keep it the [indiscernible] That's number one. 
The second thing with respect to the return on capital employed, it depends number on how you calculate it. Because if we can calculate our return on capital employed the way other people calculated that they don't consider the cash, we are at 15%, not at 10%. The second thing is that our return on capital employed has gone down, because we borrowed $5 billion that is still sitting on our balance sheet and we haven't deployed that. Once we deploy that, once we pay for the Jazan $2.5 billion [indiscernible], that return on capital employed jump up."

You Second thing is that, John, we are talking about deploying $30 billion of capital. That means those projects need to get engineered and built before they contribute to the bottom line. We have added, without exaggeration, close to 2,000 people to our engineering and project management and business development staff in the last 2 years, 2,000 people. If you take $100,000, $120,000 per person, that becomes a lot of money. We have absorbed a lot of cost because of pricing and all of that, but it's still we are spending a significant amount of dollars in order to position ourselves that not only we develop these projects but that they also execute them and build them. But then when we do that, I mean, people know how to do the math better than anybody else. If we deploy the $30 billion by 2027, which we say we will, and we say that the return on that thing is expect $0.10 operating profit for every dollar, that is $3 billion of operating profit in addition to what we are doing. You do that after tax, and then you come up with a significant number with respect to more than $10, $11, $15 per share. So in order -- we need to make that a reality, that is not going to happen by itself. And therefore, we are going to be absorbing a lot of additional costs in the meantime. 
Now a year from now, 2 years from now, depending on how many projects we have, now if the next year, we come and say that, ""Look, we spend [ 30 ], now we have to increase it to 40, then we will have to add more people."" So there is a sequence to this thing. We need to spend the money to develop the project, to get the projects. And as you know, the new rules is such that you cannot put the projects on the balance sheet and then you win them and those that you win, you have to eat the cost. That's the accounting rules. So that is where I think the investors need to have a little bit of patience with us because these costs are going to be with us. And quite honestly, it is amazing that the effect is not as much as it could be because as I said, 2,000 people, it's costing us $240 million, $250 million a year to support those people.

The other cost increases, obviously, as I mentioned before, is adding additional resources. But our philosophy is that if power costs go up, prices need to go up. And as compared to other chemical companies, we have -- another benefit is that our raw material price doesn't go up because our raw material is really air for most of our products. And if it is natural gas, we do pass it through. So overall, as I've said many times before, with my 42-year experience in industrial gases, inflationary times are, in general, are positive for industrial gases because it gives you the license to increase prices. And if the -- I mean, in our call, we mentioned price increases on an overall basis. But if you take just our merchant price increases, we have had price increases this last quarter of 7% in Americas; 3% in Europe; 3% in Asia; total company, 5% price increase.

We expect that hydrogen net worth to be really sold out in about 2 years' time because the fundamental drivers for growth are there, the refineries will come back, and there is a significant trend. Mike, you know that very well towards converting the refineries into making renewable diesel. And as we have said, the intensity of hydrogen for renewable diesel is higher than other things. So we remain very optimistic about that. It's just quarter-by-quarter, the numbers move. But for the longer term, we are very optimistic about that hydrogen pipeline and that whole infrastructure there."

I mean, in some parts of Europe, energy cost last quarter was almost 100% more than the last year. So I think that power cost increases in Europe are going to be a thing of the future. And in order -- and that's why a lot of these things that people talk about making green hydrogen, using the grid in Europe is kind of a little bit of a pie in the sky. But overall, I think that our job is to increase our prices to compensate for the power cost. And our contracts are structured that way. Sometimes, we might get a little bit of a lag in implementing that, but our people know exactly what they need to do and in turn, we will catch up. 
But I don't think power prices in Europe are going to ease."

Following this call, Ms. Melissa Schaeffer will succeed Mr. Scott Crocco as our Chief Financial Officer and assume leadership responsibility for our worldwide finance organization. Scott is retired from Air Products on September 30 as part of this smooth transition.
Today, I want to recognize and thank Scott, who has had a distinguished 31-year career with Air Products. Scott started in our career development program and ultimately progressed to the highest role in finance, serving as our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Clearly, that achievement is a testament to Scott, particularly his strong work ethic, his drive to deliver and his focus on creating shareholder value.
Scott, I would like to say publicly what I have told you privately, that it has been a privilege working with you for these past 7 years, particularly as we have executed our growth strategy and grown world-class projects in gasification, carbon capture and hydrogen. These projects continue to differentiate the company and position Air Products for significant growth into the future. Particularly, I want to thank you for leading our effort to position us for the successful closing of the Jazan gasification and power project and for your efforts related to the project financing of this significant investment. I appreciate all you have done to help us move forward, and I wish you great health and happiness in the future. Thank you again for all you have done for Air Products.

Melissa held financial roles of increasing responsibility with Siemens, Ernst & Young and Trinseo before coming to Air Products. She joined us as Vice President and Chief Audit Executive in 2016.

And now let's turn to our business results.
The stability of our business and the dedication of our people have been on full display as the talented and committed people of Air Products delivered good results again this quarter. Our people working together have kept our 750 facilities around the world operating and our customers supplied through the COVID-19 pandemic. In support of the hard work and dedication demonstrated by our employees, we have not reduced our staff or cut salaries during this difficult period. I am proud to say that Air Products is emerging from this crisis an even a stronger company than before.
We have continued to acquire new assets and businesses, successfully raised prices and brought new plants onstream. We have also strengthened our organization by adding resources in various functions, mostly in engineering and project development, to help us successfully pursue and execute the many exciting future projects we had in front of us.
At the same time, we also delivered earnings per share of $2.31 this quarter, which is 15% higher than last year despite absorbing costs related to our growth-driven development efforts. I am extremely proud of the accomplishments that we have achieved as a team, and I would like to thank all of our employees at Air Products for their dedication and hard work. We continue to execute projects and deliver strong financial results while maintaining our unwavering focus on safety.
As Slide #4 shows, despite the challenging COVID-19 conditions, our team continues to focus on working safely, following our strict protocols to help protect themselves, our customers and our communities. As always, safety is the most important focus for all of us at Air Products, and our goal will always be 0 accidents and 0 incidents.
Slides #5, 6 and 7 include our goal, our management philosophy and our 5-point strategic plan. These are the -- you have seen this before, and these are the principles that we will follow every day, and they will continue to guide us in the future.
Now please turn to Slide #8. We believe the environmental sustainability challenges facing the world are significant. The scope and complexity of the megaprojects necessary to address these challenges requires talented people with a variety of skills and backgrounds from different parts of the world to work together as one team. As I mentioned earlier, we can solve these problems no matter how challenging as long as the we always stay focused and united working toward a common goal on a global basis. We believe this is the calling of our company and the higher purpose for all of us at Air Products.
Now please turn to Slide #9. We recently published an annual sustainability report, which highlights our sustainability-driven growth opportunities and our many accomplishments in this area. For instance, our products help our customers avoid 72 million tons of CO2-equivalent emissions, which means that for every ton of CO2 that we emit in making our products, we help our customers avoid 3 tons of CO2 emissions. In addition, more than half of our offerings are sustainable, and close to 1/4 of our electricity purchases are from renewable sources.
We have also set new sustainability goals which are very much aligned with our growth strategy. Our Third by '30 goal aims to reduce our carbon intensity by 1/3 by 2030. Our growth opportunities will enable progress towards this goal. And therefore, we expect to see significant progress later in the decade as our major projects come onstream and start to positively benefit our results.
At Air Products, sustainability is our growth strategy. And sustainability and our growth go hand in hand. As we strive to solve the world's environmental sustainability problems, we are also creating growth opportunities for the company. A prime example of such an opportunity is our innovative world-class net-zero hydrogen project in Edmonton, Alberta, as we announced last June and I will talk about a little bit more later on.
Now please turn to Slide #10, which highlights our key gasification projects. We are committed to our gasification strategy and are pursuing exciting projects around the world. We do expect to announce additional gasification projects in the future.
Now specifically, I would like to give you an update on the 2 large gasification projects which I have discussed on previous earnings calls. First, our $12 billion acquisition of Jazan gasifier and power plant from Saudi Aramco. We continue to make significant progress working with our partners and the lenders. The team has worked hard to bring the project to the final stages of project financing, and we still expect this project to reach financial close by the end of our fiscal year, that is September 30, 2021.
Second, regarding Lu'An, the plant is operating at full capacity. As I mentioned last quarter, we expect to recognize reduced fees through fiscal year '22 before we return to the full fee in 2023.
Now I would like to provide an overview of 2 new and very exciting developments before I discuss the major announcement we are making today, which is our capital deployment plans for the next 6 years.
First, on Slide 11, you can see the overview of the Alberta project that we announced last month. This innovative project includes gasification, carbon capture and hydrogen, the 3 pillars of our growth strategy coming together in one project to support the energy transition. This project is fully aligned with Canada's green energy diversification strategy and enables Canada to advance its competitive low-carbon economy. It uses locally available hydrocarbons to make net-zero hydrogen.
As summarized on Slide 12, the hydrogen will be produced using auto-thermal reforming technology, enabling 95% of the CO2 produced by the project to be captured and stored. To achieve net zero, the remaining 5% carbon footprint will be offset by exporting the electricity generated by this net-zero hydrogen. The output will be -- the output, the net-zero hydrogen, will be supplied to our customers on our existing pipeline in Alberta as well as used to produce liquid hydrogen for the mobility and merchant markets. The project represents a CAD 1.3 billion investment and is expected to come onstream in 2024.
We also -- as you can see on Slide #13, we continue to focus on the very exciting hydrogen for mobility market, and we are pleased to announce a project with Cummins to accelerate the integration of hydrogen fuel cell trucks globally. Cummins will provide hydrogen fuel cell electric powertrain, integrated into heavy-duty trucks for Air Products as we begin the process of converting our global fleet of 2,000 distribution vehicles to hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. We expect the first unit to be online in 2022 and the full conversion before 2030.
Now let me give you the highlights of our significant announcement today. 3.5 years ago, in 2018, we announced publicly that Air Products' growth strategy, guided by the global energy transition and based on the 3 pillars of gasification, carbon capture and hydrogen, had the potential to create significant growth for our company and that we could foresee deploying or committing $15 billion of capital in the 5-year period from 2018 to end of 2022. At that time, I remember clearly that our announcement was received within a degree of skepticism.
Well, today, I'm happy to show you, as you can see on Slide #14, that we have developed -- we have deployed or committed almost $18 billion of capital 1.5 years ahead of our plan. And I want to state that on the aggregate, the return on this capital is in line with the guidance we have given our investors before.
This validates our long-term strategy. But now that we are ahead of the plan, the question raised by our investors was, ""What about the future?"" I had promised the investors that we would address this question sometime during the summer of 2021. So here we are today, summer of 2021, announcing, as you can see on Slide 15, that based on what we see ahead, implementing our focused strategy and based on a conservative estimate of our financial capacity, Air Products expects to deploy or commit more than $30 billion of capital for the 10-year period from 2018 to the end of 2027.
Later in this call, Scott will go through the details, but today, I wanted to make the point that as before, we are pursuing a growth strategy. We do have the right strategy to move forward. We are aided by the megatrends of energy transition. We have the people and the core competencies, and we have the financial strength to make our dream a reality and deliver on what we promised our investors.
Now at least turn to Slide 16, which shows our EPS growth. As you can see, we have delivered greater than 10% annual EPS growth since 2014 when I was appointed Chairman, President and CEO of the company. These results are the testament to the hard work and commitment of the people of Air Products. And I want to thank them again for their continued hard work and commitment.
Now please turn to Slide #17, a reminder that we share our earnings growth with our investors. Both our EPS and dividend have grown double digits since 2014. We are committed to delivering increased dividend while we continue to develop our exciting growth opportunities. We have significant cash flow that supports our substantial dividend and our growth strategy.
And finally, Slide #18 shows our EBITDA margins, as always, my favorite slide, where it shows that the margins is up 1,200 basis points since 2014.
Now I'm happy to turn the call over to Scott to provide a financial overview. Scott?"

As Seifi mentioned earlier, the stability of our business and the dedication of our people have been on full display. We continue to execute projects and deliver strong financial results despite the unprecedented challenges posed by the",1062,"Thank you, Seifi. As Seifi mentioned earlier, the stability of our business and the dedication of our people have been on full display. We continue to execute projects and deliver strong financial results despite the unprecedented challenges posed by the pandemic. If we compare our volumes this quarter to Q3 of fiscal year 2019, or in other words, before the pandemic, our volumes are up 8%. Our trailing 4-quarter distributable cash flow has held steady at approximately $2.6 billion for the past 2 years. Now Air Products is emerging from this pandemic an even stronger company. Our sales, EBITDA and EPS grew double digits this quarter. All 3 regions reported higher sales and EBITDA. And our price and volume continued to be strong despite lower earnings from Lu'An and the ongoing COVID impact.
Now please turn to Slide 19 for a brief discussion of our third quarter results. Sales increased 26% compared to prior year, reaching $2.6 billion driven by very strong volume, better pricing, higher energy pass-through and favorable currencies. Volume improved 12% as COVID recovery, new plants and acquisitions more than offset reduced Lu'An contributions. Although the pandemic has eased, the volume recovery has not been consistent across our product lines. We continue to experience the negative impact of COVID-19, although the impact this quarter was more modest than last year. Prices were again up, with improvement in all 3 regions. This is the 16th consecutive quarter of year-over-year price gains. Overall, prices were up 2% in total, which represents a 4% increase for the merchant business.
EBITDA climbed 11%, approaching a $1 billion mark as favorable volume, price, currencies and equity affiliate income more than offset higher costs, which were impacted by inflation and higher maintenance. EBITDA margin declined 520 basis points primarily due to higher costs and higher energy pass-through, which increases sales but not profit. Higher energy pass-through negatively impacted margin by about 200 basis points. Higher costs included higher maintenance spending compared to last year due mainly to low spending in the prior year, resulting from less access to sites due to COVID-19.
ROCE was 240 basis points lower. The increase in the denominator from the additional $5 billion of debt reduced ROCE by about 300 basis points. Sequentially, sales were up 4%, supported by 5% seasonally stronger volume and 1% higher price. Energy pass-through was lower by 2% as energy prices returned to a more normal range following the effects of the winter storm in the previous quarter.
Now please turn to Slide 20. Our third quarter GAAP EPS was $2.36 and included a $0.05 tax benefit primarily resulting from reserve adjustments related to a 2017 tax election on a non-U.S. subsidiary. Excluding the non-GAAP item, our third quarter adjusted EPS was $2.31 despite the ongoing impacts of the pandemic and was $0.30 above last year. Volume was favorable $0.26. COVID recovery, new plants and acquisitions more than offset reduced Lu'An contributions.
As a reminder, it's important to recognize that as the 60% majority owner of the Lu'An joint venture, 100% of the negative impact from Lu'An is included in the volume line because we consolidate the operating results. However, this is partially offset by the positive impact reflected in the noncontrolling interest line as the net income shared by our partner is also reduced.
Price, net of variable costs, contributed $0.05 as our price increases more than covered variable cost inflation. We continue to execute pricing actions in response to rising variable costs such as power and fuel. Like the prior few quarters, our plans to add resources and strengthen our organization to support growth have increased our costs. Americas' maintenance costs were lower last year due to COVID-19 limitations, and there were temporary COVID-related government incentives in Asia last year.
Currency and foreign exchange contributed $0.12, with the Chinese RMB and euro accounting for roughly half of the impact. Equity affiliate income added $0.04 on strong underlying business results, while noncontrolling interest was also favorable $0.05 on lower profits from our consolidated joint ventures, primarily Lu'An.
The effective tax rate of 18.2% was 110 basis points lower than last year due to a change in U.K. tax law. We expect our effective tax rate to be slightly below 20% in fiscal year '21. The remaining $0.04 includes a favorable $0.05 in nonoperating income primarily driven by lower pension expense and an unfavorable interest expense of $0.01.
Now please turn to Slide 21. The stability of our business allows us to continue to generate strong cash flow. Over the last 12 months, we generated about $2.6 billion of distributable cash flow or almost $12 per share. From our EBITDA of about $3.8 billion, we paid interest, taxes and maintenance capital. Note that our maintenance CapEx is a little higher than usual driven in part by spending on our new global headquarters.
From a distributable cash flow, we paid over 45% or over $1.2 billion as dividends to our shareholders, and we still have about $1.4 billion available for high-return industrial gas investments. This strong cash flow, even in uncertain times, enables us to continue to create shareholder value through increasing dividends and capital deployment.
Slide #22 provides an update on our capital deployment. As Seifi mentioned, we have extended our time horizon another 5 years to 2027. Since we see tremendous project opportunities beyond the original capacity of $15 billion, we think it's appropriate to extend the time frame for at least another 5 years. This updated view of our capital deployment potential shows over $30 billion available through fiscal 2027. The $30 billion includes over $9 billion of cash and additional debt capacity available today, almost $15 billion we expect to be available by 2027 and almost $7 billion already spent. We believe this figure is conservative given the potential for additional EBITDA growth, which generates additional cash flow and, therefore, additional borrowing capacity. We will continue to focus on managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted A/A2 rating. 
So you can see, we've already spent 22% and have already committed 57% of the updated capacity we show here. In short, we exceeded the commitment we made to you in 2018 and has substantial capacity available to deploy to support our growth strategy.
Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call back over to Seifi."

Sales increased 15% compared to last year, supported by strong volume, better price and favorable currencies. Volumes were up 6%, reversing the negative trend of the previous 4 quarters. Base volumes, driven by COVID recovery and the addition of numerous small new plants, more than offset the reduced Lu'An contribution. Asia pricing overall was positive 1%, primarily driven by good performance in China across most product lines. This was the 17th consecutive quarter of year-on-year price improvement in Asia. Sequentially, price was also positive by 1%.
EBITDA increased 9% driven primarily by favorable price, volume, currencies and equity affiliate income. Costs compared unfavorably, partly due to inflation and COVID-related incentives last year -- I should say, COVID-related government incentives and costs last year.
EBITDA margin of 47.4% was 270 basis points lower as reduced Lu'An contribution and increased costs more than offset the benefits of higher price, volume and equity affiliate income. Operating income and margin compared unfavorably to EBITDA and EBITDA margin due to higher quality affiliate income and additional depreciation from new plants. Sequentially, sales and profit improved as economic activities rebounded following the Lunar New Year holidays.
Now I would like to turn the call back to Scott to talk about the Americas results."

Volume, price, energy pass-through and currency were all positive. Volume grew 9% primarily due to COVID recovery, higher medical gases in South America and onetime items. Most merchant products have returned to their pre-COVID levels, but hydrogen volume has not yet fully caught up. While the demand for transportation fuels has improved as people resume travel, the increases are not even across different types of fuel. Gasoline and diesel volumes have rebounded. However, the demand for jet fuel, which consumes more hydrogen on a per unit basis compared to gasoline, still lags. Furthermore, the industry has shifted to use more light sweet crude, which requires less hydrogen. In addition, the industry's inventory level remained high.
Price was again strong. The 4% increase for the region was equivalent to 8% on the merchant business. Price was better across all major product lines, and this is the 12th consecutive quarter of year-on-year price improvement. Energy cost pass-through is again higher as natural gas prices remained elevated versus last year and drove a 10% sales increase.
EBITDA reached $465 million, a 13% increase over last year as better volume and price as well as onetime items more than offset power and other cost inflation and higher maintenance. Our maintenance costs were unfavorable versus last year because limited maintenance work was possible last year due to the restrictions imposed by COVID protocols. Following the successful completion of the turnaround this quarter, we expect our maintenance activities to moderate next quarter. Higher energy cost pass-through negatively impacted EBITDA margin by over 400 basis points or almost 90% of the reported decline.
Compared to last quarter, Americas' volumes increased 6% driven by stronger hydrogen volume, partly helped by recovery following the winter storm and onetime items. Price also improved 1%, up across all major product lines. Energy pass-through was lower sequentially as the natural gas price came back down after the spike caused by the winter storm. EBITDA increased 4% sequentially, supported by improved volume and price as well as onetime items, while cost was unfavorable. EBITDA margin was 120 basis points better primarily driven by about 350 basis points of favorable energy pass-through, while strong price partially offset higher costs.

Our EMEA team delivered another set of outstanding results this quarter. Sales jumped 45%, and volume and EBITDA were both up about 25% versus last year. COVID recovery and acquisitions primarily drove the 24% volume increase. Our liquid/bulk business has returned to its pre-COVID level, but the packaged gas business still lagged.
Price increased for the 14th consecutive quarter and was higher across most major product lines in all the subregions. The 1% price gain for the region corresponds to a 2% improvement for the merchant business. Real price increases were partially offset by unfavorable mix since the demand across the product lines was not even. We are also executing additional pricing actions to recover the recent power cost increases.
Currencies were a favorable 12% primarily due to the strong euro and British pound versus the U.S. dollar. EBITDA was up 25% to over $210 million driven primarily by the strong volume. EBITDA margin was down 540 basis points, with higher energy pass-through responsible for about 200 basis points. The remaining roughly 300 basis point reduction was mainly attributable to unfavorable costs, mostly power and other cost inflation.
Compared to prior quarter, sales rose 7%, primarily supported by positive 5% volume, but EBITDA was down 2% and margin was about 300 basis points lower as this volume gain was more than offset by higher costs, including power and other cost inflation, and lower equity affiliate income.
Now please turn to Slide 26, Global Gases, which includes our non-LNG sale of equipment businesses as well as central costs. Sales increased due to higher sale of equipment and project activity, but profit was lower due to business mix and higher product development spending. Sales and profits were roughly equal to last quarter.
Please turn to Slide 27, Corporate, which includes LNG and other businesses as well as our corporate costs. We were pleased to be selected for Nigeria LNG's Train 7 project, building on the success of the Air Products LNG equipment and technology for the first 6 trains.
Corporate segment sales were higher this quarter driven by increased project activities as we continued to execute multiple large LNG and other projects, but profit was lower on higher corporate costs. And sales and profits were roughly equal to last quarter.

As I mentioned earlier, Lu'An facility is operating at full capacity, and we expect the Jazan transaction to achieve financial close by the end of September 2021. For quarter 4 of fiscal year 2021, our earnings per share guidance is $2.44 to $2.54, up 11% to 16% over last year. This makes our guidance for our fiscal year to be $8.95 to $9.05, up approximately 8% over last year and within the range we shared with you last quarter. We continue to see our CapEx at approximately $2.5 billion for the year 2021. Our fiscal year '21 EPS and CapEx guidance obviously exclude any contribution from Jazan.
Meanwhile, we continue to execute our other projects, bringing them onstream and finalizing agreements with our customers. We are committed to our capital deployment strategy and to growing our pipeline of projects. We continue to be very optimistic about our focused long-term growth strategy. The capital deployment projections that we shared with you today for the next 6 years clearly demonstrate our significant growth potential in the years to come.
Now please turn to Slide #29. Clearly, the only sustainable long-term competitive advantage of any company is the degree of commitment and motivation of the people in the enterprise. We are fortunate to have that commitment with our people. By working together against the hardships of the pandemic, supporting our customers and each other, I'm proud to say that we have made our company even stronger in the process. Not only have we continued to strengthen our base business but also further extend our core competencies, pursuing our growth strategy. Our gasification, carbon capture and hydrogen growth platforms all support the drive for a cleaner environment, and we are executing mega-scale projects in all 3 areas.
We all know that the world's desire for clean energy will only accelerate. Our differentiated growth strategy and unmatched expertise have positioned Air Products for continued strong sales and growth well in the future.
As always, I want to again thank our customers around the world. In innovating alongside you, the dedicated and committed people of Air Products are doing their part to achieve our common higher purpose of creating a better world for everyone.

And second to that, as I think back over the last 3.5 years of the first CapEx outlook, the menu of things you're interested in expanded into gasification, and then we got in the green and blue hydrogen, now carbon capture. I would assume that we're going to see the future CapEx skew more towards those latter categories, but I'm also curious whether there's anything else that's on the horizon that's not currently on the CapEx venue that we should start thinking about."

Now that you asked the question, it gives me -- we came up with the $30 billion not because of lack of projects. It is because of we wanted to demonstrate what is our financial capacity to maintain our A rating. As we go forward, obviously, we will get it. We cannot project you EBITDA for 2030.

Number one, when you look at it the way you say that it is flat, the global economy is improving, please take note that the global economy is improving and people going to restaurants and flying around. In the major economies that we are operating, the industrial economy has not improved that much. That's number one.
The second thing, our results are significantly affected by Lu'An, you know that very well, because Lu'An had an EBITDA contribution every year at full capacity under normal circumstances of almost $150 million, $160 million a year. When you -- when that number comes down, then it distorts all of the numbers. But please look at our volumes.
And another thing is that our results are affected by another significant item, which I have mentioned many times before. We are investing in [ increased ] organization significantly to develop these new projects. When we [indiscernible] project like Canada, we have been working on 4 other projects. Each one of these projects costs $4 billion or $5 billion, $10 billion -- $10 million to develop. We are spending that money because we are investing for the future. So that is taking -- also hitting our results.
But look at our volumes. If you look at our volumes, our volumes are better than all of our competitors during that period. We have grown our base volumes. If you take all of the mumbo-jumbo out of people's results and our result, our volume growth has improved better than anybody else. It's 12%. So therefore, I don't [indiscernible] results. That's number one.
The second thing with respect to the return on capital employed, it depends on how you calculate it because if we can calculate our return on capital employed the way other people calculated that they don't consider the cash, we are at 15%, not at 10%. The second thing is that our return on capital employed has gone down because we borrowed $5 billion that is still sitting on our balance sheet and we haven't deployed that. Once we deploy that, once we pay for the Jazan $2.5 billion, your -- that return on capital employed jump up. Is that okay, Jeff?"

Second thing is that, John, we are talking about deploying $30 billion of capital. That means those projects need to get engineered and built before they contribute to the bottom line. We have added, without exaggeration, close to 2,000 people to our engineering and project management and business development staff in the last 2 years, 2,000 people. If you take $100,000, $120,000 per person, that becomes a lot of money. We have absorbed a lot of costs because of pricing and all of that, but still we are spending a significant amount of dollars in order to position ourselves that not only we develop these projects but that they also execute them and build them.
But then when we do that -- I mean people know how to do the math better than anybody else. If we deploy the $30 billion by 2027, which we say we will, and we say that the return on that thing is expect $0.10 operating profit for every dollar, that is $3 billion of operating profit in addition to what we are doing. You do that after tax, and then you come up with a significant number with respect to more than $10, $11, $15 per share. So in order -- we need to make that a reality, that is not going to happen by itself. And therefore, we are going to be absorbing a lot of additional costs in the meantime.
Now a year from now, 2 years from now, depending on how many projects we have, now if the next year, we come and say that, look, we spent $30 billion, now we have to increase it to $40 billion, then we will have to add more people. So there is a sequence to this thing. We need to spend the money to develop the project, to get the projects. And as you know, the new rules is such that you cannot put the projects on the balance sheet and then you win them and those that you win, you have to eat the costs. That's the accounting rules.
So that is where I think the investors need to have a little bit of patience with us because these costs are going to be with us. And quite honestly, it is amazing that the effect is not as much as it could be because as I said, 2,000 people, it's costing us $240 million, $250 million a year to support those people.

And first of all, we believe -- I mean the way we operate is that our base business, people increase prices to cover inflation. That is the minimum we expect them to do. The other cost increases, obviously, as I mentioned before, is adding additional resources. But our philosophy is that if power costs go up, prices need to go up. And as compared to other chemical companies, we have -- another benefit is that our raw material price doesn't go up because our raw material is really air for most of our products. And if it is natural gas, we do pass it through.
So overall, as I've said many times before, with my 42-year experience in industrial gases, inflationary times are, in general, positive for industrial gases because it gives you the license to increase prices. And if the -- I mean, in our call, we mentioned price increases on an overall basis. But if you take just our merchant price increases, we have had price increases this last quarter of 7% in Americas, 3% in Europe, 3% in Asia, total company 5% in price increase. So that's for the merchant side. So that is significant, and it's keeping us up to date with inflation, Kevin. Okay?"

We have stopped supplying them for a very simple reason, because we think the product that we have is worth a lot more and we can sell it for a higher price to other people. Therefore, we are in the business of making money. There was no sense for us to continue to sell hydrogen at low prices. That's why we have stopped dealing with them. In terms of building their own plant, as I said, I wish them good luck, and I hope they are successful.
And as far as other people wanting to get into the business, that's perfectly fine. We have been in the business of making hydrogen for the last 60 years. A lot of people are waking up in the morning and now want to get into the hydrogen business. I wish them good luck. There is plenty of opportunity, plenty of demand for this product. And if they want to get into it, they are more than welcome. I don't think we are concerned about that. We welcome competition. We have competition in everything else we do. And therefore, I have no concern about that, and I wish everybody good luck who wants to get into the business. We just have a minor 60 years of head start on them, but that people might consider is not that significant, but they'll find out what it takes."

Thank you for taking time from your very busy schedule to be on our call today. Before we discuss the results, I would like to say that despite the well-known global challenges in 2020 and 2021, the talented, committed and motivated people of Air Products demonstrated resilience and resolve and delivered excellent results, and in addition, continue to execute our growth strategy. I want to thank every one of our employees for standing together, working hard and delivering for our customers and shareholders.
Now please turn to Slide #3, where you can see some of our key highlights for this year. We delivered strong EPS this year, achieving 11% compounded annual growth since fiscal year 2014, and we increased the dividend for the 39th consecutive year. We were again recognized by prestigious raters and organizations for outstanding sustainability performance, including one we just announced this week, the EcoVadis for the fifth year in a row.
Our growth strategy and sustainability strategy are one and the same. And to that end, we proudly completed the asset acquisition and project financing transaction for the $12 billion Jazan joint venture with Aramco, ACWA Power and Air Products Qudra, as we announced last week. In conjunction with the government of Canada and the province of Alberta, we announced the new Net-Zero Hydrogen Energy Complex in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. This modest-scale energy complex will begin with a transformative $1 billion net-zero hydrogen production and the quotation facility expected onstream in 2024.
And just a few weeks ago, we announced the $4.5 billion Gilchrist Clean Energy Complex in Louisiana. Air Products will build, own and operate this mega project, which will produce over 750 million standard cubic feet a day of blue hydrogen for local and global markets by 2026. We will also capture and permanently sequester 5 million metric tons per year of carbon dioxide, making it the largest carbon capture for sequestration facility in the world.
By combining our core strengths and competencies, we successfully develop, execute and operate these larger-scale gasification, carbon capture and hydrogen projects to address the significant energy and environmental needs of the world. This is fully aligned with our higher purpose as a company.
Now please turn to Slide #4. As always, safety is the most important focus for all of us at Air Products, and our goal will always be to achieve 0 accidents and incidents. Despite the challenging COVID-19 condition this year, our team continues to focus on working safely, following our strict protocols to help protect our employees, our customers and our communities. We are pleased with the focus by the team that improved our safety performance in fiscal year '21 versus last year.
Slides #5, 6 and 7, which we have shared with you many times before, includes our goal, our management philosophy and our Five-Point Strategic Plan. These are the principles that we follow every day, and they will continue to guide us in the future.
Now please turn to Slide #8. As we speak, world leaders are gathered in Glasgow to work on closing the gap between climate aspirations and climate action. We are actively engaged in this rapidly evolving global dialogue and committed to ensuring that Air Products is best positioned to deliver on behalf of all of our stakeholders through this critical period of energy transition. We believe a successful energy transition requires successful development and execution of large-scale mega projects. Without that, the job cannot be done. The scope and complexity of these projects require talented people with a variety of skills and backgrounds from different parts of the world to work together as one team.
This is the higher purpose of our company. We can overcome the worst significant energy and environmental sustainability challenges with our focus and united people working together to provide real solutions for our customers.
Now please turn to Slide #9. As I have said before, we believe that hydrogen is one of the energy sources of the future along with electricity. We are scaling hydrogen production and developing a structure -- infrastructure to ensure this successful adoption as a sustainable fuel. Hydrogen will be the sustainable fuel of the future. Our customers count on us to deliver this hydrogen produced in a highly efficient manner.
Meanwhile, we are making significant investments in new facilities to produce low-carbon and carbon-free hydrogen made from hydrocarbons. By executing on new clean hydrogen projects in Alberta and Louisiana, we will be a leader in blue hydrogen as well as green hydrogen as we continue to execute our innovative new green hydrogen project in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
Now with that background, I'm happy to turn the call over to Dr. Samir Serhan, our Chief Operating Officer, to talk about our major projects. Dr. Serhan?"

We are committed to our growth strategy and continue to execute and pursue exciting projects around the world. In June, we announced the world-scale $1 billion Net-Zero Hydrogen project in Alberta, Canada, with the strong support of the Canadian federal and local governments. This project will use natural gas to make net-zero hydrogen, which has the same 0 carbon footprint as a green hydrogen made from renewable energy. 95% of the CO2 resulting from our net-zero project will be permanently sequestered, and the remaining 5% will be offset by exporting a clean electricity produced by the clean hydrogen. The project provides a road map for hydrocarbon-based economies to significantly reduce their CO2 emissions.
Just a few weeks ago, we had the honor of joining the Governor of Louisiana and state officials to announce our world-scale $4.5 billion blue hydrogen project. This will also be the world's largest permanent CO2 sequestration operation. This project will provide clean hydrogen to our customers along our 700-mile U.S. Gulf Coast hydrogen pipeline system and also produce blue ammonia, targeting heavy transport around the world. The pipeline will be able to carry a variety of carbon intensity hydrogen, including gray and blue.
These 2 projects will use advanced gasification technologies available to Air Products to produce clean hydrogen while using hydrocarbon feedstock in a sustainable way. Both projects also combine in one project the 3 pillars of our growth strategy: gasification, carbon capture and hydrogen. We have made good progress on our Jiutai project, and we expect the facility to be onstream in fiscal year '23. We also expect the Debang project onstream in fiscal year '23.
Successful execution of the Gulf Coast ammonia project continues with field construction on Air Products, large single train 175 million standard cubic feet per day of hydrogen steam methane reformer as well as the related 90 million standard cubic feet per day nitrogen ASU facility and related utilities. Construction is also progressing well on the 30-mile hydrogen pipeline network expansion to our world's largest hydrogen pipeline network. The project onstream schedule remains as originally planned for the first half of fiscal year '23. We're forging ahead in Indonesia and making good progress despite some challenges that of COVID. We expect to complete this project in '25.
For NEOM, as you can see in the picture on the slide, we are laying the groundwork for the project to preparing the land and doing detailed engineering. We're even more excited now about this project since our announcement last year. We're forecasting to export the 0-carbon hydrogen in the form of ammonia in 2026.
In addition to our mega projects, Air Products has also continued to make significant investments in small and midsized on-site generators in our regional industrial gases business, with fiscal year '21 being a record year for investments in this category. These onsite plants, which typically have project investment values from USD 0.5 million to USD 50 million, cover a range of technologies from prism hydrogen generators; prism oxygen VSA, vacuum swing adoption; and a small/midsized prism ASUs. Specifically, fiscal year '21 was a record year for investments in our Prism Oxygen VCA product line, with the new projects in North America, Europe, India, China and South Korea predominantly supplying several major glass manufacturers around the world. Oxygen VSAs are frequently integrated with Air Products oxy-fuel burner technology, which help reduce emissions, provide fuel savings, improve productivity and deliver operational savings for the customer.

As we shared with you last week, we, along with our joint venture partners, completed the asset acquisition and project financing transaction of the $12 billion air separation unit, gasification and power joint venture with Aramco, ACWA Power and Air Products Qudra in Jazan, Saudi Arabia, making a significant milestone after the hard work of our people as well as our customers and partners. The project return is expected to be better than we originally envisioned.
As we said last week, we expect Phase 1 of the project to contribute an annual run rate of $0.80 to $0.85 of earnings per share, starting as of last week. The project is expected to contribute about $1.35 to $1.40 for the first 10 years after first -- Phase 2 closes.
Now please turn to Slide #12, which shows our EPS growth. We remain vigilant and motivated to deliver excellent financial results, consistent with our strategy. As you can see, we have delivered 11% annual EPS growth on average since 2014 while laying a strong foundation for our future growth. The excellent results and key milestones we have achieved this year are just the beginning of our journey, delivering gasification, carbon capture and hydrogen solutions to the world. I am very optimistic about our company's prospects, completing -- participating in a very meaningful way in the energy transition.
Now please turn to Slide #13. As a reminder, we share our earnings growth directly with our investors. Both our EPS and dividend have grown by double digits since 2014. We are committed to deliver increased dividend while we continue to execute our growth opportunities. We have significant cash flow that supports our substantial dividend. And as you know, we have increased that now for the 39th consecutive year.
And finally, Slide #14, as always, my favorite slide, shows that our EBITDA margins are up 1,100 basis points since 2014. Our margin is down in recent quarters, impacted by higher energy pass-through, which increases our sales but doesn't impact profits. 2/3 of the margin decline from our peak margin is due to the impact of higher energy pass-through. But I do want to stress that we are determined and focused on improving our margins back to around 40% by increasing prices to cover significant increases in energy costs and by improving productivity.
Now I'm happy to turn the call over to Melissa Schaeffer, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to discuss our results in more detail. Melissa?"

We have made great strides building our growth strategy this year, completing multiple projects and winning exciting new projects. At the same time, we continue to focus our base business and deliver excellent results for the quarter and the year.
We grew our EPS 8% this year, overcoming various external challenges and absorbing the cost of additional resources needed to support our growth strategy. Our distributable cash flow remains strong at $2.7 billion. Furthermore, the large-scale projects currently under development will substantially add to our earnings once we bring them on stream.
I share Seifi's conviction that for Air Products, the best is indeed yet to come. This is a testament to the hard work and commitment of the people of Air Products. And I, too, want to thank them.
Now please turn to Slide 15 for more details on our full year results. Sales grew 17% to more than $10 billion. Volume and price together gained 7%. The 5% volume growth was primarily driven by our EMEA and Global Gases segment. Although the adverse impact from the pandemic has eased through the year, it still had a negative impact on FY '21. Price improved every quarter in all 3 regions and across most major product lines. Overall, price increased 2% and our merchant price was up 5%. EBITDA was up 7%, approaching $4 billion due to favorable price, currency and equity affiliate income, which was partially offset by higher costs.
EBITDA margin declined 330 basis points, of which 200 basis points are attributed to higher energy pass-through, which increases sales but negatively impacts margin. ROCE was 160 basis points lower. The increase in the denominator from our additional $5 billion of debt raised last year reduced ROCE by about 300 basis points. Adjusting for the cash on our balance sheet, our ROCE would be 14.2%. We expect ROCE to improve as we deploy the cash and bring projects onstream.
Now please turn to Slide 16 for a discussion of full year EPS. Our full year adjusted EPS from continuing operations was up $0.64 or 8%. Price net of variable cost was again strong, favorable $0.34, the fourth consecutive year of double-digit EPS net price improvement. Volume was flat as acquisitions, new plants, merchant recovery and higher sale of equipment activity were offset by lower contribution from Lu'An. Different business mix caused volume to have a positive impact on sales but minimum impact on profit.
Our costs were $0.46 unfavorable, primarily due to the addition of resources to support our future growth and higher planned maintenance costs. Currency was favorable $0.35, primarily driven by the Chinese RMB, euro, British pound and South Korean won. Our equity affiliates also had strong underlying business results, adding $0.23, with several joint ventures reporting stronger medical oxygen sales.
Nonoperating income was $0.16 favorable, primarily due to lower pension expense. Interest expense was $0.12 favorable due to the $5 billion of debt to support our future growth projects. Our effective tax rate of 18.9% was roughly equal to last year, and we expect an effective tax rate of 19% to 20% in FY 2022.
Now please turn to Slide 17 for a brief discussion on our fourth quarter results. Compared to last year, sales increased 22% to more than $2.8 billion. Volume, price, energy pass-through and currencies were all up. Volume improved 9% as strong hydrogen and merchant demand and new assets more than offset reduced Lu'An contribution. Prices were up again with improvement in all 3 regions. This is the 17th consecutive quarter of year-over-year price gain. Overall, prices were up 3% in total, which equaled a 6% increase for the merchant business. We experienced significantly higher energy costs in our merchant business this quarter. The situation is particularly challenging in EMEA due to the extremely high natural gas and electricity costs.
Our onsite business, about half of our total company sales, has contractual protection from energy cost fluctuations. We are actively executing additional price actions across product lines to recover the higher energy costs impacting our merchant business.
EBITDA climbed 11%, exceeding $1 billion mark as favorable volume, price, currency and equity affiliate income more than offset higher costs. EBITDA margin declined 380 basis points primarily due to higher energy pass-through, which negatively impacted margins by about 300 basis points. Sequentially, sales were up 9%, supported by 5% stronger volumes and 1% higher price. EBITDA grew 7% sequentially as better volume, price and equity affiliate income more than offset higher energy costs.
Now please turn to Slide 18. Our fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $2.51, which is $0.32 or 15% above last year. Volume was favorable 
[ $0.18 ] and price, net of variable costs contributed $0.04 as our price increases exceeded variable cost inflation driven by higher power costs.
Like the prior few quarters, our plans to add resources and strengthen our organization to support growth have increased our costs. We also saw higher costs due to disruptions across the supply chain in all 3 regions. Currency and foreign exchange contributed $0.06, primarily due to the Chinese RMB and British pound. Equity affiliate income added $0.09 on strong underlying business results. The $0.04 of nonoperating income was primarily driven by lower pension expense. The effective tax rate of 18.1% was 130 basis points higher than last year due to the last year's higher share-based compensation benefits and a tax benefit associated with the PBF acquisition.
Now please turn to Slide 19. The stability of our business allows us to continue to generate strong cash flow. Over the last 12 months, we generated about $2.7 billion of distributable cash flow or almost $12 per share. From our EBITDA of about $3.9 billion, we paid interest, taxes and maintenance capital. Note that our maintenance capital is a little higher than usual, driven in part by spending on our new global headquarters, which is essentially now complete.
From the distributable cash flow, we paid $0.45 or about $1.3 billion as dividends to our shareholders and still have about $1.4 billion available for high-return industrial gas investments. This strong cash flow, even in uncertain times, enables us to continue to create shareholder value through increasing dividends and capital deployment.
Slide #20 provides an update of our capital deployment. As we discussed last quarter, we've extended our time horizon another 5 years to fiscal 2027. We see tremendous project opportunities beyond 2022 and the investment potential far exceeding the original capacity of $15 billion.
Based on this updated view, we see our capital deployment potential reaching approximately $34 billion through fiscal 2027. The $34 billion includes roughly $10 billion of cash and additional debt capacity available today, almost $17 billion we expect to be available by 2027 and about $7 billion already spent. We still believe this figure is conservative given the potential for additional EBITDA growth, which generates additional cash flow, and therefore, additional borrowing capacity. We will continue to focus on managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted A/A2 rating.
So you can see we have already spent 21% and have already committed 67% of the updated capacity we show here. I should note that this is as of September 30, so does not reflect the closing of the Jazan Phase 1 but does include the Louisiana project.
Before I turn the call back to Seifi, I would like to share with you that we plan to reorganize our reporting segments starting in Q1 of FY '22. Our EMEA segment will be separated into Europe and a Middle East and India segment to reflect the addition of the significant Jazan project in the Middle East segment and to provide more visibility for our geographic regions. In addition, our Global Gases and corporate segment will be combined. We will provide historical resegmented financial information before the year-end.
Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call back over to Seifi."

Now please turn to Slide #21 for our Asia results. Sales increased 6% compared to last year on 5% favorable currencies and 1% positive price increase, the 18th consecutive quarter of year-on-year price improvement in this region. Volumes were flat with new plants, mostly outside of China, offsetting lower on contribution. Regarding Lu'An, there is no change for the -- from the previous updates that we have given you. The plant continues to operate at full capacity despite the coal shortage in China. As I said last quarter, under the interim supply agreement, we are recognizing reduced fees through fiscal year '22 before we return to the full year fee in 2023.
This quarter, China's effort to reduce energy usage and intensity to the so-called dual control had a modest adverse effect on our results, has reduced some merchant customers' demand and caused isolated disruptions in operations. We continue to monitor this developing situation very closely. In the long term, though, we do see positive growth opportunities as China continues to focus on reducing its carbon intensity.
EBITDA for decision grew 3%, supported by favorable currencies and price. Costs compared unfavorably primarily due to higher variable energy costs, resources needed to support project and start-ups, the timing of China government incentives last year and the disruption called by its dual control policy to reduce energy consumption. Sequentially, EBITDA and margins were lower as higher costs more than offset better volumes. Price is up but rounded to 0.

Demand for jet fuel, which consumes more hydrogen on a unit basis compared to gasoline, is still lagging. Also, the industry continued to use more light sweet crude, which requires less hydrogen. We are confident in the long-term growth of hydrogen demand, particularly in the U.S. Gulf Coast.
Price for the quarter was again strong. The 4% gain for the region was equivalent to 10% on the merchant business. Price was better across all major products. This is the 13th consecutive quarter of year-on-year price improvement. Energy cost pass-through drove a 15% sales increase with the much higher natural gas prices. EBITDA was 16% ahead of last year as positive volume price at our equity affiliate income and lower maintenance costs more than offset higher inflation. EBITA margin was 230 basis points lower. However, energy cost pass-through negatively impacted EBITDA margin by approximately 500 basis points. In other words, EBITDA margin would have been significantly up excluding energy pass-through. Sequentially, energy pass-through drove margin 250 basis points lower.
Now I would like to turn the call back over to Simon to discuss our other segments. Simon?"

Our EMEA team delivered another set of outstanding results this quarter. Sales jumped 33% versus last year and EBITDA was up 14%. Volume was strong, increasing 14%, driven primarily by improved hydrogen and merchant demand and new assets.
Our liquid bulk partially recovered from the pandemic, but packaged gases and hydrogen are still below pre-COVID levels. Price increased for the 15th consecutive quarter and was higher across most major product lines and subregions. The 4% price gain for the region corresponds to a 6% improvement for the merchant business.
Consistent with what most consumers and businesses are experiencing, our European business faced unprecedented energy cost escalation this quarter. Supply chain-related interruptions further exacerbated the difficult situation. Our team has done an excellent job coping with these challenges, executing pricing actions and keeping our customers supplied.
As Melissa said, our onsite contracts allow us to pass through the higher energy costs. For our merchant business, we continue to work hard to recover the recent cost increases through additional pricing actions already underway.
Currencies were favorable 3%, primarily due to the strong British pound versus the U.S. dollar. EBITDA was up 14% to about $230 million, primarily due to the strong volume, while better price, equity affiliate income and favorable currencies offset most of the energy cost increase. EBITDA margin was down 560 basis points, with higher energy pass-through responsible for about 400 basis points. The remaining roughly 150 basis point reduction was mainly attributable to unfavorable costs, partially offset by favorable equity affiliate income and better volume.
Compared to prior quarter, sales climbed 8% primarily due to pass-through, while positive price and volume were offset by unfavorable currencies. Operating income was 3% below last quarter as the positive price and volume were more than offset by higher costs. Meanwhile, EBITDA was 8% higher due to the inclusion of positive equity affiliate income.
And as Melissa mentioned, we will separate the current EMEA segment into 2 segments, Europe and Middle East and India, starting next quarter.
Now please turn to Slide 24, Global Gases, which includes our non-LNG sale of equipment businesses as well as central costs. Sales and profit were up on higher project activities. We continue to add resources to support project development.
Please turn to Slide 25, Corporate, which includes LNG and other businesses as well as our corporate costs. Corporate segment sales were higher this quarter, driven by increased project activities as we continue to execute multiple large LNG and other projects, but profit was lower on higher corporate costs. Sequentially, sales and profits were better than last quarter. Again, as Melissa said, we will combine Global and Corporate starting next quarter.
Now to provide closing comments, I'll turn the call back over to Seifi."

But what has compounded our issue in terms of being able to recover them fast enough is that the rate of energy increases. I mean, if energy increases, we do forecast these things. But what happened in Europe in the month of August and September was something that -- it was impossible to forecast that things would go up 200%.

I mean everybody likes to say that COVID is over, now everything is growth. China the biggest growth engine that the world had last quarter grew only 3%.

We are talking here about 2020 -- the time that we have, so 2026, when these projects are going to come on stream.
Number one, we do need increased hydrogen demand on our -- on the pipeline because we have new customers that are coming on. And we see ourselves sold out on that, and therefore, we need additional hydrogen in the pipeline.
The second thing is that we think there will be significant additional customers if we can give them blue hydrogen, and they will convert and get the benefits of that. But then a significant part of their production, especially in Canada, is going to be liquid, which is going to go for mobility where we see people converting to hydrogen for their mobility and the program they have.
Then in Louisiana, the massive amount of hydrogen that we are making, a significant part of that or part of that, we haven't given you the details until we figure out all of the details. But fundamentally, a significant amount will be converted to blue ammonia, which will be exported, and you know where the destination of that export is. That's basically in Japan, where they have no other choice. But how is Japan going to decarbonize? They don't have oil. They don't have gas. They don't have nuclear, and they don't have shallow water to do any kind of windmills offshore. So they need to import their energy. And the best form of energy to import is import blue ammonia where the CO2 has been captured and to burn it in their power plants to generate electricity so that then they can use that electricity to drive their cars and all that. So that is the thinking that we have in terms of the outlet for the blue hydrogen.

And then the other thing is that we have 2 kinds of business, as you very well know. We have the onsite business. The onsite business, we will only shut down our plant if the customer is forced to shut down. Let's say, it's a steel plant and they say, ""Shut down their steel plant."" The customer doesn't need oxygen. They have to shut down the power plant.
Then we have our merchant business. Our merchant business, we rarely shut down our merchant business case because we are not a dirty business. So they don't specifically say, ""Shut down the ASU."" It's mainly the customers that they shut down, which affects us."

When it comes to the SMR, what happens in an SMR? When you take the natural gas, you have a steam methane reformer. You take some of the natural gas directly into the process, goes over a catalyst, and you break down CH4 to CO and hydrogen. And then you shift it, you have hydrogen. And the CO becomes CO2, and it goes up at the atmosphere. You can capture 95% of that. Sure.
But then you use a lot of the natural gas to burn -- to heat up the tubes, which contain the catalyst. That is combustion, like a combustion in furnace or in a power plant. Theoretically, you can capture that CO2, but it will cost you an arm and a leg to capture that. So making the statement that I can capture 95% of the CO2 from SMR, sure, you can capture the CO2 in AI. But the issue is that, is it cost-effective or not. So what we are saying is that the technology that we have makes it possible to capture the CO2 in a cost-effective way.
But I mean you have to put a lot of equipment on the SMR to capture the CO2 from combustion. Theoretically, you can say, ""Yes, I can put special boxes and do that."" And I really don't want to comment on what our competitors say. They have to defend what they say. It's their business. But from our point of view, when we put carbon capture on SMRs, as we have done, and we actually operate the biggest one in Port Arthur, everybody can go and take a look at it. We have the CO2 capture on the process part because that is economical. We can capture that and use it for an acol recovery. But on the combustion part, we don't do that because that becomes cost-prohibitive. Can it be done? Yes, sure. Anything can be done at a cost.
I hope that helps, Marc."

I mean in California, they have put $200, right? Per ton of CO2, you get an incentive for that. Canada is talking about $50 to $100 but -- a ton. Other parts of the world that we have exposure to, that -- the number is somewhere between $100, $50, $75, $150. It's all over the place. I think that -- the way we look at these projects and all of that, we try to kind of look at the profitability on the basis that we don't get too much of these kind of things because we don't want to rely on government subsidies every time we do something. But overall, these numbers are all going to develop based on the commitments that people have made.
And fundamentally, what is going to happen, Vincent? If people are going to -- I mean I see a great deal of fascination, all of these promises being made at Glasgow. But if you add up all of those things, the amount of carbon credits that you need in order to meet the requirements becomes gigantic. And therefore, in order to generate those things, customers need to start using these low-carbon energy sources. And therefore, you have to have real incentives for people to convert from diesel for ships and trains and planes and all of that and steelmaking to really shift to clean energy. And that one, a little bit of incentive is not going to do that.
So I think if the governments are serious to achieving those goals, they have to put in steep incentives to incentivize people to actually do that. So the prospect of that is very encouraging for our business. But we have to see how it develops, Vincent, as we go forward.

They are taking coal and they are making diesel, and they are selling the diesel fuel at higher prices because the oil price is $84 a barrel.
So in a roundabout, if hydrocarbon costs go up, it helps those kind of projects. But then the other interesting part is that if hydrocarbon costs go up, then the cost of renewable energy compared to hydrocarbons becomes even more attractive. So you would say that it's easier to convert a truck driver from diesel to hydrogen because now the diesel is costing more.

Thank you for taking time from your very busy schedule to be on our call today. Before we discuss the results, I would like to say that despite the well-known global challenges in 2020 and 2021, the talented, committed and motivated people of Air Products demonstrated resilience and resolve and delivered excellent results, and in addition, continue to execute our growth strategy. I want to thank every one of our employees for standing together, working hard and delivering for our customers and shareholders. 
Now please turn to Slide #3, where you can see some of our key highlights for this year. We delivered strong EPS this year, achieving 11% compounded annual growth since fiscal year 2014, and we increased the dividend for the 39th consecutive year. We were again recognized by prestigious raters and organizations for outstanding sustainability performance, including one we just announced this week, the EcoVadis for the fifth year in a row. 
Our growth strategy and sustainability strategy are one and the same. And to that end, we proudly completed the asset acquisition and project financing transaction for the $12 billion Jazan joint venture with Aramco, ACWA Power and Air Products Qudra, as we announced last week. In conjunction with the government of Canada and the province of Alberta, we announced the new net-zero hydrogen energy complex in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. This modest-scale energy complex will begin with a transformative $1 billion net-zero hydrogen production and liquefaction facility expected onstream in 2024. 
And just a few weeks ago, we announced the $4.5 billion world-class clean energy complex in Louisiana. Air Products will build, own and operate this mega project, which will produce over 750 million standard cubic feet per day of blue hydrogen for local and global markets by 2026. We will also capture and permanently sequester 5 million metric tons per year of carbon dioxide, making it the largest carbon capture for sequestration facility in the world. 
By combining our core strengths and competencies, we successfully develop, execute and operate these larger-scale gasification, carbon capture and hydrogen projects to address the significant energy and environmental needs of the world. This is fully aligned with our higher purpose as a company. 
Now please turn to Slide #4. As always, safety is the most important focus for all of us at Air Products, and our goal will always be to achieve 0 accidents and incidents. Despite the challenging COVID-19 condition this year, our team continues to focus on working safely, following our strict protocols to help protect our own employees, our customers and our communities. We are pleased with the focus by the team that improved our safety performance in fiscal year '21 versus last year. 
Slides #5, 6 and 7, which we have shared with you many times before, includes our goal, our management philosophy and our five-point strategic plan. These are the principles that we follow every day, and they will continue to guide us in the future. 
Now please turn to Slide #8. As we speak, world leaders are gathered in Glasgow to work on closing the gap between climate aspirations and climate action. We are actively engaged in this rapidly evolving global dialogue and committed to ensuring that Air Products is best positioned to deliver on behalf of all of our stakeholders through this critical period of energy transition. We believe a successful energy transition requires successful development and execution of large-scale mega projects. Without that, the job cannot be done. The scope and complexity of these projects require talented people with a variety of skills and backgrounds from different parts of the world to work together as one team. 
This is the higher purpose of our company. We can overcome the world's significant energy and environmental sustainability challenges with our focus and united people working together to provide real solutions for our customers. 
Now please turn to Slide #9. As I have said before, we believe that hydrogen is one of the energy sources of the future along with electricity. We are scaling hydrogen production and developing a structure -- infrastructure to ensure this successful adoption as a sustainable fuel. Hydrogen will be the sustainable fuel of the future. Our customers count on us to deliver this hydrogen produced in a highly efficient manner. 
Meanwhile, we are making significant investments in new facilities to produce low-carbon and carbon-free hydrogen made from hydrocarbons. By executing on new clean hydrogen projects in Alberta and Louisiana, we will be a leader in blue hydrogen as well as green hydrogen as we continue to execute our innovative new green hydrogen project in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. 
Now with that background, I'm happy to turn the call over to Dr. Samir Serhan, our Chief Operating Officer, to talk about our major projects. Dr. Serhan?"

We are committed to our growth strategy and continue to execute and pursue exciting projects around the world. In June, we announced the world-scale $1 billion net-zero hydrogen project in Alberta, Canada, with the strong support of the Canadian federal and local governments. This project will use natural gas to make net-zero hydrogen, which has the same zero carbon footprint as a green hydrogen made from renewable energy. 95% of the CO2 resulting from our net-zero project will be permanently sequestered, and the remaining 5% will be offset by exporting a clean electricity produced by the clean hydrogen. The project provides a road map for hydrocarbon-based economies to significantly reduce their CO2 emissions. 
Just a few weeks ago, we had the honor of joining the Governor of Louisiana and state officials to announce our world-scale $4.5 billion blue hydrogen project. This will also be the world's largest permanent CO2 sequestration operation. This project will provide clean hydrogen to our customers along our 700-mile U.S. Gulf Coast hydrogen pipeline system and also produce blue ammonia, targeting heavy transport around the world. The pipeline will be able to carry a variety of carbon intensity hydrogen, including gray and blue. 
These 2 projects will use advanced gasification technologies available to Air Products to produce clean hydrogen while using hydrocarbon feedstock in a sustainable way. Both projects also combine in one project the 3 pillars of our growth strategy: gasification, carbon capture and hydrogen. 
We have made good progress on our Jiutai project, and we expect the facility to be onstream in fiscal year '23. We also expect the Debang project onstream in fiscal year '23. 
Successful execution of the Gulf Coast ammonia project continues with field construction on Air Products' largest single train, 175 million standard cubic feet per day of hydrogen steam methane reformer as well as the related 90 million standard cubic feet per day nitrogen ASU facility and related utilities. Construction is also progressing well on the 30-mile hydrogen pipeline network expansion to our world's largest hydrogen pipeline network. The project onstream schedule remains as originally planned for the first half of fiscal year '23. 
We're forging ahead in Indonesia and making good progress despite some challenges with COVID. We expect to complete this project in '25. 
For NEOM, as you can see in the picture on the slide, we are laying the groundwork for the project, preparing the land and doing detailed engineering. We're even more excited now about this project since our announcement last year. We're forecasting to export the zero carbon hydrogen in the form of ammonia in 2026. 
In addition to our mega projects, Air Products has also continued to make significant investments in small and midsized on-site generators in our regional industrial gases business with fiscal year '21 being a record year for investments in this category. These on-site plants, which typically have project investment values from USD 0.5 million to USD 50 million, cover a range of technologies from a PRISM hydrogen generators; PRISM oxygen VSA, vacuum swing adsorption; and small/midsized PRISM ASUs. Specifically, fiscal year '21 was a record year for investments in our PRISM Oxygen VSA product line, with the new projects in North America, Europe, India, China and South Korea predominantly supplying several major glass manufacturers around the world. The Oxygen VSAs are frequently integrated with Air Products' oxy-fuel burner technology, which help reduce emissions, provide fuel savings, improve productivity and deliver operational savings for the customer. 
Now I'm pleased to turn the call back to Seifi."

Please turn to Slide #11. As we shared with you last week, we, along with our joint venture partners, completed the asset acquisition and project financing transaction of the $12 billion air separation unit, gasification and power joint venture with Aramco, ACWA Power and Air Products Qudra in Jazan, Saudi Arabia, making a significant milestone after the hard work of our people as well as our customers and partners. The project return is expected to be better than we originally envisioned. 
As we said last week, we expect Phase 1 of the project to contribute an annual run rate of $0.80 to $0.85 of earnings per share, starting as of last week. The project is expected to contribute about $1.35 to $1.40 for the first 10 years after first -- Phase 2 closes. 
Now please turn to Slide #12, which shows our EPS growth. We remain vigilant and motivated to deliver excellent financial results, consistent with our strategy. As you can see, we have delivered 11% annual EPS growth on average since 2014 while laying a strong foundation for our future growth. The excellent results and key milestones we have achieved this year are just the beginning of our journey, delivering gasification, carbon capture and hydrogen solutions to the world. I am very optimistic about our company's prospects, completing -- participating in a very meaningful way in the energy transition. 
Now please turn to Slide #13. As a reminder, we share our earnings growth directly with our investors. Both our EPS and dividend have grown by double digits since 2014. We are committed to deliver increased dividend while we continue to execute our growth opportunities. We have significant cash flow that supports our substantial dividend. And as you know, we have increased that now for the 39th consecutive year. 
And finally, Slide #14, as always, my favorite slide, shows that our EBITDA margins are up 1,100 basis points since 2014. Our margin is down in recent quarters, impacted by higher energy pass-through, which increases our sales but doesn't impact profits. 2/3 of the margin decline from our peak margin is due to the impact of higher energy pass-through. But I do want to stress that we are determined and focused on improving our margins back to around 40% by increasing prices to cover significant increases in energy costs and by improving productivity. 
Now I'm happy to turn the call over to Melissa Schaeffer, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, to discuss our results in more detail. Melissa?"

We have made great strides [ at building ] our growth strategy this year, completing multiple projects and winning exciting new projects. At the same time, we continue to focus our base business and deliver excellent results for the quarter and the year. We grew our EPS 8% this year, overcoming various external challenges and absorbing the cost of additional resources needed to support our growth strategy. Our distributable cash flow remains strong at $2.7 billion. Furthermore, these large-scale projects currently under development will substantially add to our earnings once we bring them on stream. 
I share Seifi's conviction that for Air Products, the best is indeed yet to come. This is a testament to the hard work and commitment of the people of Air Products. And I, too, want to thank them. 
Now please turn to Slide 15 for more details on our full year results. Sales grew 17% to more than $10 billion. Volume and price together gained 7%. The 5% volume growth was primarily driven by our EMEA and Global Gases segment. Although the adverse impact from the pandemic has eased through the year, it still had a negative impact on FY '21. Price improved every quarter in all 3 regions and across most major product lines. Overall, price increased 2% and our merchant price was up 5%. EBITDA was up 7%, approaching $4 billion due to favorable price, currency and equity affiliate income, which was partially offset by higher costs. 
EBITDA margin declined 330 basis points, of which 200 basis points are attributed to higher energy pass-through, which increases sales but negatively impacts margin. ROCE was 160 basis points lower. The increase in the denominator from our additional $5 billion of debt raised last year reduced ROCE by about 300 basis points. Adjusting for the cash on our balance sheet, our ROCE would be 14.2%. We expect ROCE to improve as we deploy the cash and bring projects onstream. 
Now please turn to Slide 16 for a discussion of full year EPS. Our full year adjusted EPS from continuing operations was up $0.64 or 8%. Price net of variable cost was again strong, favorable $0.34, the fourth consecutive year of double-digit EPS net price improvement. Volume was flat as acquisitions, new plants, merchant recovery and higher sale of equipment activity were offset by lower contribution from Lu'An. Different business mix caused volume to have a positive impact on sales but minimum impact on profit. 
Our costs were $0.46 unfavorable, primarily due to the addition of resources to support our future growth and higher planned maintenance costs. Currency was favorable $0.35, primarily driven by the Chinese RMB, euro, British pound and South Korean won. Our equity affiliates also had strong underlying business results, adding $0.23, with several joint ventures reporting stronger medical oxygen sales. 
Nonoperating income was $0.16 favorable, primarily due to lower pension expense. Interest expense was $0.12 favorable due to the $5 billion of debt to support our future growth projects. Our effective tax rate of 18.9% was roughly equal to last year, and we expect an effective tax rate of 19% to 20% in FY 2022. 
Now please turn to Slide 17 for a brief discussion on our fourth quarter results. Compared to last year, sales increased 22% to more than $2.8 billion. Volume, price, energy pass-through and currencies were all up. Volume improved 9% as strong hydrogen and merchant demand and new assets more than offset reduced Lu'An contribution. 
Prices were up again with improvement in all 3 regions. This is the 17th consecutive quarter of year-over-year price gain. Overall, prices were up 3% in total, which equaled a 6% increase for the merchant business. We experienced significantly higher energy costs in our merchant business this quarter. The situation is particularly challenging in EMEA due to the extremely high natural gas and electricity costs. 
Our onsite business, about half of our total company's sales, has contractual protection from energy cost fluctuations. We are actively executing additional price actions across product lines to recover the higher energy costs impacting our merchant business. 
EBITDA climbed 11%, exceeding $1 billion mark as favorable volume, price, currency and equity affiliate income more than offset higher costs. EBITDA margin declined 380 basis points primarily due to higher energy pass-through, which negatively impacted margins by about 300 basis points. Sequentially, sales were up 9%, supported by 5% stronger volumes and 1% higher price. EBITDA grew 7% sequentially as better volume, price and equity affiliate income more than offset higher energy costs. 
Now please turn to Slide 18. Our fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $2.51, which is $0.32 or 15% above last year. Volume was a favorable $0.19 and price, net of variable costs contributed $0.04 as our price increases exceeded variable cost inflation driven by higher power costs. 
Like the prior few quarters, our plans to add resources and strengthen our organization to support growth have increased our costs. We also saw higher costs due to disruptions across the supply chain in all 3 regions. Currency and foreign exchange contributed $0.06, primarily due to the Chinese RMB and British pound. Equity affiliate income added $0.09 on strong underlying business results. The $0.04 of nonoperating income was primarily driven by lower pension expense. The effective tax rate of 18.1% was 130 basis points higher than last year due to the last year's higher share-based compensation benefits and a tax benefit associated with the PBF acquisition.
Now please turn to Slide 19. The stability of our business allows us to continue to generate strong cash flow. Over the last 12 months, we generated about $2.7 billion of distributable cash flow or almost $12 per share. From our EBITDA of about $3.9 billion, we paid interest, taxes and maintenance capital. Note that our maintenance capital is a little higher than usual, driven in part by spending on our new global headquarters, which is essentially now complete.
From the distributable cash flow, we paid $0.45 or about $1.3 billion as dividends to our shareholders and still have about $1.4 billion available for high-return industrial gas investments. This strong cash flow, even in uncertain times, enables us to continue to create shareholder value through increasing dividends and capital deployment.
Slide #20 provides an update of our capital deployment. As we discussed last quarter, we've extended our time horizon another 5 years to fiscal 2027. We see tremendous project opportunities beyond 2022 and the investment potential far exceeding the original capacity of $15 billion.
Based on this updated view, we see our capital deployment potential reaching approximately $34 billion through fiscal 2027. The $34 billion includes roughly $10 billion of cash and additional debt capacity available today, almost $17 billion we expect to be available by 2027 and about $7 billion already spent. We still believe this figure is conservative given the potential for additional EBITDA growth, which generates additional cash flow, and therefore, additional borrowing capacity. We will continue to focus on managing our debt balance to maintain our current targeted A/A2 rating.
So you can see we have already spent 21% and have already committed 67% of the updated capacity we show here. I should note that this is as of September 30, so it does not reflect the closing of the Jazan Phase 1 but does include the Louisiana project.
Before I turn the call back to Seifi, I would like to share with you that we plan to reorganize our reporting segments starting in Q1 of FY '22. Our EMEA segment will be separated into Europe and a Middle East and India segment to reflect the addition of the significant Jazan project in the Middle East segment and to provide more visibility for our geographic regions. In addition, our Global Gases and Corporate segment will be combined. We will provide historical resegmented financial information before the year-end.
Now to begin the review of our business segment results, I'll turn the call back over to Seifi."

Now please turn to Slide #21 for our Asia results. Sales increased 6% compared to last year on 5% favorable currencies and 1% positive price increase, the 18th consecutive quarter of year-on-year price improvement in this region. Volumes were flat with new plants, mostly outside of China, offsetting the lower Lu'An contribution. Regarding Lu'An, there is no change for the -- from the previous updates that we have given you. The plant continues to operate at full capacity despite the coal shortage in China. As I said last quarter, under the interim supply agreement, we are recognizing reduced fees through fiscal year '22 before we return to the full year fee in 2023.
This quarter, China's effort to reduce energy usage and intensity, the so-called dual control had a modest adverse effect on our results. It reduced some merchant customers' demand and caused isolated disruptions in operations. We continue to monitor this developing situation very closely. In the long term, though, we do see positive growth opportunities as China continues to focus on reducing its carbon intensity.
EBITDA for this region grew 3%, supported by favorable currencies and price. Costs compared unfavorably primarily due to higher variable energy costs, resources needed to support project and start-ups, the timing of China government incentives last year and the disruption called by its dual control policy to reduce energy consumption. Sequentially, EBITDA and margins were lower as higher costs more than offset better volumes. Price is up but rounded to 0.
Now I would like to turn the call over to Dr. Serhan to talk about our Americas results. Dr. Serhan?"

Sales increased more than 20% versus last year, and EBITDA posted another double-digit gain. Volume grew 3%, primarily due to better hydrogen and merchant demand. Although Hurricane Ida interrupted our U.S. Gulf Coast operations this quarter, our team worked very hard to limit the impact to our business. While most of our merchant products have returned to pre-COVID levels, our hydrogen volume has increased but has not yet fully recovered. Demand for jet fuel, which consumes more hydrogen on a unit basis compared to gasoline, is still lagging. Also, the industry continued to use more light sweet crude, which requires less hydrogen. We are confident in the long-term growth of hydrogen demand, particularly in the U.S. Gulf Coast.
Price for the quarter was again strong. The 4% gain for the region was equivalent to 10% on the merchant business. Price was better across all major products. This is the 13th consecutive quarter of year-on-year price improvement. Energy cost pass-through drove a 15% sales increase with the much higher natural gas prices. EBITDA was 16% ahead of last year as positive volume price at our equity affiliate income and lower maintenance costs more than offset higher inflation. EBITDA margin was 230 basis points lower. However, energy cost pass-through negatively impacted EBITDA margin by approximately 500 basis points. In other words, EBITDA margin would have been significantly up excluding energy pass-through. Sequentially, energy pass-through drove margin 250 basis points lower.

Our EMEA team delivered another set of outstanding results this quarter. Sales jumped 33% versus last year and EBITDA was up 14%. Volume was strong, increasing 14%, driven primarily by improved hydrogen and merchant demand and new assets.
Our liquid bulk partially recovered from the pandemic, but packaged gases and hydrogen are still below pre-COVID levels. Price increased for the 15th consecutive quarter and was higher across most major product lines and subregions. The 4% price gain for the region corresponds to a 6% improvement for the merchant business.
Consistent with what most consumers and businesses are experiencing, our European business faced unprecedented energy cost escalation this quarter. Supply chain-related interruptions further exacerbated the difficult situation. Our team has done an excellent job coping with these challenges, executing pricing actions and keeping our customers supplied.
As Melissa said, our onsite contracts allow us to pass through the higher energy costs. For our merchant business, we continue to work hard to recover the recent cost increases through additional pricing actions already underway.
Currencies were favorable 3%, primarily due to the strong British pound versus the U.S. dollar. EBITDA was up 14% to about $230 million, primarily due to the strong volume, while better price, equity affiliate income and favorable currencies offset most of the energy cost increase. EBITDA margin was down 560 basis points, with higher energy pass-through responsible for about 400 basis points. The remaining roughly 150 basis point reduction was mainly attributable to unfavorable costs, partially offset by favorable equity affiliate income and better volume.
Compared to prior quarter, sales climbed 8% primarily due to pass-through, while positive price and volume were offset by unfavorable currencies. Operating income was 3% below last quarter as the positive price and volume were more than offset by higher costs. Meanwhile, EBITDA was 8% higher due to the inclusion of positive equity affiliate income.
And as Melissa mentioned, we will separate the current EMEA segment into 2 segments, Europe and Middle East and India, starting next quarter.
Now please turn to Slide 24, Global Gases, which includes our non-LNG sale of equipment businesses as well as central costs. Sales and profit were up on higher project activities. We continue to add resources to support project development.
Please turn to Slide 25, Corporate, which includes LNG and other businesses as well as our corporate costs. Corporate segment sales were higher this quarter, driven by increased project activities as we continue to execute multiple large LNG and other projects, but profit was lower on higher corporate costs. Sequentially, sales and profits were better than last quarter. Again, as Melissa said, we will combine Global and Corporate starting next quarter.

But if you want to look at it that way by saying, ""Okay. I know you have done that, but the base business looks like it's growing 6%."" Well, that is the way we see the world right now because the base business, Kevin, as you know better than I do, is dependent on the growth of GDP or industrial production. And I'm not sitting here getting too excited about prospects of GDP or industrial production gold anywhere in the world.
I mean everybody likes to say that COVID is over, now everything is growth. China, the biggest growth engine that the world had last quarter grew only 3%. Europe, GDP and industrial production is not going anywhere. In the U.S., not that much happening. And Latin America is not going anywhere. So I think within the circumstances and then considering all of the issues about energy costs and then -- that we need to recover, all of the issues that is related to supply chain, which is affecting our ability to move helium containers around the world, that's the real issue.

It's our job to look at growth things, look at the other things and put it all together and give you the best judgment that we have at the time we give it to you.

We are talking here about 2020 -- the time that we have, so 2026, when these projects are going to come on stream. Number one, we do need increased hydrogen demand on our -- on the pipeline because we have new customers that are coming on. And we foresee ourselves sold out on that, and therefore, we need additional hydrogen in the pipeline.
The second thing is that we think there will be significant additional customers if we can give them blue hydrogen, and they will convert and get the benefits of that. But then a significant part of their production, especially in Canada, is going to be liquid, which is going to go for mobility where we see people converting to hydrogen for their mobility and the program they have.
Then in Louisiana, the massive amount of hydrogen that we are making, a significant part of that or part of that, we haven't given you the details until we figure out all of the details. But fundamentally, a significant amount will be converted to blue ammonia, which will be exported, and you know where the destination of that export is. That's basically in Japan, where they have no other choice. But how is Japan going to decarbonize? They don't have oil. They don't have gas. They don't have nuclear, and they don't have shallow water to do any kind of windmills offshore. So they need to import their energy. And the best form of energy to import is import blue ammonia where the CO2 has been captured and to burn it in their power plants to generate electricity so that then they can use that electricity to drive their cars and all that. So that is the thinking that we have in terms of the outlet for the blue hydrogen.
Does that help, Steve?"

You take some of the natural gas directly into the process, goes over a catalyst, and you break down CH4 to CO and hydrogen. And then you shift it, you have hydrogen. And the CO becomes CO2, and it goes up at the atmosphere. You can capture 95% of that. Sure.
But then you use a lot of the natural gas to burn -- to heat up the tubes, which contain the catalyst. That is combustion, like a combustion in a furnace or in a power plant. Theoretically, you can capture that CO2, but it will cost you an arm and a leg to capture that. So making the statement that I can capture 95% of the CO2 from SMR, sure, you can capture the CO2 in air, too. But the issue is that, is it cost-effective or not. So what we are saying is that the technology that we have makes it possible to capture the CO2 in a cost-effective way.
But I mean you have to put a lot of equipment on the SMR to capture the CO2 from combustion. Theoretically, you can say, ""Yes, I can put special boxes and do that."" And I really don't want to comment on what our competitors say. They have to defend what they say. It's their business. But from our point of view, when we put carbon capture on SMRs, as we have done, and we actually operate the biggest one in Port Arthur, everybody can go and take a look at it. We have the CO2 capture on the process part because that is economical. We can capture that and use it for a [ financial ] recovery. But on the combustion part, we don't do that because that becomes cost-prohibitive. Can it be done? Yes, sure. Anything can be done at a cost.
I hope that helps, Marc."

I mean in California, they have put $200, right? Per ton of CO2, you get an incentive for that. Canada is talking about $50 to $100 per ton. Other parts of the world that we have exposure to, that -- the number is somewhere between $100, $50, $75, $150. It's all over the place. I think that the way we look at these projects and all of that, we try to kind of look at the profitability on the basis that we don't get too much of these kind of things because we don't want to rely on government subsidies every time we do something. But overall, these numbers are all going to develop based on the commitments that people have made.
And fundamentally, what is going to happen, Vincent? If people are going to -- I mean I see a great deal of fascination, all of these promises being made at Glasgow. But if you add up all of those things, the amount of carbon credits that you need in order to meet the requirements becomes gigantic. And therefore, in order to generate those things, customers need to start using these low-carbon energy sources. And therefore, you have to have real incentives for people to convert from diesel for ships and trains and planes and all of that and steelmaking to really shift to clean energy. And that one, a little bit of incentive is not going to do that.
So I think if the governments are serious to achieving those goals, they have to put in steep incentives to incentivize people to actually do that. So the prospect of that is very encouraging for our business. But we have to see how it develops, Vincent, as we go forward. Is that okay?"

They are taking coal and they are making diesel, and they are selling the diesel fuel at higher prices because the oil price is $84 a barrel.
So in a roundabout way, if hydrocarbon costs go up, it helps those kind of projects. But then the other interesting part is that if hydrocarbon costs go up, then the cost of renewable energy compared to hydrocarbons becomes even more attractive. So you would say that it's easier to convert a truck driver from diesel to hydrogen because now the diesel is costing more. So in a funny way, if actually hydrocarbon prices go up, it will help our strategy in terms of focusing on renewables. Does that make sense, P.J.?"
